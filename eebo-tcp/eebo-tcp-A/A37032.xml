            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His is a place of Scripture, the Exposition
whereof, many in all Ages have sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ned to
adventure upon; and truly I have looked
upon it of a long time, as not convenient to
be treated upon before all Auditories, nor
easie by many to be understood; especially
because of the height of spiritual expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and mysterious rapts of Divine Love,
and the sublime and excellent expressions of
the Bridegroom therein contained, which
would require much livelinesse of frame, and acquaintance in expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
with the things here spoken of, and nearnesse in walking with
God, as being necessary for finding out the mind and meaning o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>
the Spirit of God therein: Yet we are now brought by help of his
Grace, to essay the Interpretation of it, upon these following con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations,</p>
            <p>First, Because it is acknowledged by all, not only to be authentick
Scripture, but an excellent Piece thereof; and therefore is to be
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65401:5"/>
made use of by the Church, and not to ly hid, nor to be laid aside,
as if the meaning thereof were not to be searched into, because it
seems dark and obscure.</p>
            <p>2. Because the Subject and Matter of it is so Divine, carrying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longst
with it many various cases, both of particular Souls, as also,
of the Church, both visible and invisible, with many excellent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations
of Christ the Bridegroom, which ought to be the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of his Friends Meditations, and cannot but be profitable, if he
blesse them; there being here Maps, almost for all conditions.</p>
            <p>3. Because the style and composition is so Divine and excellent,
carrying affections alongst with it, and captivating them in the very
reading; so that few can read this Song, but they must fall in love
with it, we would therefore see what is within it, if at least we may
get a taste of that which doth so sweetly relish.</p>
            <p>4. It seems the Holy Ghost, by putting it into such a mould, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to commend it: and if it be true that all the Poetical pieces
of Scripture, ought especially to be learned and taken notice of;
so should this, it being so commended to us in that frame.</p>
            <p>5. The strain and subject of it is so very spiritual, that it necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tats
the Students thereof, to aime at some nearnesse with God;
and ordinarily it leaves some stamp upon their affections, which is
not the least cause, nor the smallest encouragement to me in this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking.</p>
            <p>We shall not stand to prove the authority of it: It carries a Divine
style in its bosome; nor is there need to inquire who was the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of it, it being clear that <hi>Solomon,</hi> who was furnished with wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and understanding, as never a King before or since was, is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
to be the <hi>Amanuensis</hi> of the Holy Ghost, in putting this
Song upon record. Whether after, or before his backsliding, it is
not much to us; though it be most probable that it was after, in the
warmness of a spirit sensible of this so great a deliverance: For here
we may, as it were, see him making use of that experience of the
vanity of all things he had found, coming to the fear of God as the
conclusion of the whole matter; whereof this Song of Love is not
a little evidence, and which looks like his own saying, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 12. 13.</p>
            <p>The means which are necessary for our more perspicuous hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and your more profitable hearing, of this profound Scripture
will be,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:65401:5"/>
First, Some acquaintance with the whole Word of God, but mainly
the Book of the <hi>Psalms,</hi> and other Songs recorded in the Word; as
also, with the Gospel, and such places as have most likeness to it.</p>
            <p>2. Acquaintance with the cases of others, either by reading or
mutual fellowship; but most of all it is requisite, that one have
some experimental knowledge of the way of God towards his own
heart: He who is so wise as to observe these things, even he shall
understand this loving kindnesse of the Lord: Such kind of experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is one of the best Commentaries upon this Text.</p>
            <p>3. Watchfulnesse over our selves, keeping our heart with all
keeping, and studying a tender frame of spirit, that we may have a
Conscience alwayes void of offence towards God: Loosnesse all the
Week will not be a frame for the <hi>Canticles.</hi> It is not the simple
being of Grace, but the lively operation and exercise thereof, which
prompts and disposes either to speak to purpose, or to hear of this
with profit; He would grow in Grace who would grow in Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
here: Neither have others ground to expect that this secret
of the Lord shall be with them, or that they shall be of a quick un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
who fear him not: One may have Grace, and not a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
frame for this, except Grace be acting, and in exercise.</p>
            <p>4. Much conversing with the Bridegroom, especially by Prayer,
that he who causes the dull to understand Doctrine, may manifest
himself, and open our eyes to behold these wondrous things, and
that he may blesse us in the knowledge of his will in this we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take,
which so especially concerns Him and us; for, this Scripture
may be dark to these who speaks on it, if this be not, and a sealed
Book to you who hear it, if these things be wanting: Whereas, <hi>if
these be in us and abound, we shall neither be barren nor unfruitful</hi> in
the knowledge of this piece of Sacred Scripture.</p>
            <p>Now, that we may have the more clear accesse to speak profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
of the matter of this Song, and that our way of opening and
applying of it (which may possibly in some things be different from
others) may be the better cleared, We shall, 1. premit some Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
concerning it. 2. Draw some Conclusions from these; both
which we shall endeavour shortly to clear and confirm, as useful to be
taken alongst in our proceeding.</p>
            <p>The first Proposition then is this, This Song is a piece of Divine
Scripture, and a most excellent part thereof (which we shall speak
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65401:6"/>
to more fully on the Title) and so of equal authority with other
Scriptures (wherein holy Men spoke, as they were inspired by the
Holy Ghost) and tendeth to the edifying of the Church, and making
of the man of God perfect, even as they do. For,</p>
            <p>First, This Song hath ever been received into the Canon, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
(as they speak) for Canonick, as the rest of the Scriptures
were. It was never questioned by the Jews (as <hi>Mercer. praefat. ad
Cant.</hi> cleareth) but was still received by them, and transmitted to
the Gentile Churches, who received the Scriptures of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament
from them, who had the Oracles of God in keeping: And
that the same hath been universally received by Christians, may
appear by the Records of the Councils, and Writings of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
where the Catalogue of the Books of the Holy Scripture is set
down.</p>
            <p>2. It carrieth the Authority of the Holy Ghost engraven upon it,
as evidently as any piece of Scripture, not only as to its Matter,
manner of Expression, Divine Style; but mostly in that Divine power
and efficacy it hath on hearts and spirits (especially of the more dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning,
who best know Christs voice, as his Sheep) whereby it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishes
so sweetly, and elevats them to such an holy ravishment, that
it obtaineth the testimony from all, that there is something Divine
in it, and more then can be in Humane Writings, even though they
cannot particularly tell the meaning of it; That holding true here,
which one said of a Book which was something obscure, <hi>That which
I understand</hi> (said he) <hi>is excellent: therefore I judge, that which I
understand not to be so also, though it exceed my reach.</hi> And that its
Christ who speaketh, and that it is the Language of the Holy Ghost,
and can be applyed to no other, is by a Divine conviction extorted
from the Reader, and Hearer of it; so that confessedly and deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly,
it beareth this Title, <hi>A Song of Songs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Song must either be attributed to the Spirit, as the chief
Author of it (though <hi>Solomon</hi> was the Penman) or we must say, it
was not only Penned, but Indyted meerly by some Man, (<hi>Solomon,</hi>
or whoever he be) led by his own spirit, or some other spirit,
without the Spirit of God: But none of these last can be said.
What other spirit can so speak of Christ and the Church? What
other Song (even of the most holy Men) can be compared to this?
Was it ever equalled? Or can it be equalled? And if it cannot be
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65401:6"/>
the fruit of the spirit of a meer man (though in the most holy
frame) then it must be inspired by the Spirit, in wonderful wisdom,
and a most Divine style, compacting the mysteries of Communion
with God in Christ, in this short Song: Wherefore we say, it is just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
called <hi>A Song of Songs,</hi> whereby it is preferred not only to all
Humane Songs, but even to other Scriptural Songs, which were
blasphemous to do, were it not of a Divine rise and authority.</p>
            <p>There are two Objections, which sometimes have been started
by some; but they will not be of weight to infringe this truth. The
first is, that there is no Passage of this Song cited in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
But citation of Scriptures in the New Testament doth not
give authority to them. They are cited as having authority, and
not to get it; And therefore there are many Scriptures in the Old
Testament, which were never cited in the New: Although it may
be said, there are many near resemblances (at least) in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament,
to diverse Passages in this Song; as the often styling the
Church a <hi>Vineyard, Matth.</hi> 20. and comparing the Churches union
with Christ to <hi>Marriage, Matth. 22. &amp;c.</hi> That Christ <hi>standeth at
the door and knocketh, Rev.</hi> 3. 20. taken as it were from <hi>Song</hi> 5. 2.
The <hi>Virgins falling on sleep, Matth.</hi> 25. The efficacy of grace, called
<hi>drawing, Iohn</hi> 6. 44. taken from <hi>Chap. 1. 4. &amp;c.</hi> Christ in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables
called <hi>a King,</hi> or <hi>the King</hi> (which by way of eminency is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
to him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 45. 1, 2.) Neither is the second objection of
greater weight, to wit, that no proper Name of God is to be sound
in this Song: For, 1. Its so also in other Scriptures, as in the Book
of <hi>Esther;</hi> The Scriptures authority doth not depend on naming
the Name of God, but on having his warrand and authority. 2. This
Song being Allegorical and Figurative, its not so meet nor consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
with its style, to have God named under proper names, as in
other Scriptures: Yet, 3. There are titles and descriptions here
given to an excellent Person, which can agree to none other, but
Christ, the eternal Son of God; as <hi>the King, O thou whom my soul
loveth, the chief of ten thousand, the Rose of Sharon,</hi> and the like,
whereby his eminency is singularly set out above all others in the
World.</p>
            <p>In sum, there are none of the Characters, usually condescended on
as necessary for evidencing the Authority of holy Scripture, wanting
here; this Song being a Divine Subject, received into the Canon,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65401:7"/>
bearing a Divine stamp, having much Majesty in it's style, agreeing
with it self and other Scriptures fully; impartially speaking out the
blots and adversities of the Bride, as well as her beauty and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity,
and written by a Prophet and Penman of holy Writ, to wit,
<hi>Solomon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 2. Proposition is, That this Song is not to be taken proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
(and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>) or literally, that is, as the words do at first
sound; but it is to be taken and understood spiritually, figurative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and allegorically, as having some spiritual meaning contained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
these figurative expressions, made use of throughout this Song:
My meaning is, that when it speaketh of a <hi>Marriage, Spouse, Sister,
Beloved, Daughters of Ierusalem,</hi> &amp;c. these expressions are not to
be understood properly of such, but as holding forth something of
a spiritual nature under these.</p>
            <p>I grant it hath a literal meaning, but I say, that literal meaning is
not immediat, and that which first looketh out, as in Historical Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
or others which are not figurative, but that which is spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
and especially meant by these Allegorick and Figurative
speeches, is the Literal meaning of this Song: So that it's Literal
sense is mediat, representing the meaning, not immediatly from
the Words, but mediatly from the Scope, that is, the intention
of the Spirit, which is couched under the Figures and Allegories,
here made use of: For, a Literal sense (as it is defined by <hi>Rivet</hi> out
of the School-men) is that which floweth from such a place of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
as intended by the Spirit in the words, whether properly or
figuratively used, and is to be gathered from the whole complex
expression together, applyed thereunto, as in the Exposition of
Parables, Allegories and Figurative Scriptures is clear; And it
were as improper and absurd to deny a Figurative Sense (though
Literal) to these, as it were to fix Figurative Expositions upon
plain Scriptures, which are properly to be taken.</p>
            <p>For there is a twofold Literal sense of Scripture. 1. Proper and
immediat, as where its said, <hi>Solomon</hi> married <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Daughter.
The second is figurative and mediate, as when it is said, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 2.
<hi>A certain King made a Marriage to his Son,</hi> &amp;c. both have a literal
meaning. The first immediat, fulfilled in <hi>Solomon:</hi> The second is
mediat, setting out God's calling Jews and Gentiles, unto fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
with his Son: and so that Parable is to be understood in a
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65401:7"/>
spiritual sense. Now we say, this Song (if we would take up it's
true sense and meaning) is not to be understood the first way, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
and immediatly, but the second way, figuratively and mediatly,
as holding forth some spiritual thing under borrowed expressions,
which will further appear from these things,</p>
            <p>First, There can be no edification in setting out Humane Love (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
parties properly understood) so largely and lively; and yet
edification must be the end of this Song, being a part of Scripture;
it must have therefore an higher meaning then the words at first will
seem to bear.</p>
            <p>2. There can be no parties mentioned, beside Christ and his
Bride, to whom this Song can agree; nor can any proper meaning
thereof be assigned, which can make it applicable to these parties:
and therefore it cannot be understood properly, but figuratively,
and that not of any other, but of Christ and Believers: To <hi>Solomon</hi>
it cannot agree in its application, nor to his Queen, yea, to no man,
if it be taken in a proper sense: For, 1. These commendations
given to the Bridegroom, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. to the Bride, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. 6, 7. If
properly understood, would be monstruous, blasphemous, and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous;
such as <hi>to have teeth like a flock of sheep, an head like Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel,</hi>
&amp;c. and so in many other things. 2. Some things are attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
to this <hi>Solomon,</hi> who is the subject of this Song, that were not
within <hi>Solomon</hi>'s reach, as that, his presence at the Table, (<hi>Chap.</hi> 1.
12.) <hi>maketh her Spicknard to smell,</hi> which influence cannot proceed
from one man more then another, and <hi>Chap. 3. v.</hi> 11. where it is said,
<hi>He made a Chariot, and paved it with Love,</hi> which is no material
thing, and so could be no Pavement in <hi>Solomons</hi> Chariot. 3. That
<hi>Solomon</hi> being the Penman of this Song, yet speaketh of <hi>Solomon</hi> in
the second Person, <hi>Thou, O Solomon,</hi> Chap. 8. 12. makes it appear
that some other was designed then himself; and many such like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
that fill up the matter of this Song, (such as Spices, Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,
&amp;c.) cannot be understood properly of these very things
themselves, but of some other thing vailed under them: And so
also, when she is called <hi>terrible as an army with Banners,</hi> it cannot
be understood of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Queen, and applying it to the Church,
we cannot understand it of any carnal terror, which the external as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
of the Church doth beget in beholders.</p>
            <p>3. The style and expressions will bear out more then any Humane
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65401:8"/>
Love, or any Humane Object, upon which men set their love: We
are sure, no such love would be proponed to Believers as a warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
pattern for their imitation, as if it would be commendable in
them to be so much ravished and taken up, even with the most
lovely creature.</p>
            <p>4. Many things here are inconsistent with Humane Love, and that
modesty that is required in it (as the <hi>Hebrews</hi> themselves, <hi>apud
Mercer.</hi> observe) as to propone him to others, to excite them to
Love him, others undertaking to follow after him, her speaking to
him in her sleep, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 2. running in the night through the Streets,
and slighting him at the Door; which by no means can admit a
proper, literal, immediat sense, but must needs aim at something
figurative. Beside, what reason can there be to plead a proper sense
here, more then in other figurative Scriptures of the same sort, as
of these that speak of the Souls union with Christ, under the simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of a Marriage, and particularly that of <hi>Psal.</hi> 45. which is (as it
were) a compend of this Song, and is looked upon by all as figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative?</p>
            <p>If it be enquired in what sense we call this Song figurative, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as Typical or Allegorical? The answering and clearing of this
Question will further us in the Interpretation of this excellent
Scripture. We shall therefore shew, 1. How <hi>Allegorical</hi> properly so
called, differeth from <hi>Typical.</hi> And 2. Why we call this Song Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorical,
and not Typical.</p>
            <p>Allegorical Scriptures, or Allegories (we take <hi>Allegory</hi> here as
Divines do, who take it not as Grammarians or Rhetoricians, for a
continued discourse of many figures together) properly and strictly
taken (for sometimes <hi>Allegory</hi> may be taken largely, and so may
comprehend whatever is figurative, whether Typical, Tropologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
Analogical, &amp;c. As the Apostle taketh it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. speaking of
<hi>Abraham's</hi> two Sons, which is yet properly a Type) differeth from
Types, or Typical Scriptures, thus,</p>
            <p>First, Types suppose still the verity of some History, as <hi>Ionas</hi> cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Sea, and being in the Fishes belly three dayes and three
nights, when it is applyed to Christ in the New Testament, it sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth
such a thing once to have been: Allegories again, have no
such necessary supposition, but are as Parables proponed for some
mystical end. Thus, while it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap> said, <hi>Mat. 22. 2. A certain King made
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65401:8"/>
a Marriage, planted a Vineyard,</hi> &amp;c. That place supposeth it
not necessary as to the being of the Allegory, that ever such a
thing was, it may be an Allegory without that; but a Type can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be without reality in the thing or fact, which is made a
Type.</p>
            <p>2. Types look only to matters of Fact; and compare one
Fact with another (as Christ's lying in the Grave for such a time,
to that of <hi>Ionas,</hi> who did ly so long in the Whale's belly) but
Allegories take in Words, Sentences, Doctrines both of Faith
and manners, as in the former Examples is clear.</p>
            <p>3. Types compare Persons, and Facts under the Old Testament,
with Persons, and Facts under the New, and is made up of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that is present, prefiguring another to come: Allegories
look especially to matters in hand, and intend the putting
of some hid spiritual sense upon words, which at first they seem
not to bear; whether the Allegorie be only in the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or only in the New, or in both, it looks to the sense, and
meaning, being so considered in it's self, as the words may best
serve the scope, and teach or manifest the thing the Spirit intends,
without any comparison betwixt this, and that of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and New: Yea, an Allegory may be in precepts, as <hi>Muzle
not the mouth of the Oxe,</hi> and <hi>cut off the right hand,</hi> &amp;c. which
have an Allegorick sense in them.</p>
            <p>4. Types are only Historical as such, and the truth of Fact
agreeing in the Anti-type, make them up, it being clear in
Scripture that such things are Types; for we must not forge
Types without Scripture-warrant: But Allegories are principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Doctrinal, and in their scope intend not to clear, or compare
Facts, but to hold forth and explain Doctrines, or by such
similitudes to make them the better understood, and to move,
and affect the more, or the more forcibly to convince, as <hi>Nathan</hi>
made use of a Parable, when he was about to convince <hi>David,
2 Sam.</hi> 12. 1, 2, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>5. Types in the Old Testament respect only some things, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
and events; as Christ, the Gospel, and it's Spreading, &amp;c.
and cannot be extended beyond these: But Allegories take in
every thing, that belong either to Doctrine, or Instruction in Faith,
or to practise for ordering ones life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:65401:9"/>
Hence we may see, that Allegories are much more extensive,
and comprehensive in their meaning and application, then Types
(which cannot be extended further then some one thing) and so
are much more Doctrinal, and concern both the faith and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of Gods People much more, and may for that, more warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
be applyed, and made use of for these ends.</p>
            <p>2. We say, that this Song is not Typical, as being made up of
two Histories, to wit, <hi>Solomon's</hi> Marriage, and Christ's, nor doth it
any way intend the comparing of these two together in the
events, as to their facts or deeds: But it is Allegorick, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting
<hi>Solomon,</hi> or his Marriage, but aiming to set out spiritual
Mysteries in figurative expressions, in such a manner as may most
effectuat that end, for inlightning the judgement, and moving of
the affections, without any respect to that Story, or Fact of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon's:</hi>
For,</p>
            <p>First, The strain and series of it, is clearly Allegorick, as the
reading and considering of it will clear. 2. There can be no Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
to which it can relate, unto which the things spoken in this
Song can be properly applyed, as is said. 3. <hi>Solomon's</hi> Marriage
was at least twenty years before this Song was written; See on
<hi>Song</hi> 7. concerning the <hi>Tower of Lebanon,</hi> and compare it with
1 <hi>King.</hi> 7. 1, 2. and <hi>Chap. 6. ult.</hi> Therefore it cannot be thought
so much as to be Penned on that occasion, as an <hi>Epithalamium</hi>
which was to be sung that night on which he was Married, (and
although occasion of penning of it, were taken from that, yet
would it not prove it Typical, and to respect that as it's Type.)
And 4. What more is this Allegory of a Marriage, to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Typical, then other places of Scripture, where this same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of expression is used? 5. If it be partly Typical, how is this
Type to be made up? for Christs love unto, and Marriage with,
his Church, is not only set out here as peculiar to the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but is applicable to Believers under the Old: There can
therefore be here no comparing of Facts of the Old Testament,
with any thing answering to them in the New. If it be said, <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>'s
Marriage Typified Christ's Marrying of the Gentiles. I
answer, beside that there is no Scripture for this conjecture (and
it's hard to coyn Types without Scripture authority, otherwise
we might make <hi>Solomon</hi> a Type in his many Wives, possibly, and in
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65401:9"/>
many other such things; also that of his marrying <hi>Pharaoh's</hi>
Daughter was against a Law as well as this) it cannot be said that
this Song setteth out only Christ's love to the Gentiles; or the
believing Gentiles, their carriage and love to him: for, was it
not fulfilled (in that which they would make it's Anti-type) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Christ came in the flesh, in the believing Jews? yea, before
ever that Marriage was: and therefore, there can be no typical
respect had to that Marriage here. Beside, it would much dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the Spiritualnesse and Divinnesse of this Song, to make it in
such a way typical, as having any proper fulfilling or meaning,
that were possibly verified in the deed of any man. We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
then, that this Song is simply Allegorick.</p>
            <p>We come now to a third Proposition, which is this: The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Mystery intended, and set forth here, is the mutual Love,
and spiritual Union, and Communion that is betwixt Christ and
his Church, and their mutual carriage towards one another, in
several conditions and dispensations. The comprehensive sum of
this, is contained in this Song, and compended by the Spirit, for
the comfort and edification of the Church, under these figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
expressions: This, we say, is the scope and subject-matter
of this Song: For,</p>
            <p>First, If the intent of this Song be to set out the spiritual
carriage, amongst spiritual Parties, and the spiritual love which
each hath to other, then it must set out Christ's love to his
Church, and Her's to Him: The reason is, because there are no
other spiritual Marriage-parties known, but Christ and His
Church; There is no other spiritual Marriage, or spiritual Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-love
but this: But this Song in it's scope is to set out a
spiritual Marriage, of spiritual Parties, and their spiritual Love,
Therefore it must set out this.</p>
            <p>2. The scope of this Song must be agreeable to the matter
contained in it. Now the matter contained in it, can agree to
no other parties, and be approven in no other love; Therefore
these descriptions given to the Bridegroom, can be given to no
other but Christ; and these given to the Bride by him, can be
given to no other but the Church, and must speak out no lesse
love, then that love of Christ's, the expressions being far beyond
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65401:10"/>
the love of all others: This will more fully appear in the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up of the Song:</p>
            <p>3. What is the scope of these Allegories, in other Scriptures,
as that of <hi>Psal.</hi> 45. that of planting a Vineyard, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. that
of Marriage, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. (which none can deny) is meant of
espousing spiritually. (See this same Allegory of Marriage, <hi>Ier.</hi> 3.
<hi>Hos. 2. 3. Ezek. 16. Matth. 22. Luk. 14. 2 Cor. 11. 1. Rev.</hi>
19. 8.) that must be the scope of this also. For, 1. There can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be two spiritual Marriages, to which these Scriptures and this
can be applyed. 2. Scripture must agree with Scripture, and
one more obscure place, must be expounded by others more
clear; and therefore seing this scope is clear in other Scriptures
of this nature, we may conclude it's the scope here also: that
<hi>Psal.</hi> 45. doth agree with the expressions and strain of this Song,
is clear, by comparing them; and that it speaketh of that spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Marriage betwixt Christ and his Church, is clear by the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
drawn from it, and applyed to that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>nd by the Apostle,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 8, 9.</p>
            <p>4. Either this must be it's scope, or it must have some other
scope, or none at all. To say none at all, is blasphemous: If it
be said an other scope then this, then it must either be such a
scope as agreeth with these other Scriptures, or which differeth
from them; But not such as differeth from them, that cannot be
said, therefore it must be the same: And so it setteth out Christ's
way with his Church, and her's with Him, drawing them, as it
were, in a Mapp together.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> If any would argue, that it might better be Propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
applyed, as foretelling events in the Church, as some do:
For answer, We suppose, it would be hard to make that out to
be the scope and intention of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>2. It would be more hard to get help from other Scriptures,
in the application of it to such events, and such times; and so
this would leave it wholly to uncertainty, or mens pleasure, as
their invention, and groundless conjectures, would lead them to
apply it: (as we fear some good men have taken too much li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
without any ground but meer conjectures, to wrest the
scope of this Song) and beside, such an Interpretation would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
spoil Believers of that instruction and consolation, which
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:65401:10"/>
the true scope giveth them; for then they were not to apply
it to themselves, or to the Church, but at such a Time, and in
such an Age: because, if it shall be once fulfilled in others, or, if
it be not applicable to them, because they live not in such a time,
it will certainly marr their confidence in making any comfortable
application of it to themselves.</p>
            <p>Beside, these considerations may clear, that, in it's scope, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be properly Prophetical of such, and such times, and events, but
Dogmatical and Practical, for believers use, in all times and events.</p>
            <p>First, If the scope and matter of this Song will agree to any
one time, or if all of it will agree to Believers at any time, then
it cannot be Prophetical; for, Prophecy supponeth a diversity of
time, for diverse events, and cannot be said at any one time alike
to be fulfilled; but all the subject of this Song may be fulfilled
in one Believer or other, at any one time; there are still some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying
Christ, some deserted, some praying, some suffering, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and so of what ever part of it we can think upon, it may be said
of one time, as well as of another, that it hath its accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in one Believer or other; and therefore, it is not properly
Prophetical.</p>
            <p>2. If all of it may now be applyed to Believers, yea, and at any
time before the end of the world, may be as well applyed as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
then fulfilled, as well as when it was written, then it is not
Prophetical, seing Prophesies have their<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> particular accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
but all parts of this Song, even the first parts, may now
be applyed, and will still agree to Believers, as properly as it did
in <hi>Solomon's</hi> time. Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. If all the parts of it were in the same way applicable to, and
true, in the cases of Believers, then when it was written, even
as now, or will be before the end, then it was not intended to be
Prophetical, but Doctrinal, Narrative, and Consolatory: but
the first is true; was there any Believer in <hi>Solomon's</hi> dayes, but
these Commendations, Properties, Promises, Practices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> did
agree to them, as they do to us? and was not Christs way such to
them also, as it is to us?</p>
            <p>4. Consider further, if the scope of it be to set out Christ's
way to his Church, and her's to Him, as is said; and if according
to this scope, it should be made use of by a Believer in any time,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65401:11"/>
then it is not Prophetical, but Doctrinal, as hath been said: But
the former is true, as is cleared. Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. If it be applicable to Believers, according to their several
cases, and if it be the case agreeing with any part of this Song,
which grounds the application of it to any party, and not the
time when that case is not; then it is not Prophetical, deducing
cases by times, but Doctrinal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> applying directions, warnings,
and comforts to Believers cases, in whatsoever time.</p>
            <p>6. The matter of it is the ordinary cases which are incident to
Believers in all times, and what may make it look Prophetical-like,
may be considered in the Exposition.</p>
            <p>7. If it's scope be one and the same with other Allegories of
this kind, then it is not Prophetical, but Doctrinal: But the
former is true: Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The truth of both which, may
appear by what is said, and will further appear in that which
followeth.</p>
            <p>We leave this then, and come again to the Proposition, to
wit, that the great scope of this Song is to set out that mutual
Love and Carriage, that is between Christ and his Church:
That this Proposition, which is a main one, may be the more
clear, we shall take it in five distinct Branches.</p>
            <p>First, It holdeth out (we say) the Churches case, and Christ's
care of her, in all her several Conditions, and under all Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
Such as, 1. Her sinful infirmities, and failings in duties,
<hi>Chap. 1. 6. Chap.</hi> 5. 2, and 3. and also, under livelinesse in duties,
<hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 2, 3, 4. and 5. 5. and almost throughout. (2.) Under
Crosses, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 6. as being a <hi>Lillie among Thorns,</hi> and hated
of the World, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 2. and also in Prosperity, wherein she is
commended as terrible, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. 10. (3.) As deserted and sick
of Love, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 1, 2. and 5. 4, 5. and again, as injoying her Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,
<hi>Chap. 1. 4. Chap.</hi> 3. 4. 5. (4.) As under faithful Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds,
and lively Ordinances, <hi>Chap. 1. 4. Chap.</hi> 3. 4, 5. and also, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
carnal Watch-men, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 7. And in all these, her various con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
in all Ages, are painted forth, before Christs Incarnation,
as well as now, without respect to any particular Time or Age;
for, ceremonial things are not here meddled with, but what was
spiritual: Beside, the Church then and now is one, as in the next
consideration will be cleared. (5.) As in private, dealing
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65401:11"/>
with Christ, and longing after him, and praying for him, <hi>Chap.
4. 16. Chap. 8. 1. &amp;c.</hi> almost throughout, and also what she was
in publick duties, going to the Watch-men, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 7. and <hi>Chap.</hi>
3, 3. and what she was in fellowship with others, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 8, 9.
<hi>Chap.</hi> 6. 1, 2. (6.) It sets out Believers as more strong, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
with a greater measure of Grace, and Knowledge, and also,
as more weak in Gifts, and Grace. (7.) And Lastly, It holds
forth the same Believers, as more and lesse lively in their
conditions.</p>
            <p>This Book in it's matter, is a comprehensive sum of all these par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
formed in a Song, put together, and drawn as on a Broad,
for the Believers edification; to shew, 1. What should be, and will
be their carriage when it is right with them, as to their frame. 2.
What are their infirmities, and what they use often to fall into,
even they who are Believers, that they may be the more watchful.
3. To shew what they may meet with, that they may make for
sufferings, and not stumble at them when they come. 4. That
the care and love of Christ to them, in reference to all these, may
appear, that they may know upon what grounds to comfort
themselves in every condition, and may have this Song, as a little
Magazine, for direction, and consolation in every condition.</p>
            <p>Therefore this Song is not to be astricted to any particular Case
or Time, and is (even by <hi>Bernard,</hi> Serm. 1.) therefore observed
to differ from other spiritual Songs, in three things: 1. That
it's penned upon no particular occasion, as others are, such as
that of <hi>Moses, Exod.</hi> 15. and <hi>Iudges 5. &amp;c.</hi> 2. That it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
by way of conference, between several Parties. 3. That
there are in this conference, moe Parties than two; <hi>Christ,</hi> the
<hi>Bride, Watchmen, Daughters of Ierusalem,</hi> &amp;c. all which do shew,
it's extensivenesse, and comprehensivenesse, in respect of it's
Subject and Use.</p>
            <p>2. This Song holdeth forth the Churches, or Brides Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
under all her several considerations: We may consider the
Bride, or Church, four wayes, all of which we will find here. 1. As
visible, and visibly professing Christ, and worshipping him in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances:
in this respect there are <hi>Watch-men</hi> spoken of, a <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
house, Gardens</hi> of many Believers together, and a <hi>Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard</hi>
let out to Keepers, and a Mother having Children, (cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65401:12"/>
also <hi>Daughters of Ierusalem</hi>) who are professing Believers,
and such like, which agree only to the Church, as visible.</p>
            <p>2. Consider her as invisible, having true Faith in Christ, spiritual
Union with him, Love to him, and real exercise of Graces, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Thus Christ is her's, and she his; she is drawn by him, and brought
into the Chambers of lively Sense and Communion: thus she is
neer him, or absent from him, and such like, which only agree to
the Church or Saints, as Members of the invisible Church,
having real (and not only professed) Union with Christ; and
thus she is distinguished from the Mothers Children, which are
outward Professors of the visible Church; and thus the most of
the Commendations she gets throughout this Song, agree unto
her as invisible: Neither can it be thought strange that both
these considerations take place in one and the same Song: For,
1. That distinction of the Church in visible and invisible, is not
a distribution of a whole into distinct parts, as, suppose one
would divide a heap of Chaff and Corn, into Corn and Chaff;
But this is a distinct uptaking of the same whole, (to wit, the
Church) under two distinct Considerations; as, suppose one
would consider the foresaid heap, as it is a heap, comprehending
both Corn and Chaff, or, as it is only comprehensive of Corn; so
the Church thus distinguished, is but one, considered in whole, as
having both renewed and unrenewed in it, and as having renewed
only; Yet so, as the renewed are a part of the whole, under one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,
to wit, as they are visible Professors; and also, are
the invisible Church, being distinctly considered, as they have
more than a visible Profession: Therefore, the sibnesse being so
great and neer, it is no marvel they be frequently conjoyned in
this Song, so as they must be distinguished in respect of these di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
considerations, seing the visible Church in it's considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as such, comprehends the invisible militant Church under it,
but not contrarily. 2. It's ordinary upon this ground, thus to
conjoyn them in other Scriptures, as when an Epistle is written to
a Church, somethings are said of it, and to it, as visible, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things
again are peculiarly applicable to Believers, who are
Members of the invisible Church in it; as by looking to these
Epistles, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. and 3. is clear, all are comprehended in every
Epistle, yet is the matter diversly to be applyed, and these who
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:65401:12"/>
have ears to hear (that is, are real Members of the invisible Church
also) are particularly spoken unto, although indefinitly: And
why then may not the Church in both these considerations, be
spoken of here in this Song?</p>
            <p>3. If we consider either the visible or invisible Church, as
whole or Catholick, something is spoken to her under that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,
namely as Catholick; so she is said to be one, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. 9.
made up of many, the Mother having many Daughters, a Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard,
intrusted to all the Keepers, having some Children belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
others hated, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which must be applicable to her, as so
considered.</p>
            <p>4. If we look to particular Members, either, 1. As Professors
of the visible Church, such as the <hi>Daughters of Ierusalem,</hi> seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Beloved with the Bride, and one of them are distinct
from another, and from the Watch-men; such are the <hi>threescore
Queens,</hi> and <hi>fourscore Concubins,</hi> as distinct from the Church, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
as one. Or, 2. As Members in particular of the invisible
Church; so the Bride is distinguished from other Professors, and
Believers; she speaks to them and they to her, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. So is
one Queen and Concubine, distinguished from another; Thus
also is the Church considered in general, and in individuals, in
their carriage; yea, it serveth much to the scope of edifying
Believers, that the Church in these respects, be thus distinctly
considered and lookt upon: Neither will this be thought strange,
if we consider, that the Church however understood, and the
particular and individual members thereof (especially of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible
Church) are of an homogeneous nature; so that what
may be said of the whole, may be said of all it's parts, and what
may be predicated concerning the whole essentially, may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
of every part, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As when we consider the whole Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of water, it's water; so when we consider a drop, it's also
water: &amp; what essential properties do agree to the whole, as such,
agrees to every drop of the whole; so is it in the Church; All
Saints, Members of the invisible Church, have the same
Spirit, Faith, and Priviledges, the same Covenant, Husband, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and what thus essentially agrees to one, agrees to all, and what
may be said of all, may be said of one: I say in Essentials, because,
though there may be many circumstantial, and gradual differences,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65401:13"/>
as one Believer may be stronger than another, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet that will
not mar this onenesse, and agreement in Essentials.</p>
            <p>Yet, 3. We say, every thing in this Song, is not to be applyed to
all within the Church, or to the Church, under every consideration,
in the same manner; what agreeth to the Church as visible, will not,
at least, in the same manner agree to her, considered as invisible,
<hi>&amp; contra;</hi> nor will every thing which agrees to a Believer in one
case, agree to all; nay, not to that same Believer alwayes. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
there is great need of warrinesse in application, that the
word may be rightly divided, and the diverse cases of the Church
and particular Believers would be rightly taken up for that end:
Every place is not to be applyed to all (though sometimes a
place may be taken up under diverse considerations, as from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Scriptures, and the formerly cited Epistles, is clear) but
what agrees to every one, would be so applyed, and sol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ly upon
that consideration, and under that notion, as it agrees unto such
a person, or such a case.</p>
            <p>For helping us in this distinct application, it is necessary that
we lay down these following Rules:</p>
            <p>First, We must weigh the particular scope of such a place of
Scripture, if it speak something concerning a Believer in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
or the Church in general; if it set out some outward, or
some inward thing concerning them.</p>
            <p>2. We would consider the matter spoken to, and see how it
agreeth, whether to the Church under one consideration, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
another; and if the matter predicated of her, or attributed
to her, will agree to her as visible, or as invisible only, for so it
is to be applyed; if to the whole Church, or if also to all it's
Members, and every particular Believer; for so it is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood.</p>
            <p>3. We would see, how the same matter is applyed in other
Songs and Scriptures, and it will be safe for us to follow the same
way of application here.</p>
            <p>4. We would consider, what the particular circumstances,
that may be observed in such a particular Scripture, will help in
finding out the Sense; as who speaketh, to whom, in what frame,
on what occasion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet fourthly, we say, that this Song doth most generally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65401:13"/>
and is especially applicable to the cases of particular Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers:
Because,</p>
            <p>First, The scope is not so much to speak to all collectively, as
Distributively to hold forth the several cases, that all of them,
at all times are subject unto; for although every place do not
point out the case of the Church in general, or her duty, yet we
conceive it is still in every part, pertinent to some one Believer,
or other: Such places must therefore be understood distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively.</p>
            <p>2. The nature and strain of the most of those things mentioned
in this Song, generally will agree best (if not only) to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Believers; As to love Christ, to seek him, to be commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
so by him, to be out of one case into another, pursuing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him from one duty to another: which indeed shews the way
of the Church in general, but so as considered in the exercises of
her individual Members, and in the intercourse of Communion,
which useth to be betwixt Christ and them, and so agreeth to
the church, only in respect of particular Believers.</p>
            <p>3. There is a plurality of Parties speaking, differenced not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from carnal Professors, but from one another, who are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
the Bride, and so loving her and Christ also; which says
that the several parts of this Song must especially be distributively
considered of Believers severally.</p>
            <p>4. There is no time, we can conceive all Believers to be in the
like case, so that one case or word will not sute them all; as to be
<hi>sick of love,</hi> to have <hi>his right hand under her head,</hi> &amp;c. Something
then must agree to one, something to another, and both also at
different times to the same person: And therefore we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
this Song, as speaking distributively the Churches conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to be applyed according to the several cases of the Saints, and
according to their several conditions; something as spoken to one,
and something to another.</p>
            <p>5. The putting of these exercises in a Song, as it were to be
learned and sung by particular Believers (as a little compend,
both of what concerns their Faith and Manners) was certainly for
helping their Memories, and furthering their Consolation; which
would be much impaired, if in singing of it, particular Believers
might not suck their own consolation in particular from Christs
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65401:14"/>
words unto them: And what can hinder, but a Believer may say,
<hi>I am his, and he is mine,</hi> and that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>se and other places applicable
to them, may not be so applyed, seing their comfort and edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is the scope of this Song?</p>
            <p>5. The last Branch of the Proposition is, That this Song hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
forth the same love, and care in Christ to his Church, and the
same exercises and duties of Believers, under figurative terms,
which are plainly, and properly holden forth in other Scriptures,
which are not figurative, such as are in the Gospel, in the
<hi>Psalms,</hi> &amp;c. There are no new, strange, or uncouth cases here;
but Believers ordinary cases, there is no uncouth way of Christs
here, but what he useth to his Church: It's often the folly and
vanity of men's minds, that when expressions of Scripture look
somewhat strange like, they suppose still some uncouth, and strange
thing to be there, and therefore loaths that which is plain. It's
true, the cases mentioned here, are most spiritual, having Love of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
drawn in it's most bright &amp; lively collours, yet, for substance,
the exercises are the same, which in other plain Scriptures are
otherwayes expressed; for, it must expresse the same cases, or,
we must say, it expresseth something different from them, not
incident ordinarily to Believers, and not mentioned any where in
Scripture, which to affirm, were both dangerous and absurd:
Beside, Christ being still the same in his way with Believers, and
they having still the same spirit, and being still under the same
covenant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we can conceive no other thing here, but what he
hath expressed concerning himself and them, other-where in
Scripture. And certainly, the scope of this Song, is rather in a
sweet way, to compact together the ordinary cases of Believers,
and their consolations, for their edification, than to pitch on
strange things, or make new cases, which would not be so profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
unto them, and would wrong, and enervat the great intent of
this Song.</p>
            <div type="conclusions">
               <head>We proceed now, and shall draw some Conclusions
from these Propositions.</head>
               <p>First <hi>Conclusion.</hi> We may then warantably read, and expone
this Song; it being Scripture, it must be edifying, and ought to
be made use of. It's true, this, and some other Scriptures, were
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:65401:14"/>
of old restrained by the Jews, from the younger sort, that none
should read them, but these who were at thirty years of age:
<hi>Origen</hi> marks four pieces of holy Scripture, thus restrained by
them: The history of the Creation, <hi>Genes.</hi> 1. The description
of Gods appearance, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1. and of his Temple, <hi>Chap. 40. &amp;c.</hi>
And especially this Song, because, the matters in them were so
sublime, that there needed more than ordinary humility and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
in those who should meddle with them: This indeed, saith
men ought to be sober, and with holy fear search these Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:
but that restraint (if peremptorie) was unwarrantable,
seing the Lord hath put none such on his people, as to any porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of sacred Scripture. And though this Song be obscurer than
many other Scriptures; yet, generally the reading of it, and
hearing of it, will affect; and as to the composing of the spirit,
edifie as much, as other more plain Scriptures: which sayeth,
it's to be inquired into, that the meaning being found out, the
profit reaped thereby, may be the more distinct and apparent.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Conclus.</hi> We gather from what hath been said, that seing
this Song may be expounded, Then Doctrines for grounding our
saith, and directing our Practice, may warrantably be drawn from
it, for the edification of God's people, seing it is Scripture; and
although it be Allegorick, it is in a special way useful for edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and may as bread be broken to the children: It's not only
consistent with the nature of plain Scriptures, but also of Allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
that they be thus extended in their use. We shall clear
this Conclusion, in these three,</p>
               <p>First, There may be Doctrines drawn from this Song, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to all cases that are incident to a Believer. As, 1. In refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to the case of the Church, in all it's considerations, visible,
or invisible, Catholick or particular. And, 2. In reference to
the more private and personal cases of Believers, Doctrines in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing
them both in faith and manners, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For the Doctrines
must rise as extensively, as there scope and matter; and these are
of a great reach and extent, as formerly hath been said: Such
Doctrines then, when handled in this Song, would not be thought
strange, nor unsuitable to it; but the broader they arise, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit's
wisdom and contrivance in this Song, will be the more won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
and evident.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:65401:15"/>
2. These Doctrines, must not be taken from the words proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but Allegorically understood, according to the intention of
the Spirit in them, even as from Parables, and other clearer Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legories
and figures in Scripture, it useth to be done.</p>
               <p>3. These Doctrines so drawn, when rightly concluded from the
Text and scope, are solide and sure, useful for faith and manners,
as Doctrines drawn from other places of Scripture are: For,
1. It's certain, that many Scriptures are Allegorically set down,
and is their authority therefore any way lesse than that of other
Scriptures? And if their authority be such in themselves, as is
the authority of other Scriptures; Then their Exposition and
Doctrines drawn from them, must be solide and useful, as these
that are drawn from other Scriptures: Or, 2. We must say,
there is no use of such Scriptures, which were blasphemous; and
if they be useful, there may be solide uses drawn from them, as
from other Scriptures. 3. Our Lord useth Parables and Allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
often in the Gospel, and that in things relating both to
faith and manners; which sayeth, the use of them is solide and
safe, when they are rightly understood and applyed.</p>
               <p>All the difficulty is in the right understanding of them, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Allegories are frequent in Scripture, and this Song is wholly
made up of Allegories: Therefore, both for removing preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices,
and facilitating our way, I shall speak something to these
three. 1. We shall shew what an Allegorick Exposition, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Exposition of an Allegory is. 2. When it is necessary
to understand a Scripture Allegorically. 3. How to walk in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the solide meaning or how to know if such a thing be
the meaning, of an Allegorick Scripture.</p>
               <p>For the First, There is a great difference betwixt an Allegorick
Exposition of Scripture, and an Exposition of Allegorick Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
The first is that, which many Fathers, and School-men
fail in, that is, when they Allegorize plain Scriptures and Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
seeking to draw out some secret meaning, other than ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
in the words; and so will fasten many sense upon one
Scripture. This is indeed unsafe, and is justly reprovable; for,
this maketh clear Scripture dark, and obtrudeth meanings on
the words, never intended by the Spirit; As, suppose one speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Goliah</hi>'s combat and <hi>David's,</hi> should passe by the letter,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:65401:15"/>
and expound <hi>Goliah</hi> to be the Flesh, or the Devil, and <hi>David</hi> to be
the Spirit, or Christ: Such Expositions, may have some plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santnesse,
but often little solidity; and such, who most common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thus interpret Scripture, often fall in errors. As guilty of
this fault, <hi>Origen</hi> is generally complained of, though moe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
be guilty, as might be cleared by many instances.</p>
               <p>2. An Exposition of an Allegorick Scripture, is, the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and expounding of some dark Scripture (wherein the mind of
the Spirit is couched and hid under Figures and Allegories)
making it plain and edifying, by bringing out the sense according
to the meaning of the Spirit in the place, though at first, it
seemed to bear out no such thing: So, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. Christ ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth
that Parable or Allegory (for, though Rhetoricians
make a difference between Similitudes, or Parables, and Allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;
yet, in Divinitie, there is none, but that Allegories are
more large and continued) calling the <hi>Seed,</hi> the <hi>Word;</hi> the
<hi>Sower,</hi> the <hi>Son of man,</hi> &amp;c. This way of expounding such dark
Scriptures, is both useful and necessary, and was often used as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difying
by our Lord to his Disciples: Now, it's this we speak
of, which teacheth how to draw plain Doctrines out of Allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and not to draw Allegories out of plain Histories, or
Doctrines.</p>
               <p>2. It may be asked then, When are we to account a place of
Scripture Allegorick, and are we to seek out some other meaning,
than what at first appeareth? <hi>Ans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, When the literal proper meaning looketh absurd like,
or is empty, and nothing to edification; as when it is said, we
must eat Christ's flesh, whereby believing is expressed: And so,
these Scriptures that do command to <hi>pluck out the right eye, cut
off the right hand, take up our crosse,</hi> &amp;c. All which, if literally
understood, were absurd and ridiculous; and therefore, the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staking
such Scriptures, hath occasioned many errors, as that of the
<hi>Anthropomorphits,</hi> attributing members, to wit, head, hands,
feet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to God; and passions, yea, infirmities, as anger, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> because the Scripture speaking of God, after the
manner of men, doth Allegorically attribute to him, eyes,
hands, wrath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. These places of Scripture are to be accounted Allegorick,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65401:16"/>
which reach not the scope of edification, intended by them
if literally understood; as when Christ hath spoken of <hi>sowing,</hi>
the Disciples thought, that some more was intended than at
first appeared; for, his aime could not be to discourse of Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry
to them: So gathers the Apostle an Allegory from these
words, <hi>Thou shalt not muzle the mouth of the oxe, that treadeth
out the corn.</hi> And so also, that and the like precepts, discharging
the Jews, <hi>the sowing their fields with diverse grains,</hi> &amp;c. Which
though they be not wholly Allegorick, but have in the letter
their own truth, yet, somewhat in these beyond what appears, was
aimed at by the Spirit; for, saith the Apostle, <hi>doth God care for
oxen?</hi> that is, that precept hath a further scope. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 9, 10.</p>
               <p>3. When a literal sense would obtrude some falsitie on the
Scripture, then such a Scripture is to be understood Allegori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally;
as when Christ said, <hi>Destroy this Temple, and I will build it
up in three dayes;</hi> it is not to be understood of the material
house, or Jewish Temple, because then Christ's word would not
have had it's accomplishment; But Allegorically of his body:
So, when Christ saith, <hi>Except a man eat his flesh, he shall not live,
Iohn,</hi> 6. 53. It cannot be understood literally, seing all who have
obtained life, did never eat his flesh in a carnal bodily way.</p>
               <p>4. Any Scripture is to be accounted Allegorical, when the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral
sense agreeth not with other Scriptures, and is not repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to the analogie of Faith, or rules of right manners: As,
when we are commanded to heap coals of fire upon the head of
our enemie. Now, it were against the command of not avenging
our selves, if literally and properly understood: It must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
signifie some other thing.</p>
               <p>5. When a literal sense answereth not the present scope of the
speaker, and the speaker would be thought impertinent, if his
words were properly taken, then it would seem necessary to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
it as an Allegory; So <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 10. when <hi>Iohn</hi> is pressing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
he saith, <hi>The axe is laid to the root of the tree,</hi> &amp;c.
And that Parable of Christ's, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13. 7. speaking of the husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
that spared his tree three years. If these places were only
properly understood, they would not inforce repentance, which is
aimed at; they must therefore be expounded, as having something
more in them, of a deeper reach, which may conduce to that
scope.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:65401:16"/>
And seing, according to these rules, all the absurdities me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
would follow, if this Song were literally and properly
expounded, it must therefore be taken Allegorically, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>he

                     <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>
of the Allegory is laid by.</p>
               <p>But, 3. Because it's dangerous, to leave men to coyn what Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
they please of such Scriptures, therefore as upon the one
hand; it's absurd to cast all Doctrines from them, as unsolide;
so upon the other hand, we would see, what may fix us in a solide
exposition, and sowhat may be esteemed a well grounded Doctrine,
drawn from such an Allegory.</p>
               <p>I shall, in order to our help in this, name five rules, whereof
the last is safest.</p>
               <p>First, Some Allegories at the first view seem plain, and imprint
their meaning on these that have the least capacity, that it may
be known, at least, what in general they aim at; And therefore,
such are left frequently in Scripture unexpounded, and are used
to presse most obvious truths, such is that of <hi>Iohn, Matth.</hi> 3. 10.
<hi>The axe is laid to the root of the tree; and he hath his fan in his
hand,</hi> &amp;c. The meaning whereof, is at first obvious to be a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory
certification pressing present repentance: So is the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
of of the marriage, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 1. which at first view, appears
to be understood of espousing Believers to Christ as their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band:
And so Christ's command to <hi>take up the crosse,</hi> &amp;c. These,
as to their meaning, are obvious; and we think such is this Song
in it's general series; the very reading of it seems to imprint,
that Christ and his people must be taken up as the parties, and
the love here spoken of, must be such, as is betwixt them; and
though particular expressions be dark, thus far it is obvious.</p>
               <p>2. The meaning of an Allegory, may be gathered from the
common use of such phrases and expressions, in our common use,
so <hi>kissing</hi> and <hi>embracing, &amp;c.</hi> signifie love, and are expressions of
mutual affection. In an Allegory then, these, and such like, are to
expresse analogically some spiritual thing, answerable in our spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
life to such things in our bodily life: Thus they expresse
spiritual love, and the sense of it. Thus eyes, hands, feet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
applyed to God, denote some singular property in him: If Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legorically
applyed to Believers, they denote some qualification
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65401:17"/>
of the new man, that hath some analogy, and resemblance to these,
as knowledge, activitie, patience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> because, by our eye we
see, by our hand we work, and by our feet we walk, and travel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Thus are they transferred, to hold out some other thing than
appeareth at first from the words, and the work of the Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is to bring out the scope and matter in plain expressions,
that it may look like the thing it is, and which is aimed at as
the scope.</p>
               <p>3. It's helpful in expounding of Allegories, to know how such
phrases are expounded in other places; as when some things are
spoken of <hi>David,</hi> that cannot literally agree to <hi>David,</hi> then see
who is meant, in other places of Scripture, by him. If it cannot
be known what is meant by a marriage-tye here, seing it can be
no humane thing, see what other spiritual marriage is spoken of
in any other place of Scripture, and who are the parties, and this
is to be expounded by that.</p>
               <p>4. Being to interpret any Allegorical place of Scripture, we
would see, not only to the scope of all Scripture, and the analogy of
Faith in general; but to the scope of the Spirit in that place: As
for example, If we would understand what is intended by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
of the Prodigal, we would first consider the scope, which is to
shew God's ready welcoming of a sinner, and then lavel the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
as serving to illustrat that scope. So we would consider
what is the Brides scope, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 10. and it's to discribe Christ:
And <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. 1. we would consider what is the Bridegroom's scope;
and it's to discribe her. So then it agrees with the scope, to
open these places, &amp; apply them to what is commendable in him,
and her: And thus the Exposition, and Doctrines from it, do
not only sute with the analogy of Faith, and are not contrare to
found Doctrine; but also sute with the intention of the Spirit
there, and are agreeable to it: For the Holy Ghost under gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
commendations, may include all particulars, which may serve
to make out the general; and so when the scope is to hold Christ
out, as all desires, then what ever makes him appear desirable,
and standeth with the analogy of the expression, may well stand
with that scope: This is sure, especially when negatively it's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred;
that is, when such a scope necessarily inferreth such a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and when that scope could not be attained, if such a
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:65401:17"/>
Doctrine were not supposed: As when in general, Christ and his
Church are holden out to stand in a neer relation together, and
so to carry one towards each other, as being under such a relation;
this will necessarily infer a covenant, and an union by saith upon
the grounds of it, and some evidencing of the proofs of Christ's
love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> because without these, that relation could never have
been, nor can it without them be understood by us.</p>
               <p>5. The last rule, which we call most sure, is this: Then we
may safely conclude, that we have reached the true meaning of an
Allegorical Scripture, when from the Scripture in the same, or
other places, agreeing with the scope of the present Allegory,
we gather in plain expressions what is meant thereby, or what
was intended by the spirit in such an Allegorical expression;
as when Christ clears the Parable of the <hi>Sower,</hi> he calleth the
<hi>seed</hi> the <hi>word,</hi> &amp;c. which makes the meaning clear, and above
question; Or, when a plain expression is mixed-in with the Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory.
So that expression, <hi>Chap. 1. 1. Let him kisse me,</hi> &amp;c. in
the words following is expounded by a more plain expression, to
wit, <hi>thy loves are better,</hi> &amp;c. Hence we solidly gather that by
kisses are meant love: and this Doctrine is sure, Christ's love is
vehemently desired by the Bride. These wayes for finding out
what is the sense of such Scriptures, are safe; and therefore, that
saying, Symbolick Scriptures are not Argumentative, is to be
understood with a limitation, to wit, except in so far as the scope
and meaning of the spirit is known, and in so far as the Allegory, or
the several parts thereof agreeth with, and conduceth to the
clearing and making up of the known scope.</p>
               <p>All these wayes going together, and taken along with us, we
may through God's blessing, undertake the opening of this Song,
and draw Doctrines from it so expounded; not only agreeable
to other Scriptures, and the analogy of faith, but also as agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the Scope of this Song; yea, even the scope of such a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it, though possibly every expression in it's meaning, be
not so fully reached; which is not the thing we dare promise,
but humbly to essay the making of it in some measure clear, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing,
amiable, and comfortable to God's people. And so we
leave this Conclusion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:65401:18"/>
The 3. <hi>Conclus.</hi> and last is, That the Doctrines which this
Song yeeldeth for all conditions, and which for Believers use are
to be drawn from it, are the same plain, solid, spritual truths
which are drawn from other Scriptures, wherein Christs love to
his Church, and people, and their exercises, are set down: And if
in it's exposition, it resolve in the same meaning with other
Scriptures, then must also the Doctrines be the same; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
such Doctrines concerning faith and manners, for Believers
direction in all cases, as ariseth from the Gospel, and other plain
Scriptures, Psalms, and Histories, may be solidly drawn from this
Song: And such when they are drawn are solid (being according
to the foresaid general rules) and weight is to be laid on them,
in a Christian walk. We shall therefore endeavour to make this
out, that when the Doctrine of faith, repentance, diligence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and such other Doctrines as are in the Gospel, concerning the
Covenant, or Christ, are spoken of, ye may not think it strange,
nor unsuitable to this Song. And therefore we say,</p>
               <p>First, If the Doctrines be suitabe to the scope, and matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in this Song, then they are sure and solid, and weight is to
be laid upon them: But the Doctrines concerning Christ's love
to, and care of, his Church, and concerning her exercising of faith,
repentance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are suitable to the scope, and agreeable to the
matter of it. Or thus, If the scope and matter of this Song, do
agree with the Gospel (I call the Gospel what in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is more fully holden forth and more clearly) in the scope
and matter of it; Then must the Doctrines which arise from it,
be the same with these that rise from the Gospel: but the first
is true, as is formerly cleared, therefore must this last be so
also. And what is the scope of the Gospel, but to set forth
Christ's love to his Church? to shew her duty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and is not
that same the scope here also? Only what is preceptively, or
doctrinally delivered there, is here as it were acted in a sort of
Comedy, and compiled in a Song, but still for the same end.</p>
               <p>2. If the same Allegories in other places of Scripture, will bear
solid Doctrines concerning Christ, his covenant, faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> even
such as are in plain Scriptures; then must this Song do the like,
seing it is the word of God, tending to the same scope with these.
But it's clear, <hi>Isa. 5. 2. Ier. 3. Matth. 22. Rev.</hi> 19. 7. that the same Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gories
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:65401:18"/>
of Vineyards, Fruits and Marriage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are used and to the
same scope with this, and are made use of to yeeld solid Doctrines
concerning faith, fruitfulnesse, and other Doctrines be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belonging
to a Believers faith and practice: Therefore it must
be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>o here; for though this Song be larger, and is made up of
moe Allegories together, that will not alter the nature of it, or
of the Doctrines, which must be drawn from it.</p>
               <p>3. If we compare this Song, with the 45 <hi>Psalm,</hi> it cannot be
denyed, 1. But that Psalm and this Song are to one scope, and
of one stile or strain, in prosecuting that scope; It's a Song of
love for the King, and a spiritual marriage is the subject thereof,
as is clear from the very reading of it. 2. It cannot be denyed,
but that solid proofs and Doctrines, concerning many points of
faith and practice, which are in other plain Scriptures, are, and
may be warrantably drawn from it, even as if it were plain Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel:
Therefore must the Doctrines be such which arise from this
Song also, for that Psalm is used even by the Apostle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 8, 9.
to confirm the great truths of the Gospel.</p>
               <p>4. If this whole Song be one piece, and of one nature, driving
all along the same general scope, then such Doctrines, as the
places in it which are clear, do yeeld; Such, I say, must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
(if we could discern them) in these places of it which are
most obscure: But what is most plain in this Song, speaks out
such plain Doctrines, experiences, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore what is more
obscure, may be resolved in such also: For we may best know
what kind of Doctrines floweth from what is obscure, by the
places that are more clear, seing God in the most dark Scriptures
ordinarily hath insert some plain passages, or given some hints of
his mind, to be as a key for opening all the rest. Now if we will
for instance, consider some such places as these, <hi>My beloved is
mine,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I called, but he gave me no answer,</hi> they yeeld plain
Doctrines, as other plain Scriptures do: And therefore, seing
it's one continued Song, and each of these dark, and plain places
answer one another, to continue the series of the Discourse upon
the same subject, we may know by what is plain, how to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
what is couched, within that which is more dark.</p>
               <p>5. As one piece of the Allegory is to be resolved, so by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
must all the rest, there being one threed and scope:
Now that some pieces of the Allegory, may be expounded in
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:65401:19"/>
clear Doctrines, concerning Christ, and his Church, may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
from paralleling some parts of it with other Scriptures:
As if we compare that excellent description of Christ, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 10.
with that which <hi>Iohn</hi> sets down, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 13. we will see a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance
betwixt the two (if this last have not respect unto the
former) especially in that which is spoken anent his feet, and legs,
and his countenance; But it is certain, that description, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 13.
is given him with a purpose to describe him, and to set out the
several attributes, and excellent qualities, he is furnished with,
as Omniscience by his eyes, Justice by his legs, walking surely;
Omnipotence by his arms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are particularly so applyed
in the Epistles to the seven Churches, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. and 3. and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward:
If then there, by the Spirit's warrand, we may draw from
Christ's being said to have eyes, that he is Omniscient (and so in
other properties) may we not also think, that seing it's the same
spirit that speaks here, in the particular description that is given
of Christ, and the Bride in their several parts, that these same par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
properties may be aimed at; and may we not make use
of such interpretations else where given, for our help in the like
particulars, and so also in other things?</p>
               <p>6. Thus we argue, Either this Song is so to be resolved, as
hath been said, and such Doctrines are to be drawn from it, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise
from the Gospel, for expressing the way of Believers with
Christ, and his with them; Or then, 1. There are no Doctrines
to be drawn from it, but this Song is a meer Complement, and
but ignorantly, with holy blind affection to be sung, which is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd;
Or, 2. The Doctrines are but to be guessed at, and so the
truth of them is only conjectural, which will come neer the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
absurdity, and spoil the Believer of any solid edification, he
could have from it; Or, 3. It must contain such a kind of love,
such cases and Doctrines concerning Christ and Believers, which
are different from the Gospel, and the cases of Saints plainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
elsewhere: Now this would necessitate an uncertainty of
it's meaning, and hazard the coyning of two wayes of Christ's
dealing with his people, as also, of theirs with him, two Unions,
two Marriages, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or, 4. It must contain the same Doctrines
concerning faith, Christ, the Covenant, the Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:65401:19"/>
contained in other Scriptures, and in the Gospel, which was the
thing to be proven.</p>
               <p>We have been the larger on this, to obviat two extreams,
that men are given to follow, in reference to this Song. 1. Some
loathing plain truths, which are plainly delivered in Scriptures,
properly to be taken; and because this in expression and strain
differeth, they conclude there must be some uncouth, strange
and odd thing here. It is true, if we look to the degree of warm
affections, that breath forth here, we may conceive that there is
something odd, and singular in this Song: But, as to the kind of
Doctrine here delivered, there is nothing new; and to imagine
the contrary, were as if a man supposed, there behoved to be
some strange Liquor, or Meat in curious-like Glasses, and Dishes,
because the Master of an house might use variety of Vessels, for
the delectation of the Feasters, yet still giving the same solid food
and drink, though diversly prepared; Or, as if a man would sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
<hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> Christ our Lord, and <hi>Iohn,</hi> did Preach
different Gospels, because they were of different Gifts, and had
a different manner of expression. 2. On th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> other hand, some
are ready to cast at this Book as uselesse, because they see not
plain truths at the first in it, and possibly think all endeavours to
expound it, or draw Doctrines from it, but a guessing, and are ready
to offend, when they meet with nothing but some such truths as
are obvious in some other Scriptures. This wrongs the worth,
and divine authority of this Scripture also, and though many
(and we among others) may mis-apply somethings in this Song,
yet to say they cannot be rightly applyed, or that such Doctrines
as we have before mentioned, are not native to it, is too precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant,
to say no more.</p>
               <p>For further clearing and confirming of these propositions and
conclusions, we shall answer some Objections or Questions which
may be proposed concerning what is said.</p>
               <p>First, It may be objected, if Allegorick Scriptures be so to be
expounded, and such Doctrines to be drawn from them; then
why are such Scriptures set down under such figurative expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?
might they not be better in plain words? or might not such
plain Scriptures be rather expounded, which bear such Doctrines
with lesse difficulty?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:65401:20"/>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> If this were urged, it would not only reflect on this
Song; but on many places of Scripture, and also, on the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding
of such Scriptures; yea, it would reflect on the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of the Spirit, and his Soveraignty, who may choose what
way he pleases, to expresse his mind to his People, and what ever
way he take to do this, sure, it is still the best, and it may war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand
us to acquiesce in the way he hath taken to speak his mind,
that it is he that speaks: Yet, there may be good ends given of
this his way, or weighty reasons (even for our behove) why he
speaks to his People in such terms, and language: As, 1. Here
he putteth all the conditions of a Believer together, as in one
Mapp, which are more sparsly, and as it were, here and there, to
be found elsewhere through the Scriptures; We have them here
compended together, in a sort of Spiritual dependance one upon
another, and in a connexion one with another. And they are put in
a Song, to make them the more sweet and lovely; and under such
Poetical and figurative expressions, as best agreeth with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Songs, and Poetical Writings; that so Believers may
have them together, and may sing them together, for the help
of their memory, and upstirring of their affections.</p>
               <p>2. These figures and similitudes, have their own use, to make
us the better take up, and understand the spiritual things which
are represented by them; when in a manner, he condescends to
illustrat them by similitudes, and so to teach (as it were) to our
senses, things which are not otherwise so obvious: For which
cause, Christ often taught by Parables, the greatest mysteries of
the Gospel.</p>
               <p>3. Thus not only the judgement is informed, but it serveth
the more to work on our affections, both to convince us of, and
to deterr us, from, what is ill, when it is proposed indifferently
in an Allegory, as <hi>Nathan</hi> in his Parable to <hi>David</hi> did: And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
it conduceth the more to gain our affections to love such
things as are here set out, wherefore, even Heaven it self is so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
from similitudes of such things as are in account with men,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 22. And Christs Love becomes thus more comfortable,
and our relation to him the more kindly-like, when it's illustrat
by Marriage, and the kindly expressions of a Husband and Wife;
for this also, God is compared to a Father, and his pity to a
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:65401:20"/>
fathers pity to children, to make it the more sensible, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable.</p>
               <p>4. Thus also any knowledge that is attained, or any impression
that is made, is the better fixed and keeped; similitudes are
often retained, when plain truths are forgotten, as we may see in
experience; yea, the retaining of the similitude in the memory,
doth not only keep the words in mind, but helps to some ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with the thing which is signified, and furthereth us in
understanding the manner, how such and such things, the Lord
doth to his People, are brought about.</p>
               <p>5. Thus both the wisdom and care of God and his Spirit ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth,
who taketh diverse wayes to commend his truth unto
men, and to gain them to the love of it, that they who will not
be affected with plain truth, he may be more taking expressions,
commend unto them the same thing; which is the reason why
he hath given diverse Gifts and wayes of holding forth his truth
unto Ministers; some have one way, like sons of Thunder; some
another, like sons of Consolation; and yet all to carry on the
same end, that the one may be helpfull unto the other. Indeed
if God had delivered his truth only in obscure terms, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
might seem to have some weight; but when he doth it
both in plain and obscure wayes, this is his condescendency and
wisdom, by all means seeking to gain some.</p>
               <p>6. Thus also the Lord removeth occasion of loathing from his
Word, by putting it in some lovely Artifice, in the manner of
it's delivery; and also, he doth hereby provoke his people to
more diligence, in searching after the meaning of it; It being
often our way to esteem least of what is most obvious, and most
of that which is by some pains attained.</p>
               <p>7. Thus also the Lord maketh the study of his Word delect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
when both the judgment and affections, are joyntly wrought
upon: And to shew that all the Believers conditions may be
matter of a sweet song to him, whereas somethings, if plainly laid
down, would not be so cheerfully digested: Thus he maketh
the saddest matter sweet, by his manner of proposing it.</p>
               <p>8. Also the Lord useth to keep the Songs, and spiritual allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of his own, somewhat vailed from the rest of the world;
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:65401:21"/>
for <hi>they have meat to eat the world knoweth not of,</hi> that Believers
may see, and feed sweetly, where they discern nothing, and that
they having this Commented on by experience betwixt him and
them, may sing that Song, which none other in the world can
learn, as the 144000 do, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 1. for thus it's said, <hi>Math.</hi> 13. 9,
10, 11, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that Christ spake in Parables, that not only he might
condescend to the weaknesse of his own, so as they might bear it,
<hi>Mark</hi> 4. 33, 34. but also, that others, <hi>seeing might see, and not
perceive:</hi> Often that same way which his own gets good of,

                  </gap>oveth a stumbling to others, through their own corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>9. There may be also something of Gods design here, to try
the humility and since<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ity of his people, if they will stoop to
every way he useth, because it's his; and if they will love the
Word, not as so, or so proposed, but as it cometh from him,
and is his, and as such humbly receive it, as being that which
(though it seem to others foolishnesse, yet) makes them wise
unto Salvation. The mockers taunted <hi>Ezekiel's</hi> Message under
this notion, that he spake Parables, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20. 49. but <hi>Z<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

10, 11. when the Prophet broke the two Staves (which was a
dark and mysterious-like action) the <hi>poor of the flock waited on
him,</hi> when (as it's like) others stumbled also. By all which, we
may see why the Lord hath so compacted together, plain useful
Doctrines, under such expressions in this Song; and also, why our
undertaking to open it, may be well constructed, even though
these same truthes may elsewhere as clearly arise; yet, these
truths are here in such a way connected together, and so not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
proposed, but also commended unto us, as will not any where
else be found.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 2. If any say, the raising of such Gospel-Doctrines, makes
this Song look more like the Gospel of the New Testament, than
a Song of the Old. <hi>Ans.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>Is it the worse, that it look like the Gospel? Or, are not such
Doctrine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> (if they follow from it) the better &amp; more comfortable?
Certainly there is no Doctrine, more edifying and comfortable to
Believers, and more like, or more becoming Christs way with Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
or their's with him (which is the scope and subject of this
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:65401:21"/>
Song) then Gospel-Doctrines are. High soaring words of vanity,
and mysteries having nothing but an empty sound, are much more
unlike this spiritual Song, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>an these. 2. If it set out Christs
way to Believers, even under the Old Testament, and Believers
way of keeping communion with God even then; is not that the
same Gospel-way which we have now? Their faith and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with God, stood not in the outward Ceremonies, which were
Typical; but in the exercise of inward Graces, faith, love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
which are the same now as then; Was not Christ the same to them
as to us? Had they not the same Spirit, Covenant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and so
the cases and experiences of, or incident to Believers then, are
also applicable to us now? That Christ was then to come, and
hath now suffered, and that the way of revealing him then, was
some way different from that we have now, will not make ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Gospel, Covenant, Faith, yea, nor Church; we being grafted
in that same Stock which they once grew upon, and being by
Faith Heirs of the same promises, which sometime they pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 3. If any should yet doubt, if <hi>Solomon</hi> knew or intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
such Doctrines as these, and that therefore, they cannot be
well digested, if drawn from this Song, beyond his mind and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Our great purpose is to know what the Spirit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
and not what <hi>Solomon</hi> understood; and if this be the
Spirit's intention, to set out Christ's way with his Church; then
such Doctrines as agree therewith, must be agreeable to his
meaning. 2. Yea, suppose <hi>Solomon</hi> and other Prophets should
be ignorant, in a great measure, of the meaning of such things,
as the Spirit foretold by them (as it is not impossible in some
extraordinary things, especially when their knowledge in these
was not essential to the truth of their Prophesie, for they might
have a kind of nescience in the particulars, though they were sure
the thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> they delivered were in the complex Prophesie God's
word) yet, will any say, that we should limit the words spoken
by them, to their understanding of them? If so, by what rule
would we know, if, or how they did understand them?</p>
               <p>3. Therefore we say, It was with <hi>Solomon</hi> here, as with other
Prophets, (as <hi>Isaiah,</hi> and others) who spake many of the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:65401:22"/>
Gospel-truths, which in particular they might not so fully
know, as we do now, when these Prophecies are fulfilled; yet
was it never doubted, but the most deep mysteries of the Gospel,
were contained in their Prophecies.</p>
               <p>Yet, 4. We say there is no ground to think, but <hi>Solomon</hi>
knew much of the mind of the Spirit in this Song, yea, more than
many Learned Men now a-days. For, 1. He was not only a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever,
but one eminent for gifts and knowledge; and none will
say but he was so for divine knowledge, as well as humane; as
his Books, particularly, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 8, 9. Chapters, in his descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Christ, the substantial wisdome of the Father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do shew:
And can it be thought, he wrot this Book, without any sense of
what he wrot? 2. Can it be thought, but he lavelled what he
wrot here at a scope? and that afterward himself made use of it,
for his edification and comfort? which could not be done, if he
had not understood the most of these Gospel-mysteries, upon
which all this sweet conference betwixt Christ and Believers, is
founded. 3. His writing in such terms shews, that the words
were not ignorantly fallen upon; but he, having knowledge of all
Herbs, Spices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and how to apply them to spiritual things,
pitched upon these as the most pertinent similitudes, which are
therefore by the special wisdom of the Spirit, made use of in this
Song, as in other his Writings; yea, certainly his knowledge,
how spiritual mysteries are couched up in these similitudes, and
represented by them, was beyond what we can reach unto now;
and therefore we dare not insist, or be peremptory in the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
application of these similitudes. 4. The subject of this
Song not being Prophetical, but Narrative and Doctrinal, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
such exercises, as might be, and certainly were found in
Believers, even then, and such dispensations as they used to meet
with, will any say he was a stranger unto them, seing there was
accesse to know these much better, then Prophesies of things
which were to come? Yea, 5. Is there any thing here, but what
in other Scriptures of the Old Testament (and especially Songs
and Psalms) is to be found, where the cases and exercises of Gods
people are set down? And it needs not be thought strange, if we
equal him in knowledge with others of his time, or before him;
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:65401:22"/>
and that he sets down in a more artificial manner, according to
his measure of Gifts, that which others set down in more plain
termes, yet both by the same Spirit.</p>
               <p>We may then confidently hazard, to draw the same Doctrines
concerning Christ, the Gospel, Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from it, that are to
be found in other more clear and plain Scriptures. One of the
Fathers (<hi>Athanas.</hi> in <hi>Synops.</hi>) comparing this Song with other
Scriptures of the Old Testament, sayes, it is as <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi>
among the Prophets, other Scriptures speak of Christ as coming,
(saith he) and afar off; this speaks of Him, and to Him, as already
come, and near hand; and indeed it is so: For so even then, he
was sometimes very familiar and present both to the Faith and
Sense of his people, as well as now. Thus also, even <hi>Origen</hi>
(though in plain Scriptures too luxuriant, yet in this he) seems
to own this same scope. Thus also <hi>Zanch.</hi> in <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. makes it a
compend and Copy of the spiritual Marriage with Christ. And
<hi>Bodius</hi> in <hi>Eph.</hi> pag. 114. sayes, it's <hi>ipsius fidei, &amp; Religionis Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianae,
medulla.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it be said, if we interpret this Song after this manner, then
all the observations will run upon Believers cases only; which
would seem to say, that no Doctrines may be drawn from it, for
the edification of these who are yet unrenewed; and what use
can it then be of, to them, who yet are the greater part in the
Church?</p>
               <p>1 <hi>Ans.</hi> The Gospel hath Doctrines suitable to all within the
Church; and this Song being in substance, Christs way with his
Church, must also contain Doctrines useful for all within the same.</p>
               <p>2. In this Song the Church is not only considered as invisible,
and unite by true faith to Christ; but also as visible, and as under
external Ordinances, as hath been said; and in that respect, it
furnishes Doctrines fit for all.</p>
               <p>3. This Song will furnish Doctrines useful for these, as other
Parables or Allegories of that kind do, which Christ used often
even for the edification of such.</p>
               <p>4. Doctrines from all places of Scripture, may be raised by
analogy; as from such places, where God holdeth forth the way
he useth with his own, when they have wronged him by sin, which
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:65401:23"/>
is to humble them and bring them to Repentance, ere they see
his face again, sin becomes bitter even to them: From such
places, I say, we may gather by proportion, that God's way with
unrenewed sinners, whom he minds to bring to peace and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
with himself, is to humble them, and make sin bitter to them,
seing the recovering of peace, and the first founding of peace, as
to this, is brought about after the same manner.</p>
               <p>5. From such places, as speak directly Christs special love to
Believers, there may be drawn good uses and applications to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
partly, to ingage them to him, who so loves his own;
partly, to terrifie these who are not his, by their being debarred
from any right to such excellent priviledges.</p>
               <p>6. Where the Brides carriage is commendable, it's a copy and
pattern to all, even as Examples and Precepts are ordinarily given
in common to all, and serve to direct every one in what they
should aime at; and also to convince for what they are short of:
The duties she is taken up with, being moral, her example in these,
must lay an universal obligation upon all, and in such things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
she falleth through infirmitie, her carriage serveth well to
deter all from these evils.</p>
               <p>In the Last place, for better understanding of the subject of
this Song, we would take alongst with us, 1. some Observations.
2. some Rules.</p>
               <p>1. The subject thereof is to hold forth the mutual and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable
exercise, and out-lettings of love, as well betwixt
Christ and particular Believers, as betwixt him and the Church:
As also, his various dispensations to the Bride, her diverse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
and tempers, and both his and her carriage under them,
and her out-gates.</p>
               <p>2. The manner how this sweet subject is set down, is by way
of Dialogue, in several conferences, after a Dramatick way (as it's
called) because thus the mutual love of these parties, is best ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed:
In which there are, 1. The principal parties in the
discourse. 2. Others as Friends or Attendants waiting on: In
the Gospel, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 28, 29. there are mentioned the <hi>Bridegroom,</hi>
and his <hi>Friends,</hi> and the <hi>Bride:</hi> And <hi>children of the Marriage-Chamber</hi>
are spoken of, <hi>Math.</hi> 9. 15. by which are understood
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:65401:23"/>
                  <hi>Virgins</hi> and <hi>Companions,</hi> that attend her, and also go forth to
wait on him; which are of two sorts, some <hi>Wise,</hi> being really so,
some <hi>Foolish,</hi> being wise in profession only, <hi>Math.</hi> 25. 1, 2. There is
also mention made of a <hi>Mother, Gal.</hi> 4. 26. which hath two sorts of
children, some born after the <hi>Flesh,</hi> and but children as it were
of the <hi>Bond-woman;</hi> others born after the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and true mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Church invisible: The former persecutes the latter;
and of both kinds of children, are some of all ranks, amongst
Priests, Apostles, Ministers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We will find all these parties in this Song, acting their several
parts.</p>
               <p>First, The Bridegroom is Christ, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 24. called the <hi>one
Husband, 2 Cor.</hi> 11. 2. for there is not another spiritual husband,
to whom Believers can be matched; He is <hi>the King's son,</hi> for
whom the marriage is made, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 1, 2 &amp;c. He is <hi>the
Lamb,</hi> unto whose marriage the hearers of the Gospel are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 9. and <hi>Psal.</hi> 45. He is the <hi>King</hi> unto whom the
<hi>Queen</hi> is to be brought after she is adorned; by this name he
is also styled in this Song, <hi>The King, Chap.</hi> 1. 4. 12. &amp;c. and <hi>the
beloved;</hi> Those, and such titles are given to him, which cannot be
understood to be attribute to any but to Christ only, by Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.</p>
               <p>2. The <hi>Bride</hi> is the Church, and every Believer in diverse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations
(as is said before) who are married to Christ, and
are to be made ready and adorned for the solemnizing of the
marriage. Of the nature of this marriage see more, <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. 8.</p>
               <p>3. The <hi>Bridegroom's friends</hi> are honest Ministers, who rejoice
to see him great; Such as <hi>Iohn</hi> was, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 29. and such were
the Apostles, <hi>Iohn</hi> 15. 15. Such are here the <hi>Watch-men,</hi> trusted
with the over-sight and edification of others, spoken unto, <hi>Chap.</hi>
2. 15. and spoken of, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 3.</p>
               <p>4. The <hi>Virgins,</hi> or children of the marriage-chamber, are here
called <hi>Daughters of Zion, Chap.</hi> 3. 11. and <hi>of Ierusalem</hi> (many
whereof are weak, ready to stumble, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 6. and of little
knowledge, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 9. and ready to stir up the Bridegroom,
<hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 5.) and the <hi>Virgins that love Christ, Chap.</hi> 1. 3. and <hi>the
upright, Chap.</hi> 1. 4.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:65401:24"/>
5. The <hi>Mother</hi> is the universal visible Church, wherein are
many true Believers, who are converted to Christ by the Word
and Ordinances dispensed therein, and to which also many Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites
belong as members.</p>
               <p>6. The <hi>children of the promise,</hi> are true Virgins that love
Christ; the <hi>children of the bond-woman,</hi> and the flesh, are unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
Professors in the Church, as also, false teachers, who act
their part here likewise, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 6. and 2. 15. and 5. 7.</p>
               <p>3. This conference, as it is betwixt Christ and the Believer, is
followed as betwixt married parties. 1. In their titles, they
attribute to each other. 2. In their claiming of this relation
one in another, as that he is her's, and she is his. 3. In their
expressions, which are such as use to be betwixt most loving par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
who live exercising conjugal love, most kindly and intimatly
together. The reason whereof is, 1. To shew the neer Union
that is betwixt Christ and his Church; there is a relation, and a
most neer relation betwixt them, that is not betwixt him and
any others. 2. To shew the kindly effects of that relation in both
the parties, especially the faithfulnesse and tendernesse of the
husband, in walking according to it in every thing. 3. It's to
sweeten every piece of exercise, the Believer meets with; Yea,
to make all dispensations digest the better, seing they are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensed,
and ordered by such a loving husband. 4. It's for warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Believers heart the more to Christ, and to make this
Song heartsome and delightsome, that so Believers may have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
a marriage-Song, and every night may be to them as a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-night.</p>
               <p>4. The purpose or subject of this Song, is Christ, and divine
things of all sorts; but mainly the experiences of grown Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
held forth in most noble and lively expressions, as was
before a little cleared.</p>
               <p>5. The scope of all is, to expresse the desirablenesse of fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
with the Bridegroom, and how the Bride thirsteth and long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
for it, and how carefull she is to entertain it, and by laying
out his matchlesse excellencies to commend him to others;
which also seems to be the scope and design, for which this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is given to the Church; and so her breathing after com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:65401:24"/>
with him, doth here begin the conference, <hi>v. 2. Let
him kisse me,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>6. The manner of their expression is, 1. Sweet and loving: and
therefore, this conference is carried on, under the terms of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
and the titles of <hi>beloved, my love, spouse,</hi> &amp;c. (as being
the most lively that can expresse that relation, and most apposite
for entertaining of mutual love) are here made use of. 2. The
manner of expression is something obscure, though sweet, that
so the Lord's people may be stirred up to painfulnesse, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
in searching out his mind; and also, because the myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
here contained, are great, and cannot, as they are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs,
be conceived: Therefore that they may be illustrate, Parables
are used, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 34. compared with <hi>Mark</hi> 4. 33. where
it's clear, that the intent and effect of the Lord's speaking by
Parables, is to help some to take up these mysteries, and to
leave some ignorant. 3. The Spirit of God doth here make
use of borrowed expressions, the more lively to set out the
spiritual matter contained under them; and by things most
taking, and best known to our senses, to hold out divine Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
unto which these expressions are to be applyed. 4. Often
these same expressions, are made use of in one place, in speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Bridegroom, and in another speaking to the
Bride, he calling her <hi>chief amongst the Daughters,</hi> and she
him <hi>chief amongst the Sons,</hi> but in a different sense; for, he
styles her from his acceptation of her, and from his imputation,
and communication of his graces to her: But she styles him from
his own excellencie and worth, he having all in himself, and
nothing borrowed from any other, but imparting that which
is his, to her.</p>
               <p>2. The Rules we would take alongst with us in our proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
are these:</p>
               <p>First, We would find out, who speaks in every passage of
this Song; for this serves much to clear what is spoken.</p>
               <p>2. We would carefully ponder, what is the purpose of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
in every part thereof.</p>
               <p>3. We must apply, and conform expressions to the scope, and
expound them by it, and not stick too much in following of
every thing, which these Allegories seem to bear; but draw
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:65401:25"/>
the Doctrines from them, being compared with the scope, and
other places of Scripture, not insisting too far upon the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudes.</p>
               <p>4. We are to take special notice of the Brides frame, in her
manner of speaking; For we may observe, that often in the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency
of her passionate love, she breaks out without any seen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion,
or order, as <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 2. and by cutted, broken, and
vehement expressions, in her diverse f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ames and tender fits,
as her case is up or down, (abruptly, as it were) she useth to
expresse her self.</p>
               <p>5. We must not apply all so to the Church, as to shut out
Believers, nor contrarily; but take in both, where both may
come in; and more especially apply to the one, where the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
makes most for it, as hath been said.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Efore we enter upon the purpose of this Chapter,
or give the division of it, we would first speak
to the Title contained, <hi>ver.</hi> 1.</p>
                  <p>We account this Title Scripture, it being in
the Original, even as other Titles, prefixed to
diverse Psalms, as to <hi>Psal. 51. 102, &amp;c.</hi> In it
three things are set down. 1. The nature of this
Scripture. 2. It's Excellency. 3. It's instrumental Author,
who was made use of, by the Spirit in Penning of it.</p>
                  <p>First, For the nature of this Scripture, It's <hi>a Song.</hi> Songs in
Scripture, are such Portions, or Books thereof, as were especially
intended to be made use of, for the praising of God, the edifying
and comforting of his people, in singing of them. Three sorts of
them were in use amongst the <hi>Hebrews</hi> (as the Titles of our
Psalms do clear, and as they are mentioned by the Apostle, <hi>Eph.</hi>
5. 19.) 1. Psalms, such were used, both with voice and Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
2. There were Hymns (so the 145 Psalm is intituled)
such in the matter of them, were wholly made up of praise, and
what immediatly led to that. 3. There were spiritual Songs,
which were more extensive in the matter, taking in Histories,
cases, and exercises of all sorts; and might be sung with the voice,
without Instruments, either publickly, or privatly. Of this last
sort, is this Song, intended to be made use of in the praises of
God; and so composed, both for matter and manner, as it
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:65401:26"/>
might best attain that end, and prove edifying and comfortable
also to Believers, in their singing of it.</p>
                  <p>2. The excellencie of this Song is exprest in this, that it's <hi>A
Song of Songs,</hi> A most excellent Song, this being the manner
how the <hi>Hebrews</hi> expresse their superlatives. While it is called
<hi>A Song of Songs,</hi> it's compared with, and preferred to, all other
Songs: And we conceive the comparison is not only betwixt
this and humane Songs; But, 1. It's compared with, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to, all these which <hi>Solomon</hi> wrot, and it's preferable to
all these 1005 mentioned, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 4. 32. 2. It's compared with
all other Scriptural Songs, such as is recorded, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15. and
<hi>Iudg.</hi> 5. &amp;c. Of all which, this is the most excellent, as being,
1. Purposly intended to treat of the most choise and excellent
subject, to wit, Christ and his Church; which is not done upon
particular occasions, as in other Songs, but is the great purpose
that is only designed and pursued. 2. It treats of Christ and his
Church, in their most glorious, lively, and lovely actions, to wit,
his care of, and his love unto, his Church, and that in it's most
eminent degree; and also, of her love to him, in it's various
measures and workings. 3. It's in a most excellent manner com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
by way of conference and sweet Colloques betwixt these
two parties, having in it many excellent expressions, and variety
of them, well interwoven with sundry cases of several sorts, to
make the whole draught the more taking and excellent. 4. It's
set forth in a most lovely, excellent, majestick stile and strain,
which exceedingly ravishes and captivats affections, making the
love contained in it, sweetly savour and relish through the
beautifull garment of borrowed expressions, which is put upon
it. 5. It's a most excellent Song, in respect of it's comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sivenesse;
here is an armory and store-house of Songs in this one,
where there is something treasured up for every case, that may
be edifying and comfortable, which will not be so found in any
other Song; there being something here suiting all sorts of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
under all the variety of cases and dispensations, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they are exercised; and also, all the relations under which
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:65401:26"/>
the Church standeth: All which, should commend this Song
unto us.</p>
                  <p>It is recorded of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> that whatever Scripture was
delivered in a poetical <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>rame, they accounted themselves speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
bound to take notice of that, and to get it by heart;
and indeed it is not for nought, that some Scriptures, and not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
are casten in that mould; and something of this, as the
intent of the Holy Ghost, may be gathered from <hi>Moses</hi> his put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his last words in a Song, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. that they might be the
better remembred.</p>
                  <p>The 3. thing in the title, is the Penman made use of by the
Spirit, in the writing and recording this Song: It's <hi>Solomon,</hi> a
great man, rich, wise, yea an elect Saint; Yet one, who had also
fallen into many foul faults, whom the Lord hath suffered to
die, without recording expresly any thing of his recovery, though
we make no doubt of it; which (because <hi>Bellarmine, lib. 3. de
Iustif. Chap. 14. pag. 368. Tannovius</hi> and others, are at pains in
contradicting this, yea, <hi>Augustine</hi> doubts of it, because nothing
is directly recorded of his recovery) we shall endeavour to make
clear from these considerations,</p>
                  <p>First, From the Lords promises to him, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 14, 15.
where these three things are observable, which the Lord under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes
concerning him. 1. That he will be to him a father.
2. That he will correct him with the rods of men, if he shall sin;
which saith, he would not eternally punish him. 3. That he
would not do with him, as he did with <hi>Saul,</hi> whom he rejected;
he would not take away his mercy from <hi>Solomon,</hi> as he had done
from him: And if no more were in these Promises, but what is
temporal, there would be no great consolation in them to <hi>David</hi>
(whose consolation is one chief part of the scope of that place.)
Beside, these promises, <hi>Psal.</hi> 89. 31, 32, 33. (which are the same
with these, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.) are looked upon as special evidences of
God's love, and peculiar Promises of his Saving-Covenant.</p>
                  <p>2. When he is born, the Lord gives him his name, yea, sends <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,
2 Sam.</hi> 12. with this warrand, to name him <hi>Iedidiah,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Lord loved him; which cannot be a love flowing from
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:65401:27"/>
any thing in him, as if he had been well pleased with his carriage,
(<hi>Solomon</hi> had not yet done any thing good or evil) but it must
be a love prior to his works, and so not arising from his good
deeds, and therefore not cut off by his sins; which being like the
love, God had to <hi>Iacob,</hi> before he had done good or evil, <hi>Rom.</hi>
9. 11. must speak out Electing love, as it doth in that place.</p>
                  <p>3. He is made use of by the Spirit, to be a Penman of Holy
Writ, and a Prophet of the Lord; all which, are by our Lord,
<hi>Luke</hi> 13. 28. said, to <hi>sit down with Abraham, Isaac and Iacob,
in the Kingdom of Heaven;</hi> and there is no reason to exclude
him, seing that universal (<hi>all the Prophets, &amp;c.</hi>) would not be
a truth, unlesse he were there: And though some wicked men
have prophesied, as <hi>Balaam</hi> did, yet are they never accounted Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
of the Lord, as <hi>Solomon</hi> was, but false Prophets and Inchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
neither were they Penmen of Holy Writ; who were, as
<hi>Peter</hi> calleth them, 2 <hi>Pet. 1. 21. Holy men of God, speaking as they
were inspired by the Holy Ghost.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. Neither are the peculiar Priviledges he was admitted unto,
to be forgotten; by him the Lord built the Temple, by him
the Covenant was explicitly renewed with God, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8. 9. and
his prayers are often particularly mentioned, to be heard; yea,
after his death, some testimonies are recorded of him, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
consist with his rejection: See 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 11. 17. where the
wayes of <hi>Solomon</hi> are put in, as commendable with <hi>Davids,</hi> though
there were defects in both; and this being immediatly after <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon's</hi>
death, it would seem he left the worship of God pure,
and so had turned from his Idolatry, though all the monuments
of it, were not abolished. And especially in this, he was singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
priviledged, that, in a most lively way, he was the Type of
our blessed Lord Jesus, in his Intercession, Reign, and peaceable
Government: Beside, that by particular Covenant, the Kingdom
of Christ, and his descent from him, was established to him.</p>
                  <p>5. It's of weight also, that it seems more than probable, that
<hi>Solomon</hi> wrot <hi>Ecclesiastes</hi> after his recovery; it being neither
amongst the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> nor <hi>Songs</hi> which are mentioned, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 4.
32. And in it, he speaks out the experience he had both of <hi>folly</hi>
                     <pb n="47" facs="tcp:65401:27"/>
and <hi>madness,</hi> and the vanity he had found in all created things,
even when he had perfected his Essay of all the possible wayes of
attaining, either the knowledge of their perfections, or satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the injoyment of them.</p>
                  <p>The Scripture therefore, hath not left his recovery altogether
dark; yet, as to any Historical narration thereof, the Lord hath
so ordered, that he passeth away under a cloud, for these good
ends:</p>
                  <p>First: Thereby, <hi>Solomon</hi> is chastised with the rods of men
(even after death) upon his name; for, his miscarriages are set
down expresly, but his recovery (as to any direct testimony
thereof) is past over.</p>
                  <p>2. By this, the Lord maketh his displeasure with <hi>Solomon's</hi>
wayes, known; though he had favour to his person, and gave
him his soul for a prey.</p>
                  <p>3. Thus the Lord would affright others from declining, and
hereby teacheth his people, to be afraid to rest upon Gifts; yea,
or upon Graces, seing he hath left this matter so far in the
dark, as might yeeld an occasion (as it were) to question the
eternal condition of <hi>Solomon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. It may be also, that <hi>Solomon</hi> after his recovery, did never
recover his former lustre, nor attain to such a profitable way of
appearing in God's publike matters, for which formerly he had
been so observable: For so it is taken notice even of <hi>David,</hi>
after his fall, that his following life is stained, as different from
what went before; therefore it is the commendation of <hi>Iehosha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat,
1 Chron.</hi> 17. 3. that he walked in the first wayes of his father
<hi>David,</hi> which certainly, is not done to condemn <hi>David's</hi> state after
that time, but to leave that mark (as a chastisement) on his
failings: And seing <hi>Solomon's</hi> were greater, therefore may this
silence of his recovery, be more universal as to him.</p>
                  <p>Before we draw any thing from this, by way of use, I shall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
a doubt, and it is this, How can all these thousand and five
Songs, mentioned, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 4. 32. be lost, without <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ronging the
per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ection of Canonick Scripture? Or, what is come of them?
Or, what is to be accounted of the losse of them?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="48" facs="tcp:65401:28"/>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> We say, 1. The Scriptures may be full in the articles
of faith, even though some portions thereof, which once were
extant, were now a-missing; except it could be made out, that
some points of faith were in these Books, which are not to be
found in other Scriptures. 2. Yet, seing it is not safe, and it
wants not many inconveniences, to assert that any Book once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
of God to his Church, as a canon or rule of faith and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
should be lost. And seing, it is not consistent with that wise
Providence of his, whereby he hath still carefully preserved the
treasure of his Oracles in his Church, We rather incline to say,
that though these Songs were possibly useful, and might be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by the Spirit's direction; yet, that they were not intended
for the universal edification of the Church, nor inrolled as a part
of his Word, appointed for that end. Neither can it be thought
strange, that it should so be; for, that a thing be Scripture, it's
not only needful, that it be inspired, but also that it be appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of God for publike use. It's not improbable, but <hi>Isaiah,
Moses, David, Paul,</hi> and others might have written many moe
writtings, upon particular occasions, or to particular persons,
which were useful in themselves for edification; and yet were
never appointed of God to be looked upon, or received as Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
for publike use in his Church: So do we account of these
Songs mentioned in the objection, and other writings of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
now not extant: And it may be the Spirit hath pitched on
this Song, to be recorded, as the sum and chief of all the rest;
as he did pitch upon some particular Prayers of <hi>David</hi> and
<hi>Moses,</hi> &amp;c. passing by others.</p>
                  <p>And Lastly, We are rather to be thankful, for the great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
we have by this, than anxiously to inquire, what hath
become of the rest.</p>
                  <p>There are four things, we would propose for use, from the
Title of this Song.</p>
                  <p>First, That singing of Believers cases, even their several cases,
is allowable: Or, that singing of diverse and different cases, yea,
even their saddest cases, is not inconsistent with, but very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
unto, the work of praise: Ye see, this is a Song for the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:65401:28"/>
of it, which Song is to be sung, yet for matter, exceeding
comprehensive of all sorts of cases, and these various.</p>
                  <p>There are (amongst others) five cases, in which to sing, doth
sometimes stumble, at least, stick much with those who are weak
and tender; All which, we will find cleared in the Brides practice
of singing this Song.</p>
                  <p>First, It's doubted, if sad cases should be sung, seing, <hi>Iames</hi>
5. 13. it's said, <hi>Is any man merry? let him sing Psalms. Ans.</hi> It's
true, these who are merry should sing, but not only they, no
more then only they who are afflicted, should pray; It's not our
case, nor our chearful disposition, but the duty that should be
respected in this work of praise; yea, we should sing, for chearing
our disposition, and mitigating and sweet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ing our crosses: So
doth the Bride here sing her suffe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ings, <hi>Chap. 1. 6. Chap.</hi> 5. 7.
when she was smitten; yea, her de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ertions, she putteth these al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
in a Song.</p>
                  <p>2. It's stumbled at sometimes, to sing complaints of our own
sinfulnesse, and to turn our failings into Songs; What matter of
cheerfulnesse, is there in these, may one think? But we say here,
she doth so, <hi>mine own Vineyard have I not kept</hi> (saith she) <hi>Chap.
1. 6. I sleep,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 2. It's a ground of cheerfulnesse,
that we may sing over these unto God, with expectation to be
pardoned and delivered from them, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 65. 3.</p>
                  <p>3. When the matter is different from our case, some thinks
it's hard to sing such <hi>Psalms. Ans.</hi> Certainly in this Song, there
are different, yea, contrary cases; yet none can think, but a
Believer may sing it all at one time. Yea, 2. There had never
then, been a <hi>Psalm</hi> sung in publick; for in no Congregation, can
all the members ever be in one case. 3. The same might be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
against publick Prayers also, seing there may be many pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions
that are not suitable to all joyners; yet hath the Lord
commanded both publick Praying and Praising.</p>
                  <p>4. When the matter, which is sung, is above us, being a thing
we have not yet reached, and so cannot assert it in our particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
condition as truth, As these words, <hi>Psal. 18. 20, 21. I have
kept his ways,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ans.</hi> By this Song, all, at least most part of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:65401:29"/>
Believers, are made to sing many things, beyond their own at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments
possibly; yea, <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. that phrase, <hi>My Vineyard which
is mine, is before me,</hi> is of that same extent, with that, <hi>Psal.</hi>
18. 20. Yet will not any think, that the Spirit propounding this
<hi>Song,</hi> and that <hi>Psalm,</hi> as a subject for publick praise, did ever
intend that none should sing it, but such as were as holy as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid;</hi>
yea, it would seem, that if either <hi>David</hi> or <hi>Solomon,</hi> had
stuck to the absolute perfection which these words seem to hold
forth (if they be expounded according to the strict rule of the
Law, and be not taken in an Evangelick sense) that neither of
them would, or could have sung them: yea, it's observable, that
in this Song, there are spots mentioned; and not keeping of the
Vineyard, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. is one part of the Song, as well as keeping
of it, <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. is another.</p>
                  <p>How then may we joyn in these? <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. We sing not our
own sense, and experience only, but what may attain the end of
praise, which is attained, in our acknowledging what others have
reached, though we our selves come short. 2. Not only our
own case, as particular members, is to be sung; but in publick
we take in the praises of the whole body. 3. That expression,
<hi>Chap. 1. 6. Mine own Vineyard,</hi> &amp;c. holds forth the sense she had
of her negligence, not as if she had no way done her duty, but
she confesseth her failings in it; which she sings to the praise of
that free grace, that had pardoned her. Again, the other expression,
<hi>Chap. 8. 12. My Vineyard which is mine, is before me,</hi> expresseth
her sense of her sincerity, blessing God for it, and refreshing her
self in the acknowledging of it: and both these may agree, as to
some measure, in the Believers experience, at one and the same
time; though, when the Believer sinneth more grostely, they
do not so well agree to him, except in respect of different times
and cases.</p>
                  <p>In praising then, we would neither simply look to our frame,
nor to the matter in it self, which is to be sung, nor to the cases
we are in, as if these were the warrand of our singing, or the rule
to regul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>s in it; but unto these three things. 1. The end
where<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ore singing is appointed. 2. The command. 3. The no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:65401:29"/>
or consideration, in respect of which, the Believer joyneth
in the duty of praise.</p>
                  <p>The ends are principally three. 1. Glorifying God, and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his praise glorious: thus Histories of the Lords dealing with
his people of old, and thus the cases of others, in our singing of
them, serve to that end, that he did such works, that such a case
was once sung to him, and such a Saint was so dealth with; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
we might scruple to sing, <hi>Psal. 44. We have heard with our
ears, our fathers have told us,</hi> and other Scriptures, as well as
cases: And so the most part of the subject of praise, and the Book
of the Psalms, would be laid aside as uselesse, and not so much
as to be read; for we ought not to read, or say an untruth, more
then to sing it.</p>
                  <p>A second end is, edifying of others with whom we joyn, as well
as studying edification our selves: So, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 16. the end to be
proposed in singing, is, <hi>teaching and admonishing one another, in
Psalms, and Hymns, and spiritual Songs.</hi> And suppose, some
found themselves unsutable in their own case, to the purpose that
is to be sung, yet will it not teach them what they should be,
and admonish them because they are not such?</p>
                  <p>A third end we are to aim at in singing, is our own chearing
and refreshing, <hi>making melody in our hearts to the Lord, Eph.</hi> 5. 19.
Which ariseth not alwayes from the matter simply considered, as
it holds true in our own experience: But, 1. from our conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
going about it, as a piece of worship to God, and so doing,
we are accepted in that. 2. From the heartsomenesse of that
soul-refreshing exercise of praise; and so that Scripture which
might be more sadening in meditation to us, yet should be
chearing in praise, because it's then used in that Ordinance.
3. From the possibility that is herein discovered, of attaining
such a blessing, frame, or experience, because once a Saint did at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it: and since they were men of the like passions, and infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
with us, why may not we aim at, and hope to be made Saints
of the like graces with them, since they were, what they were, by
the grace of God? 4. From this, that it was once made good
in another, which mercy should be a ground to us, to mention
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:65401:30"/>
it to the Lords praise. 5. From it's being a part of Scripture,
appointed for his praise, whither it agree with our case or not:
That being the end wherefore it was designed to be sung, is a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
warrand, for our joyning in the singing thereof.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We would consider the command we have, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to praise, but to praise in these words of <hi>David,</hi> and other
Penmen of holy Psalms; for which cause, God hath furnished his
Church with Songs (but not so with Forms of Prayers, to which
he would have us astricted) and that for preventing doubts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the matter: For, 1. If God did propone these songs to
be sung, then they are fit to praise him. 2. If he did allow none
to sing them, but such as had no hesitation or scruple to assert
them, with application to themselves; then, either never should
they be sung, or never in publick: But, 3. Did he not appoint
them to be used in <hi>David's</hi> time? And joyners then were not all
of one size; Sure, they had never been committed to publick use,
if none might have joyned in singing them, but these who could
sing them from their own experience: Or, will a Believer be
challenged for praising God, in the rule and words laid down by
him? Certainly not: However he may be challenged, if he be
not sutably affected in the singing of them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, We would consider the notion, or capacity under
which Believers joyn in this duty; for they joyn either as parts
of the whole Church, and so they go about their part of the duty
of praise (as the matter holdeth true in any member indefinitely,
even as they joyn in prayers) so being that which is sung, be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
matter for that end: Or, they joyn as true Believers, and then
what points out infirmity, they look on it as agreeing to their
flesh; what points out sincerity, they as spiritual, though not
perfect, joyn on that account in the thankfull acknowledging of it;
what confesseth a sin, if guilty, they acknowledge it, if not, they
blesse God they are preserved by grace, yet they are made to see
their corruption, which hath the seed of that sin in it, and take
warning; as in singing the 51 <hi>Psalm</hi> is requisit, when all are not
under that guilt, which <hi>David</hi> there confesseth.</p>
                  <p>A fifth case in singing, which hath been matter of doubting to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:65401:30"/>
some, is, when they are put to sing with others, who possibly are
strangers to God. <hi>Ans.</hi> Such may be cleared from this, that the
Bride joyneth with <hi>the Daughters of Ierusalem,</hi> often they have a
share in holding up this Song; so doth she go to <hi>the Watchmen,</hi>
being willing to joyn with them who smote her: And certainly
this and other Songs, being to be sung in publick in the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
and suc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                     </gap> Congregation, as none will plead that it ought
to have been separate from, it's clear they joyned, and that upon
the account of the former grounds.</p>
                  <p>The second thing we are to observe for use, is from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
of this Song, being for it's excellency <hi>A Song of
Songs:</hi> and it is this, that, the Believer hath the choisest <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ong,
and most excellent mirth in the world; not such songs or joy as
the world hath, or giveth, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>7. Yea, their songs, are such
songs, as none can learn, but themselves, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 3. Ohow happy and
chearful a life might a Believer have, if he did not sometime marr
his own comfort! All is most excellent which he hath, his songs
are so, for they have the most excellent subject, to wit, <hi>Christ,
Psal.</hi> 45. and the most excellent grounds of rejoycing, and most
solid; the largest, sweetest, and most comfortable allowance in
the world. Considering all this Song together, though it hath
sundry sad and perplexing cases, yet it is most excellent: Or,
right thoughts of Christ, will make every condition sweet, and
a song; Nothing will come wrong to a Believer, Christ, Christ
maketh up all, and maketh all excellent: every condition with
him is excellent; whoso covets him, coveteth what is best;
whoso neglects him, neglects what is only worth the seeking, and
what can only afford a song to the owner: And it is clearnesse in
Christs worth, and an interest in him, that turns all conditions
into a song.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, From the Author (I mean the Penman) consider,
that piety and tendernesse is not unbecoming, but is rather an
ornament to the most noble, most rich, and most wise men in the
world: It's a greater glory to <hi>Solomon,</hi> and a greater evidence
of his eternal good condition, that he was acquainted with, and
taken up in holy exercises, than that he was a King; yea, places,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:65401:31"/>
parts, riches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are beautiful, when made subservient to
piety; Piety maketh these to shine in <hi>Solomon:</hi> And the Spirit
also maketh use of natural and moral wisdom, which the Lord
had bestowed upon him, to set out deep mysteries in these writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
which shews, that the Lord would have any measure of these
gifts he hath bestowed on us, adorned with the exercise of grace,
and made subservient to his glory. Also we may see here, that
much businesse in mens common affairs, and a tender walk, are
not inconsistent; if men would prudently manage their time,
they might have accesse to their imployments, and keep a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
frame also, as <hi>Solomon, David</hi> and others did. It's our
corruption, and not the multitude of lawfull imployments, that
distracts us: <hi>David</hi> went home to blesse his own family, in the
midst of publick affairs, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 20.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, From the consideration of the Penman, (stained with
such faults) made use of, by God in the composition of this Song;
we may observe, 1. That neither place, parts, nay, nor graces, will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt
any man from falling: O Believers, what need is there to be
watchful and humble! May not these examples of <hi>David, Solomon,
Peter,</hi> &amp;c. lay your pride, and put you to your arms, and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitate
you to be upon your watch? Who of you, will claim to
<hi>Solomon's</hi> knowledge, experience, or priviledges? Yet even he,
the Penman of this sweet Scripture, had his affections to God
cooled, and became an offence even to this day; what is spoken
of his fearful backsliding and fall, being still a rock of offence,
upon which many still break their necks? 2. There may be much
corruption dwelling beside much light and grace, and yet, the
one not fully put out, or extinguish the other. 3. Grace hath
fitted and made use of many a knotty Tree for the Lords work;
for what <hi>Solomon</hi> naturally hath been, may appear in his carriage
(seing men's sinfull carriage and way, is but the product of the
natural corruption that is in their heart) notwithstanding he is
thus made use of. 4. Corruption mayly long under grace's feet,
and grace may attain to a great height, and yet corruption may
again strangely break out, and grace be brought very low: What
knowledge had <hi>Solomon?</hi> What presence and clearnesse had he
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:65401:31"/>
gotten by the Lord's appearing to him? What hearing of P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ayer?
How usefull was he in God's work, in building the Temple, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
all the Levits, &amp;c? and continued thus eminent for many
years, even till he was well stricken in years, and then fell so foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly?
How may this strike us with fear? It's much to win fair off
the Stage, without a spot, Be humble, and <hi>he that standeth, let
him take heed lest he fall.</hi> 5. Grace can wash foul spots out of
Believers Garments, seing no question <hi>Solomon</hi> was washen; and
as he was recovered, so grace is able to recover the Saints from
their most dangerous a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>d fearfull backslidings. 6. Sometime the
Spirit will honour the Penmen of Holy Writ, by mentioning and
recording their names, other times not; as is clear from some
Books, unknown by whom they were written; the Lord doth in
this according to his pleasure, and as he seeth it may tend to
edification.</p>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>Having spoken to the Title, we come now to the Song it
self: which being by way of Conference, or Dialogue,
we shall divide the several Chapters, according to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the Speakers, and their several intercourses in speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
And so in this <hi>Chap.</hi> we have 5. parts. In the 1. the <hi>Bride</hi>
speaks to <hi>vers.</hi> 8. In the 2. the <hi>Bridegroom,</hi> to <hi>vers.</hi> 12. In the
3. the <hi>Bride</hi> again, to <hi>vers.</hi> 15. And 4. the <hi>Bridegroom</hi> speake,
<hi>vers.</hi> 14. And lastly, the <hi>Bride,</hi> in the two last <hi>verses.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Bride</hi> begins this sweet Conference, <hi>vers.</hi> 2. and continues
to <hi>vers.</hi> 8. 1. She speaks to Christ, <hi>vers.</hi> 2, 3, 4. Then 2. to
the <hi>Daughters of Ierusalem, vers.</hi> 5, 6. Lastly, she turns her self
again to the <hi>Bridegroom, vers.</hi> 7.</p>
                  <p>In the first of these, there is, 1. Her aime and desire, by way
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:65401:32"/>
of an earnest wish laid down, <hi>vers.</hi> 1. 2. The motives that stir
up this desire in her, and whereby she presseth it on him, <hi>vers.</hi> 2, 3.
3. There is a formal Prayer set down, <hi>vers.</hi> 4. which is amplified
in these three: 1. In the motive proposed. 2. In the answer ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
and felt. 3. In the effects that followed on it.</p>
                  <p>Her great wish is, <hi>Let him kisse me with the kisses of his mouth.</hi>
That it's the <hi>Bride</hi> that speaks, is clear; She begins, not because
love ariseth first on her side (for here she begins, as having alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
closed with him, and therefore she speaks to him, as one who
knows his worth, and longs for the out-lettings of his love) but
because such expressions of Christs love, as are to be found in this
Song, whereby his complacency is vented and manifested towards
us, doth first presuppose the working of love in us, and our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercising
of it on him, and then his delighting (that is, his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
his delight) in us: For although the man first suit the
wife (and so Christ first sueth for his Bride) yet when persons are
married, it's most suitable, that the wife should very pressingly
long for, and expresse desire after the husband, even as the Bride
doth here after Christ's kisses, and the expressions of his love.
Of this order of Christ's love, see <hi>Chap. 8. Vers.</hi> 10.</p>
                  <p>In the words, consider 1. what she desires, and that is, <hi>the
kisses of his mouth.</hi> 2. How she points Christ forth, by this signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant
demonstrative, <hi>Him.</hi> 3. Her abrupt manner of breaking
out with this her desire, as one that had been dwelling on the
thoughts of Christ, and feeding on his excellency; and therefore
now she breaks out, <hi>Let him kisse me,</hi> &amp;c. as if her heart were
at her mouth, or would leap out of her mouth, to meet with
his.</p>
                  <p>First, by <hi>kisses,</hi> we understand most lovely, friendly, familiar
and sensible manifestations of his love; kisses of the mouth are
so amongst friends, so it was betwixt <hi>Ionathan</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and so
it is especially betwixt Husband and Wife.</p>
                  <p>Next, there are several delightsome circumstances, that heighten
the Brides esteem of this, the so much desired expression of his
love. The 1. is implyed, in the person who is to kisse, it's
<hi>Him, Let him kisse,</hi> He who is the most excellent and singular
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:65401:32"/>
person in the world. The 2. is hinted in the party whom he is
to kisse, it's <hi>me, Let him kisse me,</hi> a contemptible despicable
creature; for so she was in her self, as appears from <hi>vers.</hi> 5, 6.
yet this is the person, this love is to be vented on. 3. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
is he to kisse? It's with the <hi>kisses of his mouth;</hi> which we
conceive is not only added as an Hebraism, like that expression,
<hi>The words of his mouth,</hi> and such like phrases, but also to affect
her self, by expressing fully what she breathed after, to wit,
kisses, or love, which are the more lovely to her, that they
come from his mouth, as having a sweetnesse in it (<hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 16.)
above any thing in the world. That Christ's love hath such a
sweetnesse in it, the reason subjoyned will clear, <hi>for thy love is,</hi> &amp;c.
That which is here <hi>kisses,</hi> is immediatly denominat <hi>loves;</hi> It is
his love that she prized, and whereof kisses were but evidences.</p>
                  <p>They are <hi>kisses</hi> in the plural number, partly to shew how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ways Christ hath to manifest his love, partly to shew the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
and frequency of these manifestations, which she would
be at: The thing which she here desires, is not love simply,
but the sense of love; for she questioned not his love, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
to have sensible expressions of it, and therefore compares it
not only to looks, that she might see him, but to kisses; which
is also clear from the reason annexed, while she compares his love
to Wine.</p>
                  <p>Again, her manner of designing Christ, is observable, <hi>Him.</hi>
It's a relative, where no antecedent goes before, yet certainly
it looks to Christ alone, as the reasons shew; Here no rules of
Art are kept, for love stands not on these: This manner of speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is to be found also in Moral Authors, when one eminent is set
forth, who is singularly known beside others, as having in the
estimation of the speakers no match: So <hi>Pythagora's</hi> Schollars used
to say of their Master, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                     </gap>, He said it: And in Scripture,
when the Saints speak of the Lord, they thus design him, because
they are not afraid to be mistaken, <hi>Psal. 87. 1. His foundation,</hi> &amp;c.
and <hi>Isaiah 53. 2. He shall grow up like to a tender plant:</hi> This is
neither for want of titles due to him, or rhetorick in her, but
because in this manner of expression the Saints set forth, 1. Christ's
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:65401:33"/>
singular excellency, which is such, that he hath no match, or
equal, there is but one <hi>Him.</hi> 2. Their singular esteem of him,
whatever others think. 1 <hi>Cor. 8. 6. To us there is but one Lord,
Iesus:</hi> only Christ is esteemed of by them. 3. A constant and
habitual thinking, and meditating on him; for though there be
no connexion in the words expressed, yet what is expressed, may
have, and hath connexion with the thoughts of her heart: and if
all were seen that were within, it would be easily known what
<hi>Him</hi> she meant: And so we are to gather it's dependence on the
affection, and meditation it flows from, rather than from any
preceeding words; for here there are none. 4. It's to shew, her
thoughts of Christ were not limited, or stinted to her words, or
her speaking of him: for though there be no words preceeding,
to make known who this <hi>Him</hi> is, spoken of, yet we may well
conceive her heart taken up with desire after him, and medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
on him: and so there is a good coherence, <hi>Let him,</hi> that is,
<hi>Him</hi> I have been thinking on, <hi>Him</hi> whom my soul desires, he
only whom I esteem of, and who hath no equal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>t
of abruptnesse of speech, hath no incongruity in spiritual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorick.</p>
                  <p>Whence we may observe, 1. That Christ hath a way of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating
his love, and the sense of it to a Believer, which is not
common to others. 2. That this is the great scope and desire
of a Believer, if they had their choise, it's to have sensible com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with Christ: This is their <hi>one thing, Psal.</hi> 27. 4. It's
the first and last suit of this Song, and the voice of the Spirit
and Bride, and the last Prayer that is in the Scripture, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 17.
3. That Believers can discern this fellowship (it's so sweet and
sensible) which is to be had with Jesus Christ. 4. That they have
an high esteem of it, as being a special signification of his love.
5. That much inward heart-fellowship with Christ, hath suitable
outward expressions flowing from it. 6. That Believers in an
habitual walk with Christ, will be abrupt in their suits to him,
sometimes meditating on him, sometimes praying to him. 7. That
where Christ is known, and rightly thought of, there will be no
equal to him in the heart.</p>
                  <p>2. In the next place, she lays down the motives that made
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:65401:33"/>
her so desire this; which are rather to set forth Christ's excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency,
to strengthen her own faith, and warm her own love in
pursuing after so concerning a suit, than from any fear she had of
being mistaken by him, in being as it were, so bold and home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with him in her desires. 1. The reason is generally propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
<hi>vers.</hi> 2. and inlarged and confirmed, <hi>vers.</hi> 3. The sum of it
is, Thy love is exceeding excellent, and I have more need, and
greater esteem of it, than of any thing in the world, therefore I
seek after it, and hope to attain it.</p>
                  <p>There are four words here to be cleared, 1. <hi>Thy loves</hi> (so
it is in the Original in the plural number) Christ's love is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
(as the love of God) taken essentially, as an attribute in
him, which is himself, <hi>God is love, 1 Ioh.</hi> 4. 8. Thus the Lord,
in his love, is the same in all times. 2. For some effect of that
love, when he doth manifest it to his people, by conferring good
on them, and by the sensible intimations thereof to them: So
it is, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 21, 23. We take it in the last sense here; for she was
in Christ's love, but desired the manifestations of it; and it is by
these that his love becomes sensible and refreshfull to Believers.
It's <hi>Loves</hi> in the plural number, although it be one infinite foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
in God, to shew how many ways it vented, or how many ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
that one love produced, or what esteem she had of it, and of
the continuance and frequency of the manifestations thereof to her;
this one love of his, was, as many loves.</p>
                  <p>The second word to be cleared, is <hi>Wine.</hi> Wine is chearing to
men, <hi>Psal.</hi> 104. 15. and makes their heart glad: under it here
is understood, what is most chearing and comfortable in it's use to
men.</p>
                  <p>3. Christ's love is <hi>better,</hi> 1. Simply in it self, it's most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.
2. In it's effects, more exhilarating, chearing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing.
And, 3. in her esteem, to me (saith she) <hi>it's better;</hi> I
love it, prize it, and esteem it more, as <hi>Psal. 4. 8, 9. Thereby
thou hast made my heart more glad,</hi> &amp;c. This his love is every
way preferable, to all the most chearing and refreshing things in
the world.</p>
                  <p>4. The inference, <hi>for,</hi> is to be considered: It sheweth that
these words are a reason of her suit, and so the sense runs thus, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:65401:34"/>
thy love is of great value, and hath more comfortable ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
on me, than the most delightsome of creatures, therefore
let me have it. Out of which reasoning we may see, what mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
will have weight with Christ, and will sway with sincere
souls in dealing with him, for the intimation of his love; for, the
love of Christ, and the sweetnesse and satisfaction that is to be
found in it, is the great prevailing motive, that hath weight with
them: And sense of the need of Christ's love, and esteem of it,
and delight in it alone, when no creature-comfort can afford re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing,
may, and will warrand poor hungry and thirsty souls, to
be pressing for the love of Christ, when they may not be without
it. Which shews,</p>
                  <p>1. That a heart that knows Jesus Christ, will love to dwell on
the thoughts of his worth, and to present him often to it self,
as the most ravishing object, and will make use of pressing motives
and arguments, to stir up it self to seek after the intimations of his
love. 2. That the more a soul diveth in the love of Christ, it's
the more ravished with it, and presseth, yea, panteth the more
after it: It was <hi>Him</hi> before, <hi>Let him kisse me,</hi> as being some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
afraid to speak to him; it's now, <hi>Thou, Thy love,</hi> &amp;c. as
being more inflamed with love, since she began to speak, and
therefore more familiarly bold, in pressing her suit upon him.
3. The exercise of love strengthens faith; and contrarily, when
love wears out of exercise, faith dieth: These graces stand and
fall together, they are lively and languish together. 4. Where
Christ's love is seriously thought of, and felt, created consolations
will grow bare, and lose all relish; Wine, and the best of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-comforts,
will lose their savour and sweetnesse with such a
soul, when once it is seen how good he is. 5. An high esteem
of Christ, is, no ill argument in pressing for, and pursuing after his
presence; for, to these that thus love and esteem him, he will
manifest himself, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 21, 23. 6. Where there hath been
any taste of Christ's love, the soul cannot endure to want it, it
cannot enjoy it self, if it do not enjoy him; This is the cordial
that cheareth it in any condition, and maketh every bitter thing
sweet.</p>

of the former) is <hi>vers.</hi> 3. and it runs upon these
supposed and implyed grounds. 1. That there are many
precious excellencies in Christ. So that, 2. the speaking
of his Name, is as if a man would open a sweet favou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Ointment, as that woman did, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12. 3. There is no title, or
office, or qualification in Christ, but all are savoury; his very
Garments smell of <hi>Myrrhe, and Aloes, and Cassia,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Psal.</hi> 45 8.
3. It suppons that this worth and lovelinesse of Christ, ravishes
all that ever knew him (here called <hi>Virgins</hi>) with love to him:
and therefore (which is the strength of the reason) it's no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell,
would she say, I love him so servently, and desire so ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
the manifestations of his love, which I have sound so sweet.</p>
                  <p>So the <hi>vers.</hi> may be taken up in these four things. 1. Christs
furniture, he hath many savoury Ointments, and good. 2. The
further explication, and amplification of this his commendation,
expressing both what she meant by Ointments, and also the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
and freshnesse of these Ointments, which were in Christ; in
these words, <hi>thy name is as Ointment poured forth.</hi> 3. The effect
that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ollowed on these, or the attractive vertue of them, which
is such, that the most chast, who kept their affections from other
objects, are yet without prejudice to their chast nature, taken up
and ravished with that lovelinesse of Christ: <hi>Therefore</hi> (saith she)
<hi>do the Virgins love thee.</hi> 4. There is the scope, which is partly
to shew the reality of Christ's worth, which not only she, but all
Believers were in love with; partly to shew, that it was no
strange thing, to see her so taken up with him, it would be rather
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:65401:35"/>
strange if it were other-ways; seing it is not possible for any to
see and taste what Christ is, and not be ravished with his love.</p>
                  <p>Ointments are both of an adorning, and refreshing nature,
especially to the sense of smelling, <hi>Psal. 104. 15. Ointment makes
mens face to shine,</hi> and the house where it is, to savour, when it
is precious and good, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12. 3. Men in vanity use sweet Powders,
and such things as these, which can but little commend them;
But Christ's Ointments are his graces, <hi>Psal.</hi> 45. 2. wherewith he
is anointed, <hi>for opening the blind eyes, for preaching glad tidings
to the poor, to bind up the broken-hearted, to give the oyl of joy for
mourning,</hi> &amp;c. as it is, <hi>Isa.</hi> 61. 1, 2, 3. Which qualifications, are
both more delightsome and savoury in themselves, and to the
soul that is sensible of it's need of him, than any Ointments the
high Priest of old used, which were but typical of the graces and
qualifications wherewith Christ is furnished: Hence is the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14, 15. (whereby these graces are manifested) cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>a sweet savour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, these Ointments are said to be <hi>good:</hi> so are they in their
nature, and in their effects on sinners, as is clear from <hi>Isa.</hi> 61.
1, 2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And 2. they are said to <hi>savour,</hi> the sent and smell of
them, is sweet and refreshful to the spiritual senses. And
3. they are called his, (<hi>thy</hi> good Ointments:) They are his, not
only as he is God, having all-sufficiency essentially in him, but as
Mediator, having purchased eternal redemption, and having <hi>the
Spirit without measure</hi> communicat to him, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 34: and in
that respect, <hi>anointed with the oyl of gladnesse above his fellows,
Psal.</hi> 45. 7. that <hi>out of his fulnesse, we might all receive grace for
grace,</hi> Joh. 1. 14. Our graces being of that same nature, that his
are of. It's comfortable, that Christ hath many good Ointments;
that they are his own, and that he hath the right of disposing
of them, and that as Mediator, they are given unto him for that
very purpose.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Observ.</hi> 1. Grace is a cordial and savoury thing, no Ointment
is like it. 2. Christ abounds in grace, he is <hi>full of grace and truth,
Ioh.</hi> 1. 14. Hence our wants are said to be made up, <hi>according to
his riches in glory, by Iesus Christ, Phil.</hi> 4. 19. 3. They are good
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:65401:35"/>
and excellent graces and qualifications, wherewith the Mediator
is furnished; such as do exactly answer all the necessities and wants
of empty and needy sinners.</p>
                  <p>2. The commendation is explicat, or illustrat by a similitude:
The thing she explains, and which she understood by Ointments,
is his <hi>Name;</hi> The similitude whereby it is illustrate, is, <hi>Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
poured forth.</hi> Christ's Name is himself, or the knowledge
of himself, or every thing whereby himself is made known, his
Attributes, Word, Works, especially these of Redemption, his
Ordinances, Covenant, Promises, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are all his Name
(for so the Preaching of the Gospel is called the <hi>bearing of his
Name, Act.</hi> 9. 15. and making known, or <hi>declaring of his Name,
Psal. 22. 22. Heb.</hi> 2. 12. &amp;c.) This is the thing illustrat. Now
this Name is compared, not to Ointment simply, as sealed up in a
Box, but to Ointment as poured forth and diffused. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
1. the abundance of these graces is holden forth, there is no
scarcity of them in him. 2. His liberality in communicating of
them, he pours them out, as one opening a Box of Ointment,
should so diffuse and distribute it. 3. By this is set out, the
lively savourinesse of his graces; they savour not only as Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
closed up, but as Ointment diffused. In a word, there is
nothing in Christ (for whatever is in him, is comprehended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his Name) but the unfolding of it will be more refreshful,
and abundant in spiritual delights, than if men would break and
open many Boxes of costly Ointments, and pour them all out on
others.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Observ.</hi> 1. Believers are not soon satisfied in taking up, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
of Christ's worth. 2. Christ and all that is in him, is as
full of spiritual life and refreshing, as a Box that is full of the
most precious Ointment: Christ is well stored with grace, it is
<hi>poured into his lips, Psal.</hi> 45. 2. 3. This savour of Christ's graces
is not felt by every one, the Box of his Ointments is not open to
all, but only to some, and that is to them that believe; for <hi>to
them he is precious,</hi> and every thing that is in him, is most cordial
and savoury to the Believer. 4. The more Christ and his worth
be enquired into, it will savour the better, and be the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshfull
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:65401:36"/>
(for it's his Name which is this Ointment) Christ in his
excellent worth, through men's strangenesse to him, is unknown
in the world; they do not enquire into this savoury Name, but
if he were once known, they would find that in him, that would
make them give over their other unprofitable pursuits, and pant
after him.</p>
                  <p>The effect of these his Ointments (which is a proof of the
reality of this truth, and the third thing in the <hi>vers.</hi>) is in these
words, <hi>Therefore the Virgins love thee.</hi> By Virgins here, are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
bare Professors, but sincere Believers, who are not
counterfeit in their affection, nor so common in their love, as to
bestow it on any creature whorishly, but who reserve it for Christ
only: So the Church is called, 2 <hi>Cor. 11. 2. A chast Virgin;</hi>
And so these who were kept unspotted, and sealed for the Lord,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 4, 5. are called <hi>Virgins.</hi> They are here called <hi>Virgins,</hi>
in the plural number, because this denomination belongs to all
Believers, distributively, and in particular. They are said to
<hi>love</hi> Christ, that is, whatever others do, who have no spiritual
senses, and whose example is not to be regarded; yet these
(saith she) desire thee only, and delight in thee only: and this
differenceth true Virgins from others.</p>
                  <p>If it be asked, whether that be single love, which loves Christ
for his Ointments? We answer, Christ's Ointments may be
two ways considered, 1. As they make himself lovely and desirable;
so we may, and should love him, because he is a most lovely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
as being so well qualified and furnished. 2. As by these,
many benefits are communicat to us; thus we ought to love him
for his goodnesse to us, although not principally, because no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of that love is fully adequat, and comparable to that love in
him, which is the fountain, from which these benefits flow;
yet, this love is both gratitude and duty, taught by Nature, and
no mercenary thing, when it is superadded to the former. Hence
observe,</p>
                  <p>1. All have not a true esteem of Christ, though he be most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently
lovely: for, it's the Virgins only that love him. 2. There
be some that have an high esteem of him, and are much taken
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:65401:36"/>
with the savoury Ointments, and excellent qualifications where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he is furnished. 3. None can love him and other things
excessively also; they who truly love him, their love is reserved
for him, therefore they are called <hi>Virgins:</hi> It is but common
love, and scarce worth the naming, that doth not single out it's
object from all other things. 4. They who truly love him,
are the choise and waill of all the world beside; their example is
to be followed, and weight laid on their practice (in the essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
of spiritual communion) more than on the examples of Kings,
Schollars, or Wise-men: So doth she reason here from the <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins,</hi>
and passeth what others do. 5. True chast love to Christ,
is a character of a Virgin-believer, and agrees to them all, and to
none other. 6. The love that every Believer hath to Christ, is a
proof of his worth; and will be either a motive to make us love
him, or an aggravation of our neglect.</p>

                  <p>
                     <pb n="66" facs="tcp:65401:37"/>
The petition is, <hi>Draw me,</hi> a word used in the Gospel, to set
forth the efficacious work of the Spirit of God upon the heart,
ingaging the soul in a most sweet, powerful and effectual way to
Jesus Christ: <hi>None can come to me</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>except the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
draw him,</hi> Joh. 6. 44. It is used here, to set forth the Brides
desire to be brought into fellowship with Christ, by the power
of this same Spirit, that as she desires a visit from Christ, so she
desires his Spirit, that he may by his powerful operations draw
her near to him. And although a Believer be not at a total di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
with Christ, and so needs not renovation, as one in nature
doth; yet considering what a Believer may fall into, a deadnesse
of frame, as to the lively exercise of grace, and a great distance,
as to any sensible sweet communion with Jesus Christ, and that
it must be by the power of that same Spirit (without which even
these that are in Christ can do nothing) that they must be reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
and again brought to taste of the joy of his salvation (as
is clear from <hi>David's</hi> prayer, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 10. to have <hi>a clean heart
created in him,</hi> &amp;c. See <hi>vers.</hi> 12. of that <hi>Psalm.</hi>) And that there
are degrees of communion with him, and nearnesse to him, none
of which can be win at without the Spirit's drawing, more then
being made near at the first in respect of state: I say, all these
things being considered, it's clear, that this petition is very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent,
even to the Bride, and doth import these particulars:
1. A distance, or ceasing of correspondence for a time, and in
part, betwixt Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ist and her. 2. Her sense and resentment of it,
so that she cannot quietly rest in it, being much unsatisfied with
her present case. 3. An esteem of Christ and union with him, and
a desire to be near, even very near him; which is the scope of
her petition, to be drawn unto him, that she may have (as it
were) her head in his bosome. 4. A sense of self-insufficiency,
and that she had nothing of her own to help her to this nearnesse,
and so a denying of all ability for that in her self. 5. A general faith,
that Christ can do what she cannot do, and that there is help to
be gotten from him (upon whom the help of his people is laid)
for acting spiritual life, and recovering her to a condition of near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
with himself. 6. An actual putting at him (so to speak) and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:65401:37"/>
making use of him by faith, for obtaining from him, and by him,
quickening, efficacious and soul-recovering influences, which she
could not otherwise win at. 7. Diligence in Prayer, she prays
much, and cryes for help when she can do no more.</p>
                  <p>The motive whereby she presseth this petition, is, <hi>We will
run after thee:</hi> wherein we are to consider these three things,
1. What this is, to <hi>run;</hi> which is, in short, to make progresse
Christ-ward, and advance in the way of holinesse, with chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and alacrity (having her heart lifted up in the wayes of the
Lord) for, the Believers life is a race, Heaven is the prize, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
9. 24. and <hi>Philip. 3. 13, 14, &amp;c.</hi> and the graces and influences of
the Spirit, give legs, strength and vigour to the inner-man to
run, as wind doth to a ship, to cause her make way; as it's <hi>Psal.
119. 32. Then I shall run the way of thy commandments when thou
shalt inlarge my heart,</hi> which is, on the matter, the same with
<hi>drawing</hi> here. And this running is opposed to deadnesse, or
slowness in her progresse before; Now (saith she) I make no
way, but draw me, and we shall go swiftly, speedily, willingly
and chearfully. Hence we may gather,</p>
                  <p>First, That often when there is desertion as to Christ's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
there is an up-sitting in duty and the exercise of grace.
2. That bonds in duty are as observable and heavy to Believers,
as want of comfort. 3. That there is in them an high estimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and a serious desire of inlargement in duty, or of liberty to
run in the way of God's Commandments. 4. This desire is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
acceptable with Jesus Christ, and therefore is made use of as a
motive in pressing her petition before him: he takes it well,
when a Believer is like to ly by and sit up, that he look up to him,
and pray and pant for help, to set him to his feet again.</p>
                  <p>2. Consider why the person is changed, <hi>Draw me</hi> (saith she)
and <hi>we</hi> shall run: If we take the Church collectively under <hi>me,</hi>
then <hi>we,</hi> will set out the particular members: And it is this much,
do me good, or pour thy Spirit on the Church, and we shall
run in our stations who are members: It's the better with all
the members, when it's well with the Church in general. But it
would seem to look to particular Believers, the effect of drawing
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:65401:38"/>
being most proper and peculiar on them: and so it's to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
thus, If thou wilt draw me, and by the power of thy
grace worke effectually upon me, then many moe shall get advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
by it: which holds true, partly, by reason of the sympathy
that is amongst the members of that one body; partly, because a
work of grace fits, and engages one the more to be forth-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for the good of others; partly, because of the influence
which livelinesse in one, may have upon the quickning and stirring
up of others; even as often, when deadnesse begins in one, it
leaveneth and infecteth moe; so by God's blessing may livelinesse
do. This same argument is made use of by <hi>David, Psal.</hi> 91.
when he is dealing for the establishment and liberty of God's Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<hi>then</hi> (saith he) <hi>vers. 12, 13. I will teach sinners thy way, and
they shall be converted unto thee.</hi> He was not only purposed to
stir up himself, and walk tenderly in the strength he should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
but that he would lay out himself for the good of others,
and he promised himself successe therein through the grace of
God. And so <hi>Ioshua, 24. 15. I and my house will serve the Lord:</hi>
which speaks, that his serving the Lord, would have influence upon
his house. Experience doth often make out, that a lively soul
in a Congregation, or Family, will readily occasion and provoke
others, to stir and seek with them.</p>
                  <p>3. The force of the reason, in the connexion it hath with the
petition, imports, 1. That she was much in love with holinesse,
and had an ardent desire after more of it. 2. That she resolved
to improve her recepts, for the edification of others. 3. That
these designs were very acceptable to Christ. 4. That except she
were drawn, she would come short of both. 5. A chearful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging
to be forth-coming to his honour and the good of others,
and to undertake what he shall call to, and fit for; These go
well together, that when we see and are sensible, that we of our
selves, as of our selves, can do nothing, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 5. yet we may
humbly ingage, <hi>to do all things through Christ strengthning us:</hi> In a
word, I have need (would she say) to be drawn, if holinesse be
needful; and I hope, thou who respects holinesse in me and
others of thy people, will grant what I seek. Her ingaging to run,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:65401:38"/>
if he would draw, is no vain undertaking; but a humble pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
motive, holding forth some sincerity given from him, but no
ability in her self, but as he who hath given her to will, must also
work in her to do.</p>
                  <p>The third thing in the <hi>vers.</hi> is, the return or grant of this
suit; <hi>The King</hi> (saith she) <hi>hath brought me into his Chambers;</hi>
He hath indeed brought me where I was desirous to be. The
words, <hi>he hath brought me,</hi> being compared with the petition,
<hi>draw me,</hi> and the effects following, whereby she changeth from
praying to praising, and that with expressions holding forth a
kind of surprisal, do evidence this to be a real return to her
prayer, and a comfortable alteration upon, and change in her
condition.</p>
                  <p>In this answer, consider, 1. what she receives, a noble privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
she is admitted into the <hi>King's Chambers,</hi> to nearnesse
with him, which she longed-for, and now she hath it. Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
are the most intimat places of familiar fellowship, especially
with Kings, where none but Courtiers indeed come. They were
the place where the Bridegroom and the Bride rejoiced together;
and it hath a tacit opposition to a salutation by the way, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
to outer rooms, this to which she is admitted, is more,
yet is it something here-away attainable; which we conceive, is
the injoying of that love she formerly sought-for, and which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
she ingageth to remember, as having now obtained it.
In a word, she is where she would be, as the effects shew.</p>
                  <p>2. Consider who brought her into these Chambers; it's <hi>the
King,</hi> even him she prayed unto, to draw her, he hath heard her:
This <hi>King</hi> (as being the chief of all that ever bare that name) is
called the King, by way of eminency; And so, <hi>Psal.</hi> 45. 1, 2. and
<hi>Zech.</hi> 4. 9. he is not only King, and Supream as God, having the
same essential dominion with the Father, over all the Creatures;
but also, (which is here especially meant) as Mediator, he is a
King by donation, <hi>Psal.</hi> 2. 6, 7. and also by conquest, having pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased
his Kingdom with his blood, and by the power of his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Arms that are effectual upon the hearts of sinners, brings
them to subject to him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 45. 5. So he confesseth himself to
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:65401:39"/>
be a King before <hi>Pontius Pilate, Ioh.</hi> 18. 36, 37. although his
Kingdom be not of this world. It's he, who by his blood hath
made accesse for Believers to nearnesse with God, as it is, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 18.
through that new and living way, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 19, 20. so that she
may well say, he brought her in. She attributes this to him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly,
1. For his commendation, and to give him the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
due to him in this work, which would never have been
wrought without him: All nearnesse and accesse to God, all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse
in holinesse, and comfort in duties, should not only be
sought by, and from Christ; but he acknowledged for these, and
the praise of them returned to him.</p>
                  <p>2. She observes the return of her prayer, and his readinesse to
be intreated, I prayed to him to draw (saith she) and he did it
effectually; <hi>he drew me, and brought me into the Chambers.</hi> Here
we may see, 1. Christ is easily intreated, <hi>Isa. 65. 24. Before they
call, I will answer.</hi> 2. Believers should observe returns of prayer,
and blesse Christ for them. 3. She acknowledgeth he had brought
her into the Chambers, to magnifie and to commend the mercy
the more: It's the greater honour, that not only she is there,
but that the King himself (like the Prodigal's father) met her,
and took her in: Christs convoy is much worth, and sinners may
hazard forward with it, and not despair of accesse. 4. She at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
it to him, that she may keep mind of his grace, whereby
she stands and injoyes these priviledges; and that she may be
still humble under them, as having none of these from her self:
It is much, under sense and a fair gale of flowing love, to carry
even, and to be humble: And it's rare to be full of this new
Wine, and bear it well.</p>
                  <p>3. Consider the importance of the word in the Original, it is
here translated, <hi>he brought me in,</hi> as it's <hi>Chap. 2. vers.</hi> 4. but the
word in that Conjugation, in which it is used in the first Language,
signifieth, <hi>he made me</hi> come, or go in; implying, 1. A <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ort of
aversness, and inability in her self. 2. Many difficulties in the way.
3. An efficacious work overcoming all these, and effectually bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her over all, as the same word is used, <hi>Psal.</hi> 78. 71. where
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:65401:39"/>
God's bringing <hi>David</hi> from the fold to be King, over so many
difficulties, is spoken of.</p>
                  <p>The last thing in the verse is, the effect following on this her
admission, which is both exceeding great spiritual cheerfulnesse
in her self, and gladnesse of heart also in others, whereby both her
own, and their hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ts were much inlarged in duty, as she under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
(and therefore the person from <hi>me</hi> to <hi>we</hi> is changed again)
for before, (she saith) he brought <hi>me,</hi> &amp;c. but now, <hi>we will be
glad, &amp;c.</hi> The effects, by way of gratitude, are in two expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
1. <hi>We will rejoyce and be glad in thee.</hi> And 2. <hi>We will
remember thy love more then Wine:</hi> And as she took her motive,
while she desired Christ's love, from that esteem which all Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
(under the Title of Virgins) had of it; so now, having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
what she sought, she confirms her estimation of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment,
from the experience of the same Believers, under the
name of <hi>upright;</hi> that by such an universal testimony in both
assertions, she might the more confirm her saith anent the reality
of Christs worth, seing her esteem of him did flow from no delud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
sense in her, but was built on such solid reasons, as she durst
appeal to the experience of all Believers, who thought Christ well
worthy the loving: And so this is not only brought in here to
shew the nature of Believers, whose disposition inclines them na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
to love Christ, but also to shew the excellent lovelinesse of
Christ, as an object worthy to be loved, in the conviction of all
that ever knew him. The first expression holds forth a warm
change upon her affections; no sooner is she admitted into the
Chambers, but she cryeth out, <hi>O we will rejoyce and be glad in
thee.</hi> Where, 1. Ye have her exercise and frame, it's to rejoyce
and be glad; cheerfulnesse and joy, disposing the heart to praise,
are sometimes called-for as well as Prayer. If we look on this
joy as it stands here, It says, 1. There are degrees and steps in
Communion with Christ; and the Saints are sometimes admitted
to higher degrees thereof, than at other times: Sure, it is a
heartsome life to be near Christ and in his Chambers. 2. This
joy, and that nearnesse with Christ, which is the ground of it, are
both often the effect of Prayer, and follows upon it, when Faith
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:65401:40"/>
is in a lively way exercised in that duty. 3. That Faith exercised
on Christ, can make a sudden change to the better in a Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
case, <hi>Psal.</hi> 30. 6, 7, &amp;c. 4. That a Believer should observe
the changes of Christ's dispensations, the returns of their own
prayers, and be suitably affected with them, whether he delay the
answer, or give them a present return.</p>
                  <p>The 2. thing in the expression, is the object of this joy; it's
<hi>in thee,</hi> not in Corn or Wine, not in their present sense, but in
him as the Author of their present comfortable condition, and as
being himself their happinesse, even in their greatest enjoyments,
according to that word, 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 31. Let him that rejoiceth, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice
in the Lord:</hi> and this qualifies joy, and keeps it from dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerating
into carnal delight, when he that rejoiceth, rejoiceth in
the Lord; and it is a good character to try such joy with, as may
warrantably passe under that name of the joy of the Lord, and
as will have that effect with it, to strengthen us in his way,
<hi>Neh.</hi> 8. 10.</p>
                  <p>3. We may consider a twofold change of the number in the
Brides speaking; it's <hi>We,</hi> which was <hi>Me: The King brought me,</hi>
said she, but now <hi>We</hi> will rejoice. The reasons were given on
the petition; and further, we may add here, that it's to shew
her being conform in her practice to her undertaking; and to
shew that that admission of hers redounded to the good of moe,
and ought to take them up in praise with her. The other change
of the person is, from the third to the second, from <hi>He,</hi> the
King, to <hi>Thee</hi> in the second Person, (we will rejoice in <hi>Thee</hi>)
which shews a holy complacency and delight, sometimes making
her to speak of him, sometimes to him, yet so, as she loves to
have Christ both the object and subject of her discourse, and the
more he be to her, she is the more satisfied: This being another
character of spiritual joy, and exulting in Christ, it still makes
him to be the more to them, and they are still pressing under it,
to be the nearer to him.</p>
                  <p>The 2. effect is, <hi>We will remember thy love more then Wine:</hi>
What is understood by <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> as also, why the number
is changed from the singular to the plural, hath been formerly
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:65401:40"/>
cleared. The word <hi>Remember,</hi> doth import these three things,
1. A thankful acknowledgment of the favour received, and a mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it to be remembred to his praise; this remembring is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
to forgetting, <hi>Psal.</hi> 103. 2. From which we may observe
two things, 1. The acknowledgment of the mercies we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
is a necessary piece of the duty of praise; They will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
praise for a mercy, who will not acknowledge they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
it: forgetfulnesse and unbelief doth much marr praise.
2. They that pray most for any mercy, will most really praise
when it's received; and this last is a duty as well as the former,
but is not made conscience of, nor suitably performed, but by
hearts that acknowledge God's goodnesse to themselves. 2. It
imports, a recording of this experience of God's goodnesse, for
her own profit for the time to come: Thus every manifestation
of his grace, is to be kept as an experience for afterward, when
that frame may be away, and he may hide his face, whereupon
there will follow a change in the Believers frame: It's good keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the impression of his kind manifestations still upon the heart;
So the Psalmist endeavoured, <hi>Psal. 119. 93. I will never forget thy
precepts, for with them thou hast quickned me.</hi> 3. It imports, the
doing of both these with delight, <hi>we will remember thy love</hi> (saith
she) <hi>more then wine,</hi> that is, the thoughts of Christ's love doth
and shall relish more sweetly, than wine, or any comforts amongst
creatures; the very thoughts of it are, and will be so cordial
and refreshful.</p>
                  <p>The last expression, <hi>the upright love thee,</hi> is added for confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
as was said on <hi>vers.</hi> 3. and may be lookt upon, as brought
in by way of obviating an objection; who (might it be said to
the Bride) will so rejoice in Christ with thee? She answers, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the most part of the world do, yet these who have spiritual
senses, love Christ as I do. The difference betwixt this and the
former expression in the end of the third <hi>vers.</hi> is in two: 1. Though
the persons be the same, yet she gives them different styles;
There she calls them <hi>Virgins,</hi> as being chast in their love, not
joyning themselves to idols, nor going a-whoring after creatures;
here she calls them <hi>upright,</hi> as being sincere, neither dissemblers,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:65401:41"/>
nor hypocrites, but such as were really that which they appeared
to be, having a practice suitable to their profession; such was
<hi>Iob,</hi> Job 1. 1. <hi>An upright man;</hi> such was <hi>Nathanael,</hi> Joh. 1. 47.
<hi>An Israelite indeed:</hi> These have not double ends, nor double
hearts, but are straight, and may abide the touch-stone, their
practice being, their very heart turned outward. The other dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
is in the scope, formerly they were brought in, as being
desirous of Christ, as she was; here as delighted with Christ
when he is injoyed, both go together: And whoever are desirous
after him, will be delighted in him, while present, and afflicted
for, and affected with, his absence: In both she evidenceth a
suitablenesse in her frame to the generation of God's people, and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ares not from whom she differ, if she be conform to them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Observ.</hi> 1. Where there is love to Christ, there is sincerity in
practice; neither is there true love to be found in any hypocrite;
for, sincerity and love to Christ go together. 2. Sincerity is a
character of a Virgin and true Believer: If we would know who
are the <hi>Virgins</hi> spoken of, <hi>vers.</hi> 3. she tells us here, they are the
<hi>upright.</hi> 3. All who are sincere or upright, come-in in one cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory
and reckoning; they are all of the same spiritual nature or
disposition, and what may be said of one of them (as to that)
may be said of them all. 4. God reckons Believers, not by the
degree of their progresse, but by the kind and nature of their
walk, if it be sincere or not, that is, if they be straight as to their
ends, motives, and manner in duties, or not. 5. These cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
which agree in common to Believers as such, and these
cases which agree with the ordinary way of all the Saints in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
are solid, and weight may be laid upon them in concluding
our sincerity, or the goodnesse of our state; but peculiar evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences,
or singular experience would not be leaned unto in that,
as if our uprightnesse, or the goodnesse of our state could not be
made out without these, wherein possibly an hypocrite can go near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to resemble a child of God, than in that which is more ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
to Saints, as such.</p>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>In the 5. and 6. verses, we have the second piece of the Brides
first discourse, and it is the speech she hath to the Daughters of
Jerusalem: wherein, <hi>vers.</hi> 5. she gives a description of her self;
then <hi>vers.</hi> 6. applyes and clears it, for some edifying use unto
these beginners.</p>
                  <p>For clearing of this place, let us 1. see, who these Daughters of
Jerusalem are. 2. What is the scope of these words. 3. What
is their dependence upon, and connexion with the former. 4. What
is more particularly the meaning of them.</p>
                  <p>By <hi>Daughters of Ierusalem</hi> in common, are certainly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
professors, members of the Church; and so born in, and
belonging unto Jerusalem; but because there are members of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
sorts, some strong, some weak, some sound, some unsound,
some tender, some prophane; we must inquire a little further who
are meant by these Daughters of Jerusalem, they being often
mentioned in this Song.</p>
                  <p>First, We look on them as distinct from mothers children, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in the following verse, as a party different from the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:65401:42"/>
here spoken to; and so they are not to be accounted amongst
the prophane imbittered heart-enemies of Godlinesse, who yet
live in the Church: They are not the worst then of them that are
in the visible Church. 2. We take them also as distinguished
from the Virgins and upright, who loved and delighted in Christ
in the former <hi>vers.</hi> For, <hi>chap.</hi> 5. 8, 9. and 6. 1. we will find them
very ignorant of Christ, although they have some affection. In a
word, we take them to include two sorts of Professors: 1. Such
as are weak and scarcely formed, yet are docile, and respective
to outward Ordinances, and Godlinesse in the practice of it: So
their respect to the Bride, and the question propounded by them,
<hi>chap.</hi> 5. 9. doth clear. 2. They comprehend such as are formed
Believers, really honest, and who have some sound beginnings,
yet mixed with much weaknesse, ignorance and infirmity, and so
not come up the length of grown Christians; such who need milk,
and cannot indure strong meat; so their question and undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>chap.</hi> 6. 1. doth evidence; they were Daughters, while
yet they were really very ignorant of Christ, and were ready to
provoke him before he pleased, (as the often repeated charge
the Bride gives them throughout this Song imports) and they
were Daughters still, even after they were something better taught
and ingaged. We find, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 13. the Apostle speaks of three
sorts, 1. <hi>Fathers,</hi> that are grown Believers, rich in experience,
such we esteem to be understood by the Bride in this Song.
2. <hi>Young-men,</hi> who are strong, well-advanced Believers, such
were the Virgins and upright here made mention of. A 3. sort
are styled <hi>little Children,</hi> that is, some who (as it were) are yet
on the Breasts, and that in knowledge, practice, or experience,
had not come to a consistence, or to have their senses exercised to
know good or evil, as it is, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 14. such we account these
Daughters of Jerusalem, and so may comprehend under them
Professors, who stand not in the way of their own edification, though
they be weak.</p>
                  <p>2. The scope of her discourse to them, is to prevent their
stumbling at the Crosse, or being deterred from godlinesse, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of any blacknesse or spots that were to be seen in her; it
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:65401:42"/>
being a great stumbling to weak Professors, to see sufferings ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
tendernesse (especially when it is persecuted, and pursued
by professors of the same truth) as also, to see infirmities and
sinful blemishes in persons eminently Godly: Now her scope is,
for their edification, to condescend to satisfie them in both.</p>
                  <p>3. The reason why she breaks in with this discourse, upon the
back of the former (which shews the connexion) may be two-fold,
1. To remove an objection that might be made, if any
should say, What needs all this rejoicing? Are ye not both stained
with sin, and blackned with suffering? She answers by a distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
granting that in part she was black, and that was truth,
yet that blacknesse was not inconsistent with comlinesse, which she
clears, and that therefore she might in part rejoice also. The
other way that this depends on the former is, that she may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
her project of ingaging others to rejoice with her, she en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to remove these two occasions of stumbling (taken from
the failings and sufferings of the Godly) out of the way of weak
Professors, that she may get them alongst with her; and so it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
well with the scope.</p>
                  <p>4. More particularly consider the words, wherein she endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to satisfie these doubts, and ye will find these things in
them. 1. She conceds what is truth. 2. Qualifies it by a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction.
3. Illustrates it. And these three are in the 5. <hi>vers.</hi>
(4.) In <hi>vers.</hi> 6. She applyes it. And 5. more particularly explicats
it. First then (saith she) I answer, by conceding what is truth,
<hi>I am black,</hi> both with crosses and corruptions, that cannot be
denyed. 2. She qualifies her concession, though I be black, yet
I am <hi>comely,</hi> that is, I am not universally or altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovely,
mine estate is mixed, being made up of crosses and
comforts, corruptions and graces, beauty and blacknesse. 3. She
illustrates this description of her self, or her mixed condition, by
two similitudes, both tending to one thing, or one of them ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to set forth her blacknesse, the other her beauty. I am (saith
she) like <hi>the Tents of Kedar,</hi> which were blackish, and of no great
value, being, by these who lived in them, so frequently trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
in such hot countreys; this sets forth her blacknesse. The
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:65401:43"/>
2. similitude is, that she was like the <hi>Curtains of Solomon:</hi> he
built glorious dwellings, and being a rich King, no question had
rich Hangings; this sets forth her beauty: as if she would say,
ye must not judge of my worth from one side, especially my out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,
or upon one consideration, for I have in me, both to humble
and comfort me. It may be also, though these Tents of <hi>Kedar</hi>
were not outwardly beautiful, yet they were within well furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and that the Curtains of <hi>Solomon</hi> which were most rich, had
outer coverings of smaller value, as the Tabernacle had of Badgers
skins; and so the similitudes illustrate her condition, and sets
out the thing more to the life, as <hi>Kedar's</hi> Tents (saith she) look
poor and base-like, yet if ye look within, they are glorious; so
think not strange, if I appear without beauty to the eye, there
may be, yea, there is comelinesse within, if ye could discern it, for
<hi>within the Kings daughter is all glorious, Psal.</hi> 45. 13. which way
of distinguishing, is a notable piece of spiritual wisdom and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and a great mean of peace in our selves; when what is true
of our infirmities, is acknowledged, and yet the conclusion that
tentation would infer, is denyed. Here observe, 1. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of Believers, even the best of them are mixed of good
and ill, sin and grace, comfortable priviledges and sad sufferings.
2. There is a mixture of blacknesse in Believers beauty, even
in their best frame and condition, for she is now in the King's
Chamber, and yet we find her saying, <hi>I am black.</hi> 3. Believers, if they
would consider what they are rightly, they would look on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
as having contraries in them. 4. Where challenges are just and
well grounded, they should be acknowledged, and taken with. 5. It
is wisdom so to acknowledge our sin, as we may difference it from
any work of God's grace in us. 6. Believers their observing of
their sinfulnesse, should not make them deny their grace; and
their observing their grace, should not make them forget their
sinfulnesse. 7. The crosse that follows godlinesse, or the stain
and spot that is on a godly person, is sooner taken notice of by
on-lookers, than either the advantages that follow holinesse, or
the graces and spiritual beauty of holy persons; this makes it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to remove this offence. 8. When it may be edifying, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:65401:43"/>
would assert the worth and beauty of holinesse, and their
own comelinesse thereby, as well as confesse their own infirmities;
and Christian communion will require both.</p>
                  <p>Having illustrate her answer, in the 4. place she applyes it, <hi>ver.</hi> 6.
<hi>Look not on me</hi> (saith she) <hi>because I am black,</hi> seing I am come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as well as black; look not on me only as such, and think it not
strange that I am so: <hi>Looking</hi> here, implyeth indignation and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain.
And so, <hi>Look not,</hi> is here to be taken, 1. As being a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veat
agaist indignation or disdain: <hi>Look not,</hi> &amp;c. that is, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
me not, as if nothing desirable were in me; for, sin often
waiting on the affliction of God's people, obscures the beauty of
grace, and makes them to be disdained and undervalued in the
world. 2. This <hi>Look not,</hi> is a caution to disswade them from
gazing, or curious wondering at any crosse that was on her, or sin
that was in her: It should not be the object of their curiosity,
much lesse of their delight, or contentment to see it so, <hi>Obad.</hi> 12.
It's condemned in <hi>Edom,</hi> Thou should not have <hi>looked</hi> upon the
day of thy brother. Next, while she saith, <hi>Look not upon me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I am black,</hi> she doth not disswade them from looking on
her blacknesse simply, but from looking only on it, that should
not be the alone ground of their search into her condition, but
they should take notice of what good was in her, as well as what
was wrong: So then, her blacknesse, should not be the only
cause of their looking on her, it should not be their work to ask
after her crosses and infirmities, and no more; this she suppons
may afright and terrifie them; And so it's implyed here, that
on-lookers often pore more on Believers infirmities, than on
their graces; and this is the fruit which follows, they procure
a stumbling and fall to themselves.</p>
                  <p>5. In the rest of the 6. <hi>vers.</hi> she doth more fully explicate her
answer, in so far as concerned her blacknesse (for so the words run
in this 6. <hi>vers.</hi>) two wayes, 1. In setting out her sufferings in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.
2. In a more particular distribution of the kind and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of her seeming unlovelinesse. Generally, her sad condition
is expressed in these words, <hi>The Sun hath looked upon me.</hi> The
Sun in these Countreys had great heat, as we may see in <hi>Ionah</hi>
                     <pb n="80" facs="tcp:65401:44"/>
4. 8. where the beating of the Sun upon him did sore vex him;
<hi>Iacob</hi> also sayes, it burnt him in the day-time, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31. 40.
Therefore, <hi>Matth,</hi> 13. 6. and 21. the Lord expresseth persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
under the similitude of the scorching heat of the Sun. Here
the meaning is (as if she had said) it's no marvel I be black, I
have been made obnoxious to all sorts of persecution, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
can have no outward beauty, but must be in the eyes of the
world contemptible, even as one cannot endure the hot Sun-beams
and not be blackned. So there are in this expression, these
things imported, 1. Persecution. 2. Vehement persecution.
3. Visible effects following it, she is thereby made black. 4. A
continuance under it. So the Sun's looking on her, till she be
made black, imports 5. There is her patient enduring of it.
6. There is her sense of it. Yet, 7. she is not ashamed of it,
while she shews this her suffering to be no cause, why others
should stumble at her.</p>
                  <p>Afterward, she proceeds more particularly, to describe first
her sufferings, then her infirmities. She describes her sufferings,
1. In the instruments of them. 2. The cause of them. 3. The
nature of them. The actors are not heathens, but <hi>mothers chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;</hi>
the visible Church is the common mother, who hath chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
born after the flesh, as well as after the Spirit; These chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
are professors of the same truth, but really not only stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
but heart-enemies to Godlinesse and true tendernesse;
Such was <hi>Ishmael,</hi> and such are all unrenewed persons, who are
children of the flesh, and such there will be (<hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 29.) so long as
there is a Church visible: Such instruments the Apostle complains
of, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 26. that he had perils from false brethren within,
as well as from strangers without. This is not only mentioned to
shew there are such enemies, but to set out more fully the
Churches strait; she is often more bitterly, and more subtilly
persecuted by these who are called Christians, or Professors of the
Gospel, than by Heathens themselves.</p>
                  <p>2. The cause of her sufferings, as from men, is, <hi>They were
angry with me</hi> (saith she;) She had not done them any personal
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:65401:44"/>
wrong (as <hi>David</hi> often asserts of himself, in the like case) though
she was not free of sin against God; but it proceeded from
a malicious, malignant disposition of the natural men of the
World, who, as they hate Christ, so do they hate all that are his,
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 15. 18, 19. accounting them as the off-scourings of all men,
and troublers of the World continually, upon no other ground,
but because they are not such as themselves, and because
God hath chosen them out of the World. This shews both the
causlessenesse of their persecution, as also the degree of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
that it did proceed from. From which, <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. There
are no such bitter enemies unto a godly person, as a gracelesse
malignant Professor: See <hi>Isa.</hi> 66. 5. 2. No sort of persecution doth
so blacken, or obscure the beauty of an honest Believer so much,
as the foul b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>tter reproaches of malignant Professors. Yet, 3. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
are often even under that crosse. And 4. The best be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
Believer, even Christ's Bride, will not in the World eschew
it; innocency will be no guard, but to the conscience within.
And if the Bridegroom himself, while he was in the World, did
not escape it, the Bride cannot think to go free.</p>
                  <p>The nature of her sufferings is expressed thus, <hi>They made me
keeper of the Vineyards.</hi> That this implyes suffering, and no
trust put on her, the scope and her complaint makes it clear:
Beside, that it's given as the evidence of the hatred and malice
of these persecuters. This general expression then, being compared
with other Scriptures, will import these ingredients in her suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering,
which occasioned her blacknesse. 1. That her suffering
was heavy and painful; for it was a great drudgery, to be put to
keep the Vineyards; to be made keeper, was to watch both
night and day, and so no wonder she was scorched, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. 11.
The bearing burdens in the <hi>Vineyard, in the heat of the day,</hi> is
spoken of as the greatest weight, and heaviest piece of their work.
2 That her suffering was reproachful; for, the keeping of the
Vineyards: was a base and contemptible service, therefore it's
said, <hi>Ier.</hi> 52. 16. that the poor, who were not taken notice of,
were left to dresse the Vines; and it's a promise, <hi>Isai.</hi> 61. 5.
that his people should have freedom from that drudgery, and
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:65401:45"/>
strangers should be imployed in it, for them. 3. That her suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
occasioned sad distractions to her in the worship and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of God; for, in Scripture sometimes, Vine-dressing is opposed
to the worshipping of God, as a distracting, diverting exercise,
which is very afflicting to God's people: Therefore when they
have a promise of more immediate accesse to God's worship, it's
said, they shall be liberate from such diverting imployments,
<hi>Isai.</hi> 61. 5. and 6. and in stead of these, they shall get another
task, to wit, to <hi>be Priests to the Lord,</hi> and <hi>Ministers of our God,</hi>
as if these exercises were somewhat inconsistent together; and so
she opposeth her own proper duty to this, in the next words: In
a word, these malignant brethren procured her pain, shame, and
distraction from the service of God, as much as they could, and in
a great part prevailed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Observ.</hi> 1. Malice in rotten Professors against godlinesse, will
sometimes come to a great height. 2. Malice in wicked men
thinks nothing of true tendernesse, or of these who truly are so;
but esteems them, and useth them as if they were most base and
vile. 3. Often in outward things, the prophanest members of
the Church have the preeminence; and the most godly, as to
these things, are in the meanest and basest condition; so as some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
they appoint the godly as their slaves, to their work.
4. Often while wicked professors are in power, the truely godly
are under affliction.</p>
                  <p>Though this suffering was sharp, yet she resents her sinful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities
much more sadly, in the words following, <hi>But</hi> (saith
she heavily) <hi>mine own Vineyard have I not kept;</hi> and this her
sloathfulnesse and unwatchfulnesse made her black, and also pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
the blacknesse that was on her by her sufferings. This part
of the verse implyes, 1. The Brides priviledge. 2. Her duty.
3. Her sin. 4. Her sense of it. 1. Her priviledge is, she <hi>hath a
Vineyard of her own,</hi> beside these she was put to keep. The
similitude of a Vineyard here, is to be taken in another sense, than
in the former expression; Neither are we to think strange of this,
seing similitudes are to be interpret according to the different
scope of expressions, and places in which they are used. By <hi>Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard</hi>
                     <pb n="83" facs="tcp:65401:45"/>
then here, is to be understood the particular priviledges,
graces and talents of any sort, which are given of God to a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever:
these are the things she should have watched over; the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glecting
thereof, brings blackness on her, and procures heavy chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges,
called a <hi>Vineyard</hi> here; and also, <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. 13. partly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there are many several graces to be found in Believers, as
plants planted in them; partly, because these will furnish them
matter of continual exercise and labour; and partly, because what
they have, they are to improve, that there may be fruit on them,
and rent brought in to the master that intrusted them. <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.
12. 13. This Vineyard is called <hi>hers,</hi> because the special over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight
and charge of it, was comitted to her. 2. Her duty is to
keep and watch over this Vineyard, that is, to improve the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents
she hath gotten, to see that no plants be unfruitful, and
that no hurt from any cause inward or outward annoy them:
Christianity or Godlinesse is no idle task, every priviledge hath
a duty waiting on it. 3. Her sin is, that what with other diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
and what from her own unwatchfulnesse, she had neglected
the keeping of this Vineyard; so that this one task, which was
put in her hand, she had not discharged it; but lasinesse came on,
and the Vineyard was not dressed, thorns and nettles grew, and
tentations brake in, and this marred her fruitfulness: In a word, she
was no way answerable to the trust was put on her by Christ. 4 She
resents this: where these things may be taken notice of, 1. She
sees it, and observes it. 2. She acknowledges it. 3. She is sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of it, and weighted with it, as the greatest piece of her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.
It's ill to be unwatchful, for that may draw on both
fruitlessenesse and heavinesse on a Believer; but it's good to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
and be affected with it, and to be walking under the sense
of it, even in our most joyful frame, such as hers was here.</p>
                  <p>Here then, <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. Believers have a painful laborious task of
duty committed to them. 2. They may much neglect this work,
and task wherewith they are intrusted. 3. Neglect and sloth
makes the weeds to grow in their Vineyard, and the building
which they ought to keep up, to drop thorow. 4. It's not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suitable
or unprofitable for Believers, in their most refreshing
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:65401:46"/>
conditions and frames, sadly to remember their former unwatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse,
and to be suitably affected therewith. 5. Believers should
be well acquaint at home, how it stands with them as to their
own condition and state. 6. They who are best versed in their
own condition, will find most clearly the cause of all their hurt
to be in themselves; what ever is wrong in their case, themselves
have the only guilty hand in it.</p>
                  <p>If any should ask, how makes this last part of the verse for her
scope, in removing the offence before these weak beginners? I
<hi>Ans.</hi> It doth it well: for, saith she, there is no reason ye should
stumble, or be troubled because of my afflictions, they were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
cause, as to men, though I am under much sin and guilt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God: Neither scarr at godlinesse or joy in Christ, because of
my infirmities; for, these spots came from mine own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>watchfulnesse,
and not from godlinesse it self (which is
the souls special beauty) therefore take warning from my slips,
and study to prevent the bringing on of such a stain and blot
upon your profession, by security and negligence; but esteem not
the lesse, but the more of Christ his people and wayes, and the
beauty of holinesse, which is to be seen in them; because by my
unwatchfulnesse and untendernesse, I have marred this beauty in
my self, and that is the reason I look so deformed-like.</p>

                     <q>Tell me, O thou whom my soul
loveth, where thou feedest, where thou
makest thy flocks to rest at noon: for why
should I be as one that turneth aside by
the flocks of thy companions?</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>In the 7. Verse, We have the 3. part of the Brides first speech;
in which, she turneth her self from the Daughters, to the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom;
and the scope of what she speaks here is, that by apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:65401:46"/>
her self, by prayer and faith, to Christ Jesus (who is, and
whom she for comfort acknowledges to be the great and good
Shepherd of his sheep, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10. 11.) she may be guarded against the
hurtful effects of these two evils which she acknowledged in the
former verse, to wit, afflictions and sinful infirmities; In respect
of the one, she desires Christ's guiding; and in respect of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
his consolation; that so she being under his charge, may
be upheld by him, and kept from miscarrying: That this is the
scope, and so depends upon the former verse, especially the last
part of it, will be clear by comparing the last part of this verse,
and the last part of the former together. There are these three
in it. 1. The title given to Christ. 2. The petition, or thing
sought. 3. The argument, whereby it is inforced.</p>
                  <p>First, The title is a sweet and affectionat one, <hi>O thou whom my
soul loveth.</hi> In this title these things are implyed, 1. A loveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in Christ, and such a soul-affecting and ravishing lovelinesse,
as no creature-beauty hath, nor can have. 2. An ardent and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement
love in her towards him, so that she might say, her soul
loved, honoured desired, and esteemed him. 3. A dis-relishing
of all things beside Christ, as nothing; He is the only object her
soul loves, he alone hath her heart, and is in the throne as chief
in her affections, and hath no allowed co-partner there, to whom
this title may be applyed. 4. It's implyed, what title Christ will
best accept of, even that which beares out most affection to him;
there can be no greater honour, or more acceptable piece of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
put on him by a Believer, than this, to owne him and avow
him as the only object of his souls love; as the Bride doth here,
<hi>O thou whom my soul loveth!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. The thing that is here sought by the Bride, is set down in
two petitions, meetting with the two-fold strait she was in, to
wit, of crosses and infirmities; and because fear of sin weighed
her most, she begins with the suit that might guard against that,
and in the reason presseth it most. The first Petition then is,
<hi>Tell me where thou feedest,</hi> (to wit, thy flock,) for <hi>feeding,</hi> here
is to be understood actively, that is, where he feeds others; and
not passively (as in other places) where he feeds and delights
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:65401:47"/>
himself. The 2 Petition is, <hi>Tell me where thou makest thy flocks
to rest at noon;</hi> That is, make me know, where and how thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
and refreshes thy people, under scorching persecutions and
tryals: So these Petitions go upon the relation that is between
Christ and his people, of Shepherd and flock, which is frequent
in Scripture. In sum, that which she seeks, is this, Thou who
guids all thine, as a shepherd doth a flock, let me know how
thou orders thy people, and carries them through in times of
snares, and where thou refreshest them in time of trouble: These
being the two great duties of a shepherd, are well performed by
Christ. 1. It's his work to feed them, and lead them in whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
and safe pastures, <hi>Psal.</hi> 23. And, 2. to give them quiet and cool
resting-places in the time of heat, when the Sun becomes scorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and therefore prayeth she to him, Seing thou dost both
these to thine, let me know the right way of partaking of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of thy care. Which two Petitions imply, 1. That there is
a neer relation betwixt Christ and all Believers, he is the shepherd,
and they the flock. <hi>Isa. 40. 11. Ezek. 34. 11. 12. Psal.</hi> 23. 1, 2. 2. That
Christ's flock may be, yea, usually are in hazard both of sin or
straying, and also of affliction. 3. That Christ Jesus is tender of
his people, in reference to any hazard they are in of sin, or suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering;
He is the <hi>good shepherd, Ioh. 10. 11. he carries the lambs
in his bosom, Isa. 40. 11. he stands and feeds his flock, Micah</hi> 5. 4.
4. That he hath resting-places, and shaddows for refreshing and
hiding his people, in all the stormes and heats they may meet
with. 5. That Believers sometimes under straits, may not know
well how, either to rid themselves out of tentations, or to
quiet themselves under crosses, till he help them with light and
strength: they cannot know the Well, whence their supply and conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
cometh, till it be discovered, as it was to <hi>Hagar.</hi> 6. That
even then, when they know not how to be guarded against sin,
and shaddowed under suffering, Christ knows both, and hath help
in both these cases provided for them. 7. That as it's he who
must guide them in snares, and support them in sufferings; so Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
when they are at their own wits-end in respect of both,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:65401:47"/>
ought even then to look for help and direction in these
from him.</p>
                  <p>The reason presseth for his guiding, with a great weight; <hi>For, why</hi>
(saith she) <hi>should I be as one that turnes aside, after the flocks of thy
companions?</hi> In which, these things are implyed, 1. That Christ
may have companions, (not who are indeed so, but) such who
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>et themselves up equally beside him, and make it their design
to have others to follow them, but do not follow Christ them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
Thus Hereticks, false Christs, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 23, 24. lusts,
idols, or whatever is equalled or preferred to Christ, and not
subjected to him, is made, as it were, his companion: sure, the
scope shews, they were not friendly companions; but it speaks
the nature of corrupt men, who are seducers, and the sin of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
people, that the one seeks to themselves, and the other
attributes to them, too much. 2. That these companions may
have flocks, and many followers, even as our Lord Jesus hath, so
<hi>Matth. 24. 23. 2 Pet. 2. 1, &amp;c.</hi> 3. That Believers, if not by
Christs care prevented, may go astray after some of these compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
and throng on in a way of error and defection with them.
4. That Believers will be afraid of this ill, and also sensible of
their own propensnesse to it. 5. It imports an abhorrency and
indignation at that evil, of being carried away a whooring from
Christ, <hi>Why</hi> (saith she) <hi>should I be,</hi> &amp;c? 6. She accounts it a
great mercy to be kept in Christ's way, and makes it a main
piece of her prayer, that this may be granted to her as her mercy.
7. She exercises faith on Christ, and vents her requests by prayer
to him, concerning every thing she wants; be wanting what will,
she betakes her self to him for the obtaining of it. 8. Where
there is a loathnesse to go astray, or fall in snares, it will stir up
to serious wrestling with Christ to prevent it. 9. Hazard of sin
to Believers (who are sensible of their inclination to go astray)
and weaknesse to hold on in Gods way, is a great motive that
being made use of in prayer, hath much weight for obtaining di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
and an hearing from Christ; as it is a notable spur to stir
up to pray seriously, <hi>For</hi> (saith she) <hi>why should I be,</hi> &amp;c? which
speaketh forth her indignation against every wrong way, and her
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:65401:48"/>
expectation, that if any thing prevailed with him, that would;
and so we will find her successe in this suit, to follow in the next
words.</p>

                  <p>From the 8. <hi>vers.</hi> to the 12, follows Christ's expresse return
to her former suit; and because it's he that speaks, we take it
up as the second part of the Chapter. In the Brids condition
there was, 1. Crosses and afflictions. 2. Sins and infirmities.
3. Snares and hazard of new failings. Now Christ so frames his
answer, as he may meet with all her necessities most comfortably
and lovingly; and because she was most affected with the fear of
sin, he answers that first: And so he doth, 1. In order to her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
guided against snares, give a direction for her duty, <hi>vers.</hi> 8.
2. In order to her consolation under her suffering, and the sense
of her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ailings, he commends her, <hi>vers.</hi> 9, 10. 3. He gives her
a promise, in order to her further consolation, <hi>vers.</hi> 11. The
scope of all is, to comfort her; and every part of the answer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from Christ's mouth, may be effectual for that end.</p>
                  <p>In the direction, <hi>vers.</hi> 8. there is, 1. The Title he gives her.
2. The directions themselves, which are two. 3. A supposition,
or ground upon which he gives them.</p>
                  <p>First, The Title he gives her is (<hi>O thou fairest among Women</hi>)
which is much from Christ to the Bride, who immediatly before
styled her self black; Believers who are humble under the sense
of their own infirmities, are never the lesse highly esteemed by
Christ; nor are alwayes his thoughts of Believers as theirs are
of themselves; nay, by the contrary, blushing at their own defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:65401:48"/>
is a chief part of their beauty. The giving her this title,
implyes these three things, 1. A real worth in a believer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the most noble person in the world. 2. A real respect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
and esteem that Christ hath of them, which he hath of none
other. 3. Wonderful tendernesse, condescending for her conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
to intimat these his thoughts of her to her self, now when
she was otherwise sadly afflicted, and under a double distresse.</p>
                  <p>If it be asked, how these excellent titles and commendations
may be applyed to a sinful believer. <hi>Ans.</hi> These four wayes,
1. By communication and participation of the divine Nature,
they have a stamp of the Spirit of holinesse imparted to them,
whereby they resemble God, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. and none other in the
World can compare with them in this. 2. In respect of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of Christ's righteousnesse, wherewith they are adorned,
and which they have put on, which makes them very glorious
and lovely, so that they are beautiful beyond all others, thorow
his comelinesse put upon them. 3. In respect of Christ's graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
acceptation, whereby he doth esteem otherwayes of them,
than of the most royal and beautiful in the world, they find such
favour in his eyes. 4. In respect of his design, project and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase;
she is so, and to be made so in end; he will have his people
made compleatly beautiful and spotlesse, before he have done
with them, <hi>Eph. 5. 26. without spot and wrinkle:</hi> all which are pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to a believer, of whom glorious things are spoken and
written, which are applicable to none other.</p>
                  <p>The Directions are two, Would thou know, saith he, how to
be kept out of snares? Then, 1. Look how the old Worthies
walked, and follow their way. 2. Have respect to the publick
Ordinances, and hold neer them, that you may have direction
from the Word, by these to whom I have committed the trust
of dipensing the same: I have (saith he) no new light to give you,
nor any new way to heaven to shew you, nor any new means, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
or officers to send amongst you, nor yet must ye ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
immediat revelations; but walk in the light that shines to
you, by the preaching of the Word by my Ministers, who are the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:65401:49"/>
under-shepherds which I have set over you: For thus I guide all
my counsel, whom I afterward receive to glory.</p>
                  <p>The first Direction (<hi>go thy way forth by the foot-steps of the flock</hi>)
holds forth, 1. That all believers, of old and late, are of one
flock, of one common concernment, and under the care of one chief
shepherd: This is the flock spoken of, <hi>vers.</hi> 7. whereof Christ is shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd.
2. That there is but one way to heaven, for the substantials of
faith &amp; godliness, in which they that went before have walked, and
these that follow-after must walk in the same way, if ever they
think to come there. 3. That there are many in all ages, whom
God hath helped in trying times to keep in his way, and have
been carried well through all difficulties to heaven. 4. That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
would observe these beyond others, as being especially
worthy of imitation. 5. That they should, and may follow the
commendable practices of believers in former times, and not
affect singularity. 6. That it's commendable, and often safe in
times when new opinions and doctrines bear sway, to follow their
way, who we are sure went before us to Heaven, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 7.
1 <hi>Thess. 2. 14. Heb.</hi> 6. 14. This imitation of others, is to be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
with that necessary caution, in so far as the practise of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
agrees with the first pattern, Christ, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 1. In a word,
this Direction shewes there is no way, but the <hi>good old way</hi> to be
asked for, and followed in the most declining times, <hi>Ier.</hi> 6. 16.
and that we would keep the very print of their steps, studying to
be followers of <hi>their faith,</hi> who have been honourably carried
through before us.</p>
                  <p>The 2. Direction puts them to the right use and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Ministery of the Word, which he will have them to
respect; <hi>feed thy Kids beside the Shepherds tents.</hi> Shepherds
here in the plural number, are the servants of that one Shepherd,
whose own the sheep are: So Ministers are called often Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds
or Pastors, both in the Old and New Testament, 1. Because
of their relation to Christ, by whom they are intrusted to feed
his sheep; He is the Owner, they are but Shepherds, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.
2. Because of their relation to the flock, which is committed to
their care, and for which they must give an account, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17.
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:65401:49"/>
3. Because of the nature of their charge, as being assiduous, diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult,
and tenderly to be gone about; For, such is the work and
care of a shepherd, as we may see by what <hi>Iacob</hi> speaks of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
when he had the charge of <hi>Laban</hi>'s flock. <hi>Gen.</hi> 31. 40. 4. To
shew the necessity of that Ordainance. And 5. The respect people
ought to have to them, who are over them in the Lord: No
flock needs a shepherd more than a Congregation needs a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
people without labourers, being like sheep without a shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 9. 36. under a sad necessity of wandering and being
lost. Next, <hi>Shepherds tents</hi> are mentioned, with allusion to these
parts, where shepherds in the wildernesse carried tents about with
them; and so to be neer the tent, was to be neer the shepherd:
It's like they kept Lambs and Kids neerest unto their tents, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they needed more oversight than the rest of the flock, for
a lamb to be at it's liberty in a large place, was dangerous, <hi>Hos.
4. 16. By Kids,</hi> we understand young unexperienced believers
or professors, whereby it's clear, 1. That there are kids and young
ones in Christ's flock. Yea, 2. That the strongest believers, even
the Bride, have their own infirmities; and there are some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
wherein they are weak: For this direction is given to
the Bride, as a particular and experienced believer; and seing or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
weak believers are called <hi>Lambs,</hi> and unrenewed men
<hi>Goats,</hi> it may be <hi>Kids</hi> here are mentioned to point at the
relicts of sinful nature, even in believers, which is the reason why
they need still over-sight. 3. It's clear, that the office of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery,
is a standing perpetual and necessary office in the Church,
otherwise this direction would not alwayes satisfie the believers
question here proposed. 4. The strongest believers, have need and
use of a Ministery. 5. It's a great part of a Minister's charge, to
keep believers right, in snaring and seducing times, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 12,
13. &amp;c. 6. Believers would make use of publick ordinances, and
Christ's Ministers, especially in reference to snares and errours;
and they would take their directions from them, and in their
difficulties consult with them, and their counsel would be laid
weight upon. 7. Allowed dependence on a Ministery<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> is a great
mean to keep souls from errour; whereas on the contrary, when
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:65401:50"/>
no weight is laid on a ministery, unstable souls are hurried away.
8. Christ hath given no immediat or extraordinary way to be
sought unto, and made use of, even by his Bride, in her difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
but the great mean he will have her to make use of, is a
sent ministery, and therefore no other is to be expected: It's no
wonder therefore the devil (when his design is to cry down truth
and spread errour) seek to draw the Lord's people from the shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds
tents; and no wonder souls, who once do cast off respect to
their Over-seers, be hurried away with the temptations of the
times, as in experience hath often been found a truth. 9. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
should have a special eye on the weakest of the flock, their
care should be that the <hi>Kids</hi> may be next them: Our blessed
Lord doth so, when the <hi>Lambs</hi> are carried in <hi>his own bosome, Isa.</hi>
40. 11. and therefore, seing weak believers have most need of
Christ's over-sight, if they begin to slight the Ministery and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
they cannot but be a ready prey; and the devil hath
gained much of his intent when he hath once gained that. O that
men would try whose voice that is, that saith, Come aback from
the shepherds tents (when Christ sayes, Abide neer them) It's as if
a Wolf would desire the Lambs to come out from under the shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd's
eye; And lastly, when Christ gives this direction to his own
Bride, we may see he allowes none to be above ordinances in the
militant Church, it will be soon enough then, when they are
brought to heaven, and put above the reach of seducers.</p>
                  <p>The supposition is in these words, <hi>If thou know not,</hi> &amp;c. which
is not any upbraiding answer, but tendeth to insinuat the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the more; I have given you means (saith he) and so he puts
her back to the serious use of these, as he sent <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 9. to
<hi>Ananias,</hi> to have his mind made known by him: Which implyes,
1. That a believer may be in many things ignorant. 2. That
Christ pities the ignorant, and hath compassion on them who are
out of the way, or are in hazard to go out of the way, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.
3. That believers would not in praying to Christ, neglect the
ordinary means in seeking knowledge; nor in using them, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect
him: She prayes to him, and he directs her in them.
4. Directions for a believers walk, given by Christs Ministers from
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:65401:50"/>
his Word, are his own, and are accounted by him as if he did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
speak them himself. 5. Christ would have his Ministery
and Ordinances kept up in esteem &amp; request amongst his people;
Therefore, he will not be particular in giving answer to his Bride,
but sends her to them, that she might know the usefulnesse of
them, and learn to know his mind from them. 6. They cannot
expect to make great progresse in Religion, that neglects the
Ministery, seing it is to them, that Christ recomends his own
Bride; If people were inquiring at Christ, what should they do
now in a time, when temptations to error and defection abound?
no other answer were to be expected, then what he gives to his
Bride here: Yea, if <hi>Abraham</hi> were intreated to send some from
the dead, to advise people to abhor profanity and error: His an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
would be, they have <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets, they shall have
no other, and no other would prevail, if these Ordinances do not:
People would conscienciously, and thriftily use the means and
light they have; for, it's by such the Lord trains his own Bride:
and though he will admit her as a courtier to his Chamber, yet
this familiarity he admits her to, is in the use of Ordinances, and
he will have no believer above Ordinances and need of Ministers,
whiles he keeps them within the compasse of snares.</p>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>The commendation followes, <hi>vers.</hi> 9, 10, in which the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom
hath respect to two things, which afflicted her most in her
condition. 1. That she was in hazard to be a prey to every sin,
and to every enemy. 2. That she lay under many blots, and was
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:65401:51"/>
made black by her own miscarriages; Therefore the Lord, that
he might comfort her against those, is brought-in speaking thus:
Thou art neither so weak, nor so black and unbeautiful as the
world thinks thee, and as thou esteems of thy self, my testimony
of thee is better to be believed, than either the worlds, or thy
own; and I assert thee to be stately and strong, beautiful and
comely.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>Vers.</hi> 9. He sets out her statelinesse, strength and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
by a similitude taken from horses, are (saith he) <hi>Horses</hi>
stately and strong? For so in <hi>Iob</hi> is the horse described, <hi>Chap.
39. 19, 20, &amp;c.</hi> and is not a <hi>Company</hi> of them much more stately,
especially a company of <hi>Egyptian</hi> horses, which were the best in
the World? 2 <hi>Chron. 1. 17. Isa.</hi> 31. 1. And if any in <hi>Egypt</hi> were
beyond others, certainly <hi>Pharaoh</hi> the King had such in his own
<hi>Chariots.</hi> Now (saith he) if these be lovely, strong and stately,
then thou art so; For, <hi>I have compared thee</hi> to such: This ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
<hi>I have compared thee,</hi> bears out the confirmation of the
assertion; for, it's not men that thinks thee so, but I who knows
where true worth is, and who can be surety for my own assertion,
I have said thou art as strong as these, I have likened thee to
them, and made thee like them. This holds forth these things,
1. That there is an excellent courage and boldnesse, wherewith
the believer is furnished beyond others, he is bold as a <hi>Lyon,
Prov.</hi> 28. 1. both in duties and sufferings. 2. That there is in
believers an undauntednesse of spirit, and an unconquerablenesse,
that overcome they cannot be; better fight with all <hi>Pharaoh's</hi>
Chariots, than with them, <hi>Zech. 12. Rev.</hi> 12. 3. The words
hold out, that there is an infallible certainty in this truth; we
have here Christ's verdict of it, he in his reckoning counts belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
so, and he cannot be mistaken. 4. There is the cause, why
the Bride is so strong and stately, he makes her so: And so these
words, <hi>I have compared thee,</hi> may be taken efficiently, I have
made thee comparable, or made thee to be like them; and there
is an article in the Original, which may confirm this, and the
words may be turned, <hi>like my company of horses,</hi> or <hi>of my horses;</hi>
which shews that, as believers themselves <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:65401:51"/>
whatever stock of spiritual strength and courage they have, it is
his, and from him: And that they are Christ's, and made use of by
him, shews the use of their strength, <hi>Micah</hi> 4. 13. and so <hi>Zech.</hi>
10. 3. they are called <hi>my goodly horse.</hi> 5. It implyes this, that
it becomes not believers to droop, faint, or be discouraged under
diff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>culties, seing he hath past such a sentence, or given such a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
of them; It's a reflecting on him, as if it were not so with
them as he affirms, or as if he did bear false testimony concerning
them. Now this courage, strength and boldnesse which is here
attributed to believers, is to be understood of that which is
competent to them peculiarly as believers; and their successe
in all their spiritual conf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>icts, is still to be looked upon with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to the event, which is ever to be more than conquerours, in
the issue at least, what ever appears for the present.</p>
                  <p>The second part of the commendation is, <hi>Vers.</hi> 10. Wherein
her comelinesse and beautiful adorning, is set out: Though thou
think thy self black (saith he) yet, <hi>Thy cheeks are comely with
rows of Iewels,</hi> and <hi>thy neck with chains of Gold:</hi> What is meant
by <hi>neck,</hi> or <hi>cheeks,</hi> or <hi>chains,</hi> or <hi>rows of Iewels,</hi> we think not
necessary to be particularly inquired into; the allusion is to Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
who in these places, by such ornaments used to be adorned;
and possibly there is here also an allusion to the horses of great
ones, who are said to have chains of gold about their necks,
<hi>Iudg.</hi> 8. 26.</p>
                  <p>The scope and sum of the verse may be taken up in these things,
1. That though the Bride have some infirmities, yet there is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
great comelinesse and lovelinesse to be seen in her, she is
said to be comely, and that out of Christ's own mouth: Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
grace puts much real beauty upon the person that hath it.
2. That she hath moe ornaments than one, there are here <hi>Iewels</hi>
in the plural number, and <hi>chains of Gold</hi> also; one grace goes
never alone, neither is imputed righteousnesse and sanctification
ever separat; who ever hath one grace, hath all. 3. That this
beauty which is to be seen on believers is universal, as to the
subject; for, here one part of the body is adorned, as well as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
both <hi>neck</hi> and <hi>cheeks;</hi> the whole man is renewed, and the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:65401:52"/>
person is justified. 4. This comelinesse growes not of any stock
within the believer, nor is it natural to him, but it's communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat
or imparted beauty, such as is put on, a comelinesse procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
from the beneficence of another, and is the work of a cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
workman. See <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 10, 11. where similitudes, like
these in this Text, are made use of.</p>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>In the 11. <hi>Vers.</hi> for confirming of the former consolation, he
gives her a promise; the scope whereof is to obviat an objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which jealous sense might make against what he hath said:
How shall beauty be obtained, or continued? might she say, whence
shall it come, seing I am so black and loathsome? To this he
answers, as it were, by a sweet promise, <hi>We will make,</hi> &amp;c. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we may consider, 1. The thing promised, it's <hi>borders of Gold,</hi>
and <hi>studs of Silver.</hi> 2. The party promising, and undertaking the
performance of it: <hi>We will make them to thee,</hi> saith he.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Borders of Gold,</hi> and <hi>studs of Silver</hi>(it's like) have been some
special ornaments in these dayes, and that which is here pointed
at by them, in general seems to be an addition to what formerly
the Bride possessed, he would add to her beauty, and gloriously
compleat it: And certainly it must be an excellent work, which
needs such workers as are here spoken of. We take the thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised,
to comprehend the increase, continuance and perfecting
of her comelinesse and beauty; in which work the blessed Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
are ingaged: and so, the second thing is, who undertakes it,
<hi>We will make thee,</hi> saith the <hi>Bridegroom:</hi> This word <hi>make,</hi> in
the Original is used for making of man at first, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 26. As also,
for renewing of him, and begetting holinesse in him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 100.
because it's no lesse work to renew, than to creat man. The
number here is changed from the singular, <hi>I have compared,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>Vers.</hi> 9. to the plural, <hi>We will,</hi> &amp;c. As it is also in the first mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:65401:52"/>
of man, from the singular, <hi>He</hi> made Heaven and Earth, to the
plural, let <hi>Vs</hi> make man according to our Image; as if the Holy
Ghost, purposly, in mentioning this renewing-work of grace, did
allude to the first work of mans creation. And this, 1. To shew,
the excellency of it, not that God was put to any deliberation,
but that the work was, and is exceeding excellent, and there<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ore
deliberatly, as it were, gone about. 2. To shew, that man hath
no more hand in his renovation than his first creation, that is, he
is no more of himself able to bring about the one than the other.
By this <hi>We,</hi> we do not understand God speaking of himself in the
plural number, as in some languages, for honors cause, Kings do
of themselves: For, 1. If that were more honorable, then it
would have alwayes been used for Gods honour, especially at so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
times, such as when the Law was given; but we find the
contrary true from the Scripture. 2. Although that manner of
speaking be used in some other languages, yet it is never so used
in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> tongue (as, by these who understand it, is asserted;
and by some of the most Learned <hi>Iews</hi> is acknowledged) and
therefore we understand the Trinity of Persons in one God-head
to be here understood; for, this One is also Three, the Father,
Son and Spirit, having a joynt design in promoving the Salvation
of the Elect, <hi>Isa.</hi> 61. 1, 2. And grace being a work, and gift
prayed for, from them all, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 4, 5. it must be understood of
these three blessed Persons of the holy Trinity, this work being
common to the three Persons of the God-head, and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
to no other. This then makes the consolation strong; for,
saith Christ, although the perfecting of your grace be a great task,
and far above your reach, yet fear not, <hi>We,</hi> the Father, Son and
Spirit have undertaken it, and shall make it out to you.</p>
                  <p>Hence we may lea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ort
to a true believer; and therefore the promise of it is given
to the Bride for that end here. 3. That neither growth in grace,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:65401:53"/>
nor perseverance therein, is a work of the believers own work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but the omnipotency of grace is exercised here. 4. There is
plurality of persons in the one God-head; The God-head, that is
<hi>I,</hi> is also <hi>We.</hi> 5. All the persons of the blessed Trinity concur,
and are ingaged in promoving the holinesse, and in perfecting the
beauty of a believer. 6. All the graces of a believer are pieces of
the workmanship of the holy Trinity: Grace then must be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
thing. 7. The perfecting and perseverance of a believer
is infallibly sure and certain, seing all the persons of the Godhead
are ingaged in this work; and they who this day are believers,
may promise this to themselves. 8. Much of believers beauty
is yet in the promise, and in the perfecting, so that it hath it's
defects and imperfections while they are here. 9. What is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
is so sure, that it ought to be no lesse comfortable, than if it
were injoyed; for the promise ought to have no lesse weight for
that end, than the former commendation. 10. Christ allowes
his people freedom from anxiety, because of things that are to
come, and to be comforted in him against the feares of those, as
well as to draw consolation from him against any evil that is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent;
therefore is this intimat unto them. 11. Believers ought
still to hold all their injoyments and priviledges as from him, and
the expectation of what is coming, as well as the performance of
what is past. 12. Faith in the promise, hath a large comprehensive
object to rest upon, and to draw consolation from, even the power
of the Godhead, and what may be by the Father, Son and Spirit
created, and brought about for a believers good, even though
it have not at present a being; <hi>we will make thee</hi> what is wanting
and what is needful, sayes the promise; creating power is ingaged
to through his work concerning them, I <hi>creat the fruit of the lips,
Isa.</hi> 57. 19. and <hi>I will creat Ierusalem a joy,</hi> &amp;c. more cannot be
desired, and lesse the Lord allowes not.</p>

13. 14. In it, the Bride expresseth how refreshful Christ was to
her, and how she did solace her self in him: This she holds forth,
not only in the sweet and warm title she gives him; But further
in these three things, 1. She declares the comfortablenesse of the
fellowship she had with him, <hi>vers.</hi> 12. 2. By two comparisons she
illustrats it, in the beginning of the 13. and 14. <hi>vers.</hi> 3. She
sets forth the warmnesse of her own affections to him in the

                  <p>The titles she gives him are two, 1. The <hi>King,</hi> whereby his
Soveraignty and Majesty is set forth. The second is <hi>beloved</hi> or
<hi>welbeloved,</hi> a title importing much love and affection: It differs
from that title, <hi>my love,</hi> which he gave her, <hi>vers.</hi> 9. for that is a

him by the Gospel, is held forth under the similitude of a great
feast; as fellowship in glory and injoying of him there, is set out
by eating and drinking with him <hi>at his Table, Luke</hi> 22. 29, 30.
Now this is most friendly, when Christ not only furnishes a Table,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 23. 5. but he comes and sits down, and sups with them,
and admits them to sup with him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 21. It is called <hi>His</hi>
Table, because he both furnishes it, and is Master and Maker of
the feast, yea, the matter of it also.</p>
                  <p>2. The effect of this fellowship, is <hi>my spikenard sendeth forth
the smel thereof. Spikenard</hi> here signifies the graces of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
wherewith the believer is furnished out of the treasure of the
sweet spices that are in Christ: Which are compared to spike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard,
because grace is precious in it self, and savoury and pleasant
to God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 141. 2. and to others also, who have spiritual sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
To send forth the smell, is to be in lively exercise, and to
be fresh and vigorous; Grace without smell or lively exercise,
being like flowres somewhat withered that savour not, or like
unbeaten spice, that sends not forth it's savour.</p>
                  <p>3. There is the connexion of this effect (which is so comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to her) with Christs presence, as the cause: It's <hi>while he
sits, that her Spikenard sendeth forth it's smell,</hi> it's then and not
else, that her graces flow; Such influence hath his presence on
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:65401:54"/>
her, as a cool-wind hath on a garden, for making the smell thereof
to flow out, as it's <hi>chap.</hi> 4. 16.</p>
                  <p>Here <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. Christ the Bridegroom is a King. 2. It makes
all his condescending to sinners the more lovely, admirable and
comfortable, that he is so excellent; that he being such a King;
sitteth at the Table with poor believers, is much; Love in
Christ, brings his Majesty, as it were, below it self, to feed and feast
his poor people. 3. There is a way of most sweet, and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
communion to be had even with the King, in his own Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances.
4. There is a great difference betwixt an ordinance
or duty, and Christ's presence in it; These are separable. 5. It's
Christ present that makes a feast to a believer, and makes all
Gospel-ordinances and duties so refreshful. 6. Believers may, and
will observe, when Christ is at the Table, and when not: and it
will be empty to them when he is absent. 7. All the provision
wherewith believers table is furnished, and they are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>easted, is
Christ. 8. Christ should have a continued dwelling in the believer,
and they a continual conversing with him, as these who dyet or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
at one table.</p>
                  <p>The effect (namely the flowing of her graces) and it's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
with his presence, as the cause, shewes, 1. There is a
stock of grace, and Spikenard in them, with whom Christ useth
to sup, and there is no other but such admitted to his table.
2. The graces of the Spirit in believers, may be in a great part
without savour, void of lively exercise, almost dead as to it's
effects. 3. It is exceedingly refreshful to believers, to have their
graces flowing and acting. 4. Christ's presence hath much influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to make all things lively and savoury, where he sits, all
things that are beside him (as it were) blossoms and savours;
The graces of his people are then very fresh and lively. And, 5.
though grace be savoury in it self, yet in Christ's absence, that
savour will be restrained, and not sent forth; For, it's implyed,
that when the King sat not at his table, her Spikenard did not send
forth it's smell. 6. Christ's company or fellowship with him, will
not only be prized by believers, as it brings sensible comfort to
them; but also as it revives their graces, and makes them lively.</p>

2. Her satisfaction in Christ's fellowship, <hi>vers.</hi> 13. and 14. is il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrat
in two similitudes, whereby her holy fondnesse (to speak
so) on him appears. The 1. similitude is, <hi>a bundle of myrrhe.</hi>
Mirrhe was a precious and savo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ry spice, made use of in the
<hi>anointing oyle, Exod.</hi> 30. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>3. and in embalming Christ's body. A
bundle of it, signifies abundance of it, not a stalk or a grain, but
a <hi>bundle</hi> that must be of more worth, and vertue than a lesser
quantity. The 2. similitude, to the same scope, is, <hi>a cluster of
Camphire,</hi> or Cypresse; a sweet, odoriserous and precious wood
in these parts; and a cluster of it, implyes a congeries of it, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
much of it's excellency bound up together: and under these
two similitudes (because one is not enough to set forth the thing)
is understood a most precious, refreshful excellency which is to
be found in Christ, and wherewith the most desirable excellency
amongst the creatures being compared, he is much more excellent
than they all; He is more sweet and precious than a cluster, even
of that Camphire which growes in the <hi>Vineyards of</hi> En-gedi,
where it's like the most precious of that kind grew. Now these
expressions hold forth, 1. Christ's preciousnesse. 2. His efficacy
and vertue. 3. His abounding in both; the worth and vertue that
is in him, cannot be comprehended, nor told. 4. The Brides wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
in making use of such things to describe Christ; and her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
in preferring him to all other things, and in satisfying her
self in him; which is the last thing in these verses.</p>
                  <p>This respect of hers, or the warmnesse of her affection to him,
is set forth two wayes, 1. In that expression, <hi>he is unto me</hi> (which
is both in the beginning of the 13. and in the beginning of the 14.
verse) whereby is signifyed, not only Christ's worth in general,
but, 1. His savourinesse and lovelinesse to her in particular; she
speakes of him, as she her self had found him. 2. To expresse
what room she gives him in her affection, he was lovely in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and he was so to her, and in her esteem; He is (saith she)
a bundle of Myrrhe <hi>unto me,</hi> a cluster of Camphire <hi>to me:</hi> This
is further clear from that other expression, namely, <hi>he shall lye
all night</hi> (saith she) <hi>betwixt my breasts,</hi> even as one hugges and
embraces whom they love, or what they love; and keeps it in
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:65401:55"/>
their arms, and thrusts it in their bosom; so (saith she) my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
shall have my heart to rest in, and if one room be further
in, than another, there he shall be admitted. Which imports,
1. Great love to him. 2. A satisfying her spiritual senses on him.
3. Tenaciousnesse in keeping and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>etaining him, when he is got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
and great loathnesse to quit or part with him. 4. It shewes
his right seat and place of residence; The bosome and heart is
Christ's room and bed. 5. It shewes a continuance in retaining
him and entertaining him, she would do it not for a start, but
for all night. 6. A watchfulnesse in not interupting his rest, or
disquieting of him, he shall not be troubled, (saith she) but he
shall ly all night, unprovocked to depart. These are good eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of affection to Christ, and offer ground for good directions
how to walk under sensible manifestations, when he doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municat
himself.</p>

                     <q>Behold, thou art fair, my Love;
behold thou art fair, thou hast Doves
eyes.</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>These words contain a part of that excellent and comfortable
conference between Christ and the Spouse: There is here a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
commendation one of another, as if they were in a holy
contest of love, who should have the last word in expressing of
the others commendation. In the verse before, the Bride hath
been expressing her love to Christ, and he again comes in upon
the back of this, expressing his esteem of her, and that with
a behold, <hi>Behold,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>If ye look upon this verse in it self, and with it's dependence
on the former words, it will hold out these things; 1. That love-fellowship
with Christ, must be a very heartsome life, O the sweet,
mutual satisfaction that is there! 2. That Christ must be a very
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:65401:56"/>
loving and kindly husband; so have all they found him, that
have been married unto him: And therefore, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 27. He is
proposed as a pattern to all husbands, and may well be so. 3. That
our Lord Jesus thinks good sometimes to intimat his love to
believers, and to let them know what he thinks of them; and
this he doth, that the believer may be confirmed in the faith of
his love; for, this is both profitable, and also comfortable and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshful.
Lastly, from the connexion, observe, that there is no
time wherein Christ more readily manifests and intimats his love
to believers, than when their love is most warm to him. In the
former verse, she hath a room provided between her breasts for
him, and in these words our Lord comes in with a very refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
salutation to her: for, though his love go before ours in the
rise of it; yet he hath ordered it so, that the intimation of his
love to us, should be after the stirring of ours towards
him, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 21.</p>
                  <p>In the commendation that he here gives her, consider these
five particulars, 1. The title he gives her, <hi>my love.</hi> 2. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
it self, <hi>Thou art fair.</hi> 3. The note of attention pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed,
<hi>Behold.</hi> 4. The repetition of both. 5. A particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of a piece of that beauty he commends in her.</p>
                  <p>1. The title is a very kindly and sweet one; and this makes it
lovely, that therein he not only intimats, but appropriats his
love to her, allowing her to lay claim thereto as her own, <hi>my love,</hi>
saith he, and it sayes, that there can be nothing more cordial and
refreshful to believers, than Christ's intimating of his love to
them; and therefore, he chooseth this very title for that end:
The men of the world exceedingly prejudge themselves, that
they think not more of this, and study not to be acquaint
with it.</p>
                  <p>2. The commendation that he gives her, is, <hi>Thou art fair.</hi>
If it be asked, what this imports? we may look upon it these
three wayes. 1. As it imports an inherent beauty in the Bride.
2. As it looks to the cleannesse, and beauty of her state, as being
justified before God; and this she hath, as being clothed with the
righteousnesse of Christ. 3. As it holds forth Christ's loving
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:65401:56"/>
estimation of her, that though there were many spots in her; yet
he pronounces her fair (and lovely, because of his delight in her, &amp;
his purpose to make her fair) and without spot or wrinckle, or any
such thing: From all which, these three truths may be gathered.
1. That such as are Christ's, or have a title to him, are very love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
creatures, and cannot but have in them exceeding great love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse,
because there is to be found with them a work of his
grace, a new creature, and a conversation some way lavelled to the
adorning of the Gospel. 2. Christ Jesus hath a very great esteem
of his Bride, and though we cannot conceive of love in him, as it
is in us; yet the expressions used here, gives us ground to believe,
that Christ hath a great esteem of believers, how worthlesse so ever
they be in themselves. Lastly, comparing this with <hi>vers.</hi> 5. We
may see, That believers are never more beautiful in Christ's eyes,
than when their own spots are most discernable to themselves;
and oftimes when they are sharpest in censuring themselves, he is
most ready to absolve and commend them.</p>
                  <p>The third thing is, the rouzing note of attention which is prefixed;
and this is here added to the commendation of the Bride, for these
reasons, which may be as observations. 1. That he may shew the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality
of that beauty that is in believers, that it is a very real thing.
2. That he may shew the reality of the estimation, which he hath
of his Bride. 3. It imports a desire he had to make her believe,
and a difficulty that was in bringing her to believe, either the
beauty that was in her, or his estimation of her; and therefore is
this note of attention doubled. She hath her eyes so fixed on
her own blacknesse, that she hath need to be rouzed up, to take
notice both of the grace of God in her, and also of the esteem
that Christ had of her.</p>
                  <p>The particular that he commends in her, in the last part of the
words, is, <hi>Thou hast D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>ves eyes.</hi> He insists not only in the general,
but is particular in this commendation he gives her. And this
shewes, 1. Christ's particular observation not only of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
state, frame and carriage in general, but of their graces
in particular. 2. That there may be some particular grace, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
belevers may be especially eminent; even as it's in corrupt,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:65401:57"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>atural men, that ar still under the pollution and dominion of the
body of death; yet there is some one or other predominant lust
that is strongest: in some sort it is so with the believer; there
is some one thing or other, wherein grace especially vents, and
puts forth it self in exercise. <hi>Abraham</hi> is eminent for faith,
<hi>Moses</hi> for meeknesse, <hi>Iob</hi> for patience: And hence the believer
is considered sometimes under the notion of one grace, and
sometimes of another, as we may see, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 3. That our
blessed Lord Jesus hath a particular delight in the holy simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and sincerity of a believer; Or, holy simplicity and sincerity,
puts a great lovelinesse upon believers; for, by this, <hi>thou hast
Doves eyes,</hi> we conceive to be understood a holy simplicity, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating
her, in her way, from the way of the men of the world:
for, while their eyes, or affections run after other objects, hers
are taken up with Christ; for, by eyes, are set out mens affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in Scripture; So, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 22. and often in this Song, the
eyes signifie the affections, as in that expression, <hi>Thou hast ravish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me with one of thine eyes,</hi> &amp;c. the eyes being somewayes the
seat and also the doors of the affections. Now, <hi>Doves eyes</hi> set
out not only the Brides aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ction, and love to Christ, but also the
nature of her love, which is the thing here mainly commended,
as simplicity, chastity, &amp; singlenesse, for which that creature is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended,
<hi>Matth. 10. Be simple as Doves.</hi> And this is the commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the love, that true believers have to Christ, that it's chast,
single and sincere love; Singlenesse is the special thing Christ
commends in his people. It's that for which believers are so
much commended, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 46.</p>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>We come to the last part of the Chapter, in the two last
verses, in which the Bride commends Christ's beauty, and the
sweetnesse of fellowship with him: He had been commending
her, and now she hastens to get the commendation turned over
on him, <hi>Behold, thou art fair,</hi> &amp;c. And there are two things which
she here commends. 1. She commends the Bridegroom himself,
<hi>Behold, thou,</hi> &amp;c. 2. She commends fellowship with him under
the similitude of <hi>bed, house</hi> and <hi>galleries,</hi> vers. 16. 17. From the
connexion of this with the former purpose, ye may see how rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
believers are, when they meet with any commendation from
Christ, till they get it turned over to his commendation and
praise: And this is the property of a believer, to be improving
every good word they get from Christ, to his own commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that speaks it; This is the end and design why grace is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
upon believers, that it may turn in the upshot and issue
to the commendation of his grace. 2. That there is nothing
more readily warms the hearts of believers, with love, and
looses their tongues in expressions of commending Christ, than
the intimation of his love to them; this makes their tongue
as the <hi>pen of a ready writer,</hi> Psal. 45. 1.</p>
                  <p>More particularly in this commendation the Bride gives him,
ye will find these four things. 1. There is the stile she gives
him, <hi>my beloved.</hi> 2. There is the commendation given, and it's
the same with the commendation which in the former verse he
gave her. 3. The note of attention prefixed, <hi>Behold.</hi> Lastly,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:65401:58"/>
an addition to the commendation Christ gave her, while she turns
it over upon him, and which is as a qualification of Christ's beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
because one expression will not do it, she makes use of two,
<hi>thou art fair</hi> (saith she) <hi>yea pleasant:</hi> He had said she was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>air,
nay (saith she) thou art fair, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> she turnes it over to him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the same things that are commendable i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap> her, are infinitly
and much more commendable in him; that which is in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever,
being the extract of the principal which is in him, Christ
being the principal, and the graces that are in the believer but
the transumpt or copie: All these things are in Christ like the
light in the Sun, and in the believer but like the light in the Moon,
communicat to it by the Sun; and they are in Christ as in their own
element and ocean, and in the believer but like some litle stream
communicat from that infinit fountain; and it's upon this ground,
that the same commendation given by Christ to her, is tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ned
over by her to him: And it's even as much as if she had said to
him, My beloved, what is my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>airnesse? It's thou who art fair,
I am not worthy to be reckoned fair, the commendation belongs
to thee, thou art worthy of it: And this is the nature of love
in believers, to blush (in a manner) when Christ commends them,
and to cast all such commendations back again upon him, that
they may rest upon Christ, as the party who deserves them best.</p>
                  <p>From the title ye may see here, 1. Much humility in the
Bride, and also much reverence and respect to Christ, which is the
reason why she will not let the commendation lye upon her, but
puts it back upon him: Love to Christ, and estimation of him,
aimes alwayes at this, that whatever is commendable in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever,
should ultimatly resolve upon him. 2. Here is much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity,
notwithstanding of her humility, in that she calls him
<hi>my beloved,</hi> as he called her <hi>my love.</hi> Humility and reverence,
an high estimation of Christ, and confidence in him, and familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
with him go all well together in the believer; and the believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
would labour to have all these in exercise together, and
would never let one of them part from another. In a word, it
is a humble familiar way in believing, which we would aime at.
3. One special thing that makes Christ lovely to believers, and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:65401:58"/>
natively stirreth them up to commend him, is when they are
clear anent his love to them.</p>
                  <p>If it be asked, why she turnes over this commendatien to him
in the second person, <hi>Thou art,</hi> &amp;c? <hi>Ans.</hi> She doth it, 1. To
testifie her sincerity, that she was not flattering nor complement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but she durst make him witnesse of what she said. 2. To shew
that there are many spiritual con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>erences, and sweet soliloquies
between the souls of believers and Christ, wherein they are very

                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>amiliar with him, which none knowes, nor can know, but Christ
and they; for, she is speaking to him when no body knowes, and
he to her. 3. Because there are many divine experiences of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
that are scarcely communicable to any other, but Christ:
and therefore she will tell them over to him.</p>
                  <p>The commendation she puts upon him, is even the same which
he before gave her, <hi>Thou art fair</hi> (saith she) And that which she
aimes at in this, is, 1. To set forth the exceeding great beauty
that is in our Lord Jesus; which beauty is spiritually to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,

                     </gap>mely of the qualifications wherewith he is furnished,
having grace <hi>poured into his lips, Psal. 45. 2. Ioh.</hi> 1. 14. 2. The
great esteem that the believer hath of Christ, and that both for
what he is in himself, and for what he is to him: <hi>Thou art fair</hi>
in thy self (saith she) and <hi>fair</hi> to me; and it sayes, a litle glimpse
of Christ's beauty, hath an attractive efficacy upon the heart of
a believer: When Christ Jesus is seen, it puts a wonderful stamp
of love upon the hearts of his people; he hath a very amiable
aspect, that cannot but get love in the beholders, as they said
that heard him, never man spake as he speaks; so they that have seen
him, will say, never mans countenance looked like his, amongst all the
sons of men he bears the standard, and hath a lovelinesse wherein
he is beyond them all: No wonder, he being <hi>the brightnesse of
his Fathers glory,</hi> and <hi>the expresse image of his person.</hi> 3. It is to
shew, wherefrom all her beauty was derived (as was hinted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
it was from his; If I be fair (saith she) it is because thou
art fair, it's thy beauty that puts beauty upon me.</p>
                  <p>The third thing, is the <hi>Behold</hi> prefixed, and it holds out these
three. 1. The excellency and admirablenesse of the matter:
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:65401:59"/>
Christ's beauty, is a subject of a most transcendent and admirable
excellency. 2. Her seriousnesse in the expressions of his commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as having her heart at her mouth, while she speaks of it,
being so affected and taken up with it. 3. Though he needed
not, yet she needed up-stirring, her self: and there was need she
should stir up others, and therefore this word, for her own, and
others cause, is prefixed.</p>
                  <p>The last part of this commendation, is (as was said) an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to what he spoke in her commendation: <hi>yea, pleasant</hi> saith
she; This pleasantnesse, and lovelinesse doth relate to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municativenesse
of Christ's worth, his communicating of what is
lovely in him to others; It had not been enough for us, that he
had been lovely in himself as God, if he were not also lovely by
that relation that is between him and a believer in the Covenant
of grace, whereby there is not only a communicablenesse, but
also an actual communication of these things to a believer, which
may make him lovely, and beautiful before God. And this makes
Christ pleasant, that of <hi>his fulnesse we receive and grace for grace,
Ioh.</hi> 1. 16. When the believer shares of Christ's fulnesse, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but be beautiful, and Christ cannot but be pleasant. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
if we could expresse any thing of the importance of the word,
it is a most material and massy expression, of that inexpressible worth
that is in him, and likewise of a believers estimation of it; And, 1. In
the general it imports this, A difficulty in commending Christ
rightly, there cannot be words gotten for it; the thing that is
commendable in him, is so large that words, yea, the most su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlative
of them, come far short in setting him forth. 2. It sets
forth, how unsatisfied believers are with their own expressions of
that worth, which they see to be in him; they think the first
word unsuitable, and therefore they passe on to another, and in
the close, they are forced as it were to give it over, and to say,
<hi>Thou art altogether lovely.</hi> 3. It imports, that there is no kind
of thing that may commend Christ, wherein he is defective; he
hath not only the materials of beauty (so to say) but he hath
the form. All things that are in Christ, are wonderfully delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
and pleasant to look on. Lastly, this expression implyes,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:65401:59"/>
an exceeding great refreshfulnesse and contentednesse, which
Christ Jesus doth yeeld to a believer; and that exceeding great
satisfaction and delight, that a believer may have in looking on
Christ: This word <hi>pleasant,</hi> speaks their actual feeding upon the
beautiful sight they have gotten of him, so that they cannot be
withdrawn from it: Must not Christ be lovely, when his people
get eyes to see him? and must it not be a heartsome life to be
in heaven, where they behold him, who is fair and lovely, as he
is, and have their eyes fixed on him for ever, when he is so beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
even hereaway, where we see him but darkly, thorow a glasse,
and much of his beauty is vailed from our eyes?</p>
                  <p>That which followes, is the inlargement of the Brides com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
of Jesus Christ, as he is called a <hi>beloved</hi> or husband,
for she followes that Allegory in commending his <hi>bed, house,</hi> and
<hi>galleries;</hi> And this is the scope, to shew how excellent &amp; stately
a husband he was, And, 2. How happy and comfortable a life his
Bride had in communion and fellowship with him. In the words
these three are to be cleared, 1. What is commended, as <hi>bed,
house,</hi> &amp;c. 2. The several commendations given to these. 3. The
title of claim, or relation under which they are commended,
<hi>Our bed,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>That which is commended, is expressed by three words. 1. <hi>Bed</hi>
2. The <hi>beams of the house. 3. Rafters.</hi> In sum, it is this, that as
husbands (who are in good condition) have beds to solace in
with their Brides; houses to dwell in, and galleries to walk in,
for their refreshing, and have these excellently adorned accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their rank; so our blessed husband excells in these. By
bed, is understood the special means of neerest fellowship with, and
injoying of Christ; The bed being the place of rest, and of the
neerest fellowship between the Bridegroom and the Bride.</p>
                  <p>It's commendation is, that it's <hi>green:</hi> That is, 1. Refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
like the Spring. 2. Fruitful, and so the similitude of green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
is opposed to a disconsolat, barren, unfruitful condition,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 92. 12, 13. and <hi>Ier.</hi> 17. 8. So then, that which is here
pointed at, is, that neernesse with Christ, is both exceeding heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:65401:60"/>
and refreshful, and also hath much influence on believers
to keep them fresh, and make them fruitful.</p>
                  <p>The second thing commended, is <hi>the beams of the house;</hi> The
<hi>house</hi> is of a larger extent than the <hi>bed:</hi> It signifies the Church,
wherein Christ dwels with his Bride; The beames of it, are the
Ordinances, Word, Sacraments, promises of the Covenant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
whereby the house is both compacted together, and sustained;
there being no living with Christ, nor fellowship with him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
these. The commendation is, that it's of <hi>Cedar.</hi> 1. Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar
was a durable wood. 2. Excellent and precious. Chap. 3. 10.
3. It was typical of Christ, and therefore used in the ceremonial
services: So this commendation holds forth the excellent nature
of the ordinances, and promises, being of great worth, precious,
and perpetual in their use to the Church, while upon earth: But
it doth especially hold forth the eternal excellency and worth,
and the durable power and strength of Christ, the main corner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone
of this building, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 20, 22.</p>
                  <p>The third word is, <hi>rafters:</hi> It's on the margent, <hi>galleries,</hi> and
so we take it, being rendred so, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. 5. The word signifies to
run alongst: and the scope here, is to shew what pleasant walks
there are with Christ; or, how pleasant a thing it is to walk with
him, as to dwell with him, and lye, or bed with him,. So to walk
with him, must needs be pleasant: And this Metaphor (with the
rest) is here made use of, it being ordinary in this Song, under
such expressions, to hold forth the love, fellowship, that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
Christ and his Church: Now these galleries are said to be
of <hi>Fir,</hi> or <hi>Cypresse,</hi> a durable wood. This word is not else-where
in Scripture, but the scope shewes, it's some fine thing, and points
out the unspeakable satisfaction, and pleasure which is to be had
in a life of walking with him.</p>
                  <p>3. She claimes title to all these, <hi>bed, house, galleries:</hi> she
saith not <hi>thy</hi> bed, nor <hi>my</hi> bed (whereby <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. she signifies her
own carnal ease and rest) but <hi>our</hi> bed, <hi>our</hi> house, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereby
she points at somewhat which both of them had joint interest in,
and did together converse into; although her interest be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municat
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:65401:60"/>
from him; yet she keeps the manner of speech suitable
to husband and wife.</p>
                  <p>These words shew, 1. That th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>re be several degrees of fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship
with Christ, and several wayes and means, for entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it; some more neer, as when he lay betwixt her breasts;
some more mediat (when, as it were) he and she only live together
in the house, which may point at her trading with Christ in the
Ordinances, but without sensible manifestations; and also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
walking with him in their ordinary callings, even when
they are not in duties of immediat worship, which is signified by
<hi>galleries.</hi> 2. Any of these degrees and means of fellowship, are
excellent in themselves, and to be pressed and sought after by the
believer. 3. The neerest mean of fellowship with Christ, is most
refreshful to spiritual sense, the <hi>bed</hi> more than the <hi>house.</hi> 4. Yet
though it be so, believers would not divide them; but would
think much of all the means and ordinances, even as long as they
abide here. 5. There is a mutual relation betwixt Christ and
his Bride, which gives a mutual interest in, and relation to all that
is his; What ever is his, it's <hi>ours,</hi> his <hi>bed</hi> is <hi>ours,</hi> his <hi>house
ours,</hi> &amp;c. 6. Believers that can lay claim to Christ, may and should
claim interest in all that is his. 7. This makes every dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
lovely, and every step of our walk heartsome, when under every
dispensation, and in every step of our walk, we are living a life of
fellowship with Christ, to be spending all our time in lying, dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and walking with Christ, O how sweet a life were that!
8. The meanes of fellowship with Christ, in all places and times,
are so well contrived, and so large and refreshful, as they contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
exceedingly to make a believer cheerful in all duties of
worship, and in all his conversation; For we here see, there are
<hi>bed, house</hi> and <hi>galleries</hi> provided in order to her keeping com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
with Christ.</p>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>THis second Chapter contains the same scope, and runs in
the same strain, with the former. It hath two principal
parts: In the first, Christ speaks in the first two verses.
In the second, the Bride continues to the end.</p>
                  <p>Again, in these two verses, Christ doth first commend himself,
<hi>vers.</hi> 1. 2. He describes his Bride, <hi>vers.</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p>That it's he who speaks, appears thus; 1. It's clear, at first
looking upon the words, that he speaks in the 2. verse, and who
else can be thought to speak in the first? He is the <hi>I</hi> in the first
verse, who claims the Bride by this possessive particle <hi>my</hi> in the
second. 2. The words, <hi>I am the rose of Sharon,</hi> &amp;c. are stately,
becoming him alone to speak them; Like these, <hi>I am the true vine,
I am the bread of life,</hi> &amp;c. And so majestick is the commendation,
that it can agree to none other, but to him. 3. The Brids
work is to commend him, and not her self, especially with a
commendation beyond what he giveth her, <hi>vers.</hi> 2. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the first verse must be Christ's words, not hers.</p>
                  <p>The scope is, (for her instruction and comfort now in affliction,)
that he may make her know himself: The very knowing of Christ
is comfortable, and it's one of the most excellent, rare and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishing
things he can shew his Bride, to shew her himself, or to
make her know him: Neither can he choise a subject more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
in it self, or more welcome to her, to insist on, than to
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:65401:61"/>
display his own beauty, whereby she may see her blessednesse in
such a match.</p>
                  <p>In the first verse then, Christ comes-in commending himself, <hi>I
am the rose of Sharon,</hi> and <hi>the lilie of the valleys.</hi> The rose is a
sweet savouring flower, and so is the lilie: Sharon and the valleys
are added, because these roses and lilies that grew there, were
the best that were to be found. He is said to be <hi>that rose,</hi> or <hi>the
rose,</hi> and <hi>the lilie,</hi> as if there were no other, to distinguish him,
as excellent and singular from all others. He thus sets forth
himself to shew, 1. That Christ Jesus hath a most lovely savour,
and a most delightful and refreshful smell, to them that have spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
senses to discern what is in him. 2. That there is nothing
refreshful in creatures, but it is more eminently and infinitly in
him; Therefore he is called <hi>the rose</hi> and <hi>the lilie.</hi> 3. That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
excellency is in Christ, is singularly and incomparably in
him; There is no other rose, or lilie but he: and what excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
is to be found in others, doth not deserve the name, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
compared with him. 4. That he is never suitably commended,
till he be lifted up above all. 5. That none can commend Christ
to purpose, but himself; he takes it therefore on him, <hi>I am,</hi> &amp;c He
can indeed commend himself effectually, and none but he can do
it. 6. That he manifests more of his lovelinesse to these who
have gotten a begun sight and esteem of it; for, she had been
commending it formerly, and now he discovers more of it to
her. 7. That it's one of Christ's greatest favours to his Bride,
and one of the special effects of his love, to set out himself as
lovely to her, and to bear-in his lovelinesse upon her heart; and
this is the scope here.</p>
                  <p>In the second verse, he describes his Bride. Here we have
these things to consider. 1. What she is, a <hi>lilie.</hi> 2. What o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of the world beside are, called here the <hi>daughters</hi> (so men
without the Church are to the Church, and corrupt men in the
Church are to believers) that is, daughters of their mother the
world; no kindly daughters to her, they are <hi>thorns.</hi> 3. The
posture of Christ's Spouse, she is <hi>as a lilie among thorns,</hi> a strange
posture and soil, for our Lord's love and lilie to grow in.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>lilie</hi> is pleasant, savoury and harmlesse; <hi>thorns</hi> are worth,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:65401:62"/>
lesse, unpleasant and hurtful. The lilies being compared with
them, and placed amongst them, sets out both her excellency a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
them, and her sufferings from them. In general, <hi>Obs.</hi>
1. Christ drawes his own beauty and the Brides together, thereby
to shew their kindred, and sibnesse (so to speak) she is not right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
taken up, but when she is looked upon as standing by him;
and he not fully set forth, nor known without her. 2. He took
two titles to himself, and he gives one of them to the Bride,
the <hi>lilie;</hi> but with this difference, that he is <hi>the lilie,</hi> she <hi>as,</hi> or
<hi>like the lilie;</hi> Setting forth, 1. Wherein her beauty consists, It's
in likenesse to him. 2. From whom it comes, it's from him,
her being his <hi>love,</hi> makes like the lilie. 3. The neernesse of the
mysti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>al union, that is between Christ and his Bride; it is such,
that thereby they some way share names, <hi>Ier.</hi> 23. 6. and <hi>Chap.</hi>
33. 16. 3. He intermixes her beauty and crosses together, drawing
them on one table, to give her a view of both; and that for her
humbling, and also for her comfort: It's not good for believers,
to look only to the one without the other.</p>
                  <p>More particularly, <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. Christ's Bride is very lovely, and
beautiful. 2. The children of the world are natively hurtful to
her. 3. In Christ's account the believer is exceedingly preferable
to all others, of whatsoever place or qualifications in the world.
4. Christ's relation and affection, doth not alwayes keep off out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
afflictions from his own Bride. 5. It's native to believers
to have a crossed life in the world, their plantation here <hi>among
thorns</hi> speaks it. 6. That the crosses are of more kinds than one,
which believers are environed with, thorns grow on all hands
beside Christ's lilie. 7. Holinesse and innocency will not alwayes
prevent wrongs and injuries from others, <hi>thorns</hi> will wrong even
the <hi>lilie.</hi> 8. Christ observes here, how she looks in her suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and so he takes special notice, how his people carry in a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
lot. 9. It's commendable to keep clean under sufferings,
and to be lilie-like, even amongst thorns.</p>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>The second part of the Chapter may be sub-divided in two,
First, from the third verse, the Bride comes in speaking as in a
lively frame, to <hi>vers.</hi> 8. 2. From that to the end, she speaks as
being at some distance with the Bridegroom.</p>
                  <p>In the first part. 1. She commends Christ, and layes down this
commendation, as the ground of her consolation, <hi>vers.</hi> 3. 2. She
proves it by her experience, <hi>ibid.</hi> 3. Explains the way of her
coming to that experience, <hi>vers.</hi> 4. 4. She cryes out under the
sense of it, <hi>vers.</hi> 5. 5. She shewes his tender care of her in that
condition, <hi>vers.</hi> 6. And lastly, expresseth her fear, lest there
should be any change to the worse in her condition, and her
care to prevent it, <hi>vers.</hi> 7.</p>
                  <p>The dependence of the third verse upon the second, is clear:
She takes the commendation out of Christ's mouth, which he
gave her, and after that same manner almost turns it over on
him, as she had done, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 16. and then comforts her self in
him: Hath she crosses? then he hath a shadow to hide her, and
with this she setles her self, and doth not complain of her suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
Hence, <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. There is no s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>aying of the heart against af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions,
but in Christ. 2. It's better for believers to insist in
commending him, than describing their crosses.</p>
                  <p>Here there is, 1. The Brides esteem of the children of the
world, called here the <hi>sons,</hi> they are like wild barren trees, that
gives no fruit or comfort: The world is exceeding little worth, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilay
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:65401:63"/>
to these who know Christ. 2. Her esteem of Christ, he is like
the <hi>Apple-tree:</hi> There is great odds betwixt Christ and all the
world; there is ever fruit to be found on him, and a shadow in
him. This is proven by her experience (for they that have felt
and tasted how sweet he is, can speak somewhat to this) I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countered
with many difficulties, (sayes she) like scorchings of
the Sun (See on <hi>Chap. 1. vers.</hi> 5.) and could find no shelter, nor
refreshment amongst the creatures; but I resolved to make use
of Christ by faith, in reference to them (even as men do, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposing
a tree betwixt them and the heat, that they may have
a shadow) and I found refreshing and ease, by the benefits and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
that flow from Christ, and are purchased by him, and
are injoyed by vertue of an interest in him; which were very
comfortable, even as sweet apples from an apple-tree, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshful
to one sitting under it's shadow in a great heat.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. Believers may be scorched with outward and inward
heat; they may be exercised not only with sharp outward afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
but also with the sense of Gods wrath, and with the fiery
darts of Satan's temptations. 2. Christ is a compleat shadow,
and a cure for all. 3. They that would find Christ a shadow from
the heat, must make use of him, and imploy him for that end; They
<hi>must sit down,</hi> &amp;c. 4. Believers never flee to his shadow till some
heat scorch them; For, her being scorched with heat, is supposed
here, as that which made the shadow refreshful. 5. Faith in
Christ, will compose the Believer in the midst of the greatest
difficulties; It will <hi>set them down</hi> &amp;c., yea and delight them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so.
6. Much of the nature and exercise of faith, in it's use-making
of Christ, appears in it's interpesing of Christ betwixt us and
wrath, or whatever may be troublesome to us, and in the quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of our selves upon that ground; for, this is it that is meant
by <hi>sitting down under his shadow.</hi> 7. There are many choise and
excellent fruits in Christ, that flow from him to believers.
8. All the spiritual benefits and priviledges that believers enjoy,
are Christ's fruits; they are his fruits by purchase and right, and
by him communicat to believers. 9. Believers eat and feed,
and may with his blessed allowance do so upon what is his.
10. Christ's fruits are exceeding sweet, when they are eaten; they
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:65401:63"/>
are satisfyingly, and, as it were, sensibly sweet. 11. These sweet
fruits are neither eaten, nor the sweetnesse of them felt by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
till they go to Christ's shadow, and sit down delightsom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
under his righteousnesse; then they become refreshful.</p>

and his banner over me was
love.</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>She proceeds in expressing her cheerful condition, by shewing
the way of her accesse to it, <hi>vers.</hi> 4. He <hi>brought me,</hi> &amp;c. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
1. She sets out the sweetnesse of the injoyment of Christ's
sensible love, by comparing it to a feast, or <hi>house of wine.</hi> 2. She
tells who it was that brought her to it, <hi>He brought me.</hi> 3. The
manner how she was brought to it; It was by the out-letting of
his love, <hi>His banner</hi> (saith she) <hi>over me was love.</hi> The first ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
sets forth three things, 1. The great abundance of satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
and refreshing blessings, that are to be found in Christ; such
abundance of provision as useth to be laid up at a feast, or in a
banqueting-house. 2. His liberal allowance thereof to his own,
who for that end hath laid up this provision for them. 3. The
nature of the intertainment; It's a feast of the best and most cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial
things, <hi>a house of wine.</hi> The second is, <hi>He,</hi> that is, Christ
<hi>brought me in.</hi> It shewes, 1. Believers impotency to enter in
there of themselves, and their want of right, that may give them
accesse to the blessings that are laid up in Christ. 2. That it's
Christ who makes their accesse; he purchased an entry by his
death, he applyes his purchase by his Spirit, and dispenseth it by
his office, and so brings them in. 3. It suppons a freedom of
grace in the bringing them in: They are brought in by his meer
favour. 4. It contains a thankful remembrance, or acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of this deed of Christ's, and an holding of this savour of
him. The third holds forth the manner how she is brought in;
It's under a <hi>banner of love:</hi> A stately manner; it was love that
brought her in: The expression implyeth, that not only it was
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:65401:64"/>
love that moved him to bring her in, but that he did it in a loving
manner, which amplifieth and heightens his love: She comes in
marching, as it were, in triumph, having love like a banner, or
colours, adorning this march, and making way for her entry; so
that even in the manner of her being brought in, the general
predominant, visible thing (as it were) that appeared, was <hi>love.
Obs.</hi> 1. Christ will somtimes bring his people in to the sense of his
love, exceeding lovingly and kindly, even as to the manner of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging
them. 2. Believers would observe his way with them.
3. This loving manner, in the way of his dealing with his people,
doth exceedingly commend his love, and is an heightening con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of it. 4. Christ's love is in it self a most stately, and
triumphant thing. 5. It's only the love of Christ, that secures
believers in their battels and march, against their spiritual ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries;
And indeed they may fight, who have love for their
colours and banner.</p>

                     <bibl>Vers. 5.</bibl>
                     <q>Stay me with flagons, comfort me
with apples, for I am sick of love.</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>She is almost overcome with this banquet, and therefore cryes
out for help, <hi>vers.</hi> 5. Here consider, 1. The case she is in. 2. The
cure she calls for. 3. From whom she seeks it.</p>
                  <p>Her case is, That she is <hi>sick of love.</hi> This is not to be taken
for the fainting of a soul under absence, and the want of sense; all
the context before and after, and the scope will shew it's other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
with her: But it's a sicknesse from the weight and pressour
of felt inconceivable love, damishing her (as it were) and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
her, she cannot abide that sight and fulnesse which she
injoyes.</p>
                  <p>2. The cure she desires confirms this, <hi>Stay me,</hi> (saith she) or
support me, for I am like to fall under it; and <hi>comfort me,</hi> the
word is, strengthen me, or <hi>bed</hi> me, <hi>straw</hi> me with, or in apples,
let me lye down amongst them. The first expression looks to the
house of wine where she was, which suppons no want, and may be
rendred, <hi>Stay me in flagons,</hi> as seeking support in this holy fill
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:65401:64"/>
of the Spirit, whereby she was staggering. The second looks to
the Apple-tree, <hi>vers.</hi> 3. and she would ever roll her self amongst
the apples that come from this tree; and like the Disciples, <hi>Mat.</hi>
17. 4. saith (as it were) <hi>it's good to be here<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
                     </hi> she would even be
fixed and ly down in that posture, never to part with this happy
condition again.</p>
                  <p>3. These she speaks to, and from whom she seeks help, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
in the plural-number (as is clear in the Original) which
shews a ravishment and kind of rapture in this exclamation; not
observing to whom she speaks, but expressing her delight in that
which she enjoyed, yet mainly intending Christ (as the Disciples
did, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17. not knowing what they said) for it's he who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes
the cure in the next verse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. Love will have a great out-letting at sometimes beyond
others as if a dam were gathered, and then letten out. 2. Sense
of love in a high degree will straiten and weight a believer, as
overburthening and overpowring him, so as he is put to say, hold,
and <hi>wo's me,</hi> as it is, <hi>Isa.</hi> 6 5. the nature of Gods presence is
such, and our infirmity so unsuitable thereto. 3. Love is lovely
when the believer is almost dotting with it, and staggering under
the weight and power of it. 4. It can cure even the same sickness
it makes, These <hi>flagons</hi> and <hi>apples</hi> are the only remedy, though
our bottles be now weak, and can hold but little of this new wine.</p>

a most loving Husband, he sustains he in his arms, in this swoun
and swarf, which from joy she fals in, as the words do plainly bear.
<hi>Obs.</hi> 1. Christ's love is a sensible sustaining thing, and is able to
support the heart under it's greatest weakness. 2. As Christ is ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of all his people, and at all times, so especially when they are in
their fits of love-sickness. 3. As believers would observe Christ's
love at all times, so especially when they are weakest; for then
they will find it both seasonable and profitable so to do.</p>

                     <q>I charge you, O ye Daughters of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem;
by the Roes, and by the Hindes
of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake
my Love, till he please.</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>This verse contains her care to entertain this condition, and the
way she takes for that end. That they are the Brides words, is,
1. clear from the scope and matter. 2. From the expressions she
useth, speaking of him, <hi>my Love,</hi> and <hi>till he please;</hi> for, it becomes
us to give Christ his own liberty in staying or going, and it were
not our good that our pleasure were the rule in our fellowship
with him. Now in order to the securing of this comfortable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
to her self; first, she adjures and charges, which is, 1. To
shew the concernment of the thing. 2. Her seriousness in it; for,
she is in very great earnest. 3. A fear of misguiding this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
4. A difficulty so to prevent the hazard, as to keep all quiet.</p>
                  <p>2. The parties she speaks to, while she thus adjures, are the
<hi>Daughters of Ierusalem,</hi> giving them the lesson she would take to
her self, because they had need to be thus guarded. <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. That
professors are in hazard to marr their own enjoyments, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt
an intimate fellowship with Christ. 2. Beginners are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diest
to fall in this sin. 3. Seriousnesse will stir up believers to be
watchful over themselves, and will make them presse others to be
so also.</p>
                  <p>This expression, <hi>by the Roes and Hindes of the field,</hi> is but added,
for keeping the strain of this Song (which is composed in an Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorick
way, and every similitude is not to be narrowly searched in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to)
and to shew how tenderly they ought to watch, to prevent
this hazard, as men having to do with <hi>Roes<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
                     </hi> who are soon stirred;
Shewing that a little thing may stir up Christ, and marr the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
fellowship that is between him and his people.</p>
                  <p>3. The charge it self is, That <hi>they stir not up, nor awake the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved;</hi>
as a wife would say (when her husband is come home and
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:65401:65"/>
resting in her arms) be quiet all, and let no din be in the house
to awake him: And this charge reaches her self, as well as others;
when she as the mother, commands all the little-ones or children
(as it were) to be quiet, that Christ may not be stirred up, and
made to remove; she ought to be much more careful in this her
self. Hence, <hi>Observe,</hi> 1. If a sensible presence be not tenderly
entertained, it will not last. 2. Believers would be most carefull
then, when they are admitted to near and sensible fellowship with
Christ, that nothing fall out which may provoke him to depart.
3. The least sinful motions, and stirrings of corruption would be
suppressed, as having a great tendency to provoke and stir up the
Beloved to be gone.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, This charge is qualified in these words, <hi>till he please:</hi>
Which does not imply, that she gives them leave at any time to
stir him up; but the meaning is, see that by your fault he be not
awaked, till his own time come. Observe then, 1. Christ guids
his visits and love-manifestations, by his soveralignty and <hi>pleasure.</hi>
2. He may withdraw from his people without respect to any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
provocation, as having sinful influence thereupon. 3. Christ's
pleasure is believers rule, in the things that are most precious to
them: Here she acquiesces, even to his withdrawing, when he shall
<hi>please.</hi> 4. Believers may have peace, and be quiet under absence,
if they have not sinfully provoked Christ to withdraw: For, this
is the thing the Bride aims at, as to her self, in this her care.
5. Often believers are guilty in marring Christ's fellowship with
them before he please, and they might enjoy Christ's company much
longer oftentimes, if they did not sin him out of house and
doors.</p>

                     <q>My Beloved is like a Roe, or a
young Hart: Behold, he standeth behind
our wall, he looketh forth at the windows,
shewing himself through the lattesse.</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>These words contain a case of the Brides, different from her
case in the former words; there she was in Christ's arms; here she
sees him afar off; there she was endeavouring to keep him still;
here she is sensible that he is away, and, <hi>vers. ult.</hi> is praying for his
return. Observe then from the connexion, The most satisfying
and comfortable conditions of a believer, while upon earth, are
not abiding; even the Bride must experience distance, as well as
presence. 2. Sometimes sensible presence will not continue, even
when believers are most careful to retain it, as we find she was in
the words before.</p>
                  <p>Her distance hath two steps, 1. There are some views of Christ,
and some intercourse with him, though afar off, in this Chapter:
Then, 2. she is deprived even of that, in the first part of the
Chapter following: And readily distance once begun, doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from a lesser to a greater degree, before it be removed.</p>
                  <p>More particularly, we would observe here, 1. What is Christ's
carriage, when the Bride doth not enjoy sensible presence in so
lively a way; and that in two things, 1. What he is doing; he is
<hi>co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>ing, leaping, standing behind the wall, looking thorow the lattess,</hi> &amp;c.
2. What he is saying, <hi>he is speaking</hi> to her, and, as it were, writing
kind love-letters to her at that same time: Christ is both doing
and speaking kindly to a believer, even when he is away to sense,
if it be well discerned. 2. We may see what is the Brides carriage
suitable to his, in four steps (worthy to be imitate by believers, for
their own peace, in their disconsolate condition) 1. She observes
what he doth, though it be but a twilight discovery she hath of
him. 2. She records what he saith, and reads his Epistle often
over. 3. She comforts her self in keeping the faith of her interest,
and the hope of future enjoying of him, clear. And, 4. prayes in
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:65401:66" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the mean time, for some manifestations of his love, till that come.
The first is, <hi>vers.</hi> 8. and 9. The second, <hi>vers.</hi> 10. to 16. The third
<hi>vers.</hi> 16. and 17. The fourth in the close of the 17. <hi>vers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In her observation of Christ's way with her, <hi>vers.</hi> 8. Consider,
1. his practice, which she observes. 2. Her observation of it.
3. How she is affected with it. And lastly, her expression of it.</p>
                  <p>The first of these is contained in these words, <hi>He cometh leaping
upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills.</hi> There are four things
here to be taken notice of, 1. A supposed distance, for when he is
said to be coming, he is not present: This distance is not in reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as to the union that is betwixt Christ and a Believer, that is
alway the same; but it is to be understood as to the sense of his
presence, which may be interrupted. 2. It's said <hi>he cometh;</hi> Coming
imports his drawing near to remove the distance, as being already
on his way. <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. It's his coming that removes the distance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
him and his people: The first motion of love is still on his
side. And, 2. even when Christ is absent, if he were well seen,
he is making way for our nearer union with him, and is upon
his way coming again, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 3. Even when he is away he is still
coming, though it may be afterward the distance seem to grow
greater, and the night of absence darker. The third thing is,
That there are mountains which he comes over, that is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
standing betwixt him and us, marring our accesse to him,
and his familiarity with us, till he remove it, as mountains ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
mens way in travel; and so difficulties in the way of
Gods work are compared to mountains, <hi>Zech. 4. 7. Who art
thou, O great mountain?</hi> &amp;c. So here, as there are difficulties
to be removed, before the union betwixt Christ and us
be made up.</p>
                  <p>So also there are particular sins, clouds of guiltinesse, which must
be removed, ere his presence can be restored after he goeth away.
Again, coming over mountains, maketh one conspicuous
and glorious afar off; So Christ's march and return to a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever
is ever in triumph, over some great ground of distance,
which makes him discernably glorous. 4<hi rend="sup">ly.</hi> Christ is said to be
<hi>leaping</hi> and <hi>skipping:</hi> which imports, 1. an agility in him, and a
facility to overcome whatever is in the way. 2. A chearfulness and
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:65401:67"/>
heartiness in doing of it; He comes with delight over the highest
Hill that is in his way, when he returns to his people. 3. It holds
forth speedinesse, Christ comes quickly, and he is never behind his
time, he cannot mistryst a believer; his term-day is their necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and be sure he will meet with them then. 4. It imports a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Majesty and statelinesse in his coming, as one in triumph; and so
he comes triumphantly and in great state; And what is more
stately than Christs triumphing over principalities and powers,
and making a shew of them openly, by overcoming the difficulties
in his way to his Bride.</p>
                  <p>The second thing in the Verse, is her observation of this; Christ
in his way is very discernable to any that is watchful, and Believers
should observe his way when absent, as well as present. If it be
asked how she discerned it? There is no question, faith is here ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
up Christ according to his promise, <hi>Ioh. 14. 3. If I go away, I
come again;</hi> and faith lays hold on this: Faith is a good friend in
desertion, for as we may here see, it speaks good of Christ even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
his back, when sense would say he will return no more, faith
sayes he is coming, and prophesies good of Christ, as there is good
reason.</p>
                  <p>The third thing is, how she is affected with it; This observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
proves very comfortable to her, as her abrupt and cutted ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
imports, <hi>The voice of my Beloved:</hi> As also, the <hi>Behold,</hi> she
puts to it, which shews, 1. That her heart was much affected with
it. 2. That she thought much of it. 3. That it was some way
wonderful that Christ was coming, even over all these difficulties
to her; there is no such ravishing wonder to a sensible believing
sinner, as this, that Christ will passe by all its sin, yea take them all
on himself, and come over all difficulties<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> unto them; Therefore
is this <hi>behold,</hi> added here.</p>
                  <p>The fourth thing in her expression of this, which confirms the
former, and it is such as sets out a heart, as it were surprized, and
overcome with the sight of a coming friend. Hence <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. A sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
thoughts of a coming Christ, will be deeply affecting; and
these thoughts of him are mis-shapen and of no worth, that do not
in some measure cast fire into, and inflame the affection<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> And, 2. a
heart suitably affected with the power of Christs wonderful grace
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:65401:67"/>
and love, will be expressing somewhat of it to others, as the Bride
is doing here.</p>
                  <p>In the 9. <hi>vers.</hi> the observation of his carriage is continued:
where, 1. He is commended. 2. His carriage is described, with her
observation of it. The commendation she gives him is, <hi>He is like
a Roe, or a young Hart:</hi> These creatures are famous, for loving
and kindly carriage to their mates, as also for lovelinesse and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santnesse
in themselves, <hi>Prov.</hi> 5. 19. Thus he is kindly and loving:
O so kind as Christ is to his Church and chosen! <hi>Ionathan's</hi> love
to <hi>David</hi> past the love of Women, but this surpasseth that, beyond
all degrees of comparison. 2. He is timous and seasonable, in ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling
his purposes of love to his Bride, no Roe or Hart for swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
is like him in this; and this may be the ground, from which
she concludeth that he was coming and leaping in the former
words, because Christ's affections, and way of manifesting them, is
such as this.</p>
                  <p>2. His carriage is set forth in three steps, held forth in allegorick
expressions. The 1. is, <hi>He stands behind our wall,</hi> that is, as a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Husband may withdraw from the sight of his Spouse for a
time, and yet not be far away, but behind a wall, and there standing
to see what will be her carriage, and to be ready to return; or as
Nurses will do with their little children, to make them seek after
them; so sayes she, though Christ now be out of sight, yet he is
not far off, but, as it were, behind the wall; and its called <hi>our</hi> wall,
in reference to some other she speaks with, of him; And a <hi>wall,</hi>
because often we build up these separations our selves, betwixt
him and us (<hi>Isa.</hi> 59. 1.) that hides Christ, as a wall hides one man
from another; yet even then Christ goes not away, but waits to
be gracious, as weary with forbearing: There is much love on
Christs side, in saddest desertions, and our hand is often deep in his
withdrawings: It's sad when the wall that hides him, is of our buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding:
There is often nothing betwixt him and us, but our own sin.</p>
                  <p>The 2. step is, <hi>He looketh forth at the window;</hi> which is to the
same purpose. The meaning is, though I get not a full sight of
him, yet he opens, as it were, a window, and looks out, and I get some
little glance of his face: Sometimes Christ will neither (as it were)
let the Believer in to him, nor will he come out to them; yet he
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:65401:68"/>
will make windows, as it were, in the wall, and give blinks of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
unto them.</p>
                  <p>The third step is, <hi>He shews himself through the Lattess;</hi> that is, as
there are some Windows that have Tirlesses of Lattesses on them,
by which men will see clearly, and yet be but in a little measure
seen; so, sayes she, Christ is beholding us, though we cannot take
him up fully; yet the smallest bore whereby Christ manifests him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
is much, and to be acknowledged. All this she observes with a
<hi>Behold,</hi> as discerning something wonderful in all these steps: Christ
hath several wayes of communicating his love to his people (and
that also even under desertions and withdrawings) and there are
several degrees of these, yet the least of them is wonderful, and
should be welcomed by believers, if it were to see him, but through
the Lattess.</p>

                  <p>Having put by her observation of his carriage, she comes to speak
to the second part, namely what was her carriage; and it was to
read over, or think over with her self, or to tell over to others,
what Christ had said unto her: This is a main piece of spiritual
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:65401:68"/>
wisdom, to fill Christs room in his absence with his word and
call, and to read his mind only from these, the best interpreters
of it. These words prefaced to Christ's Epistle or Sermon, <hi>my
beloved spake, and said unto me,</hi> are not idly set down, before she
tell what the words which he spake were, But, 1. It shews she
delights in repeating his Name, for she had made mention of it
before, <hi>vers.</hi> 8. 2. It shews what commended Christ's epistle or
words to her, it was not only the matter therein contained
(though that was warm and sweet) but it's come (saith she)
from my beloved, it was he that said this, it was he that sent me
this word. 3. It shews her discerning of his voice; and her as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance,
that the word, call, and promise (she was refreshing her
self with) was his word, and no devised fable. It's a notable
ground of consolation in Christ's absence to believers, when they
are clear, that such and such gracious words come out of Christ's
own mouth to them. 4. It sayes, that fellowship with Christ, is
no dumb exercise; these that are admitted to fellowship with
him, he will be speaking with them, otherwise then with the
world. And, 5. That a believer hath an ear to hear, not only
what the Minister saith, but also what Christ saith. 6. It's the
word as from Christ's own mouth, that hath any effectual im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression;
and a believer will receive it as such, that it may leave
such an impression upon his heart. 7. When Christ quickens a
word, it will be sweet; and such a word will be retained, so that
these who have been quickned by it, will be able long afterward
to repeat it: It's our getting little good of the word of the
Lord, that makes us retain it so ill. 8. It affords much satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
to a believer, when he can say, Christ <hi>said</hi> this, or that to
me, and that it's no delusion. 9. What Christ sayes unto the
spirits of his own, in communion with them, it may bide the light,
and is, on the matter, that same which he sayes in the Word and
Gospel, as we will see in the following discourse, which for this
end, and for the edification of others, and honour of the Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
she tells over.</p>
                  <p>We may take these words, or epistles of Christ's, as directed
to three sorts (as the duty here pressed, <hi>rise and come away</hi> will
bear,) 1. To these that are dead in sins, whom Christ by his
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:65401:69"/>
voice quickens, and makes to rise, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 28. Although this
be not the immediat intent of it, as it's spoken to a believer;
yet considering the scope of recording this, and the matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in it, it may well be thought useful to ingage these who
are yet strangers to Christ, there being still but the same way of
making at the first, and afterward recovering nearnesse with him,
to wit, by faith in him; and so it will presse receiving of, and clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
with Christ. 2. We may consider it as spoken to believers,
but to such as sleep, or are sitten up; so it presseth quickening:
And, 3. As spoken to believers in a disconsolat, discouraged con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;
so it's scope is to stir, quicken, rouse and comfort Christs
Bride, in any of these two last cases, that he may bring her in to
more nearnesse of fellowship with himself, and to more boldnesse
in the use-making of him; which is the great scope he aimes at.</p>
                  <p>There are three parts of this Sermon or Epistle. 1. There is
a kindly invitation, that mainly respects the pressing of faith, from
<hi>vers.</hi> 10. to 14. 2. There is a loving direction or two, <hi>vers.</hi> 14.
looking especially to the practise of duties. 3. Least any thing
should be wanting, he gives a direction concerning the troublers
of her peace, <hi>vers.</hi> 15.</p>
                  <p>In all these parts, there are four things common to be found
in each of them, 1. Some sadnesse in her condition supposed.
2. Some directions given to cure it. 3. Some motives used, to
presse the practise of these directions. 4. Some repetitions, to
shew his seriousnesse in all, and the concernment of the thing
spoken.</p>
                  <p>The case wherein these who are here spoken to, are suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to be, in this first part of Christ's Sermon, <hi>vers.</hi> 10, &amp;c. is,
1. Deadnesse, total or partial: Believers may be under a decay,
and be in part dead. 2. It is supposed that they are secure, and
not vigorous; but insensible in a great part of that ill. 3. That
they are disconsolat, and heartlesse under distance and deadnesse;
which ills often tryst together.</p>
                  <p>The direction he gives in order to the helping of this, is in
two words, 1. <hi>Rise. 2. Come away.</hi> Which sayes, that as she
was now in a case of strangenesse to Christ, so there was a necessity
of rousing her self, and coming out of it; such a necessity as there
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:65401:69"/>
is for a straying wife to return to her husband. Now these words
are a sweet call of a kind Husband, inviting to this return, and
shewing the remedy of straying, and estrangement from him. <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi>
imports, 1. One that is setled some way, in a condition op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
to walking and running. 2. A stirring up of themselves as
unsatisfied therewith, and desirous to be out of it, with some en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to be up again: Declining from Christ puts souls still
down, and holds them at under. <hi>Come away,</hi> holds forth a term
from which she is to come, from that condition she was in,
whatever it was, it was not good: Men are in no desirable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
when Christ calls them. 2. A term to which she is to
come, and that is Christ; it's to follow the Bridegroom; to
get her brought to a nearer union and communion with
him, is the great thing he aimes at. 3. An act whereby
she passeth from that she was, and turning her back on that,
moves towards him, that she may thereby attain nearer union and
fellowship with him. By both which, we conceive the exercise of
faith in him, is mainly holden forth, 1. Because, saith is ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
in Scripture set forth by coming, <hi>Isa. 55. 1. Ioh. 5. 40. Ioh.</hi>
6. 35. and this expression suits well the act of saith. 2. Because
it's the only mean of making up the distance betwixt him and us:
Decay in the exercise of faith, and distance with Christ, go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and the exercise of faith, and nearnesse with him, are also
inseparable companions. This is the meaning then, why lyes thou
in this discouraged, decayed and comfortlesse condition? there is
another, and a far better, to wit, a lively and comfortable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
allowed upon thee; Christ calls thee to exercise faith in
him, for recovering of thy case. And this now is set down im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratively,
by way of command, that we may know that believing
in Christ, or keeping communion with him by faith, are not left
to our option, but are laid on by a peremptory command, for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitating
us to the exercise of it, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 23. as a thing most
acceptable to him, with which he cannot be angry, nor will he call
obedience thereunto presumption.</p>
                  <p>3. When he hath given the invitation, he presseth it most se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
and weightily; for though it be of our concernment, we
are not easily induced even to believe: O but the world is much
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:65401:70"/>
mistaken in this, that think it an easy matter to believe! And also,
he would have us knowing, he allows us the comfortable exercise of
faith in him, with all his heart (if we may speak so) when he thus
presseth and perswadeth us to it. Likewise we may gather, that it is
no common thing, which he exhorts unto, when he doth so seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
presse it; but it is of most weighty concernment to us.</p>
                  <p>There are three wayes he maketh use of, to presse it; 1. By
excellent, loving titles, <hi>my love, and fair one;</hi> which are given
here, especially to let her know he loved her, and thereby to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
her to follow the call. The faith of his love, hath no little
influence upon our acting faith in particulars on him. 2. To shew
that he is no rigid, nor severe censurer of a discouraged believer;
no, <hi>my fair one</hi> (saith he) even when she hath many spots; Christ
will raise no ill report on his own, whatever be their failings.
3. He presseth it from the special relation he hath to her, <hi>my love,</hi>
and <hi>my fair one;</hi> which makes all his words very kindly, and
shewes an obligation on her, by the Covenant-relation that stood
between them to be his, and to subject her self to his directions,
according to that word, <hi>Psal. 45. 10. Hearken O Daugher,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>Forget thy fathers house,</hi> &amp;c. And therefore she ought to leave
all, and cleave to him: Christ requires nothing from us, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Covenant, that tyes us to communion or co-habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
(to speak so) with Christ; and it's a most binding obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
if this prevail not in pressing us to duty, that we are Christ's,
nothing will prevail: It's no little practick in a believer, to be
like the relation they stand in to Christ; what, my love (saith
he) becomes it you to be so strange? <hi>Rise</hi> and <hi>come,</hi> &amp;c. Some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing is allowed to you than to others, and some other thing
is called for from you, than is to be found in the way of others.</p>
                  <p>The third way he insisteth to urge this (for the call, and kindness
comes still on his side, even when we are in the fault) is by most
pressing arguments of three sorts. The first is, <hi>vers. 11. Rise</hi> (saith
he) <hi>and come away;</hi> for there is no hazard now to travel this jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
because what might scar you is done away, the <hi>winter</hi>-cold
and storm in past; and the <hi>rain</hi> that makes rivers unpassible, and
journeys dangerous and wearysome (therefore, it's <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 20.
<hi>pray that your flight be not in the winter</hi>) these are over. This
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:65401:70"/>
suppons, 1. There was a sharp winter, and a bitter rain (as it
were) whereby the way of fellowship with God, was unpassible,
till these were removed; the sword (as it were) standing to keep
sinners from Paradise, that is, the sentence and curse of the broken
law, and the wrath of God pursuing therefore, which was indeed
a fearful winter, and storm that made the Sun dark, and the day
gloomy, therefore is God's wrath in Scripture compared to <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
blasts</hi> and <hi>tempests,</hi> and <hi>who can stand before his cold? Psal.</hi>
147. 17. 2. It sayes, that now these are done away by Christ;
and by his call in the Gospel, he assures his people, they shall
find them fully removed; so that there is no wrath nor curse,
that any who yeelds to it, needs to fear. 3. It implyes that the
Gospel brings good news, and there is none better than this,
that Gods justice is satisfied, and his wrath removed. 4. It im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports,
that Christ can bear sure testimony to this, that wrath is
over, because he payed a price to remove it, and therefore sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
may take his word, and follow his call. And, 5. That belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
are sometimes ready to suspect, more than they have ground,
that there is some storm yet before them; but Christ hath made
all fair-weather, ere he call: O great argument! He calls not to
fight, but to gather the spoil; He puts not believers to the sea,
till he himself hath made all calm: Believers meet with blasts
and storms sometimes, but readily that is, when their back is on
Christ, and not when their faces are to him-ward: The wind of
wrath is not in a sinners face that seeketh Jesus, but the word
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>aith to such, <hi>fear not, Mark 16. 6. ye seek him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. He presseth her to rise and come, from some heartsome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements
he propons, <hi>vers.</hi> 12. There is a great change
(saith he) now, when the angry winter is over, all things are
pleasant and lovely. 1. The <hi>flowers appear,</hi> that shews there is
heat and warmnesse in the earth, and it is an effect of the Spring,
and a proof that winter is past. Hereby the fruits of grace, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
in the change that is wrought upon sinners, may be sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified,
as is frequently hinted in this Song, where the Church is
called a <hi>garden,</hi> and believers are the <hi>flowers;</hi> Come, (saith he)
grace hath made others to come through the ground, who once
were like flowers in the winter, under ground, but now they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:65401:71"/>
and flourish. 2. <hi>The time of singing of birds is come.</hi> As in
the Spring, birds sing, which in the winter drooped; So (saith
he) now many poor sinners have changed their sad note, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to sing, who once were sinking under fears: And the good
news of the Gospel, like the <hi>voice of the turtle, is heard in our
land;</hi> these good tydings have been sent even to us, which is no
little evidence of love, and no small confirmation to faith: That
the news of the Gospel, and the consolation of sinners thereby,
is here understood, is very agreeable to the scope: And these
prove the removing of wrath, and are incouraging for stirring sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
up to the exercise of faith. And O how heartsome, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshful
is the spiritual Spring, when the <hi>day-spring from on high
visits us!</hi> (as these things, mentioned in the text, are in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
spring very pleasant, and tend to provoke men to go and
recreat themselves in the fields.) And this is the particular scope
of this place: There is never a sinner hath gotten good of Christ,
but it proves him to be very kind; and the blessed change Christ
hath wrought on them, should incourage others to believe, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when it is the day of their visitation, and the Sun of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse
hath become warm by the Gospel unto them, or unto
the place and society in which they live. 3. He presseth his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
and call, by the very presentnesse, and <hi>now</hi> of the season
of grace, <hi>vers. 13. The fig-tree putteth forth,</hi> &amp;c. Which shews not
only, that Summer is neer, but that <hi>it is even at the door, Matth.</hi>
24. 32, 33. and (saith he) <hi>the vines bud and give a smell;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
is holden forth, the thriving of the plants of God's vineyard,
under the dispensation of grace, as we may see, <hi>vers.</hi> 15. All these
prove, that <hi>now</hi> is the acceptable time, and <hi>now</hi> is the day of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;
and there are l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>rge allowances of consolation to them,
that <hi>now</hi> will accept of Christ's offers, and subject to his call:
Therefore, saith he, even to us, sit not the time when all is ready,
but up, and come away: And that the voice of the turtle is
heard in our land, (that is even the Church wherein we live)
proves it to be the season of grace also; for, it's long since the
time of the <hi>turtles singing</hi> hath come to us, and their voice is yet
still heard: And this sayes the chock and season of grace is amongst
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:65401:71"/>
our hands, now when Christ's call comes to our door, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it would not be neglected.</p>
                  <p>And so he doth in the fourth place, repeat the call in the end
of <hi>vers. 13. Arise my love,</hi> &amp;c. And this repetition is to shew,
1. His willingnesse to have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>t effectual, if sinners were as willing,
it would soon be a bargain. 2. Our sluggishnesse in not answering
at once, therefore must word be upon word, call upon call, line
upon line, precept upon precept. 3. To bear out the riches of
his grace and love in this call, wherein nothing is wanting that
can be alledged to perswade a sinner to close with Christ, and to
presse one that hath closed with him to be chearful in him: What
a heartsome life might sinners have with Christ, if they would em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
him, and dwell with him in the exercise of faith! they should
have alway a spring-time, and possesse (to say so) the sunny-side
of the brae of all the world beside, walking in gardens and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards,
where the trees of the Promises are ever fruitful, pleasant
and savoury to sight, smell, taste; and every word of Christ, as
the singing of birds, heartsome and delightful to the ear; and all
of them healthful to the believer. Who will have a heart to fit
Christ's call? or if they do, who will be able to answer it, when he
shall reckon with them? It will leave all the hearers of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
utterly inexcusable. Lastly, this repetition shews the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunatnesse,
and the peremptorinesse of his call; he will have
no refusal, neither will he leave it arbitrary, if we will come, when
we shall come, or what way; but he straitly enjoyneth it, and
that just <hi>now:</hi> It's alwayes time to believe, when ever Christ calls,
and it's never time to shift, when he perswades. All this sayes,
Christ must be a kind and loving Husband; how greatly play they
the fool, that reject him? and how happy are they, who are ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectualy
called to the marriage of the Lamb?</p>

                     <q>O my Dove! that art in the clefts
of the rocks, in the secret places of the
stairs: let me see they countenance, let me
hear thy voice; for sweet is thy voice, and
thy countenance is comely.</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>This 14. <hi>vers.</hi> contains the second part of Christ's sweet and
comfortable Sermon. Wherein, beside the title which he gives
his Bride, there are three things, 1. Her case. 2. The directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which he propones, as the cure of her case. 3. The motive
pressing it.</p>
                  <p>The title is, <hi>my Dove:</hi> This hath a sweet insinuation and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
in it. Believers are styled so, 1. For their innocent nature,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 16. 2. For their tendernesse, and trembling at the
word of the Lord, <hi>Hos. 11. 11. Isa. 38. 14. Hezekiah</hi> mourned
<hi>as a Dove.</hi> 3. For their beauty and purity, <hi>Psal.</hi> 68. 13. 4. For
their chast adhering to their own mate, in which respect, that of
<hi>Isa.</hi> 38. 14. is thought to allude to the mourning of the one,
after the others death<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> This shews what a believer should be,
and who deserves this name.</p>
                  <p>The condition of this Dove is, that she is in <hi>the clefts of the
rocks, and in the secret places of the stairs:</hi> It's ordinary for doves
to hide themselves in rocks, or holes in walls of houses; And this
similitude is used sometimes in a good sense, as <hi>Isa.</hi> 60. 8. some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in an ill sense, as pointing out infirmity, and too much fear
and fillinesse, <hi>Hos. 7. 11. Ephraim is a silly Dove without heart
that goes to Egypt,</hi> &amp;c. The Bride is here compared to a Dove
hiding it self, in the last sense, out of unbelief and anxiety, taking
her to poor shifts for ease, and slighting Christ, as frighted doves
that mistake their own windowes, and fly to other hiding-places;
the scope being to comfort and encourage her, and the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
calling her to holy boldnesse, and prayer to him (implying
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:65401:72"/>
that these had been neglected formerly) doth confirm this: Then
sayes the Lord, my poor <hi>heartlesse Dove,</hi> why art thou discoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
taking thee to holes (as it were) to hide thee, fostering mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief
and fainting? that is not the right way.</p>
                  <p>What then should she do (might it be said) seing she is so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meet
to converse with him, or look out to the view of any that
looks on? He gives two directions, holding forth what was more
proper, and fit for her case, 1. <hi>Let me see thy countenance</hi> (saith
he) like one that is ashamed, thou hides thy self, as if thou durst
not appear before me, but come (saith he) let me see thy counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.
This expression imports friendliness, familiarity, and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in her coming before him: So this phrase of <hi>seeing ones face</hi>
is taken, <hi>Gen.</hi> 43. 3, 5. and 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 32. As the not shewing
of the countenance, supposeth discontent or fear; So then the
Lord calls by this to holy familiarity with him, and confidence
in it, in opposition to her former fainting and misbelief. The
second direction is, <hi>Let me hear thy voice,</hi> To make him hear
the voice, is to pray, <hi>Psal.</hi> 5. 3. and under it generally all the
duties of religion are often comprehended; It's like discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
scarred the heartlesse Bride from prayer, and she durst not
come before him; do not so (saith he) but call confidently upon
me in the day of trouble, and time of need. <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. Prayer ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
angers Christ (be the believers case what it will) but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing
of it, will. 2. Discouragement when it seases on the
childe of God, is not soon shaken off; and therefore he not only
gives one direction upon another, but also adds incouragements
and motives sutable to these directions.</p>
                  <p>And so we come to the third thing in the verse, the motives
he makes use of to presse his direction, which are two, 1. <hi>Sweet
is thy voice. 2. Thy countenance is comely.</hi> What is my voice
and countenance, might she say (for proud unbelief is exceeding

in the world so pleasant to me, as the prayer of a poor belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
Now this doth not so much commend our prayers, as it
shews his acceptation of them, and the excellency of his golden
censer, that makes them with his odours so savory before God,

spots on it, yet to me it's <hi>comely,</hi> therefore let me <hi>hear thy voice,</hi>
let me <hi>see thy countenance.</hi> Christ had rather converse with a
poor believer, than with the most gallant, stately person in all
the world. Beside, <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. Fainting may overmaster even a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever,
and misbelief may mire them. 2. There are often foolish
secklesse shifts made use of by believers, for defending misbelief
and discouragement, when they are under temptation. 3. Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
fears, and discouragement may come to that height, as to
scarr a believer from Christ's company, and marr them in prayer
to him. 4. Misbelief bears out still this to a tempted soul, that
Christ cares not for it; yea, that he disdains such a person and
their company. 5. Christ is tender of fainting believers, and of
their consolation, even when they suspect him most, and when
their suspicions are most unreasonable and uncharitable to him,
<hi>Isa.</hi> 49. 14, 15. 6. Christ allowes poor believers a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

confident walk with him; they might all be courtiers, for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
that is allowed them, if they did not refuse their allowance,
and sinfully obstruct their own accesse thereto. 7. Christ loves
to be much imployed by his people, and there is nothing more
pleasing to him, than frequently to <hi>hear</hi> their <hi>voice.</hi> 8. He is a
sweet and gentle constructer of them, and their service, and is
not rigid, even when often they have many misconstructions of
him. 9. The more discouragement seizeth upon the soul, there
should be the more prayer, and thronging in upon Christ; for
there is no outgate to be expected, but in that way. 10. None
needs to fear to put Christ on their secrets; or they need not so
to fear (if they be sincere) that they spill their prayers, as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to be kept from prayer, or made heartlesse in it; For it's
Christ that hears them, whose censer, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8. 6. makes them sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vory
before God: <hi>Let me hear thy voice is</hi> no little incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in that duty: And the right consideration of it, would
help to much boldnesse in prayer; and especially considering, that
the God who is the hearer of prayer, is <hi>our Beloved.</hi>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>This 15. <hi>vers.</hi> contains the last part of Christ's Sermon: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
as he had formerly given directions in reference to her parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
walk; so here he evidenceth his care of her external peace:
That Christ speaks these words, the continuation and series of
them with the former, the scope (which is to make full proof of
his care) and the manner how the duty here mentioned is laid on,
to wit, by way of authority, makes it clear. There are three
things in them, 1. An external evil incident to the Church, and
that is, to be spoiled by <hi>foxes.</hi> 2. A cure given in a direction,
<hi>Take them,</hi> &amp;c. 3. He gives reasons to deter all from cruel pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
in sparing any of them. <hi>For,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>In clearing the case here supposed, as incident to the Church,
we are to consider, 1. What these <hi>vines</hi> are. 2. What be these
<hi>foxes.</hi> 3. How they spoil the vines. For clearing the first; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
that the visible Church is often compared in Scripture to
a Vineyard, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. 33. And the particular professors, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
believers, are as the vine-trees that grow in it; So, <hi>Isa.</hi> 5. 7.
<hi>The Vineyard of the Lord is the house of Israel,</hi> collectively, and <hi>the
men of Iudah are his pleasant plants.</hi> They are called so, 1. For
their fecklesnesse in themselves, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 15. 2, 3, &amp;c. yet, excelling
in fruit beyond others. 2. Because of Gods separating them from
others, and taking pains on them above all others, <hi>Isa.</hi> 27. 2, 3. for
these, and other reasons, they are called the <hi>vines.</hi> Next, by <hi>foxes</hi>
are understood false teachers, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13. 4. O Israel, <hi>thy Prophets</hi>
(that is thy flattering teachers as the context clears) <hi>are as foxes
in the deserts.</hi> And, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 15.) they are called <hi>wolves in sheeps
cloathing:</hi> Hereby are meant, not every one, who in something
differ in their own judgement from the received rule, if they vent
it not for corrupting of others, or the disturbing of the Churches
peace; but these who are, in respect of others, seducers, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:65401:74"/>
men to do as they do, in that which tends to the Churches
hurt; and such also, as by flattery and unfaithfulnesse, destroy
souls, proportionally come in to share of the name, as they do of
the thing signified thereby, as that place of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> before cited,
and <hi>chap.</hi> 34. 2, 3. doth confirm. Now they get this name for
their resembling foxes, in three things, 1. In their abominable
nature, wherefore they are called, <hi>foxes, wolves, dogges,</hi> &amp;c. and
such like, which are abhorred and hated of all men, and so are
these most hatefull to God, and so ought they to be with all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
2. For their destroying, hurtful nature, in their destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Church; therefore called <hi>ravening wolves, Mat.</hi> 7. 15.
and <hi>grievous wolves, Acts</hi> 20. 29. who <hi>subvert whole houses, Tit.</hi>
1. 11. and <hi>whose word eateth as doth a gangrene, 2 Tim.</hi> 2. 17.
3. They are compared to these for their subtilty, a fox being fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
for that, for which cause <hi>Herod</hi> is called a <hi>fox, Luke</hi> 13. 32.
So false <hi>teachers speak lies in hypocrisie,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 2. <hi>creep into
houses, their doctrines eat as a canker insensibly:</hi> And they are
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 13, 14. called <hi>deceitful workers:</hi> And as their master
Satan can transform himself into an angel of light, so do they
themselves into the ministers of Christ: All such beasts whatever
their shape be, are hateful to Christ and his Church. 3. These
false teachers or foxes, are said <hi>to spoil the vines,</hi> for foxes hurt
not a Vineyard, or flock of lambs more than false teachers do
the Church. 1. Corrupting the purity of Doctrine. 2. Obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the simplicity of Worship. 3. Overturning the beauty of
Order, and bringing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>in confusion. 4. Spoiling her bond of unity,
and renting the affections, and dividing the wayes of her mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
thereby dissipating the flock. 5. Extinguishing the vigour
and life of Christian practise; diverting from what is more neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
to hurtful and vain janglings, which do still increase to more
ungodlinesse, and have never profited them who were occupied
therein, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 7. 6. By ruining souls, carrying them head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to the pit, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1. and 3. 16. There is no hurt nor ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
the Church of Christ meets with, or ever met with, more
grievous and dangerous, than what she meets with from such,
although this be an exercise and tryal, ordinarily incident to her.</p>
                  <p>2. The cure the Lord provides, is, the furnishing of his Church
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:65401:74"/>
with Discipline, and the giving of directions for managing of it
in these words, <hi>Take us,</hi> &amp;c. Wherein consider these four, 1. To
whom it's directed. 2. What is required. 3. A motive insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuat
in the expression, <hi>take us.</hi> 4. The extent of the direction,
for the obviating of a question. It may be supposed to be direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to one of four. 1. Either to the Bride; or, 2. To Angels; or,
3. To Magistrates; or, 4. To Church-guides. Now it's to
none of the first three, Therefore it must be to the last and fourth:
First, It is not to the Bride: For, 1. The word <hi>take</hi> in the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal,
is in the plural-number, and signifieth <hi>take ye:</hi> now the
Lord useth not to speak to the Church, but as to one. 2. He sayes,
<hi>take us,</hi> and so taking the Bride in with himself, as a party for
whom this service is to be performed, the speech must be directed
to some third. 2. It's not directed to Angels, these are not spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to in all this Song; and this being a duty to be performed
while the Church is militant, they come not in to gather the tares
from the wheat, till the end of the world, nor to separate the
bad fish from the good, till the net by fairly on the shore.
3. This direction cannot be given to the Magistrat; for, beside
that he is not mentioned in this Song, nor as such, hath he any
part in the ministry of the Gospel, or capable to be thus spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
unto (although the duty from the force of it's argument will
also reach him in his station, because he should so far as he can
prevent the spoiling of Christ's Vineyard in his place) Beside this,
I say, this direction must take place in all times, whenever the
Church hath such a tryal to wrestle with, otherwise it were not
suitable to Christ's scope, nor commensurable with her need: Now
for many hundreds of years the Church wanted Magistrates, to
put this direction in practice, yet wanted she not foxes, nor was
she without a suitable capacity of guarding her self against them,
by that power wherewith Christ hath furnished her. It remains
therefore, 4. That it must be spoken to Christ's Ministers, and
Officers in the Church, called rulers in the Scripture, and in this
Song, watchmen and keepers of this Vineyard, as by office, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradistinguished
from professours, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 3. and 5. 7. and 8. 11, 12.
Such the Church never wanted, such are required to <hi>watch (Act.</hi>
20. 24.) against wolves, and such in the Church of <hi>Ephesus</hi> are
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:65401:75"/>
commended, (<hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 3, 4.) for putting this direction in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
2. The duty here required is to <hi>take them,</hi> as men use to
hunt foxes till they be taken: And this implyes all that is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for preventing their hurting of Christ's Vines: Christ's Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
are to lay out themselves in discovering, confuting and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing,
censuring and <hi>rejecting</hi> them, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 11. That is, not
<hi>to endure them that are evil,</hi> but to try them judicially, as it is
<hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 2.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. Christ's Church is furnished with sufficient authority in
her self, for her own edification, and for censuring of such as would
obstruct the same. 2. This Church-authority is not given to
Professors in common, or to the Bride as the first subject; but to
their guides, Christ's Ministers and servants. 3. It is no lesse a
duty, nor is it lesse necessary to put forth this power against false
teachers, than against other grosse offenders: So did <hi>Paul, 2 Tim.
1. ult.</hi> and so commands he others to do, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 10. heresie and
corrupt doctrine being also a fruit of the flesh, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 20. as
well as other scandalous sins.</p>
                  <p>3. There is a motive to presse this, implyed, while he saith,
<hi>take us;</hi> Which words insinuat, that it's service both to him
and her, and that Ministers are his servants, and the Churches for
Christ's sake. It shews also his sympathy, in putting himself (as
it were) in hazard with her (at least mystically considered) and
his love in comforting her, that he thinks himself concerned in
the restraint of these foxes, as well as she is.</p>
                  <p>4. The direction is amplified to remove an objection, (say
some) all heresies, or all Heretiques are not equal, some compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively
are little to be regarded, and it's cruelty to meddle with
these, that seem to professe fair. No (saith he) take them all,
even the <hi>little foxes;</hi> for, though they be little, yet they are foxes,
though they be not of the grossest kind (as all scandals in facts
are not alike, yet none is to be dispensed with) so they are (saith
he) <hi>foxes,</hi> and corrupt others; for, a little leaven will leaven
the whole lump (often small-like schisms, or heresies, such
as the Novatians and Donatists, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have been exceedingly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facing
to the beauty of the Church) therefore, (saith he) hunt,
and take them all. How small a friend is our Lord to tollerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:65401:75"/>
and how displeased is he with many errours, that the world
thinks little of? Magistrats, Ministers and people may learn here,
what distance ought to be kept with the spreaders of the least er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
and how every one ought to concur in their stations, for
preventing the hurt that comes by them.</p>
                  <p>The last thing in the verse, is, the reasons wherewith this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
is backed and pressed: The first is, all of them <hi>spoil the
vines:</hi> Errour never runs loose, and Heretiques never get liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but the spoiling of the vines one way or other followes; and
can beasts be suffered in a garden, or orchard, and the plants not
be hurt?</p>
                  <p>2. If any say, they are but little foxes, and unable to hurt.
He answers this, and adds a second reason, in saying, <hi>the grapes are
tender;</hi> or, <hi>the vines are in the first grapes,</hi> that is, as they (while
scarce budding or sprouting) are easily blasted by a small wind,
so the work of grace in a believer, or Christ's ordinances in his
Church, are most precious and tender wares, and cannot abide
rough hands; even the least of seducers, or corrupt teachers, may
easily wrong them; they are of such a nature, as they may be
soon spoiled, if they be not tenderly and carefully looked to.
<hi>Obs.</hi> 1. They that have grace would be tender of it; it may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
be hurt. 2. Gracious persons, would not think themselves
without the reach of hazard from corrupt teachers; for, this is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of the Bride, <hi>The foxes spoil the vines.</hi> 3. Our Lord Jesus is
exceeding tender of the work of grace, in, and amongst his people,
and where it's weakest, he is some way most tender of it. 4. This
argument here made use of, sayes also, that these who are most
tender of his Church, and the graces of his people, will be most
zealous against false teachers, even the least of them; For, these
two are joined together in him, and are in themselves necessary to
preserve the one, and restrain the other; and the suffering these
to ramble and run without a che<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>k, cannot be the way of buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
but of spoiling Christ's Church.</p>
                  <p>The third motive, or reason pressing the watch-men to have
a care of the vines, is hinted in the possessive particle, <hi>our;</hi> for, <hi>our</hi>
vines, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is relative to the watch-men, whom he takes in
with himself, as having a common interest in the Church; The
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:65401:76"/>
Church is his, and theirs, as the flock is the owners, and the shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds,
who are particularly set to have the over-sight of it; for,
the shepherd may say, This is my flock, which no other servant
can say: And this is a great piece of dignity put upon Ministers,
to be <hi>fellow-workers with Christ, 2 Cor.</hi> 6. 1. &amp;c. and binds on
their duty strongly; for, saith Christ here to them, ye will have
losse also, if ye see not to it, because ye must count for the vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard,
wherewith ye are intrusted: It's yours, and yet ye are not
absolute lords, for it is also mine, I am the owner of it: And so
the vines are both theirs and Christ's, their interest speaks how
naturally they should care for them; His interest shews the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency
both ministers and people ought to have on him.</p>

                  <p>Now follows the two last parts of her carriage in the beloveds
absence; First, after she hath (as it were) read over his Epistle,
she comforts her self in his love, and her interest in him, though
he be absent. (It's good use of his word, when it is made use
of, for strengthening our faith in him, when sense is away) There
are two parts of this consolation, 1. Her faith is clear for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
<hi>vers.</hi> 16. 2. Her hope is solid in the expectation of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
day coming, <hi>vers.</hi> 17. Next, <hi>vers.</hi> 17. she puts up a prayer
for a gracious visit, which she knowes he will allow upon her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
that day come; and this is the last thing here recorded of
the Brides carriage in the Bridegrooms absence.</p>
                  <p>In the 16. verse, the faith of her interst in him, is, 1. Asserted,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:65401:76"/>
                     <hi>my beloved is mine, and I am his.</hi> 2. It's vindicated, or establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
against an objection in the following words, <hi>he feeds,</hi> &amp;c.
The assertion holds out an union betwixt him and her, <hi>I am
his,</hi> &amp;c. Or, as it is in the Original, <hi>I am to him, and he is to me;</hi>
Such as is the union betwixt married persons, <hi>Hos.</hi> 3. 3. which
the tye of marriage brings on: Even such is this which follows
covenanting with God; for, this union presupposeth it, and is
founded on it, <hi>Ezek. 16. 8. I made a covenant with thee, and thou
becamest mine,</hi> or, <hi>to me;</hi> Although (saith she) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e be not here,
yet he is my husband, and that tye stands betwixt me and him,
which is no little priviledge; and in this, she comforts her self
under absence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obs.</hi> First, There is an excellent union, and peculiar tye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
Christ and believers, which none other can lay claim to but
they: It's excellent, as will easily appear, if we consider these
properties of it. 1. It's a neer union, they are <hi>one flesh, Eph.</hi>
5. 27. as man and wife; they are <hi>flesh of his flesh,</hi> and <hi>bone of his
bone.</hi> 2. It's a real and not an imaginary union (though it be
spiritual and by faith) it makes and transfers a mutual right of
the one to the other, and hath real effects. 3. It's mutual on
both sides, Christ is wholly hers, and she is wholly dedicated to
him. 4. It's a kindly union, such as is betwixt husband and wise,
and followed with the fruits of a most sweet relation. 5. It's an
union which is some way full; whole Christ is hers, and she by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
and title is wholly his. 6. I'ts an indissoluable union, there
is no dissolving of it by any thing that can fall out, otherwayes the
consolation were not solid. Again, <hi>Obs.</hi> 2. That this relation,
which the believer hath to Christ, is the great ground of his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse
and consolation, and not any sensible presence, or any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation,
or gift communicat by Christ to him. 3. That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
may attain assurance, and clearnesse anent their interest is
him, and may come to know really that Christ is theirs: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
should aim to be through in this, that their <hi>calling and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
may be made sure</hi> to themselves. 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10. 4. Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
when they have attained clearnesse, should acknowledge it,
and comfort themselves in it, and not raise new disputes about it.
5. This clearnesse may consist with absence and want of sensible
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:65401:77"/>
presence, and there is no case wherein a believer should stick faster
to his confidence, than in such a case, when under desertion and
absence, as the Spouse doth here.</p>
                  <p>2. She vindicats her faith in these words, <hi>He feedeth among the
lilies.</hi> The words may be looked upon as the preventing of an
objection, for it might be said, If Christ be yours, where is he?
Is it likely that he is yours, when he is so far away? For, the faith
of clearnesse will be assaulted and set upon, and it is not easily
maintained, and unbelief takes the advantage of Christ's absence
from sense, to brangle it; So that unbelief, and temptation espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
sets on then: Therefore, she answers it thus, <hi>He feedeth
among the lilies,</hi> that is, he is kind to his people, and present
with them, though now I see him not; faith may, and will argue
from Christ's love to his people in general, and from the promises
that speaks to all, when there seems to be nothing singular in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
own condition, from which it can take comfort. By <hi>lilies</hi>
are understood all believers: the Church was called a lilie, <hi>vers.</hi> 2.
here all believers are so called, as partaking of that same beauty
and savour, and because planted in the same true garden. Christ
was called a lilie, <hi>vers.</hi> 1. and here all believers are called lilies,
Shewing, 1. That all believers have a conformity to Christ, and
partake of the divine nature and spirit that is in him. 2. That
all believers in things that are essential to grace and holinesse,
have conformity one to another, they have the same Faith, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
Covenant, Husband, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> although in circumstantials and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
there be differences. Next, his <hi>feeding</hi> amongst them,
shewes, 1. A special gracious presence in his Church, and among
believers, there he <hi>walketh among the seven golden Candlesticks,
Rev.</hi> 2. 1. 2. A special delight he hath in them, and satisfaction
to be amongst them, as a man delighteth to walk in his garden:
It's <hi>his meat (Iohn</hi> 4. 32. 34.) <hi>and drink</hi> to do them good; so
then (saith she) he is kind to all his people, and is so to me,
though for the time I see him not: And thus also she answers the
question, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. 1, 2. even when Christ is a-seeking, and she was
inquiring after him. <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. Christ's care of his Church, and love
to his Bride, is no lesse under absence, than when his presence is
sensibly injoyed. 2. The consideration of this, tends much to
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:65401:77"/>
further the consolation of believers, and it becomes them well
to believe this, when under desertion and absence, and so to
ward off tentations.</p>
                  <p>The solid exercise of faith never wants hope waiting on it,
therefore, 2. <hi>vers.</hi> 17. that follows, for compleating the Brides
consolation in these words, <hi>untill the day break, and shadows,</hi> &amp;c.
Though there be shadows (saith she) and vails betwixt him and
me, in this night of desertion; yet there is a day coming when
these, by his presence, shall be made to flee away, and I shall see
him as he is. There is a twofold day spoken of in Scripture,
1. A day of Christ's presence here upon earth, <hi>Luk. 1. 78. The
day-spring from on high hath visited us.</hi> 2. The day of his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
appearing, commonly called the great day; and in a singular
way called here <hi>the day,</hi> because it hath no night of interruption
following thereupon, and because it goes as far beyond what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
possesse now, as day exceeds the night; Therefore it's
called <hi>the morning, Psal.</hi> 49. 14. in which the just shall have the
dominion; and the dawning of the day, and the <hi>rising of the day-star
in our hearts, 2 Pet.</hi> 1. 19. which is there opposed to the clearest
prophesies and ordinances, which are but as a candle in a dark
place, in respect of that day. Now we conceive the last and great
day is signified here, 1. Because that is her scope, to comfort
her self in the hope of what is coming. 2. Because she opposeth
it to the present means, as to shadows, even to faith it self, for
that she injoyed for the time; and also to sensible pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ence, which
in the next words she prayes for, till that day dawn. By <hi>shadows</hi>
is meant, whatever marres the immediat, full and satisfying in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying
of Christ, which as shadows, hide him from us, or darken
him that we do not see him as he is, or give but small and dark
representations of him, (like shadows of the body) which are
very unproportioned unto his own excellent worth. They are
said to <hi>flee away,</hi> because a glimpse of Christ then, when he who
is the Sun of Righteousnesse, shall shine at the break of that day,
shall dispell and dissipate them more fully and quickly, than this
natural Sun when rising, doth scatter darknesse and shadows that
go before it. And by <hi>untill,</hi> we understand the setting of a fixed
term, which distinguisheth one time from another, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. I
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:65401:78"/>
will not let thee go <hi>untill</hi> thou blesse me; so saith she, untill that
day of immediat presence come, let me have love-visits, as is
expressed in the following words. <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. There is an excellent
day coming to believers, wherein Christ shall be immediatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
and seen, and wherein the soul shall be comforted with no
mediat object, or created excellency, but shall see his face, and
be filled with the fulnesse of God. 2. While here, there are
many shadows even betwixt Christ and the strongest believers;
<hi>we see but darkly as in a glasse, 1 Cor.</hi> 13. 12. There is, 1. a sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of desertion, and his hiding of himself. 2. A shadow of
Ordinances, where he is seen, yet but darkly, like a face in a
Looking-glasse. 3. A shadow of sinful infirmities, drawing vails
betwixt Christ and us, and hiding his face from us, <hi>Isa.</hi> 59. 2.
4. A shadow of natural infirmity; for, not only are we ready through
unbelief to slander him, but by reason of weaknesse (like narrow
or old bottles) we are not capable of him, and unable to contain
him. 3. At that day of his appearing, all these shadows will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
be done away: there will not one tear be left on any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
cheeks, there will be no affliction or desertion to hide him
from them, but they shall be for ever with him: there will then
be <hi>no Ordinances, nor Temple, Rev. 21. 22. but the Lord God
and the Lamb himself, shall be the Temple</hi> and light of his people:
Nor will there be any sinful infirmities then to interpose betwixt
him and them, death, the curse and corruption will be cast into
the lake; no unclean thing accompanies the believer into the
new Jerusalem; nay, no imperfect thing is there, for whatever
is imperfect, and whatever was <hi>in part,</hi> is then done away, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
13. 10. and what is perfect will then come; the soul in it's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
will then be perfected, capacitated and dilated to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
take up and delight in God; and the body perfected,
made glorious and spiritual, like the glorious body of our Lord
Jesus, <hi>Philip. 3. ult.</hi> 4. The hope of that day, and of the flee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
away of all shadows then, is (and no marvel it be) very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshful
to the Lord's people: and believers in all their darknesses
should comfort themselves and others from the hope of it,
1 <hi>Thes. 4. ult.</hi> 5. All that are Christ's, or whoever have faith in
Christ, and fellowship with him by vertue of his Covenant, may
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:65401:78"/>
expect at that day to enjoy Christ immediatly and fully, and to see
him as he is: O that men believed this! and that many were
th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>onging in to his Covenant now, as they would not desire to be
cast from his presence in that day! Yet, 6. All shadows are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
removed till then; the believer must, and some way will sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to Christ's way of ordering it so, and not seek it should be
otherwayes till then.</p>
                  <p>In the last place, the Bride falls about the exercise of prayer
in the rest of this verse; faith and hope in exercise alwayes stir up
to prayer; for, these graces do not foster las<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>nesse and security, but
incite and provoke to duty (it's a good token when faith and
hope are so accompanied) therefore she turns her to prayer, in
which she speaks to him as to her beloved: Clearnesse of interest,
as it helps notably to many things, so to confidence in prayer es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially.
The petition (importing still absence) hath these two
in it, 1. The suit it self, <hi>turn.</hi> 2. The inforcing and inlarging
of it, <hi>be like a Roe,</hi> &amp;c. Turning her, implyes, 1. Sense and
feeling of his absence. 2. Her serious desire to have Christ again.
3. That his absence may be removed by his own returning, and
so the change of her case to the better must flow from him. And<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
4. That she may ask this from him, and expect by prayer in
saith to obtain it, believing prayer being the best mean to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuat
this. Next she enforceth and inlargeth her petition, <hi>Be
thou like a Roe,</hi> &amp;c. that is, seing (saith she) all shadows will
not be removed till that time, what is my suit for the time? It's
even this, that thou will give me visits of thy presence, and be
like a <hi>Roe</hi> or <hi>young Hart on the mountains of Bether:</hi> The word
<hi>Bether,</hi> signifies division, and so it may be made use of here, so
long (saith she) as these mountains divide betwixt me and thee,
Lord be not a stranger, but swiftly, easily and kindly (as the Roes
come over mountains to their mates, <hi>Prov.</hi> 5. 19.) come thou to
me, and comfort me with frequent love-visits, untill that time
come, that thou take me to thee, to injoy thee fully and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly.
<hi>Obs.</hi> 1. It's lawfull for believers to desire sensible pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
even here-away: Yea, it's suitable, they should often long
and pray for it. 2. Where the hope of heaven is solide, sensible
manifestations of Christ's love will be most ardently sought for:
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:65401:79"/>
It will never prejudge one of their satisfaction and full payment
then, that they have gotten a large earnest-penny here, she knows
that will never be reckoned up to her. 3. Much prayer flowing
from, and waiting upon the exercise of faith and hope, is a notable
way to bring the soul to the injoyment of sense. 4. The belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
hath a heartsome life, and a rich inheritance, Christ here, and
Christ hereafter, <hi>the lines are fallen unto him in pleasant places.</hi>
5. She grounds her suit on the marriage-relation and tye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
him and her, <hi>my Beloved</hi> (saith she) a Covenant-claim to
Christ, is the most solid ground upon which believers can walk in
their approaches before him, and in their pleadings with him.
6. He allowes believers to plead for his company, from this
ground, that he is theirs by Covenant, as he pleads for their
company, on that same ground, <hi>vers.</hi> 10. &amp;c.</p>

steps. 3. Her successe in every step. 4. Her practice when
she hath obtained her desire: Or, we may take them all up in
these two, 1. Her sad condition, and her carriage under it. 2. Her
outgate and her carriage suitable thereto. Her case is implyed
in two words in the beginning of <hi>vers.</hi> 1. 1. It was <hi>night</hi> with
her. 2. She was on <hi>her bed.</hi> By <hi>night,</hi> is ordinarily understood
darknesse, and affliction, opposit to light of day and joy; and here
her exercise being spiritual, it must imply some spiritual afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

<hi>He will command his loving kindnesse in the day, and in the night</hi>

dese<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>tion she is under, thorow the want of Christ's presence whom
she loves; His presence, who is the Sun of Righteousnesse with
healing under his wings, makes the believers day; and his absence,
is their night, and makes them droop, as being under a sad night
of soul-affliction; therefore is it, that she seeks so carefully after
his presence. 2. Her being <hi>on her bed,</hi> is not taken here, as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
neernesse with him; for, the scope shews he is absent, but a
lasinesse of frame on her spirit, opposite to activenesse and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
as it's taken, <hi>Chap. 5. vers.</hi> 3. and so it's opposed to her
after-rising and diligence, and therefore it's also called <hi>my bed,</hi>
implying that she was here alone in a secure comfortlesse frame,
and therefore for this, it's distinguished from <hi>our bed, Chap.</hi> 1. 16.
and <hi>his bed</hi> afterward, <hi>vers.</hi> 7. Where she is allowed rest, and
spiritual ease, and solace in his company; but here on <hi>her bed</hi> she
hath no such allowance, whatever earnal ease and rest she take to
her self: Believers have their own fits of carnal security, when
they give their corruptions rest, that is, <hi>their own bed;</hi> and it's a
heartlesse lair (to speak so) to ly alone and want the beloved:
This is her case, wanting Christ, yet lying too still, as contented
some-way in that condition; though it cannot continue so with
believers, it will turn heavy and perplexing at last to them, as it
doth here to the Bride: and sure, the easiest time under security
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:65401:80"/>
is not so comfortable as profitable to believers, as is an exercise
that takes them more up; Therefore afterward she prefers rising
and seeking, to this woful rest. It shews, 1. That believers di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
and darknesse may grow; for, in the former Chapter, Christ
was absent, yet, as through a window or lattesse, there were some
glimpses of him; but here it's <hi>night,</hi> and there is not so much as
a twilight discovery of him. 2. Often, distance with Christ, and
security and deadnesse (as to our spiritual life) go together:
When Christ is absent, believers then usually fall from activity in
their duty, <hi>Isa. 64. 7. No man stirreth up himself to lay hold on thee,</hi>
and the reason is, <hi>thou hast hid thy face,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Matth. 25. 5. While
the Bridegroom tarrieth,</hi> even the <hi>wise Virgins slumbered and slept.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Her carriage, or way that she takes in this case, is set out in
four steps: The 1. Is in these words, <hi>I sought him, whom my soul
loveth.</hi> Consider here, 1. The title Christ gets, <hi>him whom,</hi> &amp;c.
Christ got this name before, and now several times she repeats it;
And it holds forth, 1. The sincerity of her love, it was her soul
and heart that loved him. 2. The degree and singularity of it,
no other thing was admitted in her heart to compare with him,
he bears the alone sway there, in respect of the affection she had
to him, it's he, and none other upon whom her soul's love is set,
otherwise, this title would not suitably design him; Christ loves
well to have such titles given to him, as may import the hearts
special esteem of him. 3. It shews, that even in believers lowest
conditions, there remains some secret soul-esteem of Christ, and
that in their judgement, he is still their choice and waill above
all the world. Yet, 4. That their practice while security pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails,
is most unsuitable to their convictions and judgement.
2. Consider her practice and carriage, while Christ is absent, her
practice is not altogether a laying by, without the form of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
for, (saith she) on my bed <hi>I sought him,</hi> that is, I prayed
and used some means, but in a lazy way, not stirring up my self vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorously
in it. <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. Believers in a secure frame, may keep
some form of duty, yet their duties are like the frame of their
heart, lifelesse and hypocritical. 2. There is much of a believers
practice, such as themselves will find fault with, when they come to
look rightly upon it; yea, even much of their way, while they
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:65401:80"/>
keep up the form of duty, is but like the sluggard, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26. 14.
<hi>turning themselves upon their beds, as the door doth upon the hinges;</hi>
not lying still, nor altogether darring to give over the form, yet
litle better on the matter, because they make no effectual progress,
not can they say their soul is in and with their service, which they
perform. 3. Her successe as to this step, is, <hi>but I found him not,</hi>
that is, I was nothing the better, these sluggish endeavours did
not my businesse: Every form of seeking will not obtain; and
one may seek Christ long in their ordinary formal way, ere they
find him; yet it's good not to give over, but to observe the
form: Life and love is not altogether gone, when one discerns
absence, and their own lazinesse with discontent.</p>
                  <p>When this doth not reach her design, she proceeds to a more
lively step, <hi>vers.</hi> 2. and that is, to get up, and seek him in a more
active stirring way: Which sayes, 1. She observed the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of her distance, and what came of her prayers and seeking;
which is a good beginning of ones recovery, and wining to their
feet after a fit of security and decay. 2. It sayes, it's often good
for a believer, as to their rouzing, and their recovering of spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
life, that sense is not alwayes easily obtained; this activity had
not followed (readily) had not Christ constrained her to it, by
cross-dispensations and disappointments. In this step we have, 1. Her
resolving to fall about a more active way in seeking him. 2. Her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance.
3. Her successe. First, Her resolution is, <hi>I will rise now</hi>
(saith she) <hi>and go about the streets,</hi> &amp;c. In which there are these three,
1. What she resolves to do, not to give over (for that should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be given way to) but to bestir her self more actively in duty,
<hi>I will rise</hi> and go from the <hi>bed</hi> to the <hi>streets of the city</hi> and <hi>seek</hi>
him there. By <hi>city</hi> is understood the Church, whereof all mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
are <hi>fellow-citizens, Eph.</hi> 2. 19. It's called so, 1. For it's or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and government, so the Church is as a city, that hath watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and laws. 2. For it's unity; it's one Common-wealth and
Incorporation, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 12. This Jerusalem is a city <hi>compacted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
Psa.</hi> 122. 3. 3. For it's priviledges, whereof all believers
(who are the burgesses and fellow-citizens) are partakers, <hi>Eph.</hi>
2. 19. and unto which all others who are without, are strangers.
Her <hi>going into the city,</hi> suppons a communicating of her case to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:65401:81"/>
for help, and her using of more publick means, opposite to
her private dealing within her self on her bed, <hi>vers.</hi> 1. even as
rising imports a stirring of her self to more activity in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of performing these duties, opposite to her seeking him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
while she lay still on her bed: The thing then resolved
upon is to this sense, What am I doing? are there not moe
means, in the use of which I may seek Christ? Is there not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way of inquiring after him, than this lazy formal way? I will
up and essay it. There are many meanes given for a believers
help, and when one fails, another may be blessed; and therefore,
believers are still to follow from one to another; and where true
love to Christ is, it will make them do so, and spare no pains till
they meet with him. Again, 2. Ere she gets to her feet, and goes
to the streets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> she deliberatly resolves it, <hi>I will rise,</hi> &amp;c.
Which shews, 1. That her former disappointment did put her
to a consultation what to do, and made her more serious; And
this is the use that ought to be made of disappointments in the
duties of religion. 2. That there will be heart-deliberations in
a Christian-walk, when it's serious; and they are the best perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances
and duties, that are the results of these. 3. Serious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions
are often very usefull, and helpful in duty; for, they are
ingagements, and spurs to stir up to duty, when we are indispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
for it. 4. It's good cordially to resolve upon duty, when
the practice of it is somewhat difficult or obstructed; for, this
both speaks sincerity, and also helps to lessen the difficulty which
is in the way of duty. 5. Resolutions to set about duty are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the greatest length believers can win at, while under in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposition;
and this much is better than nothing, because it
draws on more.</p>
                  <p>3. This resolution is qualified, I will rise <hi>now</hi> (saith she) that
is, seing these sluggish endeavours doth not avail me, I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
no longer, but will now presently fall about it in more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest.
It's the sign of a sincere resolution, when it doth not put
off or shift duty, but ingageth the soul in a present undertaking
of it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 59, 60.</p>
                  <p>Next her performance, or her putting this resolution in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
doth accordingly follow instantly, <hi>I sought him</hi> (said she)
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:65401:81"/>
that is, in <hi>the streets,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. It's not a resolution worth the
mentioning, that hath not practice following; for every honest
resolution is followed with practice, whatever short-coming wait
upon it. 2. Honest resolutions are often to duty, like a needle
that drawes the threed after it; and believers would not star to
resolve on duty from fear of coming short in performance, if their
resolutions be undertaken in the strength of Christ, as this was,
as is clear by considering her former frame, which was such as
would give no great incouragement to selfy undertakings in
duties.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, her successe, or rather her disappointment follows in
these words, <hi>but I found him not,</hi> even then when I was most seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in seeking him, I missed him still; which is not only spoken,
to shew the event, but also by way of regrate, she is deeply af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with it. <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. When the Lords people have been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
lazy, Christ may keep up himself, even when they become
more active, rather hereby chastening their former negligence,
than being offended at their present diligence in duty. 2. It's
sad when Christ is missed even in duty, and that once and again.
3. She continues to be a distinct observer of the fruits both of
publick and private duties, which is a commendable practice,
and to be made conscience of by all the seekers of his face.</p>

<hi>Isa. 62. 6. Heb.</hi> 13. 17. Which word imports, 1. That the Church
is a City in danger, having outward and inward enemies, and
therefore needing <hi>watch-men.</hi> 2. That there is an office of a
Ministery appointed in the Church for guarding against and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
her danger; and that some are peculiarly designed, and
separat from others for that purpose; some who may be called
<hi>watch-men,</hi> which others cannot be said to be; and so they are
here distinguished from believers or private persons. 3. This of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
is most necessary, burdensome, and of great concernment to
the safety of the Church, as <hi>watch-men</hi> are to a <hi>city;</hi> for so watch
they over the souls of the people committed to their trust.</p>
                  <p>Again, these watch-men, are in the exercise of their duty,
They <hi>went about the city;</hi> Which shews their diligence according
to their trust; at least, it holds forth the end wherefore they are
appointed. <hi>Obs.</hi> There is but one City or Church, and all
Ministers are watch-men of that one Church, given for the edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of that body; and they should watch, not only for this or
that Post (to say so) but for the safety of the whole, as watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
that stand at their post, for the good of the whole City.</p>
                  <p>3. These <hi>watch-men found her,</hi> that is, (as we conceive) by
their doctrine they spoke to her condition, and by their search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and particular application, made the two-edged sword of the
Word reach her; as if they had discernably pointed her out, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
all the rest of the Congregation: Which shews, 1. The ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy
of the word when rightly manag'd, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 12. It's <hi>a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerner
of the thoughts and intents of the heart.</hi> 2. That God can
make it find out one in the midst of many others, when the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
knows not; and can make it speak to a believers case, or
any other particular persons condition, as if he did know and aim
at them particularly. 3. That Ministers should be searching, and
differencing in their doctrine, as the several conditions, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
exercises of hearers require: that is, they ought to put
difference betwixt the precious and the vile, and rightly to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:65401:82"/>
the word of truth or to lay every ones portion to them
so as it be not given in grosse, or heaped together to all, but to
every one their own allowance. In sum then, that which she sayes,
is this, When <hi>I</hi> had gone abroad, (saith she) in heavinesse to hear
(if so I might meet with Christ in publick) God made some
watch-men speak to my condition particularly, as if one had
acquainted them with it.</p>
                  <p>2. Her improving of this opportunity (coming, as it were,
beyond her expectation) follows in the next words: she cryes
out in an abrupt manner, <hi>Saw ye him;</hi> she thinks they can help
her, being acquaint with such cases, and therefore she will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
them; That is, she follows in, upon the little experience
she had felt of their skill, to seek for help from them, and for that
end to communicat her case to them, as it were after Sermon is
done, or when some convenient time offers. <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
that are serious, will let no fit opportunity for meeting
with Christ passe; they are accurat observers, and frugal manag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of them all. 2. She observes and is glad when a word speaks
home to her case, and finds her: And this is indeed the disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a sound and serious believer. 3. Ministers would be well
acquaint themselves with soul-sicknesse, and expert in the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
exercises and cases incident to the people of God, both in
order to the finding out their disease, and the cause of it (who often
can scarce make language of their own condition themselves)
and also in order to the making suitable applications for the cure
of it; for, this is to have the tongue of the learned, to speak a
word in season. 4. Believers often can say little of their cases,
but in a broken and confused way; which sayes, Ministers had
need to be the better acquaint with the spiritual cases and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises
of souls, that they may understand by half a word what they
would say. 5. Believers would advert well to whom they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municat
their case, this would not be done to all. 6. Ministers
are suitable Physicians (though not the sole or only Physician) to
whom believers would make known their soul-exercises and cases,
and therefore, there should be much spiritual sympathy betwixt
their people and them. 7. It's a great incouragement to a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed
soul, to impart it's case to a Minister, when in his pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:65401:83"/>
doctrine he useth to speak pertinently unto it. 8. It's not
unsuitable for exercised souls (beside the publick hearing of their
Minister) to have their particular queries to him in private.
9. How Christ shall be obtained, is a suitable subject for Ministers
and people, in their converse together, to be mainly taken up
with; and holy anxiety concerning this, is a frame fit for making
adresses to Ministers; they may indeed come to Ministers with
such questions, who are much in longing after him. 10. There
may be much tendernesse in affection and love, where there is
much weaknesse in knowledge. He is the <hi>him</hi> whom her soul
loveth, even now when she knows not where he is; and the most
grown believers may be sometimes brought to this low ebb in
their condition, for good ends, and for demonstrating the use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
and necessity of publick ordinances, even to them. 11. An
exercised soul prizeth most a Ministery; and such spiritual exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises
(as are here mentioned) do cherish their esteem of that
ordinance, when other debates among a people, often do derogat
from it's due esteem. 12. Ministers would not cast affection,
nor reject zeal in weak Christians, even though these be joyned
with some infirmities, and may occasion some more trouble to
themselves; But where sincerity is, there would be an overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
condescendence as to both these, and the questions of a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
soul should be by them intertained, as having learned at
their Master, not to break a bruised reed. 13. Tender exercised
souls usually confine their questions to their own souls case; There
is no abstract curious query here, nor for the fashion proposed,
nor any needlesse debate about extrinsick things, or the faults or
practice of others, but, <hi>Saw ye him whom my soul loveth?</hi> This is
the sore upon which she keeps her finger, and this is the wound
which she keeps bleeding, till he bind it up.</p>
                  <p>3. The successe of her meeting with the watchmen, and of this
query she puts to them, though it be not expressed, yet it's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
in the first words of the next verse, which being compared
with this, holds out two things, 1. That she did not presently
find an outgate from under her sad case, for she behoved to go
further. 2. It was but a little further that she is put to go, till
she find him; which sayes, that her endeavours were not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:65401:83"/>
fruitlesse. <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. Christ will sometimes let believers
know, that all means without him are empty, and that he is
astricted to none of them; yea, nor to any fellowship, no not of
the most powerful Minister. 2. Publick means do not alway bring
present ease unto believers under disquieting cases; yet, (to say
so) they dispose and make way for it in private; and one may get
the good of an Ordinance, and of fellowship with Ministers or
Christians, though not in the mean time, yet afterward even when
they are retired at home; and it's as good a time thereafter,
yea, and better for their behove.</p>
                  <p>If it be asked here, what we should judge of these watchmen, if
they were tender or not? The ground of the doubt is, because
<hi>chap.</hi> 5. 7. watchmen that are not tender are spoken of, which
yet are there said to find the Bride. <hi>Ans.</hi> There is a twofold
finding, 1. When one searches an exercised condition for this
end, that he may contribute something for the exercised persons
ease and help. 2. When one follows or searches after tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in others, that he may find some advantage against them,
thereby to make the heart of the righteous sad; the one finds, as
a friend finds another; the other, as an enemy, or mocker finds
another: The first sort of finding is to be understood here in this
Chapter, for the watch-men here, carry as friends; The second
sort of finding, <hi>chap.</hi> 5. 7. for there they carry as mockers<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap> Which
will appear by these differences, 1. Here she propones her case
to them for their help, it's like being encouraged thereto, by their
finding out her case before in the preaching of the Word, but
<hi>chap.</hi> 5. 7. she doth no such thing. 2. When they find her, <hi>chap.</hi>
5. 7. they smite her and put her to shame, which makes her silent;
but their finding her here, doth encourage her. 3. Though here
she find not Christ instantly, yet she sayes not as in the former
steps, <hi>I found him not,</hi> she could not altogether say so, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
after she finds him; but, <hi>chap.</hi> 5. she goes long seeking
him, after she meets with the watchmen; yea, goes from them
heavier, and more wounded than when she came: And this Song
being to hold forth the various conditions of a believer, and it
being incident to them sometimes to fall in tender hands, and
sometimes, yea, often in the hands of such as are rough and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:65401:84"/>
we judge it safest to understand this place of the first, and
<hi>chap.</hi> 5. of the last, and especially because this makes most for
the believers instruction and consolation, which is here aimed at,
and this is more suitable to the scope of the Song, than that both
should be underst<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>â€¢â€¢â€¢</desc>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>The beginning of this verse, contains the last step of the Brides
carriage, and also her desired successe, <hi>She went a little further,</hi>
and <hi>but a little,</hi> and <hi>she finds him whom her soul loveth:</hi> Publick
Ordinances and fellowship with godly men, are very useful and
necessary, but not to be rested on; and they who find not the
desired outgate by these, would not immediatly give over the
businesse as desperat and hopelesse; for, there is something even
beyond these to be aimed at, <hi>a little further</hi> must be gone, which
is the first thing in the verse: and we conceive it doth import
these two, 1. A more immediat going to Christ himself, (as if
the Ministers had said) ye must go over and beyond means, to
Christ himself, and denying these, lean and rest, and that wholly
on him: They go beyond means, that rest not on them, and are
denyed to them in the use of them, as that man, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17. 14.
that brought his son to the Disciples, to get the devil cast out,
and when that did it not, he went not away, but stayed for Christ
himself, and told the case to him: Christ can do when means fail,
and we would trust him, when they seem to disappoint us: How
fecklesse are the best of Ministers, when himself is not present?
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:65401:84"/>
2. This going <hi>a little further,</hi> doth not import the doing of any
duties she had not done, but a more vigorous and lively manner
of going about the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>e: There had some heartlesnesse, unbelief and
indisposition stuck to her, in all the former steps and struglings;
now she steps further in, and goes forward in the use of the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>e same
means; and not speaking to the Minister, when she finds that the
moving of his lips cannot asswage her grief, she looks thorow to
the Master, and vigorously addresses her self to the exercise of faith
in him, of prayer to him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in a more serious way than she had
done before. <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. Sometimes believers may say too much
weight on outward and publick means; they may rest too much
there, and go no further then these. 2. It's God's goodnesse,
by disappointments in means, to train his people on to a further
length of power and li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>e in their practice. 3. It may be when a
believer hath satisfied himself in going about all external means,
and that in the due order, and hath neglected none of them, that
there is still somewhat more to do, as to the bettering of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
frame. 4. It's not a desperat businesse, nor are believers
forthwith to conclude that their hope is pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ished, because they
have not attained their desire in the use of means for a time.
5. It's not a lesse practique in soul-exercises, to go over and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
means and ordinances in sueing for Christ, than to go about
them; and the last is no lesse necessary than the first. 6. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
in the use of means, would joyn these three together,
1. Making conscience of means; And yet, 2. For the successe,
looking higher than they; And, 3. Not stumbling when they find
not instantly ease, or satisfaction by them.</p>
                  <p>The second thing here, is her successe, which is according to
her desire, <hi>I found him</hi> (saith she) when I had pressed but a little
further, he sensibly and surprisingly made himself known to me.
<hi>Obs.</hi> 1. Christ is not far off from his people when they are seeking
him, whatever they may think when he hides himself. 2. They
who love Christ, and conscionably follow all means for obtaining
of him, are not far from finding, nor he far from manifesting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to them. 3. They who sincerely presse forward to the life
of O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>dinances beyond the form, and by faith take themselves to
Christ himself for the blessing, not resting on their performances,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:65401:85"/>
will not long misse Christ; yea, it may be, he will give them a
sensible manifestation of himself sooner than they are awar; for,
<hi>the Spirit is obtained, not by the works of the Law, but by the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Faith. Gal.</hi> 3. 2. 4. A soul that sincerely loves Christ,
should not, and when in a right frame will not give over seeking
Christ till it find him, whatever disappointments it meets with;
and sure, such will find him at last. 5. Christ found after much
search, will be very welcome, and his presence then will be most
discernable. 6. Believers would no lesse observe, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
their good successe in the means, than their disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
There are many who often make regrates of their bonds,
that are deficient in acknowledging Gods goodnesse when they
get liberty.</p>
                  <p>Next, In this verse we have her carriage set down, when she
hath found him; She doth not then lay-by diligence, as if all
were done, but is of new taken up, with as great care to retain
and improve this mercy, as before she was solicitous to attain it:
Whether a believer want or have; whether he be seeking or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying,
there is still matter of exercise for him in his condition.
This her care to retain Christ (which is the fourth thing in the
first part of this Chapter) is laid down in three steps. 1. She en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to hold him, that she again lose not the ground she had
gained. 2. She seeks to have other members of that same Church
getting good of Christ also: and these two are in this verse. 3. When
his presence is brought back to the Church and Ordinances, her
care is to admonish; yea, charge that he be entertained well with
them, lest they should provock him to be gone, <hi>vers.</hi> 5.</p>
                  <p>The first step then of her care is, <hi>I held him and would not let
him go,</hi> as a wife having found her husband, whom she much
longed-for, hangs on him lest he depart again, so doth she;
which is an expression both of her fear, love, care and faith.
This <hi>holding</hi> of Christ, and not letting him go, imports, 1. A
holy kind of violence, more than ordinary, wherewith the Bride
strives and wrestles to retain him. 2. That Christ (as it were)
waits for the believers consent in this wrestling, as he saith to
<hi>Iacob, Gen. 32. 26. I pray let me go:</hi> which upon the matter
seems to say, I will not go, if thou wilt hold me, and have me
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:65401:85"/>
stay. 3. It imports an importunat adhering to him, and not
consenting upon any terms to quit him. And lastly, it imports
the singular and inexpressible satisfaction she had in him; her ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
life lay in the keeping him still with her, and therefore she
holds him, and cannot think of parting with him. Now this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of Christ (being spiritual) cannot be understood in a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
way, nor can they be carnal grips that retain him; and his
power being omnipotent, it cannot be the force of a frail crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
that prevails, but it is here as in <hi>Hos.</hi> 12. 2, 3. In <hi>Iacob's</hi>
prevailing, <hi>he wept and made supplication,</hi> that is, an humble,
ardent sueing to him by prayer, with a lively exercise of faith
on his promises (whereby he allows his people to be pressing)
ingageth him to stay; He is tyed by his own love that is in his
heart, and his faithfulnesse in his promises, that he will not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw,
and deny them that, for which they make supplication to
him, more than if he were by their strength prevailed over, and
overcome; as a little weeping child will hold it's mother or
nurse, not because it is stronger then she, but because the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
bowels so constrains her, as she cannot almost, though she
would leave that child; So Christ's bowels earning over a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever,
are that which here holds him, that he cannot go; He
cannot go because he will not. Here we have ground to observe
the importunatnesse of sincere love, which is such, as with a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wilfulnesse it holds to Christ and will not quit him, as <hi>Iacob</hi>
said, <hi>I will not let thee go.</hi> 2. We may observe here the power
of lively <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>aith (to which nothing is impossible) love and faith
will stick to Christ against his own seeming intreaties, till they
gain their point, and will prevail, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 28. 3. See here the
condescending, the wonderful condescending of the Almighty, to
be held by his own creature; to be, as it were, at their disposal, <hi>I
pray thee let me go, Gen.</hi> 32. 26. and <hi>Exod. 32. 10. Let me alone,
Moses;</hi> So long as a believer will not consent to quit Christ, so
long keeps their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>aith grip of him, and he will not offend at this
importunity; ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>, he is exceedingly well pleased with it: It
cannot be told how effectual prayer and faith would be, if ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
and vigorous.</p>
                  <p>The second step of her carriage, which is the scope of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:65401:86"/>
namely of her holding him, is in these words, <hi>till I had
brought him to my mothers house, to the chambers of her that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
me.</hi> By <hi>mother</hi> in Scripture is understood the visible
Church, which is even the believers mother, <hi>Hos.</hi> 2. 2. Say to
<hi>Ammi</hi> (my people) plead with your <hi>mother.</hi> So <hi>chap.</hi> 1. 6. this
mother hath children, both after the flesh, and after the spirit,
the former hating the latter; And, <hi>chap.</hi> 8. 5. It's the mother
that hath Ordinances, for the Brides instruction. The Church
visible is called the <hi>mother,</hi> because, 1. By the immortal seed of
the Word, the Lord begets believers in his Church, to which he
is Husband, and the Father of these children, she the wife and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that conceives them, and brings them up. 2. Because of
the Covenant-tye that stands betwixt God and the visible
Church, whereby she may claim right to him as her Husband (the
Covenant being the marriage-contract betwixt God and the
Church) which is therefore the ground of the former relation of
mother. Again, Christ is said to be <hi>brought</hi> into the Church, not
only when his Ordinances are pure in her, (which is supposed to
be here already; for, <hi>vers.</hi> 3. there were watchmen doing their
duty, and dispensing pure Ordinances) but when there is life in
them, the presence and countenance of his Spirit going along with
them, that they may be powerful for the end appointed: as it
was one thing to have the Temple, the type of his Church, and
another, to have God's presence singularly in it; So it's one
thing to have pure Ordinances set up in the Church, and another,
to have Christ's presence filling them with power: Now (saith
she) when I got Christ, I knew there was many fellow-members
of that same Church, that had need of him, and I was importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
that he might manifest himself in his Ordinances there, for
their and my good. Church-Ordinances, are the allowed
and ordinary mean of keeping fellowship with Christ, and they are
all empty when he is not there. <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. That even true belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
have the visible Church for their mother, and it's written
of them as their priviledge, that <hi>they were born there<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Psal.</hi> 87. 4, 5.
2. Believers should not disclaim the Church in which they are
spiritually begotten and born, nor their fellow-members there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in;
but reverence her as the mother that gave them life, and
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:65401:86"/>
carry respectively toward her as such; <hi>Honour thy father and thy
mother</hi> being a moral command, and the first with promise. See
<hi>Psal.</hi> 122. 3, 6. 3. When believers get neerest Christ for themselvs,
it's then the fit time to deal with him for others, especially for
the Church whereof they are members: It's <hi>Moses</hi> only expresse
suit, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 9. when God admits him to his company (in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
whereof it's said, <hi>vers.</hi> 8. he made haste) <hi>I pray thee, O
Lord, go amongst us.</hi> 4. It's true tendernesse, when one is admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to more neernesse with God than others, not to separat from
the Church whereof they were members, and as it were to carry
Christ to their own chamber; but to endeavour to have Christ
brought also to the Church, that what is wanting of life amongst
her members, or the rest of the children, may be made up by his
presence. 5. They who are tender of their own comfort, and of
retaining Christ's presence with themselves, will be carefull
to have others not yet sensible of their need of it, nor acquaint
with it, made partakers thereof also. 6. Believers in their seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
applications to Christ for the Church whereof they are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
may prevail much, and have much influence for obtaining
his presence there, and for the putting of every thing in a better
frame for the good of others. 7. A kindly member of the
Church, is brought up ordinarily in that Church, and by that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
where they were conceived, therefore she goes back to her
mothers house, for they have breasts to nourish, who have a womb

kind spouse living in her mothers house, having after long seeking
found her husband, will be desirous to have him home with her,
not only for their mutual solace, but for the comfort of all the
family; so do believers, living yet in the Church, desire to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
their credit and court with Christ, for the good of the
whole Church, that where she was conceived, others may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
also: Where Christ's Ordinances are, there ordinarily are
children begotten to God; and where a Church conceives seed,
and brings forth to him, it's a token he hath not given her a bill
of divorce, nor will disclaim her to be his wife; so much lesse,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:65401:87"/>
the children ought not to disclaim her as their mother: It's a
shame that many who professe to be children, either are not yet
conceived, or the mother that conceived them, is dispised by
them; It's strange if the Father will owne such as children, who
not only cry out against, but curse their mother, and place a piece
of Religion in this.</p>

him well, and not to provoke him to withdraw. These words
were spoken-to in the former Chapter, <hi>vers.</hi> 7. where they have
the same general scope, which is to shew her care of having Christ
retained; but in this they differ, there they look to her parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular

and blessing (to say so) in his Church: Now (saith she)
Christ is amongst you, O ye who are of my mothers house, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
of putting him away; and in this she deals with them, as
considered in their visible Church-state and relation, and not as
real believers; the charge being to all: And therefore in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
verse, and <hi>chap.</hi> 8. 5. The Daughters return an answer,
which they do not, <hi>chap.</hi> 2. 7. because here she directs her words
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:65401:87"/>
to the visible professors, whereas, <hi>chap.</hi> 2. 7. her scope was only
to compose her self, seing the presence she injoyed, was only to
her particular sense. Here, <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. As there is more of Christ's
sensible presence, and also of distance from him, in his way with
particular believers at one time than at another<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> so is there, in
respect of his way to his Church, sometime he is not in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
house, sometimes he is. 2. As every believer should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to retain Christ in his presence with their own souls; so
all the members of a visible Church, should be careful to prevent
his departure from his Ordinances. 3. Often it's with Christ's
presence in his Church, as it's with the condition of particular
believers in it; if they be secure, and he away from them, then
often he is from the <hi>mothers house</hi> also; if they be lively, and he
with them, then he is brought back again to the Church with
them. 4. As Christ may withdraw, if provocked and not enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
from a private believer; so will he do from a Church, if
they hold not fast what they have received, and walk not answerably
thereto. 5. Church-members, by their sins, have much influence
on Christ's removal from amongst them; yea, sometimes it may
come to passe (when the body of a Church turn despisers of the
Gospel) that no intercession of the godly for preventing his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture,
will prevail, even though <hi>Noah, Daniel</hi> and <hi>Iob</hi> were
amongst them, <hi>Ier.</hi> 15. 1. and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14. 14. 6. Believers that
know the hazard of provocking Christ, and what a loss the loss of
his presence is, would interpose seriously with new unexperienced
beginners, and give them warning faithfully concerning this their
hazard. 7. As a believer, in respect of the visible Church, stands
under the relation of a childe to a mother; so in respect of visible
professors, they stand under the relation of brethren and sisters,
and would keep religious communion with them, even as such,
that being an external duty that lyeth upon them. 8. True love
to Christ, will be affected even with the wrongs that others do
to him who is their beloved, and will endeavour to prevent his
being wronged and provocked, as she doth here. 9. True love
to others, will not only put to pray and interceed for them, and
employ all the court the believer hath with Christ for their good
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:65401:88"/>
(as the Bride did in the former verse) but will also manifest it
self in giving faithful admonitions, advertisements, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in

more than ordinary (as ordinarily Christ's return to a
Church and his Ordinances in it, after a palpable decay, hath
some stir and affectionat-like motions accompanying it, such as
was to be found in <hi>Iohn</hi>'s hearers, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 35.) And in this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected

is this? say they, importing they have more respect to the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and shew forth more evidences of it in their expressions, than
ever they used formerly to do.</p>
                  <p>That these are the words of the Daughters of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> may
be cleared from these things, 1. That they are placed on the
back of her charge to them; and when she charges, they use to
answer (as <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 9. and 8. 5.) and then she proceeds to speak
to them, even so it is here; for, the words hold forth a mutual
conference betwixt her and them, and therefore the words of
this verse will be most pertinently understood as spoken by them.
2. They are the same words on the matter, and spoken on the
same occasion, with these, <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. 5. which we will find to be
spoken by them. 3. They can agree to none other. To say,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:65401:88"/>
they are the words of Angels, is not warrantable, they not being
a speaking party in this Song: To say, they are the Brides own
words, will not sute with the commendation that is given to
her, and of her in them, as by a distinct party: Neither can they
be Christ's words spoken immediatly by him; for, <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. 5.
where these words upon the matter are repeated, she
is said to ascend, <hi>leaning on her beloved;</hi> and he is spoken
of, and looked on as a third, both from the Bride and the
speaker. It remains then, that they must be the words of the
<hi>daughters of Ierusalem,</hi> wondering at the change that was to be
seen on the Church, her case being now compared with what it
was before; and wondering at believers in her, upon the same
account also, as almost mistaking them, and so they speak as having
other affections to them than they had before. It's like that
wondering expression, <hi>Isa.</hi> 49. 21. Thou shall say (to wit, when
the sudden change comes) <hi>Who hath begotten me these?</hi> or, as it
is, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 9. where it's promised to the Church of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi>
that others should <hi>fall down, and worship at her feet,</hi> as being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
now, that Christ <hi>loves</hi> his Church. And that this verse
is spoken of the Bride, the words in the Original, being in the
feminine gener, puts it out of question; for, they are in the
Original, as if it were said, <hi>Who is she that cometh up,</hi> &amp;c?</p>
                  <p>The words contain a commendation of the Church, expressed
both in the matter, and also in the manner of the expression
(being by way of question) and it is given by visible Professors,
some whereof may be more tender than others, yet both contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>distinguished
from the Bride. The commendation hath three
parts or steps. 1. <hi>She cometh,</hi> or (as it's <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. 5.) <hi>ascends
from the wildernesse;</hi> It's like before this manifestation of Christ,
the Church was dry and withered-like, in a wildernesse condition,
without any beauty or lustre; but now that condition is changed,
when Christ is present, she ascends and comes out of it: And
this wildernesse (considering her ascent from it) signifies the
World, wherein believers sojourn in the way to Heaven (as <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi>
did in the wildernesse to <hi>Canaan</hi>) and wherein there is no
true content, nor satisfying rest sought by them, nor to be found
by any, therefore is their back on it, though formerly they seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:65401:89"/>
to be settled in it with the rest of the World; Thus the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venlinesse
of believers in their conversation is set out. 2. She
comes like <hi>pillars of smoak;</hi> This looks not in all things to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
smoak, but (as the after-words do clear) to the <hi>smoak
of incense,</hi> &amp;c. Now she ascends like smoak in a calm-day, and
like pillars of it together, making heaven-ward, as the smoak of
incense, which being commanded in God's worship, was accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to him: And as smoak fleeing from kindled fire cannot but
ascend, and fire (especially new kindled) cannot but have smoak,
and that in abundance; so now the Church being warmed, and of
fresh inflamed and made lively with Christ's presence, cannot but
send out a sweet savour, which discernably ascends upward from
the world (which is but a wildernesse) as smoak doth from the
earth.</p>
                  <p>3. She is <hi>perfumed with Myrrhe and Frankincense, and all the
pouders of the merchant:</hi> That is, as precious pouders are used
to make one savoury, so the believer being replenished with the
graces of Christ's spirit, (often in this Song compared to sweet
spices, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 12. and 4. 6. 13. 14. 16. &amp;c.) and these graces
being now quickned by his presence, they cast a delightful sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to them with whom such believers converse: So it was, <hi>Act.
2. ult.</hi> and the ordinances, being powerful and lively, will have
such a powerful influence, as to be a <hi>sweet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

2. Cor.</hi> 2. 14, 15. and to leave some conviction of their amiable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and excellency, even upon the consciences of these who will
never get good of them, so that there is no costly ointment or
pouder, that will so per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ume a person or place, as the Gospel
will do a Church; especially when immediatly on the back of
Christ's return, he doth in an extraordinary manner countenance
the dispensing of his own Ordinances, so that even the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary
believer is made in a manner, to receive the Gospel
with joy.</p>
                  <p>Next, the manner of the expression is by way of question, and
admiration, <hi>Who is this?</hi> say they, we never saw the like of her,
she hath no match; and so the question expresseth a wonderful
beauty and lovelinesse in her, and a great conviction and astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in them. In reference to which two, these things are to
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:65401:89"/>
be learned. 1. That there is nothing more lovely and savoury
in it self, than grace exercised in a believers walk, and Christ's
Ordinances beautified with his own presence in his Church.
2. That where Christ's Ordinances in his Church, and the graces
of his Spirit in the hearts of his people are made lively with his
presence, they will be in their beauty very discernable to others,
and will be much admired, spoken of, and commended by them.
3. That this beauty is usually most fresh, when Christ returns to
his people and Church, after he hath been a while away; for, then
tendernesse is in life amongst them. 4. The world in it self, and
being compared with Christ's Church (especially in their
estimation, whose eyes God hath opened) is but a miserable
wildernesse, and cannot give a heartsome being or place of abode
to a believer. 5. Believers have a more noble design to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe,
than to sit down and take up their rest in this world, their
faces bend upward, and their backs are upon it. 6. Christ's
presence gives life to a believers motion, and ravisheth them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
as fire put to fewel, necessitats smoak to ascend. 7. A hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly-minded
believer is a comely sight, and a world-denyed
Professor will extort a commendation, even from ordinary on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lookers.
8. As there is more of the exercise of true grace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
believers, by Christ's more than ordinary presence with
them, and in his Church; so there is often a more than ordinary
warmnesse and motion in the generality of Church-members at
such a time, whereof yet many may be unsound, as no question
all the daughters of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> were not sound. 9. The Church
of Christ and believers in it, will look much more beautiful to
Prefessors at one time than at another, and they will be much
more taken with this beauty sometimes than at other times; for,
<hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 5. 6. The daughters of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> were in hazard to
stumble at her spots; here they are ravished with her beauty, as
thinking her another thing than she was before. 10. Christ's
presence will indeed put another face, both on a Church and
person, and make them every way different (but still to the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter)
from what they were. 11. The more active, believers be in
exercising their graces, they will have the more fresh relish and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor;
for, her <hi>ascending</hi> here, makes all her persumes to flow.</p>

excellent steps, wherein by a notable gradation, <hi>Solomon</hi> is ever
mentioned, his name (who was a special type of Christ) being

1. From his bed, <hi>vers.</hi> 7, 8. Whereby is set forth, the
excellent happinesse and quietnesse that believers have in injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

which is signified that excellent mean (to wit, the Covenant of

brings his people to his rest, <hi>vers.</hi> 9, 10. 3. She propounds his

and glory of his love, beyond which there is no step to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
but here she <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ists, and willeth all others to be taken up,
in <hi>beholding him,</hi> as the only desirable and heart-ravishing ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
<hi>vers.</hi> 11.</p>
                  <p>For opening of the first, in the 7. and 8. verses, we have
these five things to consider. 1 Who this <hi>Solomon</hi> is. 2. What
this <hi>bed</hi> is. 3. What this guard, that is about it, doth signifie.
4. For what end that guard is appointed. 5. The use of the
note of attention, <hi>Behold,</hi> which is prefixed.</p>
                  <p>1. By <hi>Solomon, David</hi>'s son, properly is not understood, this
scope will not agree to him (he was indeed a great King, but a
greater than <hi>Solomon</hi> is here) Therefore, seing in Scripture,
<hi>Solomon</hi> was typical of Christ, as from <hi>Psal.</hi> 72. and other places
may be gathered: Through all these verses, by <hi>Solomon,</hi> is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
Christ, the beloved and Bridegroom, who especially
was typified by <hi>Solomon</hi> in these things: 1. <hi>Solomon</hi> had a great
Kingdom from the river to the Sea; and so will our Lord have
many subjects. 2. As <hi>Solomon</hi> was, so Christ is, a powerful, rich
King; our Lord Jesus hath all power in Heaven and Earth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to him. 3. <hi>Solomon</hi> was a royal, magnificent King, sought
unto from all parts of the earth; and so the name and glory,
wherewith the Mediator is furnished, is abov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap> every name in
Heaven and in Earth. 4. <hi>Solomon</hi> was a wise, judicious King<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
and singular for that; and so in our Lord Jesus <hi>dwells all the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:65401:91"/>
treasures of wisdom and knowledge;</hi> there is no need to fear that
any thing that concerns his people will miscarry in his hand.
5. <hi>Solomon</hi> had a peaceable reign (for which cause he had that
name) and his government was blessed and happy to his people
and servants; and so our Lord Jesus is the <hi>Prince of peace, Isa.</hi>
9. 6. and of <hi>his government</hi> there is no change; and happy are his
subjects, and <hi>blessed are his servants,</hi> for the <hi>one half</hi> of his <hi>glory,
magnificence, wisdom,</hi> &amp;c. and of their happinesse can neither be
told nor believed. This is an excellent person, and a most state<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
King, who yet is the believers Bridegroom; Christ's Bride is
nobly and honourably matched.</p>
                  <p>2. By <hi>bed</hi> here, is understood the same thing that was signified
by it, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 16. to wit, that accesse, and neernesse familiarity
that the believer hath with Christ, and whereunto he admits
them that are his; and the rest, solace and refreshment that they
injoy in fellowship with him; <hi>Beds</hi> being especially appointed
for these two, 1. For refreshing and rest, <hi>Isa.</hi> 57. 2. and <hi>Psal.</hi>
132. 3. 2. For the mutual fellowship of Husband and Wife: So
then, by this is holden forth the excellent refreshing, and soul-ease,
that a believer may have in the injoying of Christ: There
is no bed that can give quietnesse, rest and solace like this. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
it's called <hi>his bed,</hi> 1. To distinguish it from hers, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 1.
There is great odds betwixt the two, as was hinted upon that
verse. 2. To shew, that although she be admitted to it (and
therefore it's called <hi>ours, chap.</hi> 1. 16.) yet it's wholly procured
and framed by him alone. 3. It's called <hi>his,</hi> to shew the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
that a believer hath with Christ in his refreshings. O
sweet! It's Christ's own bed, if he lye well, they lye well who
are married to him; It's his peace which they injoy here, <hi>my
peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 27.
And it's his glory and throne, that they are made partakers of
hereafter, when they are set down on the same throne with him.
Again, it's called <hi>his bed, which is Solomon's:</hi> which expression, is
added, to shew where the weight of this wonderful refreshing lyes,
to wit, in this, that the rest (which he invits them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold)
is no mean man's, it's <hi>Solomon's;</hi> yea, a greater than <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon's,</hi>
whose curtains and hangings are much above his, <hi>chap.</hi> 1. 6.
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:65401:91"/>
If <hi>Solomon's</hi> servants were happy that were admitted to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
how wonderfully happy are believers, Christ's Bride, who
are admitted to his own bed: The dignity of believing and
union with him, would be read out of the dignity and glorious
Majesty of the person with whom we are united.</p>
                  <p>3. There is a guard mentioned here, which in relation to
Christ, shews his statelinesse, and in relation to us, shews our safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and security, that as Kings (and it's like <hi>Solomon</hi>) used to be
attended by guards, for statelinesse and security, that quietly they
may rest (their guards watching about them) so this rest that a
believer hath in Christ, O it's sure! there is an excellent guard
compassing them about. It is particularly described, 1. In it's
number, they are <hi>sixty,</hi> that is a competent and sufficient num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.
2. They are <hi>valiant,</hi> gallant, couragious men, that will not
fail to execute orders: They are the <hi>choice men of Israel,</hi> that
<hi>Solomon</hi> had to watch his bed, they are <hi>choice ones</hi> our Lord
makes use of for the security of believers. 3. They are orderly
disposed for their security, they are <hi>about it,</hi> on all hands, there
can be no approach made upon believers, to the prejudice of the
repose they have in Christ. 4. They are well armed; yea, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
at their arms, in a posture of defence, <hi>they all hold swords,</hi>
none of them wants arms, and they have them still in readinesse.
5. They are not only stout, but skilfull, <hi>expert</hi> men, who have
been tryed and well proven: None of his people needs to suspect
Christ's watch over them, dexterous is he in preserving poor
souls. 6. <hi>Every one hath his sword girt on his thigh,</hi> and is stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at his post. All the expressions tend to shew that here, and
here only, in Christ's bed may a soul rest secure; there is no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
for wrath to seize upon them that are in Christ, nor to devils
to pull them from Christ; for, He and his Father are stronger then
all, and none is able to pluck them out of his hand. Believers
have a notable security and defence, Christ's bed and his guard,
if he be sure, they are sure, one watch watcheth both him and her.
The same power of God, <hi>Isa.</hi> 27. 2. the <hi>twenty thousand of Angels,</hi>
which are his <hi>Chariots, Psal.</hi> 68. 17. are for the believers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
in Christ's company, <hi>pitching their tents about them,</hi> Psal.
34. 8. In a word, they are not only guarded with Angels, but
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:65401:92"/>
with divine attributes, the wisdom and power of God, and this
makes them dwell in safety.</p>
                  <p>4. The end of all this, is, <hi>for fear in the night;</hi> There are no
nights to Christ himself, and so no fear; yea, <hi>Solomon</hi> the type,
having such a peaceable kingdom, it's not like he had much fear;
but the fear is in respect of believers, who are admitted to
Christ's company and fellowship: For preventing their fears, he
hath settled all firmly, as if guards were set for their security.
Hence we gather, that the believer is supposed to be in the bed
with him, otherwise there is no use of this guard; and <hi>his bed</hi>
here is a piece of work that is framed not only for himself, but
also for the Daughters of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> as the following Chariot is.
By <hi>night</hi> here is understood believers darknesse and lightlesse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
(to speak so) wherein fears, doubts, challenges, &amp;c. are
most ready to assault, as afrightments use to befall men in the
night. These words, <hi>because of fear</hi> in the night, hold forth the
use that our <hi>Solomon</hi> hath of that guard, to wit, for quieting his
poor people, against the doubtings, difficulties, discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and such-like, whereto believers are so subject in
their drooping, night-conditions; though when light shines, they
are little troubled. These words shew, 1. That Christ's Bride
admitted to fellowship with him, may have her black and dark
nights. 2. That believers, who have thought themselves above
doubtings and fears, when things went well with them; yet in
nights of temptation, darknesse and tryal they may be overtaken
with, many sad fears; It's not alwayes day with them, and when
it's night with them, they are apt to fear. 3. That believers in
their nights, and under their fears, have good security and an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
guard; yea, their safety and defence is as good then, as
when there is no night nor fear; how dark soever their night be,
Christ's guard will sufficiently preserve them. 4. Christ is ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
even of believers fears, and hath provided so well for their
peace, as he hath appointed means not only to prevent their hurt,
but also to prevent their fears: For, <hi>because of fear</hi> hath he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
this guard. 5. There is no King or Monarch so well at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
and guarded, or who may sleep so secure and sound as a
believer: His guard is still at their post, and they are valiant
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:65401:92"/>
men, that cannot fail; for, 1. He is at peace with God; and he
that is within the peace of God, hath the warrand, right and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of it to <hi>guard the heart and mind,</hi> Phil. 4. 7. 2. The
believer hath all the promises, and confirmations of Oath and
Seals, in which it is impossible for God to lie, to secure and quiet
him. 3. He hath the watch of <hi>Angels, Psal. 34. 7. pitching their
tents about him,</hi> and <hi>chariots of Angels</hi> waiting on him. 4. He
hath God himself, and his Almighty power for his defence, who
<hi>alone</hi> may make <hi>him dwell in safety,</hi> wherefore he may ly down
with confidence, and also <hi>sleep</hi> with quietnesse, <hi>Psal.</hi> 4. 8. It's
good sleeping in Christ's bed, there is not so good rest to be
found any where in the World: So then, by the guard is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
whatever contributes for confirming believers faith, and
strengthening them against their fears of being interupted in their
rest, which (being in Christ) is allowed upon them.</p>
                  <p>5. A <hi>behold</hi> is prefixed to all this, and that deservedly. 1. To
shew the wonderfulnesse of what she was to say, O how wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
is it, if beleeved! 2. To provoke and stir up to observe and
take notice of it; few are acquaint with believers priviledges,
and if they had not been recorded in the word, we durst never
have likened or evened our selves to them. 3. It's to shew an
holy impatiency in her affection, in breaking in so with this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
as more servently desirous to fill their mouths and hearts
with the commending of Christ, than what they were about in
commending of her: A notable diversion, and sign of love in a
friend of the Bridegroom, who with <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist is content
to decrease, so he may increase: True believers should and will
endeavour more the commendation of Christ, in their fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
together, than to commend any grace, gift, or what else they
have gotten from him; they will not conceit, or cry up their
graces and gifts as they are theirs, for that were base ingratitude,
but withall they mention what they have received, partly to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dear
him to themselves, and partly to commend him to others;
and thus they design to return him his own with advantage, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
nevertheless they are the gainers, even while they seem to give
what they have received.</p>

                  <p>The second piece of work, mentioned, for the commendation
of the Worker, is a Chariot, described at large <hi>vers</hi> 9, 10. For
clearing of the words, we are to inquire concerning these three
things. 1. It's Worker or Former. 2. The end for which it
is framed. 3. Concerning this Chariot it self.</p>
                  <p>The author or maker thereof, is <hi>Solomon,</hi> and that <hi>King Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
that is Christ, as was cleared before, he is mentioned thrice
under this name; but there is a gradation here that is observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
1. He is called <hi>Solomon, vers. 7. 2. King Solomon, vers.</hi> 9.
3. <hi>King Solomon crowned,</hi> or, <hi>crowned King Solomon, vers.</hi> 11.
The longer she speaks of Christ, and insists in mentioning his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency,
her thoughts draw the deeper, she sets him up the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and becomes warmer in her apprehensions, affections and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
concerning him: Acquaintance with him, would make
one speak eloquently of him; He that is the worker and former
of this Chariot, is a most excellent King, it must needs then be
a stately, royal piece of work.</p>
                  <p>2. There are two ends mentioned wherefore he makes it,
1. It's <hi>to himself,</hi> that is, for his own glory, and that thereby he
may in a special way hold forth himself to be glorious, and that
particularly in his grace; for, though he made all things for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
yet is he said especially to manifest his glory in doing good
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:65401:93"/>
to his people; and what serves for the manifestation of his grace,
is in a peculiar manner made for himself: So <hi>Isa.</hi> 43. 7. and 21;
<hi>This people have I formed for my self</hi> (in a far other way than he
formed other nations) <hi>they shall</hi> (in a singular way) <hi>shew forth
my praise,</hi> that is, the praise of his goodnesse, wherein his way
was peculiar to them: And the paving of this Chariot with love,
and appointing of it for the daughters of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> doth confirm
this also, that it's the praise of grace that especially shines in this
piece of work. And so the second end, subordinat to the former,
is in the end of <hi>vers.</hi> 10. in these words, <hi>for the daughters of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi>
that is, for their good that are weak and far short of
perfection; it's not only fitted for his glory, but also, it's fitted
and confirmed to them, so as it may procure and bring about
their good. <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. In the greatest pieces of Christ's workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
he had mind of poor sinners yet unglorified, his <hi>delight</hi>
was with them <hi>before the world was, Prov.</hi> 8. 31. 2. The glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
of grace is the great thing Christ aimes at in all his contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
and way toward his Church and people. 3. He hath knit
his own glory and the good of his people together; that same
work which is for himself, is also for them, that if he obtain his
end, they cannot but be well; his glory and their good, <hi>ride</hi>
(to say so) <hi>in one Chariot.</hi> 4. For as stately a person as our Lord
Jesus is, he disdains not to be occupied in making works, and as
it were framing Chariots, for the behoove of his people: Rather
than they should want what may further them in their way, he will
make and furnish them himself.</p>
                  <p>3. The third thing is the work it self, which indeed is very ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable,
as the worker and ends are: It's <hi>a Chariot,</hi> several wayes
described, both in it's matter, form and furniture. The word
translated <hi>Chariot</hi> is no where else in Scripture, it's translated <hi>bed</hi>
on the margent, it's by the <hi>Septuagints</hi> expressed by such a word
as signifieth, to be <hi>carried,</hi> and to <hi>carry,</hi> as Chariots and Litters
(wherein men are carried) used to be carried by horse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>: We
think it fitly expressed by <hi>Chariot,</hi> not only because the word is
different from that which is translated <hi>bed, vers.</hi> 7. but, 1. The
immediat end and use seems to be different also; for, as stately
King's use their beds for repose and rest, in their chambers, and
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:65401:94"/>
their Chariots to ride in, when they go abroad, and wherein their
Queens may ride with them; so is it here. As Christ hath a
bed for believers quieting, he hath also a Chariot for safe convoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and carrying them thorow their journey, till they come to
their compleet rest, this being no lesse necessary for believers
(such as the daughters of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> are) than the former.</p>
                  <p>In short, by this <hi>chariot</hi> we understand the way of Redemption
in general, as it is contrived in the eternal counsel of God, and
so called the Covenant of Redemption, and also as it's preached
and manifested to us in the Gospel. The reasons why we thus
apply it, are, not only because there is no other thing that it will
agree unto; for, 1. It's a work of Christ, and so not Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
2. It's a work of special grace for his own, and that while
they are in the way (for the Elect in heaven are not daughters of
<hi>Ierusalem</hi>) therefore it's no common work of creation, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
or of glory in heaven. 3. It's for the Churches good,
and therefore cannot be understood of her; for, beside that the
several parts of it's description will not suit her, not only Christ,
but the daughters of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> are to be born in this chariot:
And we know not a fourth thing imaginable, that can be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
by it, but the Covenant of Redemption revealed in the
Gospel. But, 2. The Covenant of Redemption is that work of
Christ's, wherein most eminently the glory of his grace and love
to sinners doth appear, which makes him wonderful lovely and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable;
(to set forth which is the present scope) It therefore
must be here understood. 3. That work is signified by this
<hi>Chariot,</hi> whereby Christ communicats his love to poor sinners,
and caries them through, therefore it's said to be <hi>paved with love</hi>
for that end; Now there is no partaking of special love from
Christ, but by this Covenant, nor was there ever another mean
made, or appointed for convoying love to them, or for bringing
them through to the partaking of it, but this same Covenant,
therefore it must be understood. 4. All that is spoken of this
<hi>Chariot,</hi> as it will be applicable to no other thing, so will it well
agree to the Covenant of Redemption manifested and preached
in the Gospel. 1. It may well be compared to a <hi>Chariot,</hi> because
by it poor believers are carried through as in a Chariot, born up
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:65401:94"/>
and sustained by it, even in the way: Yea, in it and by it they
triumph, and ride as in triumph, (as he in this Gospel rides pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperously)
and if it be that wherein he rides, it must be that
wherein they ride also, and therefore well compared to a Chariot,
because both he and they triumph by it. 2. It's eminently and
peculiarly Christ's workmanship, he made this Covenant for their
behoove, and entred himself surety, undertaking for them, when
there was none upon their side of the Covenant to undertake but
he the Mediator; and therefore is he stiled Jesus and Redeemer,
and it's by his purchase (having procured this unto them) that
they are admitted to it, and carried through in it. 3. It's in a
peculiar way contrived and framed for the glory of his grace, and
the good of his people, as hath been said; by it is manifested in
the Church the manifold wisdom of God, and the riches of the
grace of Christ; If ever a piece of work was made for the good
of sinners, and the glory of grace, this is it, without which all the
creatures had been uncomfortable; yea, hurtful to them. 4. It
may be said to be of the <hi>wood of Lebanon,</hi> that is excellent and
durable, for so the wood of Lebanon was, for which cause it was
made use of in building of the Temple; and so all the materials
of this Covenant, and it's properties are excellent and durable,
it's an everlasting Covenant, that fails not, and vanishes not away,
but endures for ever. 5. The form is suitable also, <hi>He made the
pillars thereof</hi> (saith she) <hi>of Silver;</hi> pillars in a piece of work sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify,
1. Decoring. 2. Order-lines. 3. Statelinesse, for which
cause when <hi>wisdom builds her house,</hi> Prov. 9. 1, 2. <hi>she heweth out
seven pillars;</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> made <hi>pillars</hi> for the Temple, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions
whereof signified their end and use, <hi>Iachin</hi> and <hi>Boaz,
stability</hi> and <hi>strength, 2 Chron.</hi> 3. 17. And they are as <hi>silver pillars</hi>
to shew their excellency, and so this Covenant hath precious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
as the pillars thereof, able to support believers, and hath
all these so well ordered and contrived that every thing is excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
in it's own place; This <hi>Covenant is therefore said to be well
ordered in all things and sure,</hi> the pillars will not shrink, shake, nor
bow, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23 5. 6. It hath a <hi>bottom</hi> and that of <hi>Gold:</hi> A bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
is to shew it's stability and firmnesse, to sustain and keep up
these who ride in it, and Gold shews it solidity and preciousnesse,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:65401:95"/>
it's a rich bottom, therefore the new <hi>Ierusalem</hi> is said to have
her streets of <hi>pure Gold, Rev.</hi> 21. 22. So this Covenant hath a sure
foundation, elect and precious; this Covenant cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bottom'd,
and sinners cannot fall through, if once in it. 7. It hath
<hi>a covering,</hi> and that <hi>of purple:</hi> A cover is to preserve and save from
any thing that may fall from above; and Purple or Scarlet (for
in Scripture both are one, as may be seen, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27. 28. compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with <hi>Mark</hi> 15. 17.) sets out the excellency and efficacy of
that cover, it's not of every thing, it's of Purple; and this in
Scripture was made use of to be dipt in the blood of the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14. which was called, <hi>vers. 20. the blood of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi>
typifing the application of Christ's blood: This is the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
of the Covenant, the worth and efficacy of Christ's satisfaction,
whereby all in Covenant (as it were riding in this Chariot) are
preserved from the wrath of God, and their sins hid, and so co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
by that blood, that they are never called to a reckoning for
them, <hi>Psal. 32. 1, 2. Ier. 50. 20. 8. The midst thereof is paved
with love:</hi> What can this be? Gold is much, but love is more;
what workman but Christ can make this pavement? and what
piece of work of his, but the Covenant of Redemption, is so
lined and stuffed with love? <hi>The midst thereof</hi> is the inward of it,
as great men in their Chariots and Coaches, have their pillows
and cushions of Velvets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to repose them; But here there is
a far other thing, to repose and rest upon, love lines all this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot,
so that there is none in the Covenant, but love is still next
them, the Word speaks good to them, and all the Promises run
like pipes, with streams of love to them; God's dispensations
toward them breath out love, they walk on love, sit on love, rest
on love; it must be good to be here: And love is reserved for
the midst of it, to shew, that though it's excellency and beauty
may some-way shine, and glister to these that are without; yet,
none knows or can know the heart and bowels of the Covenant,
(to say so) and the love that is there, but these that are within.
2. Love is put over the bottom of Gold, and made the pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
1. Because love in this Covenant condescends lowest to
us, and there can be no lower stooping imaginable, than that to
which the love of Christ hath made him bow. 2. It's love that
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:65401:95"/>
makes the riches of Christ applicable to us, we could not walk on
that Gold, if love paved it not, the freedom of his grace and love
makes all refreshful; the believer, even though a sinner, may ride
and rest here. 3. It's to hearten a sinner to come in and close
with this Covenant, and it shews what fits it to be a Chariot for
them to ride in, it's the pavement of love; a sinner may leap
here, there is no hazard to fall, or if he fall, he falls soft, for it's
upon love: There will be no rejecting of a sinner that would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and fit down in it, why? they are to fit, stand, and lye on love,
which will cover their infirmities, and not contend, otherwise there
would be no accesse to it, nor abiding in it, it would cast them
out. Thus doth grace shine in the Covenant, as the lineing and
inside of all the promises, when they are seen, therefore is it pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly
called the Covenant of grace. 9. It's <hi>for the daughters
of Ierusalem;</hi> all the work is for them, but especially the <hi>pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of love;</hi> it's for them, who while they are in the way are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to infirmities, it's fitted for them to role on, and rest in, even
when sense of sin would otherwise sting and disquiet them; this
suits well with that word, 2 <hi>Sam. 23 5. Although my house be
not so with God,</hi> but there are many things sinful to be found in it;
yet, <hi>he hath made with me an everlasting Covenant well ordered in
all things and sure, This,</hi> saith he, (when he was to die) <hi>is all my
salvation,</hi> and <hi>all my desire:</hi> There needs no more for carrying
believing sinners through, and giving them ease under their chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges
and perplexities, but this, it's so well suited for believers
conditions. From all this she proceeds, <hi>vers.</hi> 11. to point out
Christ as precious, this Covenant putting as it were the Crown of
grace, and lovelinesse on him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. The work of Redemption, bringing sinners out of a
state of wrath and carrying them through to glory, is a noble de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
a wonderfully excellent work, and hath been deeply contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
2. O the excellent wisdom, and wonderful grace that shines
in this Covenant! 3. They who would rest in Christ's <hi>bed,</hi> must
ride in his <hi>Chariot;</hi> they who would share in his peace and be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to sweet fellowship with him, must accept of his offers, and
enter into Covenant with him. 4. The weight of all contained
in the Covenant lyes on Christ, therefore it's his workmanship
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:65401:96"/>
alone, as being the <hi>surety</hi> thereof to the Father, the <hi>Messenger</hi> of
the Covenant to us, and in effect the sum and substance of it
himself, therefore is he called <hi>the Covenant, Isa.</hi> 42. 6. 5. Christ
hath spared no invention nor cost, to make this Covenant large
and full for the believers consolation and happinesse. 6. Love is
a main ingredient in this work of Redemption, and the predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant
qualification of this Covenant, love being the thing which
he chiefly intended to make conspicuous and glorious therein.
7. Every particular of the contrivance of grace will be found more
precious than another, every step thereof proceeds to a greater
excellency, and therefore there is mention made here, 1. Of <hi>wood.</hi>
2. Of <hi>Silver.</hi> 3. Of <hi>Gold,</hi> &amp;c. The further in we come in the
Covenant, we will find it the more rich. 8. Love is here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in the last place, to shew the great excellency of Christ's
love unto redeemed sinners; there is something beyond Gold,
but nothing beyond Love, especially that of the Mediator: It's
left last also in the description, to leave the daughters of <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>
to consider the more of it, as being the great attractive com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
of this work, which should make it amiable and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirable
unto them; Love hath the last word, and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
beyond it, but himself, whose glory and lovelinesse is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to in the following verse. Lastly, her scope is, 1. To com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
Christ, for they will never esteem of him that are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
with his Covenant. 2. To ingage both her self and the
daughters to fall more throughly in love with him; The right
uptaking of the Covenant is a most forcible argument for draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
souls to Christ: For, 1. It hath all fulnesse in it, for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
2. All wisdom, for the manner. 3. All gracious conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending,
in the terms. 4. It's most ingaging in respect of it's
end, being made for this same very purpose, and designed for this
very end, that it may bring about the peace and salvation of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;
which considerations exceedingly commend it, and may
much strengthen a sinner in applying himself to it. 5. It's most
necessary in regard of the salvation of sinners, there is no riding or
journeying to Heaven, but in this Chariot; <hi>No other name by
which men can be saved, but the Name of Christ,</hi> that is manifested
by this Covenant.</p>

                  <p>She proceeds in this verse, to hold forth the worker of this
great work, and although all the pieces of the work be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
yet hath he much more glory, in as far as the builder is
more glorious, and hath more honour than the house; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
his commendation is her scope, therefore she propounds
him in his beauty and glory, with an exhortation filled with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration:
If (saith she) ye would wonder, <hi>O daughters,</hi> &amp;c.
here is a wonderful object, Christ himself, on whom all eyes
should be fixed; up therefore, come forth and behold him. There
are four things in the verse, 1. The parties spoken unto. 2. A
glorious object propounded to them. 3. This glorious object
being Christ, is qualified and set out in his most lovely and
wonderful posture, by three qualifications. 4. A duty in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to him so qualified, is called for, and pressed upon the
daughters.</p>
                  <p>1. The parties excited and spoken to here, are the <hi>daughters of</hi>
Zion: By <hi>Zion</hi> oftentimes in Scripture is understood the Church,
wherein Christ is set as King, <hi>Psal.</hi> 2. 6. and elsewhere: and so by
daughters of <hi>Zion,</hi> we are to understand members of the Church;
They are the same with the daughters of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> mentioned
<hi>vers.</hi> 5. and her scope being to speak to them who spoke, <hi>vers.</hi> 6.
and they being the same to whom she spake, <hi>vers.</hi> 5. doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
it; for, the words run in one context. They are called here
<hi>daughters of</hi> Zion. 1. Because it was for <hi>Zions</hi> sake that the
Lord so much prized <hi>Ierusalem, Psal.</hi> 87. 2. his Temple and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
being especially there. 2. To put the daughters of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi>
                     <pb n="190" facs="tcp:65401:97"/>
in mind, what was the especial ground of the relation
which God owned in them, namely their being incorporat into
his Church, whereby they had accesse to his Ordinances: And
that so they might know whoever was deficient, yet this duty cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
for, did exceedingly become them, Christ being King of <hi>Zion;</hi>
for which cause elsewhere, <hi>Zech</hi> 9. 9. the exhortation runs in
these terms, <hi>Tell the daughter of Zion, behold thy King cometh,</hi> &amp;c.
It's no little thing to get professors taking up the relation they
stand under to Christ, and ingaged to walk accordingly.</p>
                  <p>2. The object proposed to these daughters, is <hi>King Solomon,</hi>
even the King of <hi>Zion</hi> the King of Peace, and King of Saints, in a
word, their King: This relation makes him lovely to them; yet,
it's not Christ simply that is here proposed to their veiw, but
Christ with a <hi>Crown,</hi> in most stately magnificence, such as Kings
use to be adorned with, when they are in great state, or on their
Coronation day. While it's said, <hi>he hath a Crown,</hi> hereby is not
signified any material Crown, but majesty and glory, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 21. 3.
<hi>Thou set a Crown of pure Gold on his head,</hi> &amp;c. And so Christ <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering
on the white horse, Rev.</hi> 6. 3. is said to have <hi>a Crown:</hi>
And, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 12. it's said, <hi>he hath on his head many Crowns,</hi> To
shew his great and manifold glory, such as becomes the Prince of
the King's of the earth: Every look of Christ is not enough, many
thinks not much of him; This shews how Christ's glory is to be
seen, and how for that end he is to be considered by on-lookers;
He is to be looked upon as he doth discover and hold forth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
otherwise his glory will never rightly be taken up: And
therefore to help us in this, and to prevent an objection which
carnal sense might make against her scope, she qualifies this Crown
and glory of his three wayes, 1. It's <hi>the Crown wherewith his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
crowned him:</hi> Where we are to inquire, 1. What different
Crowns Christ may be said to have, and what this is. 2. Who
this <hi>mother</hi> is. 3. How she is said to <hi>Crown him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Christ may be said to have a fourfold glory, or crown, 1. As
God co-essential with the Father; this crown is not put on him,
being natural to him, who is the <hi>brightnesse of the Fathers glory,
and the expresse Image of his person,</hi> Heb. 1. 2, 3. 2. He hath a
crown and glory as Mediator, in respect of the power, authority
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:65401:97"/>
and glory wherewith he is invested, as God's great deputy, and
anointed upon the holy hill of <hi>Zion,</hi> having power and a rod of
iron, even in reference to enemies; and seing this is not of his
mothers putting on, it is not that which is here understood.
3. He hath a crown and glory in respect of the manifestation of his
glory in the executing of his Offices, when he makes his Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
-power and glory apparent in particular steps; thus some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
he is said to <hi>take his power to him, Rev.</hi> 11. 17. and is said
<hi>to be crowned,</hi> when the <hi>white horse</hi> of the Gospel rides in triumph,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 6. 2. The last step of this glory will be in the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
In short, this consists in his exercising his former power,
committed to him as Mediator. 4. There is a crown and glory
which is in a manner put on him by particular believers, when he
is glorified by them, not by adding any thing to his infinite glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
but by their acknowledging of him to be so, especially their
acknowledging his rich and free grace, and by believing, <hi>putting
their seal</hi> thereunto. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 33. and giving him glory, as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
did, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 20. in which respect he is <hi>crowned,</hi> as on the
contrary, when he meets not with this, he is despised, and it is a
saying upon the matter, <hi>this man shall not reign over us:</hi> Now
this last is to be here understood. Again, by <hi>mother</hi> here, is not
understood his natural mother, but it must be taken in a spiritual
sense for one of two, either, 1. For the Church Catholick, which
being mother to Christ mystical, may be said to be mother to
him, as <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 5. the Church is said to <hi>bring forth a man-childe,</hi>
who is taken to Heaven, and hath ascribed to him the properties
due to Christ, and yet <hi>Christ mystical</hi> is there understood; Or,
2. For a particular believer, who may be said to be Christ's mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in these respects, 1. For the near relation that is betwixt
Christ and particular believers, and the accompt he hath of them;
for which reason they are called <hi>his sister, his spouse, Chap.</hi> 4. 10.
and <hi>Matth. 12. ult.</hi> He calls them <hi>his brother, his sister; ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
2. Because Christ is formed and brought forth in them,
being as it were conceived in every one of them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 19. Christ
(as it were) getting a new being in them, which he had not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
We conceive both may be understood here, and the last
especially, as serving most to the scope of commending Christ to
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:65401:98"/>
them; and if the first be included, to wit, the Church universal,
then particular believers (being homogeneous parts of the whole)
cannot be excluded; for, the Church crowns Christ, when she
brings forth children to him, which is, when by the Ordinances
Christ is begotten in them. Now they are said to <hi>crown</hi> Christ
and glorify him, not by adding any new degrees of glory to him,
considered in himself; but this his being crowned by them, doth
especially appear in these three, 1. Their high estimation of him,
beyond what others have, and what themselves were wont to
have; Now he is highly esteemed who before was despised by
them, and whereas to them he wanted a crown and dominion,
now he hath it. 2. Their acceptation of him as their King, when
by their consent, they ratify (as it were) God's donation of the
crown to him, and in acknowledging thereof, they submit to his
Scepter and Government: Thus he is crowned by them, when he
is expresly with full consent of the soul acknowledged as King and
Lord: Even as <hi>David</hi> formerly crowned, anointed and made King
over <hi>Israel</hi> by the Lord, is said to be made King by <hi>Iudah,</hi> when
they accept of him to reign at <hi>Hebron;</hi> and afterward by the ten
Tribes in their submission to him, and consenting to the former
appointment: Even so believers submission to Christ, is a crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of him, as to themselves: And so there are particular Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
(to say so) of Christ, even as there are particular espou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals
betwixt him and believers. 3. This is in respect of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
that results to Christ from their submission and acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
even as sinners despising him, put (as it were) a blot on
him, put him to open shame, and sayes we will not have him to
reign over us; so believers, yeelding up themselves to Christ, do
in a manner put honour and glory upon him, <hi>Isa.</hi> 62. 2, 3. The
married Church or people, are said to be <hi>a crown of glory in the
hand of the Lord,</hi> when the grace of Christ hath it's native effect
amongst them; as the conversion of souls proves to faithful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
<hi>their crown and joy, 1 Thes.</hi> 2. 14. so doth it to the great
Bishop and Shepherd of souls: And, as <hi>Prov.</hi> 12. 4. A vertuous
woman is a <hi>crown,</hi> or <hi>ornament</hi> to her husband, whereas if she be
not so, she maketh him ashamed: So are believers some-way a
crown to Christ, because all the glory and beauty which is to be
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:65401:98"/>
found on them, is his, and from him. This then is the meaning,
Consider Christ in the beauty wherein he appears to believers,
and with the esteem they have of him, as full of grace and truth,
when they acknowledge him, and subject to him, and he will be
seen to be exceeding flately and lovely.</p>
                  <p>The second qualification confirms this: This crown is put
on him <hi>in the day of his espousals;</hi> Now Christ's general espousals
are not yet come, and so the crown in that respect is not yet put
on him; it must be therefore the day of his espousals with parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
believers (which is here understood, there being no other
before his second coming) who are, 2 <hi>Cor. 11. 2. espoused to him,</hi>
by their consenting to accept him<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> for their husband, as he is king
to them, by their submitting to his dominion. His being crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
here, is mentioned with respect to this day of his espousals,
because as bridegrooms used to be most glorious in their mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-day,
so Christ hath at the time of espousals, a special love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse
to the new married believer, what by the more kindly
and tender manifestations of his love, and what by the fresh rel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
it hath then to them, when their spirits are broken with the
sense of their sin, and warm with a deal of holy joy and fainnesse
which useth then to abound in their heart, in reference to so good
a bargain; so Christ is then to believers wonderfully lovely:
And although the effects of his kindnesse may be inlarged after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and their esteem of him may also grow, yet readily then
as it's most sensible, so their admiration is most in exercise, and
their thoughts of Christ's excellent worth, are most affectingly,
and overcomingly ravishing; and when in their after-thoughts
they are taken up with him, the remembring of that day of es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pousals,
when he took them by the hand, puts still a lovelinesse
on him to them, that in his love he so wonderfully condescended
unto them.</p>
                  <p>The third qualification confirms the same (for, it is in effect
one qualification in three expressions) and it's in these words,
<hi>and in the day of the gladnesse of his heart;</hi> What is it (saith she)
that chears Christ, and makes him heartily glad? It's even this,
when poor sinners accept of him, that is Christ's marriage-day;
and as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride that day, so doth
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:65401:99"/>
he rejoice: and as <hi>the good Shepherd</hi> rejoiceth when he recovers
his <hi>lost sheep,</hi> or the <hi>father</hi> his <hi>prodigal son, Luk.</hi> 15. 32. so doth
Christ when sinners are brought in to him by the Gospel: And
this joy is called <hi>the gladnesse of his heart,</hi> to shew the reality of
it, Christ (in a manner) can injoy no such satisfying thing as a
marriage with a poor sinner, then <hi>he sees the travel of his soul and
is satisfied, Isa.</hi> 53. 11. that chears him and makes him smile (if
I may say so) and this looks to that glory which shines in Christ,
and is expressed by him when he is well satisfied with poor sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and that is mainly when he gets welcome by them. This
signifies not joy in Christ, as it's in us: But, 1. It shews how accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
a sinners believing in him, is to him. 2. What confident
welcome they may expect from him, when they come unto him.
3. How kindly he useth them, by manifesting himself to be well
pleased, as one that is chearful doth on his marriage-day to
his bride.</p>
                  <p>3. The duty prest upon the daughters is in two words, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth two duties, the one whereof is the mids or mean to the
other, and the other the end of this. The first is, <hi>Behold,</hi> which
points at the great scope and thing called for; And it imports,
1. A wonderful object, and indeed Christ is so, being considered
in his most royal posture, as a crowned King upon his coronati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on-day;
and in his most loving posture, as a beautiful Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom
on his marriage-day. 2. It imports a dulnesse in the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
needing upstirring to take up Christ in this lovely and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
posture. 3. A difficulty rightly to take him up under this
consideration, yet a necessity of it, and that it be done with at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.
4. It implyes an intensnesse or benfill of spirit in the act
of beholding; so rare an object, calls for greatest intention of
heart, and gravest consideration of mind in the beholder: It's not
every look or glance of the eyes that will discern it; But, 1. There
must be attentivenesse and steddinesse, an stayed looking, and as
it were dwelling on the object with their eye. 2. The exercise
of saith must go alongst with this their looking, reading his worth
by faith exercised on him, as <hi>Isa. 45. 19. look unto me and be ye saved;</hi>
Beholding of him, as the stung Israelits did the brazen serpent.
3. Also the exercise of love; an affectionat look is here necessary,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:65401:99"/>
delighting in him, and being taken up with him, as one with that
wherein they take pleasure, the eye of the seer here, cannot but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
and inflame the heart. 4. This looking is attended with
wondering at this glorious object, as one beholding a wonder,
and ravished with the admirablenesse of it: All these are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
under this expression, <hi>Behold him.</hi> The second word
(which hath in it another piece of their duty) is, <hi>go forth,</hi> and
this is a help to the other: And (beside what hath been hinted
at in the former expression) it shews, it's not in every posture
that they will take up Christ thus, but there is a necessity they
must come out from under the natural condition they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to:
We take it to be the same with that precept, <hi>Psa.</hi> 45. 10, 11.
<hi>Forget thine own people and thy fathers house, so</hi> (and no otherwise)
<hi>shall the King greatly desire thy beauty.</hi> Christ manifests not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>,
as reconciled and pleased, till former lovers be given up with;
and this <hi>beholding</hi> of his smiling and glorious countenance, cannot
be obtained till then, even as one fitting in the house cannot dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
a flately fight going by, except they go forth: Thus the
similitude is borrowed, to shew a necessity of rousing of affections
within; but not to signifie any local mutation. This then is the
sense and scope, O Professors (saith the Bride) would ye see a
stately sight? then get up, and set your selves to take up Christ,
more glorious than <hi>Solomon</hi> either on his coronation or marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age-day
(to which there is an allusion here) And because few sees
great comelinesse and beauty in Christ, why he should be desired;
Therefore she adds what a sight it is she understands. Endeavour
(saith she) to behold him as he is discernable to believers, when
they close with him, and accept of him; if so ye will exercise
faith in him, so as ye may perfect espousals with him, and satisfie
him by resting on him, ye will then have a stately and soul-ravish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
object to look upon, otherwise Christ is not alway, and to
every one pleasant and chearful company.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. Christ, when rightly conceived and taken up, is a most
ravishing satisfying fight, and a most glorious stately person to
look upon. 2. Though Christ Jesus be so stately a person, yet
he condescends to espouse and marry himself to the believer:
Thus Christ by faith becomes theirs. 3. This marrying hath
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:65401:100"/>
it's day, and men are not born espoused to Christ, but by their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
of him, their espousals with him are consummat. 4. Christ
is never taken up aright but by the believer, nor doth his glory
ever appear as it is, but to the believer: others that are not
spiritual cannot discern it. 5. Christ's condescending to marry
sinners and accept of them, is as the Crown and Diadem of his
glory; and that which makes him most singularly admirable, is
that he is <hi>full of grace and truth, Ioh.</hi> 1. 18. 6. Christ accounts
believing on him by a poor sinner, a singular piece of honour done
unto him; It's as the putting of crown on his head, when they
make use of his grace; as he accounts it the greatest dishonour
can be done to him, to refuse and slight him; and therefore,
misbelief (when Christ calls) is a most hainous sin, it is as it were
the taking of Christ's crown from him. 7. There is no such plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
that a sinner can do to Christ, as to believe on him; and
Christ is ever chearful then, when sinners are thronging on
him by faith, and he is never discontent with that; for, that is
the <hi>day of the gladnesse of his heart,</hi> as other dayes in the Church
are sad, when this design of his, is (as it were) obstructed and
disappointed. 8. Usually the sight and sense of Christ's grace are
most fresh and sensible to the soul, about the time of their closing
with Christ, or of their being clear that they have closed with
him. 9. Every lazy looking on Christ, or wishing for him, will
not be acceptable to him, nor solidly comfort a sinner; but there
must be a <hi>going forth,</hi> and a <hi>beholding of him.</hi> 10. This being
spoken to the daughters of <hi>Zion,</hi> saith, many may have much of
a profession and a name, yea, they may have a kind of high esteem
of gracious people (as the daughters had, <hi>vers.</hi> 6.) and yet be
such as have not rightly taken up Christ, but are exceeding igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of him, as these are, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 9. 11. Considering these words
as spoken by the Bride, who was so much commended, <hi>vers.</hi> 6.
we may observe, that no particular esteem or commendation will
satisfie a sincere believer, so long as Christ gets not his due: his
honour will still be neerer them than their own.</p>

                  <p>THat these are Christ's words spoken to the Bride, is at
the first clear; He continues speaking from the beginning
unto <hi>vers.</hi> 16. and then <hi>vers.</hi> 16. the Bride speaks by
prayer to him, for the influences and breathings of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>In Christ's speech there are two parts; the first to the eight
verse, wherein he gives both a general and particular commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Bride. The second, from that foreward to the last
verse, wherein he begins with a sweet invitation, and then shews
how he was affected towards her, and so breaks out in another
commendation of her. The matter in both is sweet and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable;
wonderful to be spoken by such a one as Christ, of such
a one as a believer; but there is nothing in his love, but what
is wonderful and like himself. The scope of the first part of
Christ's speech is twofold. 1. More general, to intimate his love to
his Bride, on the back of so much darknesse; <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 1. 2. (in the
midst of which, notwithstanding her love did appear in her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
him;) and it's subjoined to the commendation that she
gives of him to others, in the preceeding Chapter, to shew,
1. That when believers slight their own esteem, to have it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creassing
to Christ's commendation, it's never losse but gain to
them; for, here Christ comes in to commend her himself, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
it was but the daughters of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> who commended her,
<hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 6. 2. It shews, that time taken, and pains bestowed for
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:65401:101"/>
the edification of others, and their instruction in the excellency
of Christ, is acceptable to him, and proves often useful for at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
sensible fellowship with him; yea, it proves often to be
some way as useful in reference to this as their own particular
praying for themselves, the Lord doth so return their pains
taken this way in their bosome. That to commend the Bride
is the scope in general, is clear from <hi>vers.</hi> 7.</p>
                  <p>More particularly we take the scope to be, his giving her an
answer to her prayer, <hi>chap.</hi> 2. 17. where she prayed for his fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
<hi>untill the day break,</hi> &amp;c. Here he doth not only materially
answer, but <hi>vers.</hi> 6. formally repeats her words, that she may
know what he speaks is a direct answer to her prayer: <hi>untill that
day come</hi> (saith he) it shall be so as thou desires (as the words will
make it clear) Shewing, 1. That a believers prayers may for a
time lye beside Christ, (as it were) and yet he not forget a word
of them, but mind well the answer and performance of them.
2. That sometimes he will not only give what is sought by his
people, but make them know that he respects their prayer in the
giving of it; and so he not only hears their prayers, but lets
them know he hath heard them.</p>
                  <p>This commendation, whereby he intimats his respect to her,
hath four steps. 1. It's done in general, <hi>vers.</hi> 1. Then, 2. He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
on particulars, from <hi>vers.</hi> 1. to <hi>vers.</hi> 6. 3. He shews how
his respect to her affected him, <hi>vers.</hi> 6. 4. He sums all particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
up in an universal commendation, <hi>vers.</hi> 7. lest any thing should
be missed, or being left out might vex her; whereby he shews,
what was his scope in that which preceeded.</p>
                  <p>The general commendation in the beginning of <hi>vers.</hi> 1. is the
same that was given her, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 15. yet here it's repeated with
the two <hi>beholds:</hi> The reasons why he repeats it, are, 1. That
Christ might evidence to her the reality of his love, and that he
varies not, nor changes in it, even though sits of security on her
side had interveened, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 1. Christ's love and thoughts to
his people, are still the same, whatever changes be upon their
frame and way, which may occasion sad changes in his dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
towards them. 2. That she might the more be perswaded of
his love to her and esteem of her; Christ would have his own
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:65401:101"/>
throughly perswaded that he loves them, 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 16. and would
have others to know that he respects them, more than the most
mighty in the world. 3. It's because often believers from all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hands, whether the men of the world, or from themselves,
have but little comfort, therefore Christ renewes his intimations
to support and comfort them: Believers consolation hangs most
on his kindnesse to them, and they who depend most on it are no
losers. And further, We may here observe, that even a believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
especially after sad challenges, will need renewed intimations
of Christ's love.</p>
                  <p>The more particular explication and commendation of her
parts follows; where we would advert, 1. That bodily mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
or parts, are not to be here looked unto, but believers
have a inner-man, as well as an outward, a new man as well as
an old; and so that inner-man hath, as it were, distinct parts and
members as the natural body hath, which act in reference there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
with some analogy to these members in the natural body.
2. As the new or inner-man sets forth the new natural and habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
grace in the believer; so the particular parts, eyes, lips, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
signifie distinct graces of faith, love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are parts of that
new nature. 3. These parts may be looked on as useful in the
new man, as the external members are in the body, or as they
are evidences of something in the renewed disposition. 4. They
set forth the disposition, as they are qualified in the commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and not simply. 5. Although we cannot satisfie our own,
or others curiosity, in the particular application of these parts,
yet there is a particular meaning of every several part here attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
to her, as well as of every part attributed to him, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.
11, 12 &amp;c. and he giveth no idle words, nor useth any vain repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions:
We would therefore beware of thinking all this needless,
seing he knoweth best what is needful. 6. Being clear of the
scope, that it is to commend graces, and to evidence the beauty
of her several graces, we must regulatall the application by that
scope, and what is subservient thereto, cannot be impertinent.
Yet, 7. There is much need of sobriety here; therefore, we shall
be short and not peremptory in particular applications. 8. There
being a connexion amongst all the graces of the Spirit, it must
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:65401:102"/>
not be thought absurd that some of these graces be signified twice
in different respects, and that one part respect moe graces (which
are neerly linked) especially when the commendation gives ground
to infer it. 9. We take this commendation to set forth especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the invisible Church, or true believers, which are the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
thereof, as the scope and application do clear.</p>
                  <p>If it be asked, why he insists on particulars in this commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
I answer, for these reasons; 1. That he may shew, that
whoever hath the new nature, and a lively work of grace, hath
also particular graces in exercise. 2. That it may be known that
the new nature is not a dead body, but a living; and exerciseth
it self by putting forth these particular graces in exercise. 3. That
he may shew, that where ever one grace is, all are there, and as
it's ordinarily with one grace, so it's with all; where believers
are in a good and commendable case, it will not be one grace or
two that will be in exercise, or one duty or two in which these
graces are exercised, but it will be universally, all graces, and in
all known duties. 4. To shew, who may expect Christ's commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation;
these who have a respect to all his commands, and make
conscience to exercise all graces. 5. To shew what particular
notice he takes of believers graces, he can tell how it is with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one of them; and takes this exact notice of them, because
it's very acceptable to him, when he finds them in good case.</p>
                  <p>There are seven parts particularly mentioned, every one having
it's own distinct commendation. The first two of them are in
the rest of <hi>vers.</hi> 1. The first thing commended is her <hi>eyes,</hi> which
here have a twofold commendation. 1. That they are as <hi>Doves
eyes.</hi> 2. That they are <hi>within her locks.</hi> Eyes are the organs of
seeing in the natural body, whereby we discern objects that are
visible; and so our understandings are thereby set forth in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
That <hi>the eyes of your understanding may be inlightened,</hi> saith
the Apostle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 18. By eyes also the affections are set forth,
because the affection sets the eye on work to look here or there,
(Hence is the phrase of a <hi>single</hi> and <hi>evil eye, Matth.</hi> 6. 21, 23.) and
because it's some way the seat of these, and somewhat of love or
hatred will be, and may be gathered from the eye. Here we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
1. A spiritual, sanctified and inlightened understanding
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:65401:102"/>
in the things of God, taking up Christ and spiritual things <hi>spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually,
1 Cor.</hi> 2. 15. that is, by faith, it being <hi>the evidence of things
not seen,</hi> Heb. 11. 1. And therefore <hi>looking</hi> is frequently put for
believing in Scripture, which presupposeth understanding. 2. Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse,
or a spiritual, kindly and affectionat carriage to Christ;
in a word, it is the exercise of love upon this spiritual and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
excellent object <hi>Christ,</hi> a having <hi>respect to him,</hi> as it's, <hi>Isa.</hi>
17. 7. his <hi>eyes</hi> shall have <hi>respect</hi> to his Maker, it's such an uptak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Christ and spiritual things, as works love and delight in
them.</p>
                  <p>The commendation will confirm this, which is twofold, 1. They
are <hi>doves eyes:</hi> This was opened, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 15. and it signifieth,
1. What is the great object they behold, and are taken up with,
it is <hi>Christ;</hi> and they are chast to him, and seek to <hi>know</hi> no other
at all but h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 2. 2. It imports that the act of faith
whereby they behold him, is simple, single and sweet, their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
is not subtile, nor politick, nor are they pust up with it,
but it's taken up in studying Christ and him crucified, opposite to
the vain wisdom of the world, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 1, 2. 2. These eyes are
<hi>within her lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>ks.</hi> Locks are that part of the hair that hang about
the face, handsomly knit, and was then in stead of a vail to wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 7. and so the word in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> will bear; and
it's differenced from that word translated hair, in the words fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
which is that part of the hair that covers the head: It im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes
here, that the believers knowledge is not used for frothy
ostentation (as the knowledge that puffs up) but is kept with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it's right bounds, and that they are wise unto sobriety, and
that their knowledge is not at the first obvious, but seasonably
vents it self and looks out, as eyes that are within the locks.</p>
                  <p>These things are sure, and may be observed from the words,
1. That a believer should be filled with spiritual knowledge and
understanding. 2. Knowledge is no lesse necessary to a believer,
that he may go right in the way of God, and not erre, than eyes
are to guide a ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap> in a journey; and this necessity extends both
to faith <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>nd practice. 3. A believer without knowledge, or weak
in knowledge, is very far defective in spiritual beauty, he is as a
man without eyes, it's not decent that a believer should be so;
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:65401:103"/>
from this it is, that many are called weak in faith. 4. That know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of spiritual things, should ever have faith, love and single<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
going alongst in the exercise thereof; for, every knowledge
will not be commendable to Christ, more than every eye will be
useful in a body; Believers eyes must be as <hi>doves eyes.</hi> 5. A be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
eyes, or knowledge, is different from the knowledge of all
others, 1. In respect of it's object, which is Christ and spiritual
things. 2. In that it's joyned with love, it respects him. 3. In that
it's chast keeping the soul for him alone. 4. It works delight in him.
5. It's denyed to other things. <hi>Obs.</hi> 6. Often the most subtile in
worldly wisdom, knows least of Christ truely; whereas the most
simple that have <hi>doves eyes,</hi> take up most of him. 7. Christ respects
not how much a man knows, but how he is affected with it; It's
not the <hi>eagles,</hi> but the <hi>doves eyes,</hi> which he commends. 8. It's good
to know and to think little of our knowledge, and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                     </gap> to be puft
up with it. 9. Christ loves it well, when his people seasonably
use, and improve their knowledge and parts; then the new man
becomes lovely, as the <hi>eyes</hi> are within <hi>the locks.</hi> 10. There are
extrems in the use-making of knowledge, which are to be shunned,
we would neither altogether obscure it that it be not seen, nor
by ostentation make shew of it; It's good when it runs in the
right mids, then it gets the commendation, and is as <hi>eyes within
the locks.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second thing commended is her <hi>hair,</hi> having a twofold
commendation also. The hair is no integral, or essential part of
the body (to say so) yet in all ages a great part of mens decoring,
hath ever been placed in it: It's the most conspicuous thing of
the body, being highest and most discernable, especially in the way
it used to be dressed; and this conspicuousnesse of it, by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation,
seems mainly to be aimed at. By hair we understand
the ornament of a Christian godly, and sober walk, having the
right principles of saving grace within, and the fruits thereof in
a well ordered conversation, and suitable profession appearing
without in the practice We take it so, not only because it is a
main piece of a Christians or believers beauty, but also for these
reasons, 1. Because as hair sets out and adorns the natural body,
though it be no substantial part thereof; so a well ordered con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:65401:103"/>
commends grace within, and makes it lovely. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
as hair is upmost and most conspicuous, and therefore seen
when the natural body is hid (therefore it was to women <hi>a cover,
1 Cor.</hi> 11. 5.) so a suitable practical profession, is (as it were) the
cover of holinesse, through which it shines, and by which it's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous,
which otherwise would not be discernable. 3. And e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially,
because in Scripture this adorning with good works, and
with a meek and quiet spirit, is put in the place of decking of the
hair, and other external decorements, (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 9, 10.) as that
wherein Christians beauty <hi>should shine before men, (Matth.</hi> 5. 17.)
and which should be to a believer, as decking of the hair is to these
who take pains to adorn the body. For sure these do make them
beautiful before God and men, more than hair and it's decore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
can make any person in the world appear beautiful to the
men thereof. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 9, 10. whose <hi>adorning</hi> (saith the Apostle,
speaking of b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>lieving women) <hi>let it not be in costly apparel, broi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
hair,</hi> &amp;c. but (what then should be in the place thereof?)
<hi>shamefastnesse, sobriety, and good works,</hi> so 1 <hi>Pet. 3. 3, 4, 5. Whose
adorning let it not be the platting of the hair,</hi> but in the place
thereof, let it be <hi>a meek and quiet spirit, which in the sight of God
is of great price.</hi> And this is also mentioned by the Apostle, as
that which is exceedingly ingaging to the husband, for which
<hi>Sarah</hi> there is commended. Next, the commendation of her hair,
in both it's parts, will confirm this, 1. It's <hi>like a flock of goats:</hi>
Goats are stately and comely in going, and a flock of them must
be very flately, as they were especially in these parts, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 21.
and 31. And so this ornament of a good conversation, is an
amiable, gaining and alluring thing; by it, saith <hi>Peter,</hi> the husbands
affection may be won (and that both to Christ and to his wife in
the Lord) more than by any outward decoring, and this puts them
to glorify God, when it shines before them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 16. 2. It's
commended from this, that it's like a flock <hi>appearing from
mount Gilead:</hi> This was a fruitful place, and it's like the goats
that fed thereon, were more excellent than others in their beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
And being seen afar, and discernable ere men came near them,
were pleasant and stately to beholders; and so good works, show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth themselves in a well-ordered conversation, do also as
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:65401:104"/>
from a mountain appear to others, and sets believers up as <hi>lights
shining in a dark place, Philip.</hi> 1. 15. and also makes them lovely
and desirable in the consciences of on-lookers and beholders.
Observe then, 1. That practice should wait upon knowledge,
for, it is the end thereof, and without it all mens knowledge is void
and vain. 2. Grace and holinesse appearing in a Christians practice,
will shine, and be in some measure very discernable. 3. This is
a thing that makes the believers conversation very beautiful and
lovely. 4. It's not enough that believers be tender, and consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious
in secret before God; but there ought to be a shining,
even in their outward conversation before men. 5. This doth
exceedingly adorn a believers walk, and make it stately to behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
when the fruits of holinesse visibly appear in his conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>The third particular commended, is <hi>vers.</hi> 2. and it's her <hi>teeth,</hi>
which have a fourfold commendation given them. The <hi>teeth</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
taken, are useful for furthering the nourishment of the body,
they being the instruments that fit meat for digestion; and what
comelinesse is in them, is not every way obvious, they are not
seen or discerned in their proportionablenesse or disproportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nablenesse,
but by the motion of the lips, otherwise they are hid
by them. 2. Again in Scripture they are used to evidence and
signifie these three things, 1. They are used to signify the nature
and disposition of a person, as good or evil; Hence evil men are
said to have <hi>lions teeth,</hi> and that their <hi>teeth are as spears,</hi> Psal. 57. 4.
And that beast, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 5, 7. is said to have <hi>three ribs in his teeth,</hi>
pointing out it's cruel disposition. 2. They evidence good or ill
food, that the person feeds on. 3. A healthfull or unhealthfull
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:65401:104"/>
complexion, which depends much on the former: Hence <hi>Iudah's</hi>
good portion and healthfulnesse is set out by this, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 12.
<hi>His teeth shall be white with milk.</hi> According to the first, by <hi>teeth</hi>
in the new man may be understood two things; first, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>aith, believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
being often compared to eating, because it furthers the souls
nourishment, and is the mean by which the soul lives on it's spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
food. This saith, 1. That the inner man must have food,
as the natural body hath, for it's sustaining. 2. That the believer
actually eats, and makes use of that food, he hath teeth for that
end, and should not only look on Christ, but feed on him. Secondly,
Meditation also may be here understood, that serving much to the
feeding and filling of the soul, as <hi>Psal. 63. 6, 7. My soul shall be
filled as with marrow and fatnesse,</hi> how? <hi>While I meditate on thee
on my bed, and think of thee in the night watches;</hi> Meditation is
as it were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
                     </gap> soul's ruminating and chewing it's cude, feeding
upon, and digesting what is understood and eaten, as the clean
beasts did; which may be one reason why her teeth are in the first
part of their commendation, compared to <hi>a flock of sheep,</hi> which
were among the number of clean beasts by reason of this property:
Meditation is exceedingly useful for a believers life, and they who
are strangers to it, are not like Christ's sheep.</p>
                  <p>Again as the teeth evidence first the nature and inward disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
so we conceive they are also made use of here (as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
also clears) to shew, 1. The zealous nature which is,
and ought to be in believers, they have <hi>teeth,</hi> and ought not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
to be soft, when the Lord's honour is concerned: Zeal though
it bite not, and devour not, yet it's not senslesse, but easily
touched with the feeling of that which reflects upon the glory of
God. 2. The similitude here is to shew what a meek and quiet
spirit believers have, they have not such teeth as lions or tygers,
but such as sheep have; not tusks like dogs and ravenous beasts,
but <hi>even shorn,</hi> shewing a moderation, and equablenesse in their
way, being first <hi>pure, then peacable, gentle,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iam.</hi> 3. 17. This
will agree well to <hi>teeth,</hi> as they appear by opening the lips; for,
the new nature within is expressed and doth appear in words,
which afterward are spoken of under the similitude of <hi>lips.</hi> Now
this christian moderation which keeps the right midst, is a notable
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:65401:105"/>
piece of spiritual beauty (as is clear from the second piece of the
commendation) for it's <hi>as a flock of sheep even shorn,</hi> and not une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually,
and unhandsomely clipped; so true zeal will not upon by-respect
or interest be high or low, up or down, but keeps a just
equality in it's way: And this speaks out a well constituted frame,
that is, neither too soft, nor too sharp, in <hi>biting</hi> and <hi>devouring</hi> one
another (as is said, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 15.) which carnal zeal sets the teeth a
work to do.</p>
                  <p>2. This similitude doth evidence and signify a good subject they
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>eed on, to wit, <hi>Christ</hi> and his promises; and a good subject they me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate
on, the same <hi>Christ</hi> and what is most precious in him: Hence
in the third part of the commendation, they are likened to sheep
<hi>coming up from the washing,</hi> white and clean: Neither mixture of
humane inventions, nor of carnal passions or worldly delights, gets
place and entertainment with them; their zeal is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>ã€ˆâ€¦ã€‰</desc>
                     </gap>, their ends
are single, their affections are chast and clean, being <hi>purged from
all filthinesse of flesh and spirit,</hi> and they appear so.</p>
                  <p>3. Not only their healthfulnesse is hereby evidenced, but fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
also their fruitfulnesse; whereupon their inward meeknesse
and zeal, moderated by pure and peaceable wisdom, have great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence,
as is clear by the fourth part of their commendation, <hi>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one of these sheep bear twins, and none is barren amongst them:</hi>
The scope whereof, is to shew their aboundant fruitfulnesse; thus
their sweet nature is a pleasant possession, like a flock of sheep
that inriches their owner, they are so fruitful and profitable.
<hi>Obs.</hi> 1. Feeding on Christ, is ever fruitful to the soul that makes
him it's food; whereas other meats profit not them that are <hi>oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied
therein,</hi> Heb. 13. 9. 2. Zeal moderated with meeknesse,
hath also a deal of fruits waiting on it, <hi>Iam.</hi> 3. 17. but bitter
zeal (as it's there in the Original) or <hi>strife,</hi> hath <hi>confusion, and
every evil work</hi> following on it. <hi>Ibid. vers.</hi> 14, 15, 16. It's much
to be zealous alway in a good thing, and no little piece of a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
commendation, to keep the right midst with our zeal.</p>

                     <q>Thy lips are like a threed of Scarlet,
and thy speech is comely: thy Temples are
like a piece of a Pomegranate within thy
locks.</q>

                  <p>In this 3. <hi>vers.</hi> we have the fourth and fifth particulars that are
commended in the Bride. The fourth thing commended is her
<hi>lips:</hi> The commendation given them is, that they are like <hi>a
threed of Scarlet,</hi> that is neat and lovely, and of an excellent co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
as Scarlet, which (being of the richest dye) was made use of
under the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>ã€ˆâ€¦ã€‰</desc>
                     </gap> to represent the blood of Christ, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 19.
Next, this is amplified, as we conceive, in the following expression,
(<hi>and thy speech is comely</hi>) which is added for the explication of
the former, and therefore is joyned thereto with a copulative
(<hi>and</hi>) which is added to none of the other parts here commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
and it may be here added, to shew, 1. A way of opening
the other expression; for, speech is expressed by lips, because they
are the organs (to say so) whereby it's formed and uttered. And
2. To shew, that under lips comes in both our words to God in
prayer and praise, and also our words to others, whatever is spoken
or comes out of the lips, as often the phrase is used for both.
Also it shews, that in a special way he takes notice of believers
speech (when it's savory) as a main part of their spiritual beauty,
which makes them lovely.</p>
                  <p>The commendation of her lips and speech is twofold. 1. More ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
it's like <hi>a threed of Scarlet.</hi> 2. That is expounded by another
expression more clear and particular, namely this, that her <hi>speech is
comely:</hi> The meaning of both which, may be comprehended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
these four, 1. That her speech is profitable for it's matter,
as a Scarlet threed is precious and useful: The subject of a belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
discourse is not common, but <hi>good to the use of edifying,</hi> Eph.
4. 29. 2. It's pleasant and delightsome for it's manner, like a
sweet, comely and pleasant voice, opposite to some kind of voices
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:65401:106"/>
that are harsh and unpleasant; It's by prudence and love sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and made savory, and therefore is said in Scripture to be <hi>sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned
with salt,</hi> Col. 4. 6. and <hi>to minister grace to the hearers,</hi> Eph.
4. 29. and it's called <hi>a giving of thanks,</hi> Eph. 5. 4. 3. It's articulat
and distinct, therefore called <hi>speech,</hi> and not a sound, having honest
ingenuity in it, speaking as they think <hi>in their heart,</hi> Psal. 15. 2.
and opposite to lying, dissembling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereby one speaks to
vail or hide his mind from another. 4. Hereby is also signified,
that they hazard not even the best of their prayers on their own
bottom and worth, but their work is to have them all dyed in
the blood of the Lamb, and to put them up <hi>in his Name,</hi> Heb.
13. 15. They are all <hi>offered up by him.</hi> Now these are special
qualifications, commendations and characters of a believer; shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
1. That a believer, as a believer, is not dumb, but hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
lips, whereby he can speak to God in praise <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
                     </gap> his honour,
in prayers for his own good, and also to others for their edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
A believer that can speak nothing to a good purpose, or if
he can, doth it not, is not like Christ's Bride; much lesse these
whose discourses tend quite another way. 2. That words are in
an especial way taken notice of by Christ, and are special eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the frame of the heart, according to which we may expect
commendation or reproof from Christ, for by <hi>our words we shall
be justified</hi> or <hi>condemned,</hi> Mat. 12. 37. 3. That there is nothing
more commendable in it self, beautiful in a believer, or accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to Christ, than the well ordering of the words; He who can
<hi>rule the tongue,</hi> is a <hi>perfect man,</hi> Jam. 3. 2. 4. That believers
prayers are all dyed in Christ's blood, and put up in his Name:
And we conceive prayer, or the believers speech to God, is espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
here understood; partly, because prayer gets this same
commendation to be sweet and comely, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 14. and partly,
because mutual communication in words among believers, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
afterward more clearly, <hi>vers.</hi> 11. though it is not to be
excluded here.</p>
                  <p>The fifth part of her commendation (or the fifth character or
property of the Bride) is in these words, <hi>Thy Temples are like
a piece of a Pomegranate within thy locks.</hi> The temples are that
part of the face, that are betwixt the ears and the eyes; and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:65401:106"/>
the signification is so large, as they take in the cheeks; they
are a special part, wherein the beauty of the face consists, and are
the proper seat of shamefastness and modesty, wherein blushing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears.
The commendation is two sold, 1. They are like <hi>a piece
of a Pomegranate:</hi> They who write of it say, it is a fruit, which
when broken (as here the mentioning of a piece thereof signifies)
is pleasant with red and white spots, not unlike blushing in a
pleasant face. The second commendation is, that these temples
are <hi>within her locks,</hi> of the colour of a Pomegranate, but not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable
fully (as the eyes also were, <hi>vers.</hi> 1.) yet something ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable;
As sometimes modesty will make blushing, and again
will seek to cover it, when hardly will it be gotten done. Here
we take tendernesse, shamefastnesse, modesty in spiritual things,
and blushing before God to be understood; Christ's Bride hath
a tendernesse that is soon affected with wrongs done to him, she
easily resents them; and this is opposite to affrontednesse and a
whores fore-head, which cannot be ashamed, than which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is more displeasing to Christ, and unbecoming to his Bride;
here the temples are not hard, (as the brow that is of brasse)
but like a piece of a Pomegranate, opposite to it; here it is not
stretched out impudently, but covered within the locks, and not
shamelesse and affronted that cannot blush, but coloured (to say
so) with shamefastnesse and blushing, which though they seek to
hide, yet it appears in them. And this application being safe in
it self, and agreeable to the scope: (which shews what Christ is
delighted with in her) And this being a main piece of her beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and also suitable to the commendation, there is no hazard to
fix on it; for, without this she would not be so lovely. Now we
may easily conceive, that this tendernesse, modesty or blushing,
is not any natural indowment, which appears in the carriage of
man to man; but it is a saving grace, which especially is to be
found in believers carriage before Christ, as being their Lord and
Husband: and it evidenceth it self in believers in these, or the
like steps. 1. In their being soon challenged, for any thing that
looks like sin. 2. In their being affected easily with challenges,
and with the infirmities that are in them. 3. In their thinking
shame of them, as of things that are disgraceful. 4. In their not
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:65401:107"/>
being tenacious of them, or of their own will, nor disputing with
Christ in any thing, but passing easily from their compearance, as
it were, and thinking shame to be taken in any sin, or to be found
in mistakes with him. 5. In being sparing to speak of any thing
that tends to commend themselves, or in seeking their own glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
These are commendable things in a believer, and makes him
look like the piece of a Pomegranate, spotted with red and white:
And it shews the result of a believers looking on their own way,
when they take it up, and see that wrong, and this right, and
even that which is right, wrong in so many things, and so many
wayes; whereupon as there is ever some sincerity, so there is
ever some shame, and holy blushing; and this is constant, and
(as it were) native to them, still to blush when they look upon
themselves.</p>
                  <p>2. This commendation, that her temples are <hi>within her locks,</hi>
Imports, that Christ's Bride blushes when none sees, and for that
which no other sees: And also that she seeks not to publish her
exercises, but modestly covers them; yet the evidences of all
these in a tender walk, appear and are comely. <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. Shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastnesse
or sobriety becomes a believer, or Christ's Bride exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
well, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 9. 2. Inward heart-blushing, when we look
upon our selves before God, is the best tryal of true tendernesse.
3. A believer will have many shamefull representations of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and will think much shame of what he sees, which the world
will never be acquainted with. 4. This grace of self-loathing
and holy blushing, is much taken notice of by Christ, and most
especially recorded by him, however it be much hid from others.</p>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>The sixth thing commended in the Bride, is <hi>her neck:</hi> The
neck being comely and straight, adds much to the beauty of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:65401:107"/>
and is placed by nature, as a more eminent and essential part
of the body than the eyes, legs, lips, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or any other part here
mentioned; for, it's that whereby the head and body are joined
together. The commendation therof is, that it's <hi>like the tower
of</hi> David: What particular place this hath reference unto, it's
hard to say, possibly it's that mentioned, <hi>Neh.</hi> 3. 16. 19. 25. cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the <hi>tower of the mighty,</hi> or the armory; It's like, that some
strong hold built by <hi>David,</hi> eminent for beauty and strength, is
hereby signified; which might have been imployed for keeping
of arms, for times of danger, as the words following seem to
bear.</p>
                  <p>2. This tower is more particularly explicat, 1. From the end
and use for which it was intended, It was <hi>built for an armory,</hi>
that men <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
                     </gap> be furnished with arms in time of need. 2. The
store of arms there laid up, is here set down, <hi>whereupon hang a
thousand bucklers, all Shields of mighty men,</hi> that is, It's furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
especially with defensive arms (the believers war being most
defensive) as shields; but with abundance of these, for number
a <hi>thousand;</hi> and for quality excellent, and such as <hi>mighty men</hi>
make use of.</p>
                  <p>If we consider the neck here, in respect of it's use, it holds
forth the vigorous exercise of the grace of faith; for, it's that
by which a believer is united to Christ the head: It's that which
strengthens them, and is their armory furnishing them with
shields, because it provides them out of Christ's fulnesse, which is
contained in the promises; which promises, or rather Christ in
them, being made use of by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>aith, are for a believers security, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
challenges, tentations, discouragements, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as so many
excellent shields: Therefore, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 16. it's called <hi>the shield of
faith,</hi> and for their safety it is commended above all the rest
of the spiritual armour: And this being the believers great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
and specially tending to their commendation when it is in
lively exercise, this similitude cannot be so well applyed to any
other thing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. Faith in exercise is a notable defence to a believer,
against all assaults and temptations; there is no such shield as
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>aith is, every promise, and every attribute in God, is as a shield
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:65401:108"/>
to these that exercise this grace of saith thereupon. 2. Faith
exercised on these, is exceedingly well pleasing to Jesus Christ.
3. That all believers have their arms out of one armory, there
is but one store-house for them all, to wit, faith acting on Christ's
fulnesse. 4. Faith will never want a buckler, there is a <hi>thousand</hi>
laid up in a mag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>

<hi>mighty</hi> and valiant man, who is most in the exercise and use-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of faith. 6. Faith is the grace that makes a man valiant and
victorious, as all the <hi>cloud of witnesses,</hi> Heb. 11. proves.</p>
                  <p>Again, if we consider the neck, as it's commended here, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
like a <hi>tower</hi> for uprightnesse and straightnesse; it signifies a
quiet serene mind, and a confident boldnesse in doing and suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
in which sense, it's opposit to hanging of the head, which
speaks discouragement: And as a stretched out <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> in a carnal
sense, <hi>Isa.</hi> 3. 16. signifies haughtinesse and pride; so here in a

holy boldnesse, which proceeds from the spirit of adoption;
and this waits upon, and follows after the exercise of faith, being
fixed and stayed upon the Lord and his word against all events,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 112. 6. Bold in duties, and valorous in sufferings, and in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoing
any difficulties. So then, this is no small commendation

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>The seventh and last part that is commended in the Bride, is
her <hi>two breasts</hi> or paps. For clearing of this similitude, we are
to consider, 1. That the breasts in nature are a part of the come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse
of the body, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 7. 2. They are useful to give suck
and food to others. 3. They signifie warmnesse of affection, and
lovingnesse, as <hi>Prov. 5. 19. let her breasts alwayes satisfie thee;</hi>
                     <pb n="213" facs="tcp:65401:108"/>
and <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 13. the Bride expressing her affection to Christ, saith,
<hi>he shall lye all night between my breasts;</hi> and so the wise of the
bosome is the chast and beloved spouse: And thus Christ is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Son of God's love, or <hi>of his bosome.</hi> For this cause, we
conceive these things are here understood, 1. A believers fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to edifie others, and that believers are in a condition suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to a married wife, or mother, that brings forth children, and
hath breasts to nurse them: and so to have <hi>no breasts, Chap.</hi> 8. 8.
is opposed to this; a believer is, as it were, a nurse with breasts,
fitted to edifie others. 2. That believers being in case to be
useful to others for their edification, is a special ornament to
their profession. And the third thing that is here understood, is
believers warmlinesse and kindlinesse to Christ, and these that
are his, taking him and them (as it were) in their bosome; the
believer hath warm affections to receive them into. And <hi>two</hi>
breasts are mentioned, to shew there is no defect as to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
but both her breasts are in good case, and alwayes ready in
love to communicat their furniture, for others edification.</p>
                  <p>The commendation is in two steps, each whereof is qualified
for the further inlarging of the commendation. The 1. is, They
are like <hi>two R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>es,</hi> that are lovely and kindly, <hi>Prov.</hi> 5. 17. (often
mentioned before) and like <hi>young Roes,</hi> because these are most
lovely, and suit best to be a similitude to set <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>orth the comeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of that part of the body; they are like young Roes, not
too big; for, when breasts are too big, it's a deformity: And so
when private edification exceeds it's true bounds, it's not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provable
or lovely. And these Roes to which her breasts are
compared, are <hi>twins:</hi> Which shews, an equality and proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ablenesse
in their love to God and to others, giving each of these
their own place, and keeping their love to creatures in the right
subordination; and also their communicating their love to others,
in admonitions and rebukes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> equally, keeping a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionablenesse
in all.</p>
                  <p>The second part of the commendation, is, they <hi>feed among the
Lilies:</hi> As Roes would not maintain their pleasantnesse long, if
they did not feed; yea, if the pasture were not good: So, these
must needs be pleasant and useful, because they feed, and that not in
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:65401:109"/>
a wildernesse, but amongst the lilies; Which shews, that believer
in fitting and furnishing themselves; that they may be forthcoming
for others edification, do not neglect their own advantage and
edification, but feed on good pasture, whereby they are yet more
fitted for being useful to others.</p>
                  <p>By <hi>feeding</hi> in this Song, is understood, 1. To be present in such
a place, as <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 16. 2. To make use of that which is food
for the intertaining of life. 3. To delight in a thing for satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
of the affections. Next, by the Brides <hi>breasts</hi> (being <hi>like
Roes that feed amongst the Lilies</hi>) three things may be understood.
1. As this expression respects Christ's feeding, (so to speak) for
he is said to <hi>feed amongst the Lilies, Chap.</hi> 2. 16. and so it sayes,
that the believer loves to feed in Christ's company, and where he
is. And, 2. That this makes believers breasts run to others, when
they are much with him, and in his company. 2. As it respects
believers, who are called <hi>Lilies, Chap.</hi> 2. 16. and, 6. 2. And so it
sayes, 1. That all believers have one pasture, they feed together
as a flock doth. 2. That one believer loves and delights in the
company of another, they are the <hi>excellent</hi> and the <hi>lilies</hi> of the
earth, their delight is with them. And, 3. That this helps a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
growth, and fits him to be usefull for others edification,
and to improve well the spiritual fellowship of other believers.
3. As it respects Christ himself, who is called a <hi>lilie, Chap.</hi> 2. 1.
and his <hi>lips</hi> are said to be <hi>like lilies droping,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 13.
Whereby is holden out, his Word, Promises, Ordinances, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
And so it sayes, 1. That Christ and his word is the great and main
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ood, upon which believers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>eed, that is their proper pasture; to
be much drinking-in the <hi>sincere milk of the word</hi> is their meat
and drink. 2. That much acquaintance with Christ in the word,
inables one for being very useful to others. In sum, it sayes,
1. That a believer is no bare novice, but hath breasts that yeelds
milk and nourishment to others. 2. That a believer hath a good
pasture to feed on. 3. That believers breasts run to others, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as they feed themselves; If they hunger themselves, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
will not be edified by them; if they feed on wind and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty
notions themselves, it will be no healthful food that others
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:65401:109"/>
will receive from them. 4. That it's a pleasant thing and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to Christ, when a believer so communicats what he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
to others, as he is still feeding on Christ himself, and not
living on the stock he hath already received.</p>

her beauty, that he tels her, he cannot but haunt her company,
and answer her prayers. For, comparing this verse with <hi>vers.</hi> 17.
<hi>chap.</hi> 2. we find it a clear answer of her petition she puts up there. The
words contain, 1. A promise. 2. A term set to the performance
of it, shewing the continuance of his performance. The promise
is, <hi>I will get me to the mountain of Myrrhe, and to the hill of Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incense:</hi>

Christ's, or shutting of himself up in heaven from her; for, that
will not agree to the scope, which is to shew how he loves her,
and comforts her; nor will that be an answer of her prayer, but
the contrary: It must then hold forth some comfortable act of
Christ's, evidencing his respect to her for her consolation; which
we conceive to be a promise of his presence with her to the end
of the world. By <hi>mountain</hi> is often und<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

And it's called <hi>a mountain of Myrrhe, and hill of Frankincense,</hi> to

<pb n="216" facs="tcp:65401:110"/>
and savourinesse of the graces of Gods people, and of their
prayers, <hi>Psal. 141. 2. Let my prayer be set forth before thee as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense,</hi>
&amp;c. Here then is understood that place of the world
(namely the Church) where the graces of Gods people flow,
and their prayers (as acceptable sacrifices) are put up to him;
And so it answers the scope, and is opposed to the mountains of
the world, mentioned in the eighth verse. The Church is called
the <hi>mountain of Myrrhe,</hi> and <hi>hill of Frankincense,</hi> 1. Because it's
the place, where the graces signified by these are to be found:
It's only in Believers they do abound. 2. Because there they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
in prayers and praises, which ascend before him, as incense
from an high place. 3. Because he accepts so kindly of their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
that they are pleasant to him, and he delights to rest amongst
them beyond all other places, as being a <hi>mountain of Myrrhe;</hi> In
which respect, the house of God is called the house of prayer,
because of the exercise of that duty frequently performed there.</p>
                  <p>The second thing is the term he sets to the performance of this
promise, in these words, <hi>untill the day break, and the shadows flee
away: I will get me</hi> (saith he) <hi>to the mountain of Myrrhe,</hi> till that
day; The sense is, amongst all places of the world, the Church is
the place in which I will choose to reside, and with believers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding
in the exercise of grace and prayer; they shall not want
my presence, for there will I abide, untill the everlasting day of
immediat fellowship with them break up: And so this makes for
the Brides comfort, thou mayst my spouse (saith he) expect my
company, and the acceptation of thy prayers (which are as incense
to me) untill that day come, as thou desired: Where we may
see, (beside what was spoken upon this expression, <hi>chap.</hi> 2. 17.)
1. That Christ conforms his answers to our suits, and makes the
one as extensive as the other; the term she proposed, is that he
accepts of. 2. His hearing of one prayer, gives ground to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to expect that he will hear all their prayers, and so he is called
the <hi>hearer of prayer</hi> indefinitly, <hi>Psal.</hi> 65. 2. and this is the reason
why he sayes not, he will turn to her: (which would look to that
one prayer, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 17.) but he saith, he will <hi>get him to the hill
of Frankincense,</hi> which looks to all her prayers, and so his answer
is more extensive, than the particular sought; which shews,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:65401:110"/>
3. That as Christ will not mince his answers to believers,
and make them lesse than their prayers, so he will often inlarge
them, and make them more extensive than their prayers.</p>
                  <p>Next, from this that he gives believers such a name, as the <hi>hill
of Franckincense,</hi> which is in a special way, with respect to their
prayers, <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. That believers ought to be very frequent in
prayer, like an hill that abounds in incense. 2. That Christ's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
is ever to be found, where these spiritual sacrifices of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and praises abound: For, where ever he hath an Altar built to
himself, and <hi>records his Name,</hi> there he <hi>will come and blesse his
people,</hi> Exod. 20. 24.</p>
                  <p>Again, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e sets down this by way of promise, it gives us
ground to observe, 1. That even our sense of Christ's presence,
is in, and by a promise; and it's the promise thereof that should
comfort and satisfie the believer, even when sense is removed, and
is not for the time injoyed, as <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 21, 23. 2. Christ limits
himself to no other term-day, for continuing of the fulfilling, and
performing of his promises, than that very time when believers
shall be entered into the possession of what is promised; for, <hi>I
will grant thy desire</hi> (saith he) <hi>untill the day break,</hi> &amp;c. that is,
un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e great day come, I will keep this course with believers.
3. Christ's promise of coming, and his making that sure, is one of
the greatest evidences of love which he can bestow on his people.
4. There is no society or place (to speak so) but the Church, nor
any person in the Church, but such as abound in spiritual sacrifices,
who have a promise of Christ's presence. 5. Christ would have
the thoughts of eternal life, and of immediat injoying of himself,
entertained in his Bride, and would have her confirmed in the
faith of it; and therefore is there here a particular repetition of
the term which had been mentioned, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 17. 6. He would
by this repetition also expresse, that (some way) he longs for that
day of the consummation of the marriage, as well as she doth, and
that he would gladly have all shadows gone betwixt him and
her; which serves much to confirm her in the faith of it, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
her till it come.</p>

                  <p>This verse contains the last piece of the commendation which
Christ gives to his Bride, and it is the scope of all; whereby, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
spoken of some particular parts, he now sums up all in a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
1. Positively exprest, <hi>Thou art all fair, my love.</hi> Then,
2. Negatively, <hi>There is no spot in thee.</hi> The reason why, thus in
a general, he closes up her commendation, is to shew that his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing
the enumeration of the rest of her parts, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>s not because
of any defect that was in her, or that his touching of some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
was to commend these parts only, but to shew this in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
that all of her parts, as well not named as named were love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
This universal commendation is not to be understood in a
popish sense, as if she had had no sin; for, that will not agree with
other expresse Scriptures, nor with this Song, where she records
her own faults, as <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 6. and 3. 1. and 5. 2, 3. And also
this commendation agrees to all believers, who yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>cknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
by themselves not to be perfect. Neither is it to be taken
in an <hi>Antinomian</hi> sense, as if their sins and failings were no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap> sins
to them, and did not pollute them; for, 1. That is not consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
with the nature of sin. Nor, 2. With the Brides regrates and
confessions in this Song; Nor, 3. With the present scope, which
is to shew the Brides beauty: And he doth thus highly commend
her beauty, not because her sins were not sins in her, as they were
in others, but because her graces were more lovely, which were
not to be found in others: Hence the particular parts of the new
creature, or inherent holinesse, are insisted on for proof of this;
Further, this commendation did agree to believers before Christ
came in the flesh; And this love-assertion, <hi>thou art all fair,</hi>
holds true of the Bride, in these four respects, 1. In respect of
Justification and absolution she is clean, though needing washing
in other respects, <hi>Ioh. 13. Ye are clean by the word that I have
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
                        </gap>,</hi> yet they needed to have their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>eet washen. Thus a belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
is in a justified state, and legally clean and fair, so as there is
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:65401:111"/>
no sin imputed to him, or to be found in him to condemn him,
because the Lord hath pardoned them, <hi>Ier.</hi> 50. 20. 2. It's true
in respect of Sanctification and inherent holinesse, they are all <hi>fair,</hi>
that is, they are wholly renewed, there is no part but it is beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
in respect of God's grace (though in degree it be not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.)
Thus where grace is true, it's extended through the whole
man, and makes an universal change. 3. It's true in respect of
Christ's acceptation; and so where there is sincerity in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
he over-looks and passeth by many spots<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> thus thou art all <hi>fair,</hi>
that is, in my account thou art so, I reckon not thy spots, but
esteem of thee as if thou had no spot: Christ is no severe inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter
of his peoples actions; and where there is honesty, and no
spots inconsistent with the state of children, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 2. he will
reckon of them, as if there were none at all. 4. It's true of
Christ's Bride that she is <hi>all fair,</hi> in respect of Christ's design, He
will make her at last <hi>without spot, or wrinkle or any such thing,</hi> Eph.
5. 25, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And because of the certainty of it, it's applyed to
her now, as being already entered in the possession thereof in her
Head, in whom she is set in heavenly-places. Hence we may see,
1. The honest believer ere all be done, will be made fully fair
and without spot. 2. Christ often expounds an honest believer,
from his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
                     </gap> of heart-purpose and design; in which respect they get
many titles, otherwise unsuitable to their present condition; and
believers themselves may someway reckon so also. If all were put
together, it were a great matter for a believer to conceive and
apprehend these words as spoken to him in particular from Christ's
mouth, thou, even <hi>thou art fair:</hi> And without this, they will
want their lustre, for certainly Christ speaks so upon the matter to
some, and he allowes that they should believe that he speaks so
unto them.</p>

place, but shewing that Lions and Leopards o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and it's like upon these, notwithstanding all their beauty: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
mountains, are called <hi>mountains of prey,</hi> Psal. 76. 4. because

is somewhat, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2. 17. that confirmes this, where the <hi>violence
of Lebanon,</hi> and the <hi>spoil of beasts,</hi> is mentioned, supposing that
there, beasts used violently to spoil.</p>
                  <p>By these <hi>mountains</hi> here, we conceive are understood the most
excellent, eminent and choice satisfactions that are to be found
amongst the creatures, wherein the men of the world delight,
who are often compared to ravenous beasts: and the reason is,
it's something that is conceived to be excellent, that is here im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
by the description, yet such as hath no true excellency in it;
therefore the Bride is called from it, and commanded to look o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it, even at it's height, and to leave it to the men of the world,
whose portion properly these heights and excellencies are, for
they have not another to enjoy or look after. By <hi>Lions</hi> and <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pards,</hi>
we understand covetous, worldly men, who pursue the
world to the destruction of themselves and others; So they are
often called in Scripture, as <hi>Psal. 57. 4, &amp;c.</hi> 1. For their devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
insatiable nature, that can never have enough, but use al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
to prey on others. 2. For their unreasonable, brutish na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
being in their way like bruit-beasts, rather than men, <hi>Psal.
49. ult.</hi> 3. For their malicious nature, that are alwayes hurting
the godly that are amongst them. Again, these heights and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies
of the world, are called the <hi>dens</hi> and <hi>mountains</hi> of these
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:65401:113"/>
beasts, 1. Because often ungodly men have the greatest share of
those, and have no more to claim unto; <hi>their portion is in this
life,</hi> Psal. 17. <hi>penult.</hi> 2. Because they rest in them, and seek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
no more, as Lions do in their dens. These mountains then
are the excellencies of the creatures; for the injoyment of which
men often use great violence, therefore they are called, <hi>Psal.</hi> 76. 5.
<hi>mountains of prey,</hi> as having such beasts, as cruel men lurking in
them, above which God (who is the portion of his people) is
there said to be far more excellent; and thus these mountains here
are opposed to the <hi>mountain of Myrrhe,</hi> vers. 6. where Christ hath
his residence. Next, the Church, (whose state and case is suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to be the same naturally with the men of the world) is called
from this her natural state, and from the remainders of such a
frame, in two words, 1. <hi>Come,</hi> quite it, saith he, and come
with me, which is the same with that command, <hi>Chap. 2. 10. Rise
up and come away,</hi> implying the exercising of saith in him, and the
delighting of her self in communion with him (as the Spouse
should do with her Husband) and a withdrawing from these crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
concernments, wherein men of the world sought their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
The second word is, <hi>look from the top of these,</hi> which word
sets out faith also, so <hi>Isa. 45. 19. Look unto me,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>looking
from these,</hi> signifieth her elevating and lifting of her affections
higher than the highest excellencies of the earth, even towards
heaven and the injoyment of Christ, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 1, 2. And so it saith,
she is not to look to what is present, but to what is not seen,
and coming, which is by faith only to be discerned and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded:
And this is to be done, by looking over the tops of the
highest of created excellencies. Now this word being added to
the former, doth shew, that when they cannot <hi>come,</hi> they are to
<hi>look;</hi> and that their looks are not to be fixed on created things,
as their objects, but must ascend higher, as the <hi>Israelites</hi> from these
mountains, <hi>Hermon</hi> and <hi>Shenir,</hi> beheld <hi>Canaan,</hi> with desire to be
there,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. The world hath it's own taking excellencies, it's <hi>heights</hi>
and <hi>mountains,</hi> whereby it looks very pleasant to many. 2. The
most beautiful created excellency hath a palpable defect in it,
the most pleasant hill hath a wilde Lion lodging in it, that marrs
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:65401:113"/>
all the satisfaction that can be found there to a believer; and
God hath wisely so ordered, that every gourd to them hath a

The believer in this is beyond <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, who desired

all these, as undervaluing them, and longing to be at something

he is for the time absent; and when believers cannot win to walk
and move towards him, they may look to him; and sure, Christ
who calls for this, will accept of it, till the other be attained.

excellent of created contentments, for profite, honour and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
should be denyed and forsaken when Christ calls. 15. There
is nothing a believer would watch more against, (as that which
marrs fellowship with Christ) than taking excessive contentment in
created things. 16. Often a condition which abounds in worldly
contentments and delights, is very scarce of Christ's company;
therefore when he allowes her his presence, he calls her to leave
them, in her affection at least.</p>
                  <p>3. Because he knows the world is most bewitching, and the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
of his Bride are not soon weaned from it (though this be
most necessary) therefore three wayes he presseth her to deny her
self in these, and follow him (which is the sum of the call,)
1. Saith he, thou art <hi>my Spouse,</hi> that is, my Bride: It's the same
word which (<hi>Ier.</hi> 2. 32.) is translated <hi>Bride, Can a Bride forget her
attire?</hi> This title is frequently given her in this Chapter, and
<hi>vers. 1. Chap.</hi> 5. Importing, 1. A marriage-tye and relation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
him and her. 2. Love in him, owning that relation, and
claiming thereby an interest in her. 3. A duty in her to owne
him as her Husband, and to forsake all her lovers, that she go not
a-whoring after any other, as a wife should cleave to her husband:
It's the same with what is pressed, <hi>Psal. 45. 10, &amp;c.</hi> My Spouse
(saith he) thou hast not thy portion in the world, therefore come
away from it. 2. He presseth it from the advantage of his own
company, which she should enjoy upon her obeying his call: <hi>Come
with me</hi> (saith he) my Spouse, and this is repeated, <hi>come with me,</hi>
that is, thou art mine, and I am thy Husband, wilt thou not then
come with me, <hi>with me?</hi> This is a weighty argument, and none
will prevail, if this do not; Christ's company should have more
weight, and be of more force to ingage a believer to Christ, than
all the pleasantnesse of the world can have to divert them: He is
more excellent be far than the <hi>mountains of prey,</hi> Psal. 76. 4. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is his company to be preferred to them all. 3. He presseth
it, from the heartless condition which she could not but have in
the most excellent things in the world without Christ, they were
but <hi>dens of Lions,</hi> not for her to stay with, nor yet any way agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with her state and case. Hence observe, 1. When Christ and
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:65401:114"/>
the most excellent things in the world are opposed, there will be
great odds, and a vast difference seen betwixt them. 2. All the
defects that abound in created excellencies, should necessitatethe
believer to take himself to Christ; there is no satisfaction for him
till he come there. 3. Men have no great losse that loose their
affections from the world, and set them on Christ; It's but lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the dens of <hi>Lions,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>coming to him,</hi> who is more <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
then all the mountains of prey.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We may also read these words, by way of promise, <hi>Thou shall
come with me:</hi> And the scope will not be against this, it being no
lesse an evidence of Christ's love, and no lesse comfortable to the
Church, to have his promise, than to have his call; and all his
calls having promises implyed in them, both will well agree. And
so that which is set down by way of precept, <hi>Rom. 6. 12. Let not
sin reign in your mortal body,</hi> is set down by way of promise,

company; for, his heart is ravished with her. The scope in both
verses is the same, but is more clearly exprest, <hi>vers.</hi> 10. Not so
much setting forth the Churches loveliness (though that is not to
be excluded) as his loving kindnesse, who is admirably affected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
her, as every word in matter and manner of both, shews. In
them consider, 1. The titles given her, which are the same in
both verses. 2. What is asserted, and that is, that his heart is
<hi>ravished.</hi> 3. The manner how this is expressed, in a sort of holy
passion, doubling the expression. 4. Wherewith it is his heart
is so ravished, it's (saith he) <hi>with one of thine eyes,</hi> &amp;c. In the
end of the 9. <hi>vers.</hi> and more fully amplified, <hi>vers.</hi> 10.</p>
                  <p>The titles are two; one of them, namely that she is his <hi>Spouse,</hi>
hath been spoken of; but his repeating of it, shews a kind of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
in it, as being very much delighted therewith. The other
title, <hi>my sister,</hi> is added, and it doth import these five things,
1. A condescending upon Christ's part to be thus joyned in kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to the believer, and so it takes in his incarnation, whereby
he was made <hi>in all things like to his brethren,</hi> Heb. 2. 17. Our
blessed Lord Jesus is man, believers are his brethren and sisters,
they are bone of his bone, and flesh of his flesh; and for his Brides
consolation this is asserted. 2. A priviledge whereto she is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
upon her part, and that is, that by Adoption believers are
become sons and daughters to the Lord God Almighty, not only
friends but children, and so <hi>heirs</hi> and <hi>joynt-heirs</hi> with Jesus Christ,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. So as now they are his brethren and sisters, which is an
unspeakable advancement. 3. It imports a change of nature, as
well as of state in believers, so that they partake of the divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and Spirit with Christ Jesus, as it is, <hi>Heb. 2. 11. He that
sanctifieth,</hi> and <hi>they that are sanctified, are of one;</hi> which is a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
ground of his sibnesse and kindred to believers, not common
to others, but special to them, and founded on their sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
4. It implyes sympathy, friendlinesse, and a kindly esteem
in him, that takes her up, and speaks of her, and to her, in all the
most sweet relations of <hi>mother, sister, spouse,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Matth. 12. ult.</hi>
5. It shews, his owning of all these relations, he is not ashamed
to call believers, <hi>sisters</hi> and <hi>brethren,</hi> Heb. 2. 11. <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. There
are many wonderful, near and sweet relations betwixt Christ and
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:65401:115"/>
the believer. 2. Christ is the most faithful owner of them, and
is in a most friendly way forth-coming to them, according to
them all.</p>
                  <p>2. The thing asserted here, is, <hi>Thou hast ravished my heart:</hi>
The word in the first language is one, and it signifieth, <hi>Thou hast
hearted me,</hi> or so to speak, <hi>Thou hast unhearted me:</hi> It's no where
else in Scripture, but here; Christ's unspeakable love, as it were,
coins new words to discover it self by, it's so unexpressible:
The word is borrowed from the passionatnesse of love, when it
siezes deeply on a man, it leaves him not master of his own heart,
but the object loved hath it, and (as it were) possesseth it, and
commands it more than the man himself; so the Gospel saith,
<hi>where a mans treasure is,</hi> (that is, the thing a man esteems most of)
<hi>there</hi> (as it were) <hi>his heart is,</hi> and not in the party that loves, <hi>Mat.</hi>
6. 21. So the common phrase is, such a man <hi>hath my heart,</hi> when
he is dearly beloved; and thus in a subtile way, <hi>Absolom</hi> is said
to have <hi>stollen away the hearts of the people from his father.</hi> It's
in sum, <hi>my spouse thou hast my heart,</hi> thou hast won it, and as it
were by violence taken it away, I am not master of it, I cannot
but love thee.</p>
                  <p>It's hard to draw observations, that may suitably expresse the
thing here spoken of; only we may hint at these things. 1. Love
in Christ to a believer, hath strong and wonderful effects on him,
in reference to them. 2. The believer hath Christ's heart, he
hath a seat in his affection, he possesseth his love (for no other thing
hath his heart) and he may promise himself from Christ, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he can desire for his good, even as if he had his heart under
his command; for (so to speak) he can refuse believers nothing,
which they seek, and which he knows to be for their good. 3. Love
in Christ to a believer, it's at a height, or, it's a love of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
degree: There is no greater intensnesse thereof imaginable;
for, to have the <hi>heart ravished,</hi> is the expression of the
greatest love.</p>
                  <p>3. The manner how he expresseth this, is by doubling the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
<hi>Thou hast ravished my heart, thou hast ravished my heart:</hi>
And this is to shew, that this word <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ell not rashly from him, but
was drawn out by the vehemency of affection in him. 2. That
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:65401:116"/>
he allowes believers to believe this great love and affection he
hath to them, and would have them dwelling on the believing
thoughts of it; and therfore, he doubles the expression while he
intimats his love unto them: Only remember there are no dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly
passions in Christ, as in us; yet, that there is sympathy
and love in him, and passionat effects of love from him, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be denyed.</p>
                  <p>The fourth thing is, wherewith it is his heart is so ravished:
It may be thought to be some great thing that thus prevails over
Christ: Now what it is, is set down in two expressions, which
are joyned to the former, to make this love of his the more won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful;
that which was conquered, or ravished, was <hi>his heart;</hi>
that which doth it, is <hi>her eye,</hi> the eye or look of a poor sinful
creature, even of such a person, as may be despised in the world,
and like <hi>Lazarus</hi> full of sores, and not admitted to mens compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
2. It's not with <hi>both her eyes,</hi> but (saith he) with <hi>one of thy
eyes,</hi> that is (as it were) with a squint-look; a side-look of the
Bride prevailed thus with him. One eye is not here mentioned,
as preferring the beauty of one of her eyes to the other; but to
shew what excellent beauty is in her, and much more what infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit
love is in him, that he could not (because he would not) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
a look of one of her eyes cast toward him. We shew what is
understood by <hi>eyes, vers.</hi> 1. and it's explicat in the following verse,
to hold forth love especially here (lovers using to signifie affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by their eyes) yet it takes in knowledge, as being presuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;
and faith as going alongst. The second expression is, <hi>with
one chain of thy neck:</hi> These chains were spoken of, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 10.
Whereby we shew was signified her inherent holinesse, with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
righteousnesse, which by faith she possessed; and so here
also it signifies her graces, especially her exercising faith on him,
for so the neck was expounded, <hi>vers.</hi> 9. to be understood of faith,
which joineth the believer to Christ as his head: And it is said
to have <hi>chains,</hi> because it never wants excellent fruits, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
it is adorned, when it is exercised. One <hi>chain</hi> is spoken of,
not as if she had not had moe, or as if he did not respect them
all, but to hold forth this, that one of her chains (as it were) did
overcome him; and so it may be gathered, what will both eyes
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:65401:116"/>
do, and moe chains, when one so prevails. The scope then here
doth shew, 1. That Christ is easily prevailed with by his people,
O how easily is he overcome by them, who have love to him,
and faith in him! 2. That Christ stands not on the degree of his
peoples graces, nor doth he suspend his love and acceptation of a
person, upon such or such a degree; but where ever reality and
sincerity are, if it were in the meanest degree, and but one look,
or one chain, he will yield to it, and accept of it. 3. It's to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
and incourage believers to cast a look to Christ, when they
find their faith to be so weak that they can do no more; and to
confirm them in the expectation of good from him freely, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any rigid reckoning: It's not only the strong believer, and
the strong acts of faith and love, that prevail with Christ, but
he condescends to be overcome, even by the weakest, with whom
the sincerity of these graces is to be found.</p>
                  <p>This is further followed and explicat, <hi>vers.</hi> 10. and that two
wayes, 1. By an indefinite question, <hi>How fair is thy love!</hi> 2. By
two comparative questions, whereby in two similitudes, her love
is preferred to the most excellent things, <hi>How much better,</hi> &amp;c.
The thing commended, is <hi>her love,</hi> that is, the love wherewith she
loves him, wherewith her heart breathes after him, delights in
him, esteems of him, and is zealous to please him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
he gives her love, is, that it is <hi>fair.</hi> And by the way
we may observe, that this clearly shews, that by all the former
parts of her beauty, are understood spiritual graces: Now (saith
he) <hi>thy love is fair,</hi> that is, it's lovely and acceptable to me: as
beauty and fairnesse are much esteemed amongst men: So this
grace of love is a beautiful thing in Christ's Bride. The manner
of the expression is by way of question, and admiration, <hi>How fair!</hi>
I can get nothing (saith he) to compare it with: a wonder, that
Christ should be so taken with the love of sinners, as to admire
it, or think that their love exceeds all expression; for, so men
use to expresse what they cannot expresse: But this doth indeed
shew, that the heighth and depth and length and breadth of that
love, which Christ hath to believing sinners, passeth all knowledge,
and is beyond all words. <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. That a believer is one that
loves Christ, and true faith hath alwayes this grace of love joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:65401:117"/>
to it. 2. That love where it is sincere and true, is a proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Christ's Bride and Spouse; there are no other in the world
who love him, but these who are espoused to him. 3. Where love
to Christ is, there Christ loves; he cannot but love them, that
love him; and there is nothing more acceptable to him, than the
faith that is working by love. 4. Our Lord Jesus takes special
notice of the frame of the heart, and what seat he hath in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
of his people; he layes more weight on their love, than
on their work, though true love can never be without works.</p>
                  <p>The second way how he explains and illustrates this, is more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
by two comparisons, yet keeping still the former manner of
expression, by way of question and admiration: The first is, <hi>how
much better is thy love then Wine!</hi> Wine may be looked on in
two respects, 1. As it's useful in mans life, and refreshful, <hi>Psal.
104. 15. It maketh glad the heart of man,</hi> and <hi>Eccl.</hi> 10 19. It <hi>mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the heart merry:</hi> Wine is one of the most comfortable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
therefore she calls <hi>his love better then Wine, Chap.</hi> 1. 2. Thus
observe, 1. Christ will not be behind with his people, neither in
kindnesse nor in the expressions of it; for, this is beyond hers,
<hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 2. Not that he hath a better object to love, but because
the love wherewith he loves her, is like himself, and more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
then hers. 2. There is no such refreshful thing in all the
work of creation of Christ, no such feast, as the warming of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
heart with love to him is: This (<hi>Luk.</hi> 7. 47.) is thought
more of by Christ in a poor woman, than all the great feast he
was invited unto by the rich Pharisee.</p>
                  <p>Again, we may look on Wine as used in the ceremonial servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and drink-offerings, <hi>Levit. 23. 13, &amp;c.</hi> Thus the meaning is,
thy love is preferable to all outward performances and sacrifices,
as <hi>Hos.</hi> 6. 7. Love being the principle within, from which all our
performances should flow, it is not opposed to sacrifice simply,
or to obedience; but, 1. Supposing these to be separate, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
love; if it were to cast in but a mite of duty out of love, it
will be more acceptable than the greatest bulk of duties without
love, as is clear in the case of the widow, <hi>Luk.</hi> 21. Yea, if men
would <hi>give their bodies to be burnt,</hi> without this, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 3. it
will avail nothing. 2. It saith, that where both the inward prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:65401:117"/>
and the outward fruit or work are, the Lord respects that
more than this, and he respects this in a manner but for that.</p>
                  <p>The second comparison is to the same purpose in these words,
<hi>and the smell of thine Ointments then all spices!</hi> Ointments typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
the graces of the Spirit, the pouring out whereof, is called,
<hi>the unction,</hi> Joh. 2. 20. and <hi>the oil of joy,</hi> Psal. 45. 7. The <hi>smell</hi>
thereof signifieth the acceptablenesse of these graces, when in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise;
our Lord Jesus finds a sweet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>avour in them, as ointments
cast a smell that is refreshful to men (as was said upon <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 6.)
the grace of love mentioned before is here included; but under
<hi>Ointments</hi> there is more comprehended, to shew, 1. That where
one grace is, there are all the rest of the graces of the Spirit to be
found. 2. That love to Christ, and zeal for him, holds believers
stirring, and makes them send forth a sweet and savory smell.
This smell is preferred <hi>to all Spices,</hi> not to one or two, but to all:
Spices were either used as gifts, because they were precious and
costly; So the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> propined <hi>Solomon</hi> with them,
2 <hi>King.</hi> 10. 2. and the wise men offered such to Christ, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2. 11.
And so it saith, there is no such propine can be offered to Christ,
as love, and the graces of his Spirit, when they are in exercise.
Again, spices were used in the Levitical services, and holy Oil,
<hi>Exod.</hi> 30. 23, 24. and so they are to be considered as <hi>Wine</hi> was in
the last sense formerly spoken of, and it shews how preferable the
inward exercise of grace, is to all external duties. Lastly, they
are not only prefered, while he saith, <hi>thy love is better,</hi> &amp;c. but as
passing comparison, they are extolled far above all these things
with which they are compared, <hi>How fair,</hi> or <hi>how much better is
thy love then Wine!</hi> &amp;c. O my Spouse (saith he) it's not to be
wondered that thy love ravishes my heart; for, there is no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
thing so precious, nor any external service so acceptable to me,
as it is. Hence observe, 1. That inward love, or the inward
exercise of grace, and outward performances are separable.
2 That when outward performances are separate from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
exercise of love and other graces, the Lord respects them
not. 3. That love is a good and necessary principle of all due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and especially of the duties of worship. 4. These who have
any thing of the lively exercise of love to Christ, want never a

propine that will be acceptable to him; if it were but a mite,
or a cup of cold-water, or a look to Christ, if love be the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
from which these flow, they will be very acceptable with
him.</p>

                  <p>Having thus expressed his affection to his Bride, he breaks forth
in a positive commendation of her (which may be looked upon as
the ground of the comparative commendation in the former
verse) and he describes and commends her at once, these two
wayes, 1. Touching, as it were, at some particulars (which are
indeed generals) wherein her lovelinesse appears in actual fruits,
<hi>vers.</hi> 11. 2. In seven comparisons he holds forth her fruitfulnesse
from the 12. to the 16. <hi>vers.</hi> wherein he not only commends her
by the fruits which she brings forth, but from her fitnesse or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
to bring forth these fruits, so that she cannot but be fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full;
As if one commending an Orchard from the fruit, Apples,
Pomegranates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or whatever other fruits are in Orchards,
should then fall upon the commendation of the Orchard it self in
it's situation, fences, waters, or kinds of the plants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So is it
here. And this last commendation, is to be looked upon as the
cause of the former.</p>
                  <p>In this 11<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>vers.</hi> there are three particulars commended: un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
which we conceive much of the series of a believers walk is
understood. The 1. Is her <hi>lips:</hi> which are commended from
this, that they <hi>drop as the honey comb:</hi> By lips, as <hi>vers.</hi> 3. and
frequently in the Song (and so in the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> a man of lips is
taken for a man of talk) is understood her speech, words or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
especially to others. These her words, (or her speech)
are compared for the matter, to <hi>honey</hi> or <hi>the honey comb,</hi> that is
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:65401:118"/>
sweet, nourishing, healthful and pleasant; as <hi>Prov. 16. 24. Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
words are as the honey-comb, sweet to the soul, and health to the
bones:</hi> And by honey in Scripture, is often understood that which
is excellent, and useful for the life of man: And therefore it was
a property of <hi>Canaan,</hi> that it flowed with milk and honey, which
are put together in the following piece of her commendation.
2. Her speech or words, are commended from the manner or qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification
of them, <hi>They drop as the honey-comb,</hi> &amp;c. Droping
words signifie, 1. Seasonable words, which are like dew, drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for the edification of others, as dew by it's droping makes
the fields fruitful. 2. Prudence and moderation in discourse,
and so droping is opposed to floods, that with violence overflow.
3. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>his phrase <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ignifieth a continuance in seasonable, prudent and
edifying discourse, as <hi>Iob, 27. 22. My words droped on them,</hi> and
<hi>Deut. 31. 2. My doctrine shall drop as the rain:</hi> Thus <hi>the lips of
the wise feed many,</hi> Prov. 10. 21. <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. A believers words
tend to edification, and are for the true benefite and advantage of
others. 2. Every subject is not the matter of their discourse;
but, as the <hi>honey,</hi> it's excellent and choice, and that which mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistreth
grace to the hearers. 3. Mens words give a great proof of
what is in them; and when rightly ordered, they are a good evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of their love and respect to Christ. 4. A well ordered
tongue is a most commendable thing before Christ, and every
word that proceeds from the mouth, is observed by him.
5. Christ's spouse should be observably different, as to her words
and discourse, from all others. <hi>Thy lips, O my spouse</hi> (saith he)
<hi>drop as the honey-comb:</hi> Implying, that whatever be the way of
others, it becomes the spouse of Christ, to have her words sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable,
savoury and edifying.</p>
                  <p>The second thing here commended, reacheth more inwardly, and
it is in these words, <hi>honey and milk are under thy tongue:</hi> There
will be sometimes smooth words as butter, when there is much
venome within; it's not so with Christ's Bride. By <hi>under the
tongue,</hi> which is the part commended, we understand the heart
or inward-man, as it's distinguished from the bare expression of
the tongue or words, which are only spoken (as we say) from the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>eth forward: So, <hi>Psal.</hi> 66. 17. He <hi>was exalted under my tongue,</hi>
                     <pb n="234" facs="tcp:65401:119"/>
(as it's in the Original) is expounded in the following verse, by
<hi>heart-regarding:</hi> There was an agreement betwixt his words and
his heatt, without which God would not have accepted his words.
And seing when it's said of the wicked, that <hi>mischief and vanity
are under their tongue, Psa. 10. 7. Rom.</hi> 3. 13. whereby their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful
rotten heart, and the venom that is within is signified; So
here must be understood inward sincerity, and a good frame of
heart within, as well as good words without. The commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is, that there are <hi>milk and honey under her tongue:</hi> It's almost
the same with the former; As her words were edifying, so there
was much edifying matter in her heart, or <hi>under her tongue,</hi> the
honey-comb (as it were) was there, and it by words droped to
others. <hi>Milk</hi> is added, because it's also sweet and nourishing.
In a word, that which he here points at, is, that her inward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
and frame is like a <hi>Canaan,</hi> flowing with milk and honey;
so fertile and fruitful is Christ's Bride. Here, observe. 1. That Christ
takes not only notice of words, but of what is under the words;
the disposition and frame of the heart, and the thoughts thereof
are observed by him. 2. There is a suitablenesse often betwixt
the heart within, and the words without; when there is honey
under the tongue, then the tongue cannot but drop; for, out of
the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks. 3. It's a most
commendable thing in the believer, when the inner-man is right,
in a lively and edifying frame, and when the heart is watched over,
so that no thought enters in, or word goes forth, but what is
edifying. 4. The heart would be furnished with edifying, profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
purpose and thoughts, as well as the mouth with pertinent
and useful words; and that is as the fountain, from which this
must run and flow. 5. They will feed and edifie others best by
their words, who feed best upon the most healthful subjects, and
savoury thoughts themselves.</p>
                  <p>The third thing commended, is, <hi>the smell of her garments:</hi>
Garments are that which covers our nakednesse, and are for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corement
externally put upon the body; sometimes by them is
understood Christ's righteousnesse, whom we are <hi>said to put on,
Gal.</hi> 3. 27. Sometimes our own inherent holinesse, which makes
our way comely before others, and hides our nakednesse from them;
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:65401:119"/>
So, <hi>Iob.</hi> 29. 19. saith, <hi>I put on righteousnesse, and it cloathed me.</hi> Now
here it's to be taken especially in the last sense (though not only)
as setting forth the outward adorning of her walk with holinesse; and
this is the third part of her commendation, distinguished from the
other two, which pointed at her words and thoughts. And so it's
the practice of holinesse that is here commended, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to <hi>garments,</hi> because good works are called the cloathing of
such as professe godlinesse, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 9. and 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 3, 4. The
<hi>smell</hi> of them, is the savour and relish of these good works to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and also to him; even as it's said, that <hi>Iacob's</hi> garments
did smell to his father (to which this may allude) so our holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
being washen in the blood of the Lamb, is very savoury to
him, and is also savoury to others; yea, the smell thereof is as
the smell of <hi>Lebanon,</hi> which was an hill that abounded with trees
and flowers, exceeding savoury and delightsome: whereas a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
conversation, is exceeding unsavoury, as rottennesse, and
dead mens bones. In sum, this compleats believers commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
when their words are edifying, their heart answerable to
their words in true sincerity, and their outward walk adorning to
the Gospel, so as their natural nakednesse and pollution appears
not in it. <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. Where there is true honesty within, it will
appear in the fruits of holinesse without. 2. There is no garment
or cloathing that can adorn or beautifie men, as holinesse doth a
believer. 3. Though outward profession alone be not all, yet
is it necessary for compleating the commendation of a believer.
4. Although good works be not the ground of our relation to
Christ, but follows on it, and though it be not on the account
of our works, that the Lord is pleased with us to justifie us; yet
are the good works of a believer and of a justified person, when
done in faith, acceptable to God, and an odour and sweet savour
to him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 18.</p>

spouse: a Spring shut up, a Fountain
sealed.</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>Having thus summed up her carriage in the former threefold
commendation, now he proceeds both to describe and commend
her, by a seven-fold comparison, wherein (to say so) the rhetorick
of our Lords love abounds: Each of them may point out these
three things, 1. They describe somewhat the nature of a believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
or Christ's Bride. 2. They evidence Christ's love and care,
which he hath toward her. 3. They hold forth her duty in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to her self. We shall shortly explain them, as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
to this scope.</p>
                  <p>In this 12. verse, we have three of these comparisons, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
she is described and commended. 1. She is compared to a
<hi>garden inclosed:</hi> A garden is a plot of ground, separat from other
places, for delight and recreation of the owner, having many
flowers in it, and much pains taken on it: So believers are,
1. Set a-part by God beside all others in the world, and much
pains is taken on them; The trees in Christ's garden are <hi>digged
about and dunged,</hi> Luk. 13. 8. 2. They are his delight, being
separat from others for his own use, with whom he dwells, in
whom he takes pleasure, and amongst whom he <hi>feeds, Chap.</hi> 6. 2.
3. They are furnished with many excellent graces, fruits of the
Spirit, which are planted in them as flowers in a garden, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 21.
Next, this garden is <hi>inclosed:</hi> It's a special property of gardens
to be so; To be inclosed, is by a wall or hedge to be fenced
from the trampling and eating-up of beasts, and also from the
hazard of winds: So, <hi>Isa.</hi> 5. 2. the <hi>vineyard of the Lord of Hosts</hi>
(which is his Church) is said to be <hi>fenced,</hi> a <hi>wall is built about it,</hi>
to defend it from the danger of beasts, and storms. And this
sheweth, 1. His care of her, in watching over her, <hi>Isa.</hi> 27. 23.
And, 2. Her watchfulnesse over her self, whereby she is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
or accessible to every one; but as she is defended by his care,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:65401:120"/>
so also she hath a watch her self at the door of her lips, of her eyes,
of her ears, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> she is not like a city without walls, obnoxious
to every assault and temptation, but hath a hedge of divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,
which is as a wall of fire about her to defend her; and
also a guard of watchfulnesse and holy fear, in the exercise of which
the believer hath rule over his own spirit, which (<hi>Prov.</hi> 25. 28.)
is implyed to be as strong walls about a city.</p>
                  <p>The second similitude wherewith she is compared, is <hi>a spring
shut up:</hi> Springs were of great price in these hot countries, and
served much for making Gardens fruitful, as is implyed, <hi>Isa.</hi> 58. 11.
where it's promised to the Church, thou shall be as <hi>a watered
Garden:</hi> Hence the righteous is called, like a tree planted by the
<hi>rivers of water,</hi> Psal. 1. 3. And on the contrary, the barren condition
of his people is described, <hi>Isa.</hi> 1. 30. by the similitude of a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
that <hi>hath no water.</hi> In a word, she is not only a Garden, but
a spring, that is furnished with moisture and water, for making her
fruitful. More particularly, by this may be set out the graces of
the Spirit, compared to <hi>waters,</hi> Joh. 7. 38, 39. and said to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<hi>a well of water</hi> in these that believe on Christ, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 14.
for, these graces of the Spirit, and his influence on them, doth
keep all things in the believers souls case fresh and lively, as a
spring doth make a Garden green and fruitful. Next, this spring
<hi>is shut up,</hi> for so were springs in these countries, where they were
rare, as we see by <hi>Iacobs</hi> rolling the stone away, <hi>Gen.</hi> 29. 8. And
this kept the waters from being corrupted by the Sun, and also
from being bemudded by beasts: This signifieth the preciousness
of the graces and influences of the Spirit, wherewith believers are
furnished. 2. Purenesse and clearnesse in them, as in waters that
are not bemudded. 3. A care she hath to keep them pure from
carnal passions, or fruits of her own spirit, that would bemudd all.</p>
                  <p>The third comparison is on the matter the same, but adds a
further degree to the former; She is (saith he) <hi>a fountain sealed:</hi>
A fountain may signify waters springing in greater aboundance;
and sealing doth signify not only shuting up, but securing it by a
seal, after it is shut up: So the den of Lions was sealed, after <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi>
was cast into it, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. 17. And the stone was sealed, that
was put on Christ's grave, that so it might not be opened by any,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:65401:121"/>
but by these that sealed it. And though there be other uses of
sealing, yet we conceive that which is aimed at here is, 1. To shew
the Church is not common, but well kept and sealed, so that
none can trouble believers peace without Christ's leave, who
hath <hi>sealed them by his Spirit to the day of Redemption,</hi> Eph. 4. 30, &amp;c.
2. To shew Christ's particular right to the Church and her graces,
and his owning of her and them, she bears his seal (as the 144000.
<hi>Rev. 7. are sealed</hi>) there is none but himself, that hath accesse
to these waters; her graces and fruits are all reserved for him,
<hi>Chap.</hi> 7. 13. 3. It shews (to say so) her closenesse, and resolute
watchfulnesse, so that there is no gaining upon her to bemudd her
condition, without advertancy and observation, more than waters
can be drawn from a sealed fountain, the seal not being broken:
Like that phrase, <hi>Prov. 5. 15. Drink out of thine own cistern, let
them be thine own,</hi> &amp;c. She hath her own distinct fountain, from
which shew draws influences, and that she preserves and secures to
her self. 4. It shews a kind of sacrednesse in this fountain, so that
nothing may meddle with it, more than that which is marked and
separate by a seal. In sum, the first comparison shews, that Christ's
Bride or the believer is to be fruitful. The second, what makes her
fruitful, the spring of the Spirit. The third shews her care to keep it
clear, and to have it running and flowing, that she may be fruitful.</p>

                  <p>The fourth comparison follows, <hi>vers.</hi> 13, 14. wherein she is
compared to an Orchard (as before to a Garden) planted with
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:65401:121"/>
diverse and excellent plants. Now, this includes these three things,
which he adds to the former commendation, 1. That the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
hath many graces, he is an <hi>Orchard</hi> that is planted with many
trees and plantes. 2 That the believers graces, as they are
many, so they are various; and therefore trees and spices of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
sorts are reckoned here. 3. That the believers graces are
excellent for kind, as well as many for number and variety, they
are as <hi>Spikenard, Saffron,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>with all the chief spices.</hi> And as it
commends an Orchard, to have many plants, and great variety,
and to want none; so to have them of the best kinds, adds much
to the commendation, when it's fruitful of these. Thus the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever
is furnished with many various graces of the Spirit, as
plants planted in his soul, and these of the best kind, rising from
the most excellent seed that can be, the Spirit of Christ. And so
the graces of believers are rare and precious, in respect of any
thing that natural men have, which are but like shrubs in a dry
wildernesse.</p>
                  <p>Besides these; we may further observe, 1. That to have fruit
and aboundance of fruit, will not prove one to be a believer, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
it be choice fruit which he brings forth. 2. Believers fruits,
and the graces that are in them, differ from the most excellent
parts and gifts that can be in natural men, or most refined hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites.
3. It's excellent and commendable, when all the graces
of the Spirit flow and increase together in the believer.</p>
                  <p>It's like, the Holy Ghost may here signify the effects and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
of diverse graces, by these several spices and fruits; and it
may be <hi>Solomon</hi> understood the particular signification of every
one of them; for, having so great an insight in natural and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
things, it's like he did not conjecturally, but on knowledge,
mention such spices and no others; but we must hold on the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral:
They are precious, physical, savory and delectable fruits,
and so are the graces of the Spirit to one that hath them, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
they converse with, and to Christ in respect of his accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
they are like an Orchard or Garden, that abounds with
these: This is the scope, wherein we rest.</p>

living-waters and streams from Lebanon.</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>The fifth, sixth and seventh similitudes, are contained in this
verse, wherein the Lord, following the same scope, further insists
and explicats what manner of fountain this is, which makes the
believer so fruitful. 1. She is <hi>a fountain of Garden:</hi> A <hi>fountain</hi>
was spoken of, <hi>vers.</hi> 12. whereby is signified an inward principle
(to say so) or spring, which from within sendeth forth and furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth
waters: Here she is called <hi>a fountain of Gardens,</hi> she was
called a Garden, <hi>vers.</hi> 12. here <hi>a fountain of Gardens</hi> in the plural
number. By this is holden forth, 1. The end of grace in a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever,
it is given him not only for himself, but also for the use
of others, as the gifts of the Spirit are given to every one <hi>to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite
withall,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 7. 2. It shews that believers act and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
their graces for others edification, as a fountain that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
is common for the use of moe Gardens, and so it points out
what publick spirits they should have, intending the edification
of all to whom they can conveniently communicat their gifts and
graces. 3. It shews the aboundance of spirit and life (to say so)
wherewith Christ's Bride is furnished, so as she may communicate
for the admonishing, strengthning and edifying of others with her
self, as it's, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 14. where believers are said to be <hi>full of
goodnesse, filled with all knowledge, and able to admonish one another.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The sixth similitude is, <hi>A well of living waters:</hi> This is not
only to difference her from a cistern, that hath water, but hath no
spring in it, but also to shew the nature of the Spirit of grace in
believers, it proves quickning and healing to these that have it:
Both these are held forth, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 14. He that drinks of this <hi>water
shall never thirst,</hi> for it shall be in him <hi>a well of living-water, spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up to eternal life.</hi> So is it also, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7. 38, 39. where the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of grace is, it will be springing; and grace will never dry up,
where it is true.</p>
                  <p>The last similitude is, <hi>And streams from Lebanon:</hi> Which saith,
that Christ's Bride is not only a fountain, but also she is a stream:
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:65401:122"/>
and it holdeth forth, 1. That grace in her hath it's rise from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
though it beget a spring in her, as if <hi>Lebanon</hi> sent a stream
to a Garden, which did become a spring by it's constant flowing
there. 2. By a stream also is set forth the aboundance of grace
in believers, it is in them not as a brook, but as a stream.. Next,
<hi>Lebanon</hi> was a hill much commended, it's like sweet streams issued
from it: It's written, that <hi>Iordan</hi> which watered much of the
land, had it's rise and spring there. In the 5. Chapter, <hi>vers.</hi> 15.
Christ's countenance is compared to <hi>Lebanon,</hi> and so here, while
the flowing of grace in her is called a stream from <hi>Lebanon,</hi> the
derivation of grace, and of the Spirit from Christ Jesus is holden
forth; which though it have a seat, and becomes a fountain in
the believer, yet it hath it's rise from him, and is kept flowing
and springing by him; It's as a fountain derived by a stream from
<hi>Lebanon,</hi> and otherwise any spring of grace, that is in a believer
would soon run dry. All these being put together, and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with what is before, shew, 1. That the believer is fitted by
Christ not only with spiritual life, and a stock of habitual graces,
but also with every thing that may make him lively and fruitful
in the exercise of these. 2. This contrivance of spiritual influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
that makes believers fruitful, is a most lovely and excellent
thing. 3. The great commendation of believers is grounded
upon the graces of the Spirit that are in them, and upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences
of the same Spirit that comes from Christ to them.
4. Where grace is, it will have fruits, and be savory in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,
in the exercise thereof. 5. It's the best evidence of
grace, and of Christ's influence and Spirit, when it appeareth in
the fruits; These prove the believer to be an <hi>Orchard,</hi> and <hi>a
fountain.</hi> 6. These graces that make a believer fruitful, have
not their rise in, or from a believer, but from Christ, and the
<hi>fountain</hi> that is in them, is but a <hi>stream</hi> that comes from him.</p>

                  <epigraph>
                     <bibl>Vers. 16.</bibl>
                     <q>Awake, O North-wind, and come,
thou South, blow upon my Garden, that
the spices thereof may flow out: let my
beloved come into his Garden, and eat his
pleasant fruits.</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>Christ having now been large in commending the Bride, she
steps to in this verse (as it were, taking the opportunity of his
neernesse) and puts up her desires to him, briefly in two suits,
which are grounded on the commendation that he gives her, and
shews what is the great design that she aims at now when she hath
Christ's ear; and she follows these suits so, as she acknowledgeth
all her fruitfulnesse (for which she is commended) to flow from
him, and to depend on him, who is therefore so much the more
to be commended and extolled himself. In sum, the sense is this,
Though I be a garden (saith she) and have good plants, habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in me, yet will they not bud nor flow, nor can they be fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
except the spirit (which is as the stream from <hi>Lebanon</hi>) blow
to make them so: Therefore, O Spirit come, and let me partake
of thy influences and breathings, that my beloved may have an
invitation thereby, to come; and when come, may be intertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon his own fruits.</p>
                  <p>The first petition is, for livelinesse and fruitfulnesse: The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
is, for the beloved's presence, which is the end of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.
And these two, life and sense, are (as it were) the air that
kindly-believers love to breath into. That both these are the
Brides words, may thus be collected, 1. Because they look prayer-like,
and it's more suitable for her to say, <hi>come,</hi> than for him:
yea, the Spirit being invited <hi>to come</hi> to the garden, it's clear the
party that speaks hath need of his presence: And that it's not said,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:65401:123"/>
go, but <hi>come,</hi> with reference to the necessity of the party that
speaks, doth make it evident, that it cannot be spoken by the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom,
but by the Bride; for, so the phrase every where, and
in the next words, <hi>Let my beloved come,</hi> Imports, 2. That the
last part of the verse is her suit, none can deny; and there is no
reason to conceive two different parties, seing both the matter
of the suits, and the manner of speaking, will agree to the
same party.</p>
                  <p>In the first petition, we may consider these two, 1. The thing
sought. 2. The end wherefore that which she seeks and prayes
for, is held forth, as it were, in three steps or degrees, in three
expressions, <hi>awake, O north-wind, come thou south, blow upon my
garden.</hi> For understanding whereof, we are to look, 1. What
these <hi>winds</hi> signifie. 2. What this <hi>garden</hi> is. And, 3. What
these act, of <hi>awaking, coming</hi> and <hi>blowing</hi> are. By winds often
in Scripture is understood the Spirit of God in his mighty ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. 3. and 14. And the special work and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Spirit is compared to wind, 1. For it's purifying na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
2. For it's cooling, com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>orting, refreshing power and efficacy.
3. For it's fructifying vertue, winds being especially in these hot
countries, both exceeding refreshful, and also useful to make
trees and gardens fruitful. Lastly, for it's undiscernable manner
of working, as, <hi>Ioh. 3. 6. the wind blows where it lists,</hi> &amp;c. yet hath
his operation real effects with it. And it's clear that the Spirit,
is here intended, because it's the Spirit's blowing that only can
make the spices or graces of a believer to flow, as the wind doth
the seeds and flowers in a garden. Next, by <hi>north</hi> and <hi>south<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind,</hi>
are understood the same Spirit, being conceived and taken
up in respect of his diverse operations (as it's, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 6, 7,
8. &amp;c. and therefore called <hi>the seven spirits of God, Rev.</hi> 1. 4.)
sometime cooling and in a sharper manner nipping, as the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind,
sometimes working in his people more softly and warmly,
and in a still and quiet manner like the South-wind; yet, as both
winds are useful, for the purging and making fruitfull of a garden;
so are the diverse operations of the Spirit, to the souls of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.
In a word, hereby is understood, the different opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Spirit, whether convincing and mortifying, or quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:65401:124"/>
and comforting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Both which contribute to make her
lively and fruitful, which is the scope of her petition.</p>
                  <p>2. By <hi>garden,</hi> is understood the believer, called a garden,
<hi>vers.</hi> 12. and an orchard, <hi>vers.</hi> 13. because the believer doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
in diverse graces, as a garden doth in many flowers. And
she calls it <hi>my garden,</hi> as he calleth the plants <hi>her plants,</hi> that
were planted there, <hi>vers.</hi> 13. and as she called the vineyard <hi>hers,
Chap.</hi> 1. 6. and 8. 12. which also is <hi>his, vers.</hi> 11. as also this garden is
called <hi>his</hi> in the following words, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. 1. It's <hi>his</hi> by proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as the heritor and puchaser; as also, all these graces in her
are <hi>hers,</hi> as being the servant that hath the over-sight of them,
and who hath gotten them as talents to trade with for the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
use. All that we have, <hi>viz.</hi> a soul, gifts, graces, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are
given to us as talents, which we are to d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>esse for bringing fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>th
fruit to the owner, as the following words do clear.</p>
                  <p>3. The actings and workings of the Spirit, are held forth in
three words, which are as so many branches of her petition. The
first is, <hi>awake.</hi> This word is often used by God's people in dealing
with him, <hi>awake, put on strength, O arm of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Isa.</hi> 51. 9. It
is not as if the Spirit were at any time sleeping, but she desires
that by some effects, sensible to her, he would let it be known
he is stirring. The second word, <hi>come,</hi> is to the same purpose:
the Spirit considered in himself, cannot be said to come or go,
being every where present; But this is to be understood, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the effects of his presence, and so he is said to come and
go: Thus while she saith, <hi>come,</hi> the meaning is, Let me find
some sign of thy presence, quickning and stirring my graces.
The last word is, <hi>blow upon my garden:</hi> Blowing holds forth the
operation, whereby the Spirit produceth his effects in believers;
It's not the Spirit himself, nor the fruits of the Spirit that are in
believers, that are here understood, but the operation of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
whereby he influenceth, or (if we may so speak) infuseth
them (as God breathed in <hi>Adam</hi> the breath of life) and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he stirrs, excits and quickens them for acting. The prayer
then, is directed to the Spirit (as, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 14.) considering the
Spirit essentially as the same God with the Father and Son, (in
which respect, to pray by name to one person of the Godhead, is
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:65401:124"/>
to pray to all the three, who in our worship are not to be divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
that he would by his operations (which are diverse and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
for believers good) so stir and quicken his own graces in her,
that seing she is a garden wherein the beloved takes pleasure, her
graces for his satisfaction may be exercised, and made to savour,
to the end that he may the more manifest himself in sweet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with her.</p>
                  <p>Next, the end wherefore she presseth this suit so much, is,
<hi>that her spices may flow out:</hi> In a word it is, that she might be
fruitful; for, though there were many graces in her, yet, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Spirit's breathings and influences, they would be as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beaten
spices, that did not send forth their smell.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. Although a believer have grace, yet it is not alwayes
in exercise; yea, it may be, and often is interrupted in it's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise.
2. That the believers great desire is to be fruitful, and
to have grace in exercise, that they may be delighted in by Christ;
It's not only their desire to have grace habitually, but actually
to have it in exercise. 3. There is nothing can make a believer
lively and fruitful, but the influences of the Spirit: and that
same Spirit that works grace, must quicken it and keep it in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise.
4. There may be an interruption of the influences of the
Spirit, so as his blowing may in a great measure cease. 5. The
same Spirit hath diverse operations, and diverse wayes of working
and manifesting himself: sometimes as the South-wind, more
smoothly; sometimes as the North-wind, more sharply. 6. All
his operations, how rough soever some of them may appear, are
alwayes useful to believers, and tend to make them fruitful:
And to this end, the most sharp influences, contribute, as well as
the more comfortable. 7. Believers would walk under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
of their own inability to act their graces, and of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of the Spirit's influences, for drawing them forth to acting
and exercise. 8. They who are thus sensible, may seek after the
Spirit for that end: and it's a good frame in order to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
of life and quickning by the Spirit of Christ, when the
sense of their own inability, their love of fruitfulnesse, and the
faith of attaining it by his Spirit, puts them to seek after it.
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:65401:125"/>
9. Prayer is a necessary and excellent mean for stirring up one in
a secure frame, and for attaining the Spirit to revive and quicken
the work of his grace. 10. Believers may beg the Spirit to
quicken them, when they find themselves lifelesse; as well as
they may ask pardon, when they find themselves under guilt.
11. Believers will be, and should be as desirous of livelin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>sse and
fruitfulnesse, as of sense: yea, this is the order by which they
must come, and should seek to come to the obtaining of sensible
presence. 12. No commendation of any atainment in believers,
nor any clearnesse of interest, should make them sit down on their
attainments, or become negligent; but, on the contrary, should
stir them up to aim at the more livelinesse and spiritualnesse, that
they may be answerable to that interest they have in him, and to
the commendation he allows upon them: For which cause, this
petition follows immediatly upon the former commendation.</p>
                  <p>The second petition, which goes alongst with the former, is
for the beloved's presence, <hi>Let my beloved</hi> (saith she) <hi>come into
his garden, and eat his pleasant fruits:</hi> Her desire here, is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold,
1. That Christ would <hi>come:</hi> This doth respect a greater
degree of neernesse, notwithstanding of any thing she injoyed.
2. That he would <hi>eat his pleasant fruits,</hi> that is, familiarly, and
friendly delight in his own graces; and therefore it was she pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for the influences of the spirit, that there might be abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of fruits for his satisfaction. The way she presseth this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
is very kindly, though the words be short. 1. She pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
it from the relation she had to him, Let <hi>my beloved</hi> (saith
she) <hi>come:</hi> This makes her request and invitation warm and
kindly. 2. From the kind of the fruits; they are <hi>pleasant</hi> fruits,
that is, delectable in themselves, and acceptable to him. But,
3. Lest this should derogat from him, and arrogat to her self, she
adds <hi>his</hi> pleasant fruits; they are <hi>his,</hi> and that makes them plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant,
so that he cannot but accept them: they are <hi>his</hi> being pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased
by him, wrought by him, keeped in life by him; though
he hath made me the garden (saith she) wherein they grow (and
the garden, as it hath weeds, is hers) yet all the good fruits, in
so far as any of them are to be found in me, are his: In sum, all
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:65401:125"/>
all my desire is this, 1. To be fruitful, Then, 2. To have Christ's
company, shewing himself pleased and present with me. <hi>Obs.</hi> 1.
Whatever believers have, they neither will, nor can rest upon it;
nay, not in the most eminent measures of holinesse attainable here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>away,
without Christ's presence and company. 2. Fruitfulnesse and
livelinessehelp and contribute much to the injoyment of Christ's
manifestations, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 21. 23. 3. Believers that aim seriously at
the exercise of grace in themselves, may confidently invite Christ
to come, and may expect his presence. 4. All believers fruits,
even when quickned by the Spirit, are Christ's. 5. This would be
acknowledged, and when we are most fruitful, we would look on
our fruits, not as our own, but as <hi>his</hi> still. 6. Christ will seed
or delight in nothing, but what is his own, and is acknowledged
by his people to be so: And there can nothing, which he will
accept of, be set before him but such. 7. Believers end and
design in pursuing livelinesse and fruitfulnesse, is not, and ought
not so much to be their own satisfaction, and the seeding of
themselves, as the satisfaction of Christ, and the pleasing of him;
for, that is <hi>his eating his pleasant fruits;</hi> which is the Brides
great desire and design, when she calls for the <hi>North and South-wind,
to blow upon her garden.</hi>

                  <p>THis Chapter hath four parts, according to the parties that
successivly speak. In the first part, <hi>vers.</hi> 1. Christ speaks:
And that it is he who speaks, doth at the first reading
appear, they are kindly words, well becoming him, and are the
answer of her suit in the former words: And so depend on them
(for the division of this Song, as also of other Scriptures into
Chapters, not being done by the Penmen of the Holy Ghost, but
by the Translators, is not to be stuck on where there is no questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the matter) she desired him, verse last, of the former Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
to <hi>come,</hi> and now in this verse, <hi>Behold I am come,</hi> saith he, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
In it we have, 1. His yielding to <hi>come.</hi> 2. His carriage when he
is come, as to himself: And also his intimation of both. 3. His
invitation to others, which may be also a part of his carriage when
come, taken up in three. 1. He makes himself welcome; and,
2. Others, 3. He intimats it.</p>
                  <p>The title being spoken of formerly, the first thing is, <hi>I am
come into my Garden</hi> (as thou desired) <hi>my sister,</hi> &amp;c. Hence ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
1. Christ hath particular and peculiar wayes, of coming to
his people, and of nearnesse with them, even as he hath of with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing
from them. 2. There are some peculiar times, wherein
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:65401:126"/>
he is more near than at other times. 3. Sometimes he will not
only draw near to his people, but let them know he is near, and
put them out of doubt that he is <hi>come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, if we look to this as the answer of the former prayer, we
will see, 1. Christ is easily invited and prevailed with to come
to his people; and sometimes there will not be long betwixt their
prayer and his answer, it's the very next word. 2. Few words
may be an effectual prayer to Christ (as the former suit was) a
breathing or sigh will not be rejected by him, where sincerity is.
3. Christ will sometimes not only answer prayer in the thing
sought, but he will intimate, and let his people know that he hath
answered it.</p>
                  <p>More particularly, we may consider the answer, 1. As it agrees
with her prayer, 2. As it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ems defective. 3. As it's beyond it.</p>
                  <p>First, It agrees fully to her last suit, she prayed <hi>he would come
and eat,</hi> he <hi>comes and eats. Obs.</hi> Christ will carve and shape out
sometimes his answer, even according to his peoples desires, as if
they had the power of prescribing their own answers. For, when
our prayers make for our good, Christ will alter nothing in them,
but will grant them in the very terms in which they are put up.</p>
                  <p>Again, I say there seems to be somewhat defective, there is no
return recorded of the first suit for livelinesse; and her drousie,
lazy case, <hi>vers.</hi> 2, 3. gives ground to think, that that petition was
not as yet answered. <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. Christ may be particular in answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
one petition of the same prayer, when yet he may for a time
suspend an answer to another, in it self as acceptable to him. Yea,
2. He may answer the last prayer, and seem to passe over somewhat
formerly sought for.</p>
                  <p>Finally, compare this answer with her last suit, he doth more
than she required; for, she desired him only to <hi>come and eat,</hi> but
he <hi>comes, eats, gathers,</hi> &amp;c. Christ will often stuff in more in the
answer, than was in the desire of his people; and will do <hi>above
what they asked or thought,</hi> Eph. 3. 20.</p>
                  <p>Next, his carriage (as to his own satisfaction) is in three steps,
1. <hi>I have gathered my Myrrhe, with my spice:</hi> Myrrhe and spice
signify (as hath been often said) the graces that grow in believers,
who are this Garden: <hi>His gathering of them</hi> is his pulling (to say
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:65401:127"/>
so) and dressing of them, as Gardeners do their herbs and fruits,
for making them useful; Here ere he eat he gathers, signifying,
that as the spices are his, so he must prepare them for himself;
She cannot prepare what provision Christ gives her, till he do it:
She cannot put forth to exercise the grace she hath received, till
he breath on it.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>I have eaten my honey-comb with my honey:</hi> When he hath
prepared, he eats: By honey-comb and honey, is signified the same
thing (as <hi>Chap. 4. vers.</hi> 11.) because as that was savory and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
food in these dayes and places, so are believers graces a feast
to Christ.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>I have drunk my wine with my milk:</hi> Milk was for nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
wine for refreshing; Christ mentions drinking of both, to
shew, how aboundantly he was satis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
                     </gap>, and fully feasted, both
for meat and drink; and how heartsomely he entertained himself
on it, as a friend that thinks himself very welcome. Consider
here, 1. Meat and drink are mentioned; Christ will not want
entertainment where he is, he will invite and treat himself, where
he gets welcome: Where Christ gets welcome, he will never
complain of the want of fare, he hath there a feast. 2. He accepts
all heartsomly; as Christ is easily invited, so is he chearful and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
company: where he comes, he takes what there is to give him,
he is not sour and ill to please. 3. There is <hi>Myrrhe</hi> and <hi>spice, milk</hi>
and <hi>honey</hi> and <hi>wine;</hi> which is not only to shew that there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities
of graces, but that Christ casts at nothing of grace that
is found in his people, he takes the <hi>milk</hi> as well as the <hi>wine;</hi> he
makes much of the weaker grace, as well as of the most lively.
4. He <hi>gathers</hi> and <hi>eats;</hi> As Christ provides food for himself, so
(to speak with reverence) he is his own Cook, none can dresse
dishes for Christ, but himself. 5. Where he gets the most seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
invitation to come, there may be much unpreparednesse for
him when he comes, until he right it, and prepare his own en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment
himself. 6. Though things be not prepared for him,
yet sometimes he will not suspend his coming on that, nor will it
ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>

welcome, He <hi>dresseth</hi> and <hi>eateth.</hi> 7. He intimates all this: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
Christ may be well-pleased with believers, and be feasting

himself on their graces, and yet they not discern it, nor believe
it, until he intimate it and make it known to them: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that their joy may be full, he graciously condescends now
and then to put them upon the knowledge of it, and perswades
their hearts of it.</p>
                  <p>The last thing, is his invitation to his Friends to eat with him,
which is pressed, 1. By kindly compellations, <hi>Friends and Beloved.</hi>
2. By three words, <hi>eat, drink,</hi> and that <hi>aboundantly.</hi> By <hi>Friends</hi>
and <hi>Beloved,</hi> are understood believers, there are none other ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of these titles, and it was she that prayed, that is here un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
by Friends and Beloved, and so he answers her. Hence
we see, the believer is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
                     </gap> Friend, as <hi>Abraham,</hi> Jam. 2. 23.
and <hi>Lazarus,</hi> Joh. 11. 11. were called. It imports, 1. A privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
on the believers part, to be admitted to special league
of friendship with him, when others are slaves or enemies. 2. A
special friendlinesse in Christ's carriage to them; familiarly, free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
telling them all his mind, so far as is needful for them to know,
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 15. 15. and lovingly manifesting himself to them, as one doth
to his friend. 3. It holds out a duty lying on the believer, to
carry friendly to Christ and them that are his, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15. 14. A man
that hath friends <hi>must shew himself friendly</hi> (Prov. 18. 24.) to
them: And seing he trusts them, and expects no ill from them,
they would be like Christ's friends, answerable to their trust.
They are also <hi>beloved,</hi> the title that the husband gives the wife,
for evidencing special love: All Christ's friends are beloved, and
believers are (whatever they be as to their desert, or in the eyes
of men) both friends and beloved: No friend hath such bowels
for his friends, as Christ hath for his friends. Friends and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
are in the plural, 1. To shew he excludes no believer, but
includes all, and that with the same seriousness he invites and makes
them all welcome to feast with him, whether they be strong or
weak. 2. Because his mercy to one may be cheering to many,
and he allows and would have others of his people to be
cheerful, because of his kindnesse and mercy manifested to one.</p>
                  <p>His intertaining of them is held out in three words. 1. <hi>Eat,</hi>
that declares his desire to have believers partaking with him in
the soul-refreshing blessings of his purchase, by their reflecting act
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:65401:128"/>
of faith comforting themselves in the priviledges, promises and
mercies allowed on them. <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. The same feast, is a feast to
Christ and believers both. 2. Where he is cheerful, they should
be so also. The second word is, <hi>drink:</hi> He drinks, that is, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfies
himself as fully feasted, to wit, with the graces of his
people (such is the complacency he hath in them, when he stirs
them up to any livelinesse of exercise) and he allows them in this
case to be refreshed, satisfied and feasted also: It becomes them
to drink when he drinks, and bids them drink. The third word
is, drink <hi>abundantly:</hi> that shews the largenesse of his allowance,
and the heartinesse of his welcome, as a gladsome Hoast, so che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes
he his ghuests; and all this is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
                     </gap> be understood spiritually,
of the joy and comfort which he allows on his people, even to
be <hi>filled with the Spirit,</hi> in opposition to wine, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 18. which
is more satisfying, cheering and refreshing to the inner-man, than
wine is to the body. The scope and dependence, points out these
things. 1. There is much notable soul-refreshing to be had in
Christ's company; where-ever he is, there is a feast, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 20.
2. He allows his people largely to share of it; yea, it is his will
that all should liberally improve this allowance, he willeth it.
3. If our joy run in a spiritual channel, there cannot be excesse in
it, if it were to be drunken with it, so as to forget our proverty,
and to remember our misery no more. 4. Christ is never fully
satisfied at his own feast, till he get his friends feasted and cheered
also: He eats not his morsels alone, but is desirous to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicat
his good things, according as they are communicable.
5. Christ's preparing and dressing is rather for the welcoming of
his friends, than for himself I have <hi>gathered, eat ye,</hi> saith he.
6. Christ is a most heartsome distributer to others, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainer
of his friends: There needs be no sparing to eat where he
invites. 7. Believers, even Christ's friends, needs invitation, by
reason of unbelief, sense of unworthinesse (which makes them sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
modest) and the dulnesse of their spiritual appetite; and
therefore they will need (to say so) bidding and intreaty often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to eat their meat, and to chear themselves in him, and he
will not let them want that. 8. Where-ever Christ is present,
there is a feast with him for them that are in his company, he
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:65401:128"/>
sups with them, and makes them sup with him; and all is his
own, and of his own dressing. 9. It's a gift of Christ's mercy,
not only to have grounds of consolation, but to be inabled to
comfort our selves in these grounds; (as in outward things, it is
one gift to have, and another to have the cheerful use of that
which we have) for, the believer may have the one when he wants
the other; and when he hath the one, to have the other added
is a double mercy, as the exhortation, <hi>eat, drink,</hi> &amp;c. imports:
10. It is not every one who is Christ's friend, nor every one that
hath that honour to comfort and feast themselves with him; it's
a priviledge that is peculiar to them who are his friends indeed.</p>

                     <q>I sleep, but my heart waketh: it is
the voice of my beloved that knocketh,
saying, Open to me, my sister, my love,
my dove, my undefiled: for my head is
filled with dew, and my locks with the
drops of the night.</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>From <hi>vers.</hi> 2. unto the ninth (which is the second part of the
Chapter) the Bride speaks, and sets down a very complex piece
of her condition, which we take up in these three. 1. Her
condition is shortly set down. 2. The mutual carriage of the
Bridegroom and Bride are recorded; wherein (as it were) grace
and loving kindnesse in him, and unkindnesse in her, are wrestling
together for a time. 3. The out-gate, and the way how she at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
it, by several steps on his side, and hers, are particularly
insisted on from <hi>vers.</hi> 4. with what followed thereupon.</p>
                  <p>Her case is in short, <hi>I sleep, but my heart waketh,</hi> or (as it is
in the Original) <hi>I sleeping, my heart waking:</hi> It's made up of
contraries, and seeming paradoxes; she is distinguished from her
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:65401:129"/>
heart, and the sleeping of the one is opposed to the waking of
the other: Both this sleeping and waking are spiritually to be
understood; The first signifies a ceasing from spiritual duties, or
a suspension of the acting of spiritual life, by arising of some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
corruption, that dulls and binds up the spiritual senses, as
in natural sleep the external senses are dulled and bound up: So
1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5. 6. and <hi>Rom. 13. 11. Let us not sleep, but watch and be
sober.</hi> This is a further degree of spiritual distemper, beyond
what was <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 1, 2. where she was <hi>on bed,</hi> and yet <hi>seeking,</hi> but
here she <hi>sleeps</hi> and <hi>lyes</hi> still, as we see, <hi>vers.</hi> 3. It imports, 1. An
interruption of livelinesse and actual exercising of grace. 2. An
indisposition and lazinesse in the frame of the spirit, added to
that. 3. A sort of acquiescing and resting securely in that indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
with a loathnesse to stir and be interrupted, such as
useth to be in the bodily sleep, and such as appears to be here
from the following verse: It's sleepinesse, or to be given to
sleep, such as the sluggard is subject unto, who sleepeth exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively,
and out of due time. This <hi>I</hi> that sleepeth, is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever,
but considered in so far as unregenerat; as, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 18.
<hi>I know, that in me (that is, in my flesh) there dwelleth no good thing:</hi>
For, as the believer hath two different natures, which have oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit
actings; so are they considered as two different persons.
Hence in that, <hi>Rom. 7. 1, yet not I,</hi> &amp;c. by which <hi>Paul</hi> as renewed,
is distinguished from himself as unrenewed. By <hi>waking,</hi> is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
some livelinesse and sensiblenesse, or at least life, in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
to the former deadnesse and dulnesse, as, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 11.
<hi>It's high time to awake:</hi> And, 1 <hi>Thess. 5. 6. Let us watch, and be
sober;</hi> which is opposit to that spiritual drousinesse, wherein we
are scarce at our selves. <hi>My heart,</hi> looks to the renewed part,
which is often called the <hi>Spirit,</hi> that lusteth against the <hi>flesh,</hi> as,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 17. and the <hi>law in the mind,</hi> Rom. 7. <hi>circumcision in the
heart,</hi> Rom. 2. 25. the <hi>new heart</hi> in the Covenant, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. In
sum, it is this, Things are not right with me, and indisposition
to duty or lifelessnesse in it, is great (as it is with one that is in
a sleep) yet even then there is some inward stirring of life, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
in conviction of judgement, challenges, purposes, prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stations
of the inward-man, against this dead and lazy frame, as
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:65401:129"/>
not delighting in it, but displeased with it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> wherein the new
nature wrestles and yeilds not, nor gives it self leave to consent
to it, although it can act nothing, at least in a lively way, under
this condition: Thus she is sleeping, because she acts nothing;
yet, the heart is waking, because it's kept from being involved
in that security, though it be bound up, and over-powered with
corruption, that it cannot win to act according to the light and
inclination that it hath within. Hence observe, 1. That the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever
hath two different and opposite natures and principles with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
him, leading him diverse wayes; the carnal and sleeping <hi>I,</hi> and
the renewed and waking <hi>heart.</hi> 2. They may be both at one time
acting oppositly, the <hi>one lusting against the other, Gal.</hi> 5. 17.
3. Sometimes corruption may prevail far over believers that
have grace, and lay them (though not quite dead, yet) fast asleep
for a time, and mar in a great measure the exercise of their grace.
4. Believers at their lowest, have life in them, and (by reason of
their new nature) are not totally and fully involved in their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
and back-sliding conditions. 5. There may be some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
apprehending of our hazard, and dangerous condition, when
it is very sad and low, so as believers may know it is not right
with them, and yet (as it's here with the Bride) may continue
under it, and lye still. 6. Spiritual lazinesse and security is inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to the strongest believers: The <hi>wise virgins</hi> may <hi>slumber,</hi>
and <hi>sleep,</hi> Matth. 25. 7. Yea, after the greatest manifestations,
and often on the back of the fullest intimations of Christ's love,
and the most sweet invitations they have from him, and most joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
feastings with him, they may be thus overtaken, as the words
preceeding bear out: The Disciples <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ell in this distemper, that
same night after the Lord's Supper. 8. Believers may fall over and
over again in the same condition of sinful security, even after
they have been rouzed and raised out of it, as this, being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with <hi>chap.</hi> 3. will clear. 9. The more frequently believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
(or any other) relapse in the same sin, they will go the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
length readily in it, and by falling more dangerously, be more
hardly recovered than formerly: Now she sleeps, and when put at,
will not rise, but shifts, which is a further step than was <hi>chap.</hi> 3.
10. Lazy fits of indisposition and omissions of duty, do more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:65401:130"/>
steal in upon believers, than positive out-breakings and
commissions, and they are more ready to please themselves in them,
and to ly still under them. 11. Believers should be so acquaint
with their own condition, as to be able to tell how it is with
them, whether as to their unrenewed or renewed part; So here,
<hi>I sleep,</hi> but <hi>my heart waketh.</hi> 12. Believers in taking up their
condition, would advert both to their corruptions and graces;
and in their reckoning, would put a distinction betwixt these two,
otherwayes they will misreckon on the one side or other: They
would not reckon themselves wholly by the actings of nature,
lest they disclaim their graces; nor yet their renewed part, lest
they forget their unrenewed nature; but they would attribute
every effect in them to it's own cause and principle, where-from
it proceeds. 13. It's good for a believer when overcome with
corruption, and captivate by it, to disallow and disown it from
the heart, as not allowing what they do, and to present this to
God, as a protestation entered against their prevailing lusts. In
some sense a believer may both condemn himself as sinful, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
himself as delighting in the law of God, at one and the same
time; and where he allowes not his corruption; but positively
dissents from it, he may disclaim it as not being his deed.</p>
                  <p>This being her case, follows the Bridegrooms carriage: Which
is expressed in the rest of <hi>vers.</hi> 2. and her carriage (implyed only
in this verse) is more fully expressed, <hi>vers.</hi> 3. His carriage holds
out the great design he drives, and that is to have accesse to her,
and to have her roused up: for attaining of which, 1. He doth
something, and that is, <hi>knocks</hi> at the door. 2. He endures and
suffers <hi>dew</hi> and <hi>drops</hi> in the <hi>cold night,</hi> and yet doth not give over.
3. He speaks, and useth many perswasive arguments for that end:
All which she observes, and yet lyes still. It is in sum, as if a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
husband, that is shut out by a lazy, yet a beloved wife, would
knock, call, and waiting on still, use many arguments to perswade
her to open; so doth our Spiritual Bridegroom, wait upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
whom he loves, to have them brought again to the lively
exercise of faith in him, and to a frame of spirit meet for commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with him. To take the words as they ly, there is, 1. The
Brides observation (as it were in her sleep) of the Beloveds cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:65401:130"/>
at the door. 2. There is set down his call. 3. The argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
he useth for prevailing with her. By <hi>knocking</hi> is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
the inward touches of the Word upon the conscience, when
the efficacy of the Spirit goeth alongst, which raps at the Brides
heart, as knocking doth at a door, and is the mean of awaking
her from spiritual sleep, as knocking at a door is a mean of awaking
from bodily sleep: So it is, <hi>Rev. 3. 20. Behold I stand at the
door and knock:</hi> In which sense the word is compared to a <hi>ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi>
Jer. 23. 29. It takes in these three, 1. A seriousnesse in
him that so knocks. 2. A power and efficacy in the word, that
some-way affects the heart, and moves it. 3. It implyes some ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
it hath upon the heart, as being somewhat affected with that
touch; Therefore it's his voice or word that not only calleth,
but knocketh, implying some force it had upon her: By <hi>voice</hi> is
understood the Word, as <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 8. 10. yet, as backed with the
Spirit and power, and as <hi>commended</hi> thereby to <hi>the conscience,
1 Cor.</hi> 2. 4. and convincingly demonstrated to be the very voice
of Christ; yet, so as rods inward and outward, and other means
may have their own place, being made use of by him, yet still accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the word. His great end for which he knocks, is in that
word <hi>open;</hi> which, as it implyes her case, that her heart was in a
great measure shut upon him, and that by some carnal indisposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he was kept out of it, and was not made welcome; So it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
the removing of all that stopt his way, and the casting
open of the heart by saith to receive his Word, and by love to
receive himself: and in these two especially, this opening doth
consist, 1. In the exercise of faith, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 14. The Lord <hi>opened
the heart of Lydia,</hi> and that is expounded, she <hi>gave heed</hi> unto
these things which <hi>Paul</hi> spoke. 2. An inlarging and warming of
the affections towards him (which ever comprehends the former)
as, <hi>Psalm 81. 10. Open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it:</hi> What
that is, the refusal following declares, <hi>my people would not hear,</hi>
(that is, believe) <hi>Israel would none of me,</hi> or <hi>loved not me</hi> (as the
words in the Original import) they cared not for me, they desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
me not, and would not quite their Idols, as in the foregoing
words, <hi>vers.</hi> 9. is mentioned. 3. There resulteth from these two
a mutual familiarity, as <hi>Rev. 3. 20. If any man will open, I will
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:65401:131"/>
come in and sup with him, and he with me.</hi> This opening then,
imports the removing of every thing that marred fellowship with
Christ, and the doing of every thing that might dispose for injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it, as awaking, rising, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which follows in the 4. <hi>vers.</hi>
and while he commands to open, he calls for the entertaining of
fellowship with him, which now is by her drousinesse interrupted:
Which two parts of the verse put together, hold forth, 1. That
Christ's own Bride may shut the door on him, and so make a sad
separation betwixt him and her. 2. Christ's word is the great
and ordinary external mean, whereby he knocks at mens hearts,
and which he makes use of for begetting faith in them. 3. That
in a believers secure condition, there will be sometimes more than
ordinary convictions, stirrings and motions by the Word. 4. That
the Word of God, backed with power, will reach the securest heart
and affect it. 5. That believers will discern Christ's voice and
call, when their condition is very low. 6. It will be refreshful
to them to have him knocking; she looks on it as a kindly thing,
even to have his knock bearing-in convictions, challenges, or some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
else on her; though it please not her flesh, yet in as far as
she is renewed, it will be <hi>the voice of her Beloved</hi> to her. 7. Christ
hath a way of following his own, even when they are become se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure;
and sometimes then, will make his call, challenges or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions
pursue more hotly and pressingly than at other times.
8. When Christ knocketh and presseth hardest, it's for our own
good, and it's a token of love in him to do so; for, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more deplorable, than when he faith to one under indispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
and in an evil case, let him alone. 9. When Christ calls
by his Word, it is then our duty to open to him, and to receive
him; and this can no more be slighted without sin, than prayer,
mortification and other commanded duties; can be neglected or
slighted without sin. 10. Christ may call very pressingly, and his
Word may have some work on the conscience and affections of
hearers, and they be some-way affected with it, and yet the Word
be rejected, and the heart not made open to Christ; as here she
<hi>sleeps</hi> still notwithstanding; and the following verse confirms it.
11. There are some operations of the Spirit, which though they
be more than a common work on the generality of hearers, yet
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:65401:131"/>
are not saving, and may be, and often are, even by believers frust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
for a time, and by others for ever; for, this <hi>knocking</hi> gets a
refusal, <hi>vers.</hi> 3. So deceiving, beguiling and dangerous are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
motions to rest on, when the finger of gracious Omnipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
is not applyed, as <hi>vers.</hi> 4. 12. Christ's design when he knocks
fastest, is friendly, and yet it sometimes sayeth, things are not right:
This is the end of all his knocking and speaking to a people, and
then it is plainest when he speaks most powerfully.</p>
                  <p>2. The way how Christ presseth this, is, 1. By shewing who he
was, it's <hi>me, open to me:</hi> There can be no greater commendation
given to Christ, nor weightier argument used for him, than to
make it known that it's he, the Husband, Lord, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whose the
house is, and to whom entry by right from the wife ought to be
given. 2. By giving her loving titles, and claiming her as his in
many relations, as <hi>my sister, love, dove;</hi> and (which was not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
before) <hi>undefiled</hi> is added, that is, my perfect one, or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
sincere one, as it is often rendered. These titles given now,
and so many at once, shew, 1. That believers when secure, have
very much need of the Spirit to rouze and stir them up: Souls
are not easily perswaded to receive Christ. 2. There is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
love in Christ, that condescends so to intreat his people when
in such a secure case: even then he changes not her name, no more
than if all things were in good case; for, our relation to him, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
not on our case. 3. Christ will sometimes very lovingly
deal, even with secure souls in his way, for obtaining entry, and
perswading them to open to him, and sometimes will apply the
most refreshful Gospel-offers and invitations, and use the most kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
compellations for that end. 4. Christ sometimes will over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look
the lazy distempers of his people, and not alwayes chide with
them for these, but give them their wonted stiles notwithstanding.
5. The kind dealing of Christ to his people, will ever prove love
to be on his side, but will not alwayes prove that the persons so
dealt with are presently in a good condition; for, he may accept
their persons, and speak comfortably as to their state, although he
approve not their present condition, as here. 6. We may see
that Christ's love is not founded on our merit, nor is up and
down according to our variable disposition, but he prevents both
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:65401:132"/>
in his dealing with his people. These titles being made use of as a
motive to answer his call, and to open to him, shew, 1. That the
perswasion of Christ's love in souls, is a main thing to make way
for their entertaining of him. 2. That it is a shame for a belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so beloved of Christ, to hold him without at the door, when
he knocketh to be in. Grace would make a heart to blush, and
in a manner look it out of countenance, that would refuse his
kindnesse.</p>
                  <p>The third and great argument, is, <hi>for my head is filled with dew,
and my locks with the drops of the night:</hi> Very shame might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
with the wife, when the Husband useth such an argument as
this: It's even as if a husband, standing long without doors in a
tempestuous night, should use this motive with his wife to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
her to let him in, it will be very prejudicial and hurtful to
my health, if thou open not unto me; for, I have stood long with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out:
This may no doubt be presumed to be a very strong and
prevalent argument with a loving wife; yet, it gets but a poor
and very unsuitable answer from the Bride. By <hi>dew, drops</hi> and
<hi>night-time,</hi> are understood, afflictions, external crosses and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:
So, <hi>Daniel</hi> 4. that King is said to be <hi>wet with the dew of
heaven</hi> in his low condition, as having no house to shelter himself
in, but being obnoxious to all changes and injuries of weather:
and <hi>Iacob</hi> mentions it as a part of the toilsome labour, that he
had with <hi>Laban, I did endure the heat of the Sun in the day, and
the cold in the night,</hi> that is, he was ever watchful, and spared not
himself for the hurt of either day or night: Here Christ's spiritual
sufferings also may come in, whereby he made himself obnoxious
to the Fathers wrath and curse, that he might have accesse to
communion with his people; and the account that he hath of
being kept out by his people, as a new piece of his suffering, or
as a painful reviving of the remembrance of his old sufferings.
The scope is to shew, that as a kindly husband, will so deal with a
beloved wife, and expect to prevail, being put to this strait; so
doth Christ with his people, being no lesse desirous of a room in
their hearts, and being as much troubled by their unbelief, as any
man is when put to stand in the cold night, under dew and rain
at his own door. This way of arguing saith, 1. That the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:65401:132"/>
as such, loves and respects Christ, and would not have him
suffering, as a kind wise would be loath to hazard her husbands
health. 2. That Christ expounds her so, even when she is lazy
and keeps him out, otherwise this argument would be of no force,
nor would he have used it; He will see much evil (to speak so)
ere he notice it in a believer; and is not suspicious, even
when occasions are given. 3. Believers are often exceeding un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>answerable
to the relation that is betwixt Christ and them, and
may suffer Christ to stand long waiting without. 4. It affects
Christ much (and is a suffering to him, and a kind of putting
him to open shame, and a crucifying again of the Son of God) to
be kept out of hearts by unbelief, and there can be no pardonable
sin that hath moe and greater aggravations than this; for, it is
cruelty to kind Jesus Christ. 5. Believers, even when Christ is
in good terms with them, may fall in this fault. 6. Christ is a
most affectionat suiter, and patient Husband, that thus waits on
even when he is affronted, and gives not over his kind suit: Who
would bear with this, that he bears with and passeth by, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
kindly notwithstanding? Many strange and uncouth things
are comported with, and over-looked betwixt him and believers
without hearing, that the world could not digest. 7. Out Lord
Jesus hath not spared himself, nor shunned sufferings, for doing of
his people good: <hi>Iacob</hi>'s care of, and suffering for <hi>Labans</hi> flocks,
and <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> his humiliation was nothing to this. 8. The
love of Christ is manifested in nothing more for his people than
in his sufferings for them, and in his patient on-waiting to have
the benefits thereof applyed to them. 9. Christ's sufferings, and
his affectionat way of pleading from them, should melt hearts in
love to him, and in desire of union with him, and will make the
refusal exceeding sinful and shameful<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> where it is given; O so
strong arguments as Christ hath, to be in on the hearts of his
people! and how many things are there, to plead for that?</p>

shall I defile them?</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>The Brides answer is here set down, but O! how unsuitable to
that which was his carriage? He stands, she lyes; He without, she
within; He calls friendly; she ungrately shifts it, at best: As if a
wife should answer her husband so calling, <hi>I am now in bed, and
have put off my cloaths, and washen my feet,</hi> and so have composed
my self to rest, I cannot rise, it would hurt me to rise: So doth
the Bride thus unreasonably, and absurdly put back this fair call,
upon a twofold shift, both which are spiritually to be understood, as
the sleep and opening, formerly mentioned, were. In it consider,
1. The answer. 2. The manner of it. 3. The particular grounds
which she layeth down to build it on. And, 4. The faults of this
reasoning of hers, which at first may be concluded to be unsound.
The answer in general, is a denyal, as the event clears; and it's
like that, <hi>Luk. 11. 7. I am in bed, and my children with me, trouble
me not,</hi> &amp;c. Yea, <hi>how can I put them on?</hi> These words (being the in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>terrogatinonot
of one doubting, but of one shifting) imply a vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement
denyal, as if it were a most unreasonable and impossible
thing for her to give obedience to what was called for: which shews,
that Christ may get most undiscreet refusals to his fairest calls:
Which refusal is thus aggreged, 1 It was against most powerful and
plain means: The most powerful external Ordinances may be frustrat
even Christ himself in his Word, when he preached in the dayes
of his flesh, had not alwayes successe. 2. It was against her light,
she knew it was Christ's call: Even believers may fit challenges
against their light, and sin wittingly through the violence of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
though not wholly willingly. 3. She had invited him by
prayer, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. 16. yet now lyes still: Which lets us see, 1. That
believers in their carriage, are often unsuitable to their prayers:
There may be, and is often a great discrepancy betwixt these.
And, 2. Often believers may be more desirous of an opportunity
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:65401:133"/>
of meeting with Christ, or any other mercy, when they want it,
than watchful to make the right use of it, when they have got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
it.</p>
                  <p>Her way is to give some reasons for her refusal, as if she could
do no otherwayes, and were not to be blamed so much for her
shifting of Christ, as the words <hi>how can I,</hi> &amp;c. import. Observe,
1. The flesh will be bruidy and quick in inventing shifts for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
of it self, even against the clearest convictions and duties.
2. It's ill to debate or reason a clear duty, often Satan and the
flesh gets advantage by it. 3. Folks are oft-times very partial
in examining their own reasons, and are hardly put from their
own grounds once laid, although they be not solid; and the most
foolish reasons will be convincing to a spiritual sluggard, who in
fostering his ease, seems wiser to himself, than one who can ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the most concludent arguments, and strongest reasons to the
contrary, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26. 16. The opening of the particular reasons
will clear this; The first is, <hi>I have put off my coat,</hi> and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
is, <hi>how can I put it on?</hi> Putting off the cloaths is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence

                     </gap> betaking themselves to rest, as keeping them on,
is a sign of watching, as in <hi>Nehemiah 4. 23. None of us put off
cloaths, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
                        </gap> to washing;</hi> Hence keeping on of the cloaths is bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed,
to set out spiritual watchfulnesse, and hiding of spiritual
nakednesse, as <hi>Rev. 16. 15. Blessed is he that watcheth and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
his garments, lest he walk naked:</hi> And on the contrary put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
off of cloaths, signifieth not only a spiritual drousinesse, but
a high degree of it; as having put off, and fallen from that ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse
and watchfulnesse in her walk, wherewith she was cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>Chap.</hi> 4. 11. and is now somewhat setled in her carnal ease
and security. From this she argueth, <hi>how shall I put it on?</hi> The
force of the reason may be three wayes considered, 1. As it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
a difficulty in the thing, how shall I do it? O it's difficult!
2. As it imports an aversnesse to it, in her self: It stands against
her heart, as a seeming unreasonable thing, as <hi>Gen. 39. How shall
I do this great wickednesse,</hi> &amp;c.? 3. A sort of shame may be in it,
I am now out of a posture, and I think shame to rise, and to be
seen: Which shews, 1. That it's hard to raise one that hath fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
into security. 2. To lazy souls every thing looks like an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>superable
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:65401:134"/>
difficulty, their way to duty is as <hi>an hedge of thorns,
Prov.</hi> 15. 19. and <hi>there is a lyon in their streets,</hi> and sometimes, as
it were, even in the house-floor, when any duty is pressed upon
them that would rob them of their carnal ease, <hi>Prov,</hi> 26. 13. and
22. 13. 3. It's much for one in a secure frame to wrestle with
their own indisposition, it's a wearinesse then to take <hi>the hand out
of the bosome,</hi> Prov. 26. 15. 4. It's not a commendable shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastnesse,
but must needs be a very sinful modesty, that keeps one
from duty: It was indeed more shameful to lye still, than
to rise.</p>
                  <p>Her second ground is of the same nature, <hi>I have washed my feet:</hi>
washing the feet, fitted and prepared for rest; mens feet in these
countries, being, by walking bare-footed, someway stiffened,
beaten and bruised, which by washing were eased and refreshed,
as we may see, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 19. in <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lots</hi> carriage to the
Angels, supposing them to be men: So here, it is, I have fitted
and composed my self for rest, as being wearied with the painful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of holy duties, and now she cannot endure to stir her self
toward these, as if that would again defile her: In <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
                     </gap> reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
there are these faults, 1. That she doth at all offer to debate
a clear duty, this makes way for the snare. 2. That she interprets
the study of holinesse, and communion with Christ to be a trouble,
and carnal security to be an ease: There will be strange misrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations
sometimes, both of our faults and failings, and of
Christ's worth and excellency, which have much influence on
our deadnesse and sinful distempers. 3. She makes one sinful action
the cause of her continuance in another: There is often a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
amongst <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ins, and one draws on another; the premisses
that the flesh layes down as principles, will still bear conclusions
like themselves: It's unsound and unsafe reasoning from these.
4. That which should stir and perswade her to rise, to wit, that
she was not right, she makes a motive of it to strengthen her self
in her lazy inclination to lye still; Carnal sense draws conclusions
most unreasonable in every thing, and tends still to foster it self,
whereas faith and tendernesse would reason the quite contrary.
5. She puts too honest a name upon her security, and calleth it
the washing of her feet, which was indeed the polluting of them:
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:65401:134"/>
Fairding and plaistering over our own evils, is a great fostering of
security, yet too common; as to call unbelief humility, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
faith, security peace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We give to sin the name of
vertue, and then without a challenge maintain it; which is a
degree of putting darknesse for light, and bitter for sweet, and
a sort of calling evil good, which brings under the hazard of the
pronounced wo, <hi>Isa.</hi> 5. 20. 6. She fails here, that she expects
more ease in lying still, than in opening to Christ, whereas it is
but the flesh that is troubled at Christ's presence; but, solid satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
is only to be had in his company: Flesh hath ever secret
fears of Christ's company, as if it were intollerable, irksome and
troublesome to be a Christian in earnest; and these whisperings,
and wicked suggestions of the flesh, may have sometimes too much
weight with a believer. 7. She mistakes Christ's word, which
pressed that he might be admitted, who was a most loving hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
and had suffered so much in waiting for entry; but, she
states the matter otherwayes, if she that was at ease should trouble
her self, that so the shift might seem reasonable; Though Christ
be not directly and down-right refused, and the heart dar not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
convictions adventure on that, yet by opposing respect to our
selves to him, and by shifting to open to him when he knocks,
many are guilty upon the matter of refusing and slighting Christ
himself, when they think they slight not him, but would only
shun something that is troublesome to themselves: These words
are not so to be looked on, as if explicitly believers would so ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue,
but that in their lazy and drousie spiritual distempers there
is such arguing on the matter, and such or such like shifts prevails
often to make them keep out Christ, when directly they dar not
refuse him; which doth evidence the power and subtility of
corruption, even in a believer, and the greatnesse of the love
of Christ that passeth it by.</p>
                  <p>If it should be asked, Why is this sinful distemper of hers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrat,
and put upon record? Why say, 1. For her own good;
It's profitable for believers to mind and record their miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages
to Christ, as well as his kind dealings with them. 2. It's for
the honour of the Bridegroom, whose love appears and shines
most brightly, when it is set for-against her miscarriage; believers
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:65401:135"/>
would acknowledge their infirmities and failings, as well as their
mercies and graces, when it may make to the Bridegrooms com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation.
3. It's for the edification of others; often one
believers infirmities, through Gods blessing, may prove edifying
to others, for making them watchful, and bidding them stand,
and sustaining of them when fallen: The infirmities of <hi>Iob</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his fore tryals, have strengthened many, as his patience hath
convinced them.</p>
                  <p>In sum, this reasoning is indirect and frivolous, shewing in the
general, 1. That men incline to cover their secret misregard
of Christ, as if it were rather tendernesse to themselves, than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discreet
disrespect to him, yet he expounds it so: as, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 5.
when they alledge it as a necessary excuse, that they behoved to
wait on their farm and merchandise, he interprets it, they made
light of the invitation to the marriage of the Kings Son. 2. It
shewes, that the shifts whereby men put back Christ, are exceeding
frivolous, there can be no strong nor relevant reason alledged for
our slighting Christ, and for our ruining our selves in slighting
of him in the offers of his grace in the Gospel; although corrupt
nature exercise and rack it's invention, to find out reasons to
plead our excuse, yet when such reasonings are examined, they
will not abide the tryal. 3. That when mens hearts are in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
frame, very trivial and weightlesse arguments will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
to make them keep out Christ; and for as trivial as they
are, they would prevail even with believers, did not grace refute
them, and make way for his entry into the soul.</p>

                  <p>There follow; in this fourth verse, a second step of Christ's

his finger, and powerfully makes application to her, by a saving

work of the Spirit upon her heart, which hath the desired and

                  <p>In this we have, 1. The mean applyed and made use of. 2. The
manner of application. (for that the worker is the Beloved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
is clear) The mean in his <hi>hand,</hi> which in Scripture signifieth
three things, when attributed to God, 1. His Omnipotency,
whereby he doth what he pleaseth, <hi>Exod. 15. 6. Thy right hand,
O Lord, is become glorious in power:</hi> And, <hi>Exod.</hi> 8. 19. it's said,
<hi>This is the finger of God,</hi> that is, his power. 2. It's taken for the
Spirit, or the common operations of the Spirit, whereby miracles,
beyond the power of man are wrought; as by comparing <hi>Matth.</hi>
12. 28. with <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 20. will be clear. 3. It's taken for the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
work of the Spirit, applyed for the working of faith in the
elect at the first, or renewing and confirming of it afterward in
believers; as, <hi>Acts 11. 21. The hand of the Lord was with them,
and a great number believed.</hi> This is it which is pointed at, <hi>Isa.</hi>
53. 1. where, <hi>Who hath believed? and to whom is the arm of the
Lord revealed?</hi> are made of equal extent: And so especially it's to
be taken here, as the scope clears, to wit, for the immediat power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
work of the Spirit, made use of in the working of faith, as a
key is made use of for the opening of a door.</p>
                  <p>The way of applying this mean, is, <hi>he put in his hand by the hole
of the door:</hi> where (following the similitude of a husbands stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at a shut door, and not geting entry) he shews what he did,
when knocking prevailed not; to wit, he took an effectual way
of opening it himself, which is ordinary by putting in the key,
or somewhat else at the hole of the door: So Christ by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
made open the heart, in a kindly native way, not by breaking
open, but by opening; he indeed having the key by which hearts
are opened, even <hi>the key of David, that opens and no man shuts,
and shuts <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>and no man opens,</hi> Rev. 3. 7. Which words do shew,
1. That beside the call of the word, and any common conviction
that is thereby wrought in the heart, there is in the conversion
of sinners, an immediat, real, powerful and peculiar work of the
Spirit that accompanies the word. 2. That the application of
this is necessary, and that men being now asleep, and dead in sin,
cannot without that be stirred and quickned by the most power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:65401:136"/>
external Ordinances, or common operations: Nay, even to
the believers reviving, from his backslidden and drousie case,
this work if omnipotency is needful. 3. This work of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
is effectual, and when peculiarly applyed by Christ, cannot be
frustrat; for, he <hi>puts in his hand,</hi> and the effect follows. 4. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it be a most powerful work, yet it works kindly, and
brings about the effect without wronging of the natural faculties
of the soul, but makes use of them formally for bringing forth
the effect, as one that openeth a door by the lock, makes use of a
key, but doth not hurt nor destroy the lock: There is therefore
no inconsistency betwixt Christ's opening and ours; for, he co-acts
not nor forceth the will, but sweetly determins it, so that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but be willing; he takes away unwillingness from it, and makes
it willing, <hi>Psal.</hi> 110. 3. Christ hath the keyes of hearts, and can
open and shut at his pleasure, without wronging of them. 5. Grace
being the work of a high-hand, it cannot be easie to procure wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
to Jesus Christ even amongst believers, and much lesse with
others, who have no principle of grace within to co-operat with
Christ. 6. Christ Jesus as he is a most powerful worker, so is the
work of his power most free, soveraign and wonderful; which
clearly appeareth in that it is applyed on the back of such a slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
answer, and not before: Yea, 7. Often-times the work of
grace surprizeth his own, when they are in a most unsuitable case,
and when in respect of their deserving they might have expected
the quite contrary; certainly, we are not obliged to our free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will
for our conversion, but to his Spirit; nor to our predisposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
for his applying of it, but to his own grace, who in his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
way of dealing with his people, comes over many obstructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and packs up (to say so) many affronts and injuries.</p>
                  <p>If any should ask, why Christ did not apply this work, and put
in his hand at first, but suspends it till he had gotten a refusal, and
be now at the very withdrawing? <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. He doth this to shew
the Soveraignty of grace, that works as well when it will, as on
whom it will: Grace must not be limited by us in the manner or
time of it's working, more than in it's work, or subject matter
upon which it worketh. 2. By this he discovereth, what belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
would be without his grace (and so would teach them to
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:65401:136"/>
walk humbly) which otherwise had not so well appeared. 3. His
wisdom and tendernesse appears herein, that he will not withdraw
from her, and leave her lifelesse too, but ere he awake challenges
in her, he will make her lively in the exercise of her graces; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
she might have lyen still in her deadnesse: Christ times
his operations, his appearings and withdrawings with much ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse,
wisdom and discretion.</p>
                  <p>This work of the Spirit puts a stir in the Bride, which vents it
self in four steps. 1. <hi>Her bowels are moved. 2. She ariseth.
3. Her fingers drop with Myrrhe. 4. She opens.</hi> All which may
be considered, either, 1. As effects following the work of the
Spirit, whereby she is recovered from such a condition: Or,
2. As duties lying on a believer: Or, 3. As they hold out the
order of the effects wrought by the Spirit. In general, it holds
forth, 1. That the work of the Spirit, when it's effectually apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
makes a very great, palpable and universal change upon the
persons in whom it works: There is a great difference betwixt
the Brides carriage here, and what it was, <hi>vers.</hi> 3. 2. Although
it be not absolutly necessary, nor ordinary for a believer,
to know the instant of his conversion; yet, when the change
is suddain, and from an extremity of a sinful condition, it
will be discernable, and the fruits following the change will be
the more palpable. 3. A believer would endeavour to be clear
in the change of his condition; and when this clearnesse is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by the distinct uptaking of the several fruits of the change,
it is very useful and profitable for establishing the believer in the
confidence of his interest in Christ, and that there is a saving
change wrought in him; So here, the Bride both asserts him
to be her beloved, and likewise the reality of the change he had
wrought in her.</p>
                  <p>The first effect, is, <hi>my bowels were moved for him;</hi> Which, in
short, holds forth the kindly exercise of serious repentance, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
and stinging (as it were) the very inward bowels, for
slighting Christ so long: which will be cleared by considering,
1. What is meant by <hi>bowels.</hi> 2. What by <hi>moving of the bowels.</hi>
3. What that is, <hi>for him.</hi> By <hi>bowels,</hi> are understood either sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
and that in an intense degree, as, <hi>Iob 30. 27. my bowels
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:65401:137"/>
boyled.</hi> Lam. 1. 20. My <hi>bowels are troubled.</hi> And <hi>Ier. 4. 19. My
bowels, my bowels, I am pained at the very heart:</hi> Or, bowels are
taken for affection and tender love in the highest degree, such as
mothers have to the children of their womb, <hi>Philip. 2. 1, 2. If
there be any bowels.</hi> And <hi>Philemon, v. 12. Receive him that is my
own bowels.</hi> Thus they are taken, <hi>Isa. 63. 15. Where are thy bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els?</hi>
and frequently elsewhere, both in the Old and New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
By <hi>moving of the bowels</hi> (or sounding, or making a noise,
as the word is elsewhere trauslated, <hi>Isa.</hi> 10. 11. and 63. 15.) is
understood a sensible stirring of the affections, when they begin to
stound, and that kindly, and in a most affectionat manner, either
severally, or jointly, such as is <hi>the turning of the bowels,</hi> Hos. 11.
and the <hi>troubling of the bowels,</hi> Jer. 31. 18, 19, 20. It's even such
as is kindly sympathy with persons that are dearly beloved, when
any sad change befalls them: It's called the yerning of the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els,
spoken of that mother, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 3. 26. who was so affected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
her child, out of love to him, that she had rather quite him
to the other woman that was not his mother, than see him di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided,
her bowels were so hot towards him; (another thing than
was in any on-looker) It's the same word here, which shews, that
this motion of the Brides bowels proceeded from love to Christ,
and from sorrow for wronging of him, which two jumbled her with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
and pierced and stounded her to the heart, as a kindly parent
useth to be for the death or distresse of his only child, which is
the character of true repentance, <hi>Zech. 12. 10, 11. 3. For him,</hi>
holds out, 1. The procuring-cause of this trouble, that it was
for wronging of Christ, and the slighting of so kind an husband
and friend, that, that stounded her at the heart above all, as, <hi>Zech.
12. 10. They shall look on him whom they have pierced, and mourn for
him.</hi> 2. It holds forth the final cause wherefore she was so stirred and
moved; It was <hi>for him,</hi> that is, that she might injoy him, as the
word is, <hi>Hos. 7. 14. They assemble themselves for corn and wine,</hi>
that is, to obtain them: So her bowels were moved <hi>for,</hi> or <hi>after</hi>
him, to obtain and injoy him: And thus, sense of the wrong done
to him, in her by-past unkindly carriage to him, and desire to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
him again, so affects her, as if it were the pangs of a travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
woman, till Christ be again formed in her heart. <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. The
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:65401:137"/>
first work of the Spirit, is, by powerful convictions to beget evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
repentance in the heart, and to make the soul sensible of by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>past
failings, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 37. This although it be not in time before
faith, nor in nature (for, seing it proceeds from love, it suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
faith) yet it's the first sensible effect, that sinners (surprised
in a sinful condition) are touched with, and it's never separat
from, but alwayes joined with, the exercise of faith, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12. 10.
2. This work of repentance is necessary to be renewed, even in
believers after their failings, and it is the way by which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover;
Christ's Bride is thus affected, and it becomes them well
who have sin, to be deeply moved and afflicted with the sense of
it. 3. Where most love to Christ is, and where most sincerity
hath been, when a wakening comes, it will be the more sensible,
and affect the heart the more throughly. Particularly, we may
gather hence these properties of true repentance or godly sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.
1. Godly sorrow is no fruit of nature, but is a work and
effect of the Spirit of Christ, and a peculiar saving grace, beyond
common conviction, and a believer is not the worker of it in
himself. 2. This sorrow consists most in the inward pangs and
stings of the heart, wherein love to Christ, and indignation against
our selves for wronging of him, strugle, and put all within, in a
stir. 3. True repentance is different from, and beyond convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and challenges (which the Bride had before when this was
wanting in her) and makes another kind of impression, and a more
sensible touch upon the heart and inward bowels: I say not that
it's alway terrible; for, that is accidental to it, but sensible it is.
4. Though this godly sorrow affect the heart deeply, yet doth it
work kindly, sweetly and affectionatly, as a mothers affection
warms to her child, or, as a man is troubled for his first-born:
Love hath a main influence upon, and goeth alongst in, this godly
sorrow, both in the rise of it, love kindles this heart-indignation;
and also in the exercise of it, love to Christ keeps it lively; and
in the manner how it vents it self, it makes it a kindly and no
torturing or terrible exercise. 5. Nothing more affects a kindly
repenting heart, truly touched with godly sorrow, than that it
should have sinned against Christ It's own hazard is not the predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant
cause of this sorrow (she is clear of her interest still) nor
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:65401:138"/>
is it any sad event that might follow, which so affects her (though
she was not senselesse as to these) but it is <hi>for him,</hi> and his cause,
and not her own, that she is thus moved: The Spirits conviction,
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 16. 8. is, because they <hi>believe not on me.</hi> 6. Considering the
words with what follows, <hi>I rose,</hi> &amp;c. and comparing them with
what went before, <hi>Observe,</hi> That true repentance brings forth
alwayes a change in a believers carriage to the better, in those
things by which Christ their Beloved was formerly provocked;
and it doth stir up to universal activenesse, in the study of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:
This makes her arise from the lazinesse in which she for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
was. 7. Consider, that she rests not till first she open to
Christ, and thereafter obtain his presence, which sheweth, that where
true repentance is, the soul will never sit down on challenges, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions,
or making a-mends in the conversation, or any thing in
self; but it will be restlesse until by faith it close with Christ; yea,
it will be pressing after the intimation of his favour, on the back of
any peace attained in closing with him, as <hi>David</hi> doth, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51.</p>

                     <q>I rose up to open to my Beloved, and

the handles of the lock.</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>There are two steps of her carriage, or effects of the Spirit's
work, <hi>vers.</hi> 5. The first is, her bowels being thus stirred and
moved, she <hi>ariseth to open,</hi> as being sorry she had lyen still and
shifted him so long: <hi>I rose up;</hi> This is opposit to her former
lying still, and refusing to give him entry; now she yields, and
begins to bestir her self, to draw her cloaths to her, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which
imports not only more diligence as to the matter of duty, but
much seriousnesse as to the manner: It seems to differ from
opening (which is the actual receiving of Christ into the heart,
when all things are ready and prepared) not as if it were simply
contradistinguished from faith (for, this being a fruit of her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:65401:138"/>
and he acknowledged to be her beloved, there behoved
to be faith in it) but only, as one degree or act of faith is distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
from another, as, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. In the Prodigals case, it's said,
after he came to himself, before he act, he deliberats and stirs
himself; So this holds forth, her rousing and quickning her self,
for receiving Christ, which is not separat in time, either from
her repentance in the former words, or her faith in these that
follow; she <hi>rose to open,</hi> that shews her design, that she resolved
now not to stand at, but to go over her former reasonings; and
purposed by this stirring, to have the way rid for Christ's entry,
and to make him welcome; which shews, it was no confused ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
that her repentance put her unto, but distinct and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested,
like the Prodigals, <hi>I will arise, and go to my Father,
and say,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. Repentance will put the securest sinners to their feet,
when it is real. 2. There is no settling of an exercised mind, but
in receiving of Christ, and in making of him welcome. 3. When
the heart is affected with the sense of sin, and desire to have Christ,
it's not time to delay or dispute what to do, but to rise and open,
and by faith to receive Christ. 4. Where a soul hath been plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in security, or (like the <hi>Prodigal,</hi> Luke 15.) in prophanity,
there will be need of gathering, composing and rousing of it self,
for exercising of faith in Christ; this is not from any difficulty
that is on graces-side to receive a sinner, but from the difficulty
that is on the sinners side, in acting of grace, who being at a low
ebb, must by several steps of grace ascend out of it, with a kind of
violence to corruption, discouragement and unbelief, from under
the power of which the penitent must arise, when they combine
to intangle and detain him, as she doth here. 5. Believers would
be distinct in their exercises, especially in reference to their end
and design, that in their activity and stirrings it may be discerned
by themselves what they would be at: Some exercises are confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
neither having a distinct cause, nor a distinct end; kindly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
hath both, though much confusion may be with it. 6. Faith
in Christ, and making way for him into the heart, should be, and is
the native end of all inward exercises, diligence in duties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
This must be the great scope of all pains whatsoever; these stings
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:65401:139"/>
of exercise that put not the soul to open to him, though they
put the person thorow other, are not to be fostered, nor laid
much weight upon. 7. Though faith and duty differ, and the most
active frame is not to be rested on without faith, yet activity in
duty, and livelinesse in the exercise of faith go together: as her
rising and opening do, even as before, her lying still, and the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of him out, went together. Yea, 8. This activenesse runs es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
to perform what he called to: He called to open, and she
accordingly riseth to open; which shews, that the penitents acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
doth principally bend it self towards these duties, that Christ
in a more especial manner calls for.</p>
                  <p>She proceeds to set down her experience which she found when
she had risen, which is the third effect of the work of grace on her
by Christ's putting in his hand, when she arose to open: <hi>Her hands
and fingers dropped sweet smelling Myrrhe upon the handles of the
lock:</hi> She continues the comparison of opening a shut door, he,
as it were, put in the key without, and she came to draw the
handle or slot within. (as is usual in some locks) The door is the
heart, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 24. 7. called, <hi>the everlasting doors:</hi> The lock that
closeth, is unbelief and security, indisposition and declining in the
exercise of grace, whereby, as by a fast lock, Christ in his accesse to
the heart is kept out: Now she puts-to her hands and fingers to
the sock within, which imports her stirring her self again in the
exercise of faith and diligence, being now arisen to open; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by faith we are said to grip and take hold of Christ, and to
work righteousnesse, and by it the heart is opened to him, as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes.
This <hi>sweet smelling Myrrhe</hi> that drops, is the flowing of
habitual grace, which formerly was not vigorous and active, but
now it flowes and vents, and is to the heart as oyl applyed to
moisten and make easie a rousted lock, to make it open without
difficulty: This grace is ordinarily compared to Myrrhe, and the
anointing typical oyl was made of it and of other spices, <hi>Exod.</hi>
30. 23. It's said here, to drop from her <hi>fingers,</hi> implying the
active stirring of her faith, because when faith becomes lively, it
puts all other graces to exercise, and thereby (as it were by oyl)
her former hardnesse and indisposition was softned and removed,
and her heart made meet to act lively. In sum it's this, That
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:65401:139"/>
when she in the exercise of faith and holinesse, set her self seriously
and effectually to make way for Christ, and to remove what for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
had kept him out through her indisposition, unexpected<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
she found, that by his putting in of his hand, it went much
more easily and sweetly than she expected, all had been so anointed
and quickned; and thus conduced to the opening of her heart, as
dropping of oyl doth to the easie opening of a lock: Which shews,
1. That the work of grace upon the heart, being applyed by
Christ from without, doth leave an inward fitnesse on the heart
within for the opening of it self to him: Grace infused and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by Christ's Spirit, will make the most indisposed and secure
heart to open to him heartsomly. 2. That though Christ apply
grace from without to open the heart, yet will he have the heart
formally opening it self to him; and though the heart open it self
formally to him, yet it's by the vertue of his application from
without; for, this putting-to of her hand, and it's dropping
Myrrhe, is the effect of his putting in his hand, first. 3. Often
when the most spiritual and difficult duties (if it were even faith
it self) are e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ayed, they will be found more easie, than was expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and none can tell how they will go with them, till they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
and set about them. She, while lying in her security,
thought it impossible to get this done, yet now it goes easily and
sweetly with her. O! but when grace goes along and flows, the
exercise of duty is a sweet, and easie work. 4. Although the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of grace make duties easy, and a supply of help be given
thereby for doing of spiritual duties, yet the Lord will have the
person assaying duty ere he find it so; nor can he find or expect
that supply that will facilitat duties to him, till he first set himself
about them, as she first <hi>rises to open,</hi> before her <hi>fingers drop with
Myrrhe.</hi> 5. These that set themselves to open to Christ, and
minde that singly from the sense of their need of him, and being
affected for wronging of him, will not find grace wanting and defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to help them; and by this all the mouths of unbelievers
will be stopped, that are ready to say, and usually say they had not
grace to open. 6. Faith in exercise hath a great influence on the
keeping of all other graces in a believer fresh and green, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:65401:140"/>
it acts by Christ's strength, and therefore when it is in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise,
it makes all the rest to <hi>drop,</hi> as it were, <hi>with sweet smelling
Myrrhe.</hi>

                     <q>I opened to my Beloved, but my Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved

gone: my soul failed when he spake: I
sought him, but I could not finde him: I
called him, but he gave me no answer.</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>This 6. <hi>vers.</hi> contains five particulars of the Brides experience
in this case: The first of them, <hi>I opened,</hi> &amp;c. is the last effect fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
upon his putting in his hand <hi>vers.</hi> 4. This work of grace
left her not in an indifferency, whether to open or not, but having
given her to will in the former verse, now he gives also to do, and
actually determins the will, or makes it determine it self to receive
him: but now Christ is found to be absent, whereupon follows the
other steps of her carriage, and the disappointments that she met
with in seeking of him. This opening is the very thing called for
by him, <hi>vers.</hi> 2. which (considering the words following) is espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
to be understood of her exercising of faith in him, whereby
the heart is delated to receive him, hence believing is called, a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
of Christ,</hi> Joh. 1. 12. And it being a heart-receiving, it
must be the very thing understood here by opening. Now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
faith according to it's several acts, may be several wayes
considered, yet that act of faith whereby the heart consents to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
Christ, and to rest on him, is that which is mainly here aimed
at, 1. Because this opening, is opposed to refusing, <hi>Psal.</hi> 81. 10, 11.
It must therefore be consenting. 2. It's not giving of consent,
that mainly keeps Christ at a distance from souls, or keeps them
without interest in him, as opening to him, or receiving of him
intitles them to him, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 11, 12. and <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 14. 3. This
opening is both different from conviction, resolutions, repentance
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:65401:140"/>
and what may be supposed to preceed; these were in the words
going before: and is also distinguished from sense and the fruits
of believing, which follow after: It must therefore be the hearts
yielding to Christ's call, and submitting thereunto, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 3.
as actually consenting to be his: Yet all these acts would not be
looked on as distinct in respect of time, as they proceed from
grace (which puts all together) but in nature, and in respect of the
distinct uptaking of the same grace, in it's effects: In a word,
saith the Bride, the Lord having applyed the work of his Spirit to
me, it effectuated one step after another, and left me not untill I
yielded my self to him to be his, as a mansion for him to dwell in.
Which shews, 1. That grace doth not only work upon the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
to enlighten it, but that it doth also immediatly work
on the will, and determins it; for, this opening of the heart, is
an effect of that work of grace, <hi>vers.</hi> 4. as the former steps were.
2. The act of believing and opening to Christ is both the effect of
grace, and also the work formally of the believer: Therefore the
<hi>Lord</hi> is said to <hi>open the heart,</hi> Act. 16. 14. because the effect flows
from his putting to his hand; and the Bride is said to <hi>open</hi> her
own heart, because she formerly brought forth, or elicited the
act of faith, by the strength of grace. 3. This (being compared
with his call, <hi>vers.</hi> 3.) shews, that it's by faith that way is made
for Christ into the heart, and it's that which especially intitles
one to Christ, closes with his call, receives him, and enters Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with him; for, if opening or believing be that which he calls
for, as giving him accesse to the hearts of his people, then belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
being the performance of that called-for condition, must
unite the soul to him, and enter him into the heart. 4. There
is some peculiar efficacy in faith, in the uniting of one to Christ,
in accepting of Christ's call, and making way for him to come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the heart, which is not in any other grace: Or, it hath a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
way of concurring, in effectuating the persons union with
Christ (and so in Justification) which no other grace hath: Hence
this opening is peculiarly to be attributed to it, and is distinct
from repentance spoken of before, <hi>vers.</hi> 4. and from other duties
mentioned in the words following. 5. Whoever honestly, from
the sense of sin and need of Christ and desire to have him to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:65401:141"/>
their need, essayes believing and opening their heart to him,
shall certainly come good speed, and without fail attain their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign;
<hi>I rose to open</hi> (saith she) <hi>and I opened.</hi> 6. Although the
distinct exercise of saith be not attained instantly, (but there must
be first a rising, and an offering of violence to our corruptions in
the pursueing thereof, before we win to the distinct opening of
the heart) yet it should be prosecute till it be perfected. 7. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the exercise of faith will be distinct and discernable, so that
a believer can tell he hath believed; and it's no lesse comfortable
to be clear from serious reflecting on our selves, that we have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
by faith yielded to Christ, than to be clear of it by the fruits
following thereupon: For she is clear and confident in this, that
she had opened to him.</p>
                  <p>Having opened, now the Beloved is gone, like as a husband,
being offended at his wifes disrespect to him, should withdraw,
when she at length with much adoe were brought to rise; So our
Lord Jesus takes that way of rebuking kindly the former unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse
of believers, by after-desertions and withdrawings. The
word is doubled, <hi>but my Beloved had withdrawn himself, and was
gone,</hi> or, <hi>he was gone, he was gone;</hi> which doth not only import
in his carriage a sad withdrawing, and on hers an observation of
it; but also a sorrowful regrate and weightednesse, as having
met with a sad disappointment (as the following words clear)
as if she had said, at last I opened, but alace he was gone and away!
What this withdrawing of Christ is, we may know by considering
what his being present is, which is not to be understood of the
omni-presence of his God-head, there being no coming nor going
that can be attributed to that infinit Essence, which is every-where
at all times present; but it is in respect of the out-letting of his
especial love, and that in the peculiar way of manifesting it to his
people, and not in regard of his love it self, or of their interest in
him; for, here her interest stands in him, and faith in him is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised,
and the lifelesnesse that she was under is removed, so that
now she is acting faith, and there is a presence o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>grace making her
active and lively, even under this withdrawing: The thing then
which is wanting, is a sensible manifestation of Christ's love to her,
which now upon her yielding to open, she expected to have been
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:65401:141"/>
filled with, as a wife opening to her husband should expect his
embracements, and yet in place thereof, find that he were gone:
This withdrawing is no real alteration on Christ's side, nor are
we to look upon it as if now she had lesse than before she believed
and bestirred her self; for, her union with him, and the influence of
his grace on her remained: But, 1. She missed that comfortable
and sweet sense of love that she expected from him; that was kept
up. 2. She was then more sensible that he was provoked, and
found that her peace was not so well grounded, which formerly she
pleased her self with, as she conceived. 3. Upon this also follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
some kindly exercise, whereby Christ might make his dissatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
known, as a husband doth his, by his withdrawing; so that
although interest be not disputed, and the heart be kept in the
exercise of duties, yet disquietnesse may grow above what it was:
and Christ wisely times this sense of his absence now, with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of his grace, because she might both better endure it, and
it would also be more profitable thus to chasten her now, than if
he had done it in her dead condition. Hence, <hi>Observe,</hi> 1. That
believers, in the lively exercise of faith and duty, may have many
moe exercises, and sharper spiritual dispensations, than they had
formerly in their security. 2. Christ hath a peculiar way both of
presence with, and absence from his own. 3. Often believers
when they are in the exercise of faith and duty, expect satisfying
manifestations of Christ to their sense; for, it is supponed here,
that she looked for him this way, when she opened. 4. Sometimes
Christ will keep up the sense of his love, and withdraw himself
from his own, even when in the exercise of faith and duty.
5. Christ's withdrawing is not alwayes an evidence of the worst
frame, even as his presence doth not speak out his satisfaction
every way with his peoples condition, but these are often acts of
Soveraignty, timed according to his good pleasure; for, she is
now in better case than formerly, and yet he is withdrawn and
gone. 6. Christ by his withdrawing may be chastning for some
former sin or disrespect, done to him before the believer became
lively, who yet for good ends did suspend the taking notice of
that sin, till he was in a frame to bear it, and profite by it.
7. Christ's withdrawings ought to be observed by his people, as
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:65401:142"/>
well as other pieces of their own experience: It's profitable to
know what he doth, as well as what they do themselves. 8. There
is a great difference betwixt faith and sense; yea, betwixt clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of interest, and sensible presence, the one may be in a great
measure, where the other is not, as in this case here. 9. It's the
exercise of faith in Christ, that makes his absence to be discerned:
(for that is not known here, till the door be opened) And the
more lively a person be in the exercise of grace, the more will
Christ's absence be marked and regrated; whereas in a belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver's
secure frame, or in a person still unacquainted with Christ,
his absence is not discerned nor laid to heart. 10. Although
sense be not satisfied, yet believers should not disclaim their faith
when it is real, but acknowledge that they do believe, and open
to Christ when they do it: So it is here, <hi>I opened,</hi> or yielded by
faith to him, even when he was gone, and I could not find him.</p>
                  <p>What effect this disappointment had upon her part, follows,
<hi>my soul failed when he spake:</hi> This effect is sad and heavy, the
sense of her sin, and the apprehension of her grieving of him,
kindled by love to him, pierceth and stoundeth her so to the heart,
that it becomes almost lifelesse: So the word is used, <hi>Gen.</hi> 42. 28.
of <hi>Iacobs</hi> sons, when they found the money in their sacks mouths,
they were sore afraid, and their <hi>hearts failed them,</hi> or, <hi>went out
of them;</hi> It's a surprizing unexpected heavinesse, and that in a
high degree, holding forth, how de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ply believers will be affected,
when disappointed of the expected presence of Christ, and that
by their own guilt: The cause or occasion of this failing of heart,
is in these words, <hi>when he spake,</hi> which look to the time past,
though the effect was present; and they may be two wayes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
1. As being a remembring how it was with her while
he spake (for now he speaks not) she now observes, and calls to
mind, that when he called and she shifted, yet even then her heart
was affected with his word, and this smites her now, that she
should have so long smotherd so much kindnesse, and have brought
all this upon her self; It's like that of the Disciples, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 32.
who after Christ was gone, say one to another, <hi>Did not our hearts
burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and opened up to
us the Scriptures;</hi> though before they little heeded it, yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:65401:142"/>
they observe, and when they recollect themselves, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
more distinct than it was in the time. 2. It may be lookt
on as being the present effect of the words formerly spoken, which
although they did not so sensibly affect her when he spoke them,
yet now being brought to her remembrance (as, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 26.)
they pierce her, that she should have slighted and neglected them,
as, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. when <hi>Peter</hi> is admonished, the word for the time
affects not, but afterward, <hi>vers.</hi> 75. when he remembers it (as
challenges brings back words formerly spoken) <hi>he went out and
wept bitterly;</hi> So her resentment of what she formerly slighted is
now bitter. <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. The time of Christ's absence is a time when
by-gone challenges, or challenges for by-past offences, use to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur.
2. Often believers when brought through a secure fit, will
find some stirrings and effects of the grace of Christ to have been
in them, even then, which were not so discernable to them while
they were under their distemper. 3. Christ's word may have ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
long after it is spoken and heard; yea, a word long since
heard, may be an after-remembrance (being brought again to
mind by the Spirit) <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 26. and have operation more than at
first; or, although for a time it have had none at all, but may be
as seed under the ground, till the Spirit blow on it to bring it
above, yet, afterward by the the Spirit's influence, it may have
many blessed effects. 4. There is nothing that will affect a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
soul more, than to misse Christ's presence, when the disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
hath been procured by it's own sin, if it be but a with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing
for a time, that will make the hearts of his own even <hi>to
fail,</hi> but O! if it be eternal, by reason of sinners constant slighting
of him now in the offers of his grace, what desperate anguish will
it produce? And there is none that slights Christ's call now and
puts him away, but one time or other it will be heavy to them
and cost them dear. 5. It's a kindly thing, when a believer
misses Christ, and wants presence, to be affected with it; and it's
unkindly to discern absence, and not to be affected. 6. Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
where it's kindly, or right heart-sorrow will have it's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
and growth from one degree to another: This <hi>failing of
heart</hi> is a continued, but a further step of the <hi>moving of her bowels,
vers.</hi> 4. 7. Although interest in Christ be clear, and matters
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:65401:143"/>
otherwise not in an evil case, yet want of Christ's presence for the
time, and the remembrance of by-gone guilt, will be a very sad
exercise to the believer, and affect his heart very much.</p>
                  <p>This is a sad posture, yet she gives not over, notwithstanding
of this or any following disappointments, till she obtain the holy
design she drives: Where faith and love are exercised together,
for attaining Christ, nothing will scar nor discourage the soul in
it's pursuit of him. Her carriage follows in four steps (whereby
she endeavours to recover him) with the successe that she found
in each of them. 1. She gives private diligence. 2. She applyes
her self to publick Ordinances, <hi>vers.</hi> 7. When that also fails, she,
3. betakes her self to the exercise of mutual fellowship with the
daughters of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and seeks their help, <hi>vers.</hi> 8. and at last
rests on the exercise of faith in him, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. 3. Her secret pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse,
with the fruit thereof, is set down in two steps, in the
rest of this verse, 1. <hi>I sought him,</hi> that is, painfully used all means
to meet with him, as one searcheth earnestly for what he wants;
so the word is taken, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15. 14. It shews her seriousnesse as to
the end, and also her holy solicitude in the manner of pursuing it:
But (saith she) <hi>I found him not,</hi> he was now obtained, but she con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth
still under the want of the sensible manifestations of his
presence. Again, the 2. is, <hi>I called him,</hi> that is, prayed to him,
<hi>but</hi> (saith she) <hi>he gave me no answer,</hi> that is, I had no sensible
ease, and return of prayer; though the prayer was not altogether
unheard; for, her continuing to seek after him, shews that <hi>she was
answered with strength in her soul,</hi> Psal. 138. 3. There was sustain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-grace
even then, though there were not the soul-satisfying
and comforting inlargements, or sensible embracements of Christ,
and his warm-speaking of peace to her heart, which she aimed at;
and the greatnesse of her bensil after these, makes her think that
she had received no answer at all. It's in sum, as if a wife, by search
and running to and fro, did seek her husband, and when that suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
not, she calls him by his name: So did she leave no mean
unessayed, but did not obtain what she sought. Which shews,
1. That God often blesseth want of sense to a believer, to be a
spur to much diligence. 2. When desertions are most sensible,
then ought the believer to be most diligent in the use of all
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:65401:143"/>
means, especially of prayer, for an outgate. 3. There may be
much life in duty, even then when there is little sense and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
as to the event; there is here <hi>seeking</hi> and <hi>calling</hi> on him,
though she found him not, and he gave her no answer. 4. It's a
blessed heart-sorrow that vents in diligence and prayer to God
for his presence. 5. The remembrance and resentment of our
by-gone wrongs to Christ, should not so affect, as to scar us from
him, but should presse us to seek to be again in his company;
otherwise, if we scar at him, or bide away from him, because of
the sense of guilt, it will be the mending of one fault with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
It's ever best reckoning our own guilt, when he is present.
6. Christ's presence is the only cordial that can satisfie a soul,
fainting under the sense of the wrongs it hath done to Christ:
therefore when her heart <hi>fails,</hi> she sits not down under it for ease,
but seeks and calls for himself and his own presence. 7. There
may be much seeking and prayer, which may be so indeed, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
of by God, and yet his comfortable presence be kept up,
and the particular sought-for suspended. 8. Often the having of
our eye in prayer upon one particular (suppose upon one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort)
may make us construct our prayers, to have lesse of an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
than they have, whileas indeed they are not fruitlesse, but
may be answered in other things, which we do not observe. 9. The
Lord may deny comfort when it is sought, and yet shew his grace
in sustaining his people, and quickning them to follow him in their
duty, when they in the mean time may take it for a sort of refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 9, 10. It is ever good for believers to reflect on
their duty, and on the successe of it, whatever it be; and that
not in one step only, but in the whole tract of their way. 10. If
we compare this with her former carnally easie and secure condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>vers.</hi> 2, 3. we see, that sensible desertion, when a believer is
holily active under it, is no ill condition; comparatively it's bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
with her now when she is swounding and fainting without
Christ, than when she did ly still carelessly without him; grace is
working more actively now (as from <hi>vers.</hi> 4. is clear) and she is
nearer unto him, and hath much more solid ground of peace than
she had at that time.</p>

                  <p>When private means do not the businesse, the Bride betakes
her to publick Ordinances, and frequents them: And this 7. <hi>vers.</hi>
shews what she found in the use of that mean, a sad disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
also, which is several wayes aggreged: Christ's presence is
easily lost, but it is not easily recovered; This will cost much
pains, and the enduring of many perplexing disappointments: It
is much more difficult to win to injoy Christ, than it is to lose
him: Lying <hi>on the bed</hi> in ease may bring on that, which much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
and watching will not remove.</p>
                  <p>That this verse points at her going about the publick Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
the scope makes clear, that being the next ordinary mean used
for enquiring after an absent Christ, when private diligence hath
had little successe. The matter of the words, as was cleared in
<hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 3. doth also evidence this; The Church is the <hi>City</hi>
which hath <hi>walls</hi> (that is, the Ordinances) for preventing her
hurt, and promoving of her edification: The <hi>watchmen</hi> are her
Ministers, appointed and designed to <hi>keep the walls,</hi> and <hi>to go about
the City:</hi> They are said to go about the City, in respect of their
care and solicitude to prevent inward difficulties and hazards, and
are called keepers of the walls, as they stand to repel what from
without may disturb the Churches edification, and ecclesiastick
peace: In a word, they are the same by office, that these were,
<hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 3. but their carriage to her is more unlike the relation
they stood in: Which is set forth in four steps, all which are to
be looked on as a special piece of untendernesse in them, and of
suffering in her; which now the Lord in his wisdom permits her
to meet with, that so she may find how unwisely she had done to
neglect Christ's kind call, <hi>vers.</hi> 2. when as now other hands deal
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:65401:144"/>
more roughly with her: The reasons hinted, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 3. do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
this; beside, there being so much spoken of their wounding
of her, either she or they must be wrong; Now she is (for the
main) in her duty, and under a fainting condition, seeking after
Christ, and there is no warrand to wound a poor seeker of Christ
in such a condition, even where there have been former failings,
(2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 7. The Apostle will have the incestuous person in such
a case tenderly dealt with, lest he <hi>should be swallowed up</hi>) but it's
duty rather to bind up their wounds, and to pour oyl into them,
by speaking a word in season to such weary souls. This was, no
doubt, their duty, and the Lord himself doth so, <hi>Isa.</hi> 50. 4. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
could her former security be a ground to reach her such
blows now, especially her offence being betwixt Christ and her
their alones, and so no object of publick reproof; and she being
a burthen to her self, ought not to have been made more heavy
by them: Beside, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 4. the watchmen dealt more tenderly
with her, when yet she had been in security also. This dealing of
theirs cannot be to speak a word in season to the weary soul of a
tender person, whose carriage is so convincing even to others, that
<hi>vers.</hi> 9. they give her a high commendation, which is a clear testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
against the malignity of these watchmen; they must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be lookt on as untender, or unskilful, or both, who do thus
misapply the Word contrary to the end for which it is appointed,
and as miserable comforters talk to the grief of such as he hath
wounded. The first step is, <hi>They found me:</hi> It is not the finding
of a friend, as <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 3. but (as the effects clear) the finding of
an enemy, and is as if a Minister should digresse of purpose, to take
in the case of some poor tender soul, that he might reach it a
blow, though beside his Text: Thus, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34. 21. The Idol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shepherds
(who it may be, had a true external call) are said to
<hi>thrust with the side and shoulder,</hi> and <hi>push all the diseased with the
horns:</hi> And, <hi>vers.</hi> 4. to <hi>rule with force and cruelty:</hi> And in <hi>Ezek.</hi>
13. 20. they are said to <hi>hunt the souls of God's people:</hi> A part of
which cruelty and oppression, is <hi>vers.</hi> 22. in <hi>making the righteous
sad:</hi> This is their <hi>finding,</hi> a seeking occasion to load them with
bitter invectives, and reproaches. It's observable also, that here
at the very first finding they hurt her, without so much as suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:65401:145"/>
her to tell her own case, as she did to the watchmen, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 3.
So that without taking notice of her condition, they presently fall
upon her; which saith, that in their smiting her, they did not
respect her case. 2. <hi>They smote her,</hi> that is, more gently at first;
however, they suffer no occasion to slip, whereby they have any
accesse to give a wipe to such heart-exercised souls, but it's laid
hold upon; and what infirmity is in any of them, or inconsiderat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in their zeal, that is casten up, and often somewhat of lesse
moment is much aggreged. The word takes in also wronging
with the tongue, <hi>Ier. 18. 18. Come, let us smite Ieremiah with
the tongue:</hi> and it's like, by the words following in that verse, the
prophane Priests had no little accession to it. 3. <hi>They wound her:</hi>
This is a further step, and imports such a smiting as continues
till the person be wounded, denoting a higher degree of cruelty,
such as is the <hi>persecuting of these whom God hath smitten, and talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their grief,</hi> Psal. 69. 26. which will exceedingly wound a
tender exercised soul, who is soon affected; and the Psalm espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
points at <hi>Iudas,</hi> who, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12. 4, 5, 6. was ready to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
the holy zeal of an honest soul, which our Lord vindicats
and leaves on record to her eternal commendation. 4. The last
step is, <hi>They took away my vail from me:</hi> The word that's rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<hi>vail,</hi> comes from a root that signifieth to subdue, it's that
fame word which we have, <hi>Psal. 144. 2. who subdues the people,</hi> &amp;c.
It had a threefold use, 1. For decorement, as <hi>Isa.</hi> 3. 23. 2. For
a sign of modesty, pleaded for by the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 6. 3. And
mainly, for a sign of womens subjection to their own husbands;
for which cause <hi>Rebekah</hi> puts on her vail, when she meets <hi>Isaac,
Gen.</hi> 24. 65. And therefore it's called <hi>power,</hi> as being the sign of
the wifes being under the <hi>power</hi> of her husband, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 10.
Here, her <hi>vail</hi> is the tendernesse of her profession, whereby in a
decent, modest and humble way, she profest her self to be a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever,
seeking after Christ Jesus, as one bearing the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>dge of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
to him as her husband. The <hi>taking away</hi> of the vail, is
their wronging of that honest profession she had, and the giving
of her out, not to be that which she profest her self to be, and so
not worthy of a vail; but that her profession was hypocrisie, her
painfulnesse and tendernesse, conceitinesse, even as <hi>Iudas,</hi> Joh. 12. 5.
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:65401:145"/>
nicknames that good work wrought upon Christ by that honest
woman, calling it <hi>wastry:</hi> And by these and such other means,
often tender souls are affronted, and proposed as a reproach to
the multitude; even as if a wife that is chast, were denuded of her
vail, and reputed as an gadding harlot, while she is seeking her own
husband: So when the Lord threatens his people, that their le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
should be made to appear, he useth this expression, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 23.
26, 27. They shall <hi>stripe thee out of thy cloaths,</hi> &amp;c. that being a
manifest <hi>shame to a woman, that should be covered,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 6.
This is added, to shew that they pretend they have reason for
their smiting: They disgrace her, and take away her vail, that
they may not be thought to smite holinesse or tendernesse, but
a hypocrite under such a vail, or a whore more decently adorned
than became her to be.</p>
                  <p>This is the sum, when I prevailed not in privat diligence, I
frequented the publick Ordinances; but these who were watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and healers by office, being untender (as if they had intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it) did by malice, or want of affection, or through unskilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and want of experience, so apply the word, that they sowed
pillows under the arm-holes of the prophane, and made the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
sad: Whereby I was not only nothing profited, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
more weighted and ashamed, and had no encouragement
to seek any more of their help, as I had done, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 3. but was
necessitat to turn to others: Which shews, that she accounts
them untender, and therefore, sets it down here as a piece of her
sad tryal; whereas, had it been the <hi>wounding</hi> of a friend, it had been
<hi>a kindnesse to her, Psal.</hi> 141. 5. and would have ingaged her to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
on for healing from that same hand, so far would it have been
from being the matter of her complaint, neither would it have
been complained of by her.</p>
                  <p>These words afford many such doctrines, as, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 3. As, 1.
The visible Church is a distinct incorporation by it self, and all
it's members have right to it's priviledges, to wit, such whereof
they are capable: It's the City, and they are the <hi>Citizens,</hi> Eph.
2. 19. 2. Its a City that is not without fear and hazard, though
it have walls; but it had need to be watched both within and
without: Or, the visible Church hath many enemies, she is in
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:65401:146"/>
constant war: Hence therefore, is she called the militant Church;
and for this cause, she hath walls and watchmen. 3. The Lord
hath provided her with sufficient means against all assaults. 4. A
lawfully-called ministery, or watch-men peculiarly defigned for
that end, are the great mean Christ hath appointed for preventing
the hurt, and promoving the good and edification of his Church,
<hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 12, 13. They are as the sentinels, which he hath set on the
walls for giving advertisement and warning; and this well becomes
their office, <hi>Isa. 62. 6. Ezek.</hi> 3. and 33. Chapters, and elsewhere.
5. Tender believers will put a great price upon publick Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
even when they seem to themselves to come little speed in
their privat duties; privat diligence furthers publick, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
furthers privat: These two ought not to be, neither will
they, be separat in a tender person, but go together. 6. Tender
believers may have weights added to their exercise, and a load
put above a burden, even by these whose stations and relations
call for much more sympathy and healing. 7. Publick Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
may be sometimes unfruitful to believers, even when they have
great need, and are under great sense of need. 8. When one that
is tender gets no good nor ease by publick Ordinances, often
there is an addition made to his burden thereby. 9. Untender,
unskilful and unfaithful men may creep in, and be admitted to
the ministery, and to watching over the Church, as <hi>Iudas</hi> was.
10. When such are gifted, and (as to order) lawfully called, they
are truly ministers, though not true ministers, and have authority
for discharging of all duties; and duties discharged, or Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
dispensed by them according to Christ's warrand, are valide,
and the word from their mouth, is to be received as from him;
Therefore they are called watchmen, which imports them to be
really in office, which could not be if the former assertions were
not true. 11. Very often, tender believers in their exercises,
suffer much from such ministers: Or an untender minister, is
often a great affliction to tender exercised believers; yea, of all
men, these prove most sadly afflicting to them; no man wounds
godlinesse more, or wounds and affronts the profession thereof
more in them that are the most real and tender professors, than
a gifted untender minister may do, and often doth; though some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:65401:146"/>
the Lord will make use of him for their good, to humble
them, yet more to provoke them to the study of more serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in secret duties, and to more closse and constant waiting on
the Lord himself. 12. Where enmity against godlinesse once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riseth
and vents it self against the godly, it often grows from
one degree to another, as here; Men, especially Ministers once
ingaged in it, are not easily recovered and brought out of that
evil, but are carried, yea, often hurried from one step to another:
yet, she accounts them watchmen, as holding out the respect she
bare to their office, even then: Whence observe, 13. That it is
a piece of spiritual wisdom and tendernesse, to distinguish care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
betwixt the office of the Ministery, or the Ordinance it self,
and the faults and untendernesse of persons, who may miscarry
in the exercise of that office; and not to fall from the esteem of
the Ordinance because of them, or of what faults may be in them,
but even then to respect the Ordinance out of respect to Christ,
and his institution and appointment. 14. Believers would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the fruit of publick Ordinances, as well as of secret diligence,
as the Bride here doth.</p>

This sicknesse implyes pain as of a woman in travel, whose
showres are sharp, and pangs vehement till she bring forth: The
same word is used to this purpose, <hi>Isa. 26. 17. Like as a woman
that draweth near her delivery, is in pain,</hi> &amp;c. And it imports in
this place, these two, 1. Vehement desire after Christ, from ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:65401:147"/>
love to him, so that she could not indure to want him.
2. Much heart-affectednesse following upon that ardent desire,
which (under her former disappointments) did beget such pain
and fainting, that it was as a sore sicknesse, though not danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
This sicknesse differs from that spoken of, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 5. as the
scope shews: That is like the pain procured by an overset of the
stomack, so the sense of his love being let out in a very great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
was like to master her; not that sense of his love is simply
or in it self burdensome, but she is weak like an old bottle, or a
queasie and weak stomack that cannot bear much: But this is like
the pain that proceeds from hunger, and a strong appetite, when
that which is longed-for is not obtained, which augments the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
and at last breeds fainting and sicknesse. This shews, 1. That
love to Christ where it is sincere, is a most sensible thing. 2. That
the moe disappointments it meets with, in seeking after sensible
manifestations of Christ, it grows the more vehement. 3. That
continued absence to a tender soul, will be exceeding heavy and
painful; hope deferred makes the heart sick, especially when the
sweetnesse of Christ's presence hath been felt, and his absence di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly
discerned. 4. That Christ's presence is the souls health,
and his absence it's sicknesse, have else what it will. 5. That love
to Christ will sometimes, especially after challenges and disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments,
so over-power the soul, that it cannot to it's own
sense (at least) act under it, or sustain it (it seems so heavy a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den)
as sicknesse will do to the body, if it get not an out-gate.</p>
                  <p>The way she takes to obtain Christ after all other means fail
her, is by making her application to the daughters of <hi>Ierusalem:</hi>
Indeed it's Christ, and not they that can cure her, he is the only
medicine for a sick soul; therefore, her design is not to rest in
their company, but to make use of it for obtaining his company:
For, the company, although it were even of Angels, will not be
satisfying to a soul that seeks Christ, the best fellowship is empty
without him, <hi>Ioh. 20, 12. 13. Why weepest thou?</hi> (say the Angels)
<hi>Why?</hi> (saith she) <hi>they have taken away my Lord.</hi> In this consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
1. The parties she betakes her self to, <hi>the daughters of Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi>
spoken of <hi>chap.</hi> 1. 5. Professors not of the worst stamp; yet
(as after appears) under much ignorance of Christ, and of spiritual
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:65401:147"/>
exercise: This is the mean she goes now unto. Where observe,
1. Spiritual communion amongst professors or believers, is not
only a duty, but a special mean, being rightly made use of, to
further our fellowship with Christ. 2. Believers in their sad
cases, may, and ought freely to make use of this mean, by desiring
others help; and for their own case and furtherance in meeting
with Christ, by communicating their case to them, as she doth
here. 3. Even the strongest believers (whom the Bride repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents)
may be helped by these, that are much weaker than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in gifts, grace and experience; as the daughters of <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi>
are here: And so <hi>Paul</hi> often requires of others, inferior
to, and much short of him, the help of their prayers. Consider,
2. her desire to them, <hi>Tell him</hi> (saith she) <hi>I am sick of love,</hi>
make my case known to him, and hold it up by prayer: She had
been doing so her self, and had not come speed, and therefore
she puts them upon it, that they might help her to obtain an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.
<hi>Obs.</hi> 1. That prayer for one another, is a duty of mutual fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship,
especially for these that are exercised: others should be in
that exercise with them, <hi>Iam.</hi> 5. 17. 2. Believers sometimes will
not trust themselves with the opening of their own case to Christ,
and will not be satisfied with their own way, but will think others
can do it much better. 3. Praying for our selves, and desiring of
help from others should go together; Or, it will give most clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and peace to believers, to desire the help of others, when
they have been serious in the use of all means by themselves, as
she had been. 4. It sayes, That believers holding up the case of
another, will be very acceptable to Christ. And, 5. That there
is nothing we can tell Christ, of our own or other folks case, that
will be more pleasant to, and taking with him, than this, that
we are they who are <hi>sick of love</hi> to him: This is propounded,
as that which may and will be most acceptable to him: <hi>what
shall ye tell him?</hi> (so the words run) these are the best and most
acceptable news to him. 6. Such a ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>e as love-sicknesse is a
good motive, upon which to presse for the help of others pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and that which may also give confidence to any, to bear such
a message to Christ. 7. Believers in their communion with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
would more insist upon their own cases, than on the faults
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:65401:148"/>
of Ministers, or miscarriages of others: Although she was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
smitten by the watchmen, yet this is the great thing she
propounds to them. Consider, 3. a qualification, put in her
suit to the daughters of <hi>Ierusalem; If ye find him:</hi> That is, If
ye get accesse, which now she thinks her self excluded from. And
it imports, 1. That there is a peculiar finding of, and accesse un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Christ at one time beyond another. 2. That a weak believer
may sometimes have much more accesse to Christ, and sensible
communion with him, than others of greater parts and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
She suppones that they might find, while she did not.
3. That when any gets accesse for themselves, then especially they
should remember others, and improve their court with Christ,
for their good who may be in bonds, and under sad exercise:
Then (saith she) when ye get accesse, remember my case: She
would share of the fruit of their most warm injoyments. 4. She
doth not resent nor envy this, or become jealous of it, but hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
submits to be helped by them; Christ will have every one
useful to another, and the strongest should not disdain to be in
the common of the weakest.</p>
                  <p>The last thing is the manner of her proposing of it, <hi>I charge</hi>
or <hi>adjure you</hi> (saith she) which hath the force of an oath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to others, as if she had sworn them that they should do it:
The same charge or adjuration is set down, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 7. and 3. 4.
She puts them to it, as they will be answerable. Which shews, 1.
Great seriousnesse in her; the matter of Christian-fellowship,
and our desiring of the help of others prayers, is no matter of
complement, but should in earnest be sought for. 2. She desires
seriousnesse in them, in their discharge of this duty: In our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for others, conscience would be made of it, as seriously as for
our selves, and we would beware of superficialnesse and overlinesse
in it. 3. Our expressions in our fellowship, especially concerning
the most serious purposes, would be suitably serious: A light
manner of speaking in serious things, often spills the beauty of
them, marrs edification, and diminisheth from the weight of the
matters themselves.</p>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>In this 9. <hi>vers.</hi> is the third part of the Chapter, where the
daughters of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> are brought in speaking: where we may
see what effect the Brides serious charge had upon them: It some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
surprizeth and astonisheth them, to see a person convincingly
approveable in her carriage, so taken up with that which the most
part of the world slights; This makes them think that he whom
she asketh for, must be a person beyond ordinary, and in this they
conclude right: There is much infirmity in this question (as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
many professors are upon the matter really ignorant of Christ's
worth) yet some honest-like things (at least) are in it. There is,
1. respect to her as a beautiful and goodly person, even when she
was thought little of by the watchmen. 2. Docilenesse, and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to know. 3. Some suspition of their own knowledge of Christ:
And, 4. Ingenuity in seeking help. All which, are good symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes
in beginners, and we will see that the question ended well
with them, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. 1. and it's like was awakened in them by her
serious carriage. The return they make to her charge hath in it,
1. The title they give her. 2. The question they propose to her.
3. The rise of it, or that which gives them occasion to ask, and
which puts them to it. The title is excellent, <hi>O thou fairest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
women:</hi> It was given to the Bride by Christ himself, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 8.
It implyes, 1. A spiritual beauty in her who now was thought
little of by the watchmen, and had her own crosses in the world,
yet even in this case lovely in her self, and lovely to these daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
<hi>Observe,</hi> 1. That believers should be eminently convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,
and commendable in their carriage even before others;
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:65401:149"/>
They should be <hi>fairest</hi> among them, and for spiritual beauty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous,
as lights shining in a dark place. 2. Grace when seriously
in exercise, is that which makes any person (though outwardly
mean and contemptible) truly beautiful and lovely; It makes
them so really, and also in the eyes of all spiritual beholders.
3. Sometimes God will make honest seekers of him the more
lovely to others, when corrupt Ministers seek most to defame
them; The watchmens wounding her, marrs not the daughters
estimation of her; and this shews that they did smite her with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
reason. Again, 2. It implyes respectiveness on their part, and
also honesty; for, there is now no external thing to commend her
to them: Which saith, 1. That to the spiritual eye of honest
souls, none will be so beautiful as the person that is holy; yea,
sometimes holinesse will have a commendation in the consciences
even of them that are strangers to it. 2. Often holinesse may
be more esteemed of, and holy persons more respectively dealt
with, by men of little either knowledge or profession, than by these
who may be much more knowing, and whose station and place
calls them to be more tender: The Bride here is like the <hi>wounded</hi>
person, <hi>Luke 10. 31, &amp;c.</hi> whom the <hi>Samaritan</hi> succoured, when
both the <hi>Priest</hi> and <hi>the Levite</hi> had passed by him. 3. Where grace
shines, it would be highly esteemed of and respected; and such as
are but babes in Christ, ought much to reverence these that are
of older standing. 4. Tender souls when under exercise, if we
can do no more to ease them, would be respectively spoken unto
at least: These daughters do not wound the Bride, as the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
did, but speak discreetly and respectively to her, although
they can further her little. 5. The right use of freedom, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riousnesse
with humility in mutual fellowship, is a great help to
entertain mutual respect amongst professors; when the weak see
the strong ones not puft up, but condescending to take their help,
it will conciliat love and respect: Thus the daughters meet the
Bride here with respective carriage. 6. Respective expressions of
one professor to another, with gravity and seriousnesse, becomes
Christian-fellowship well; and is a great furtherance of edification
and mutual confidence: So we see here, and <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. 1. as also in
the Brides expressions preceeding.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="295" facs="tcp:65401:149"/>
2. The question propounded by them is, <hi>what is thy Beloved?</hi>
as scarce knowing him, or acquainted with him themselves: It is
not spoken out of disdain, but out of desire to know, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
that there behoved to be some excellency in him, beyond
others, as the following effects clear. The question is proposed
by way of comparison, and doubled, <hi>What is thy Beloved more than
another beloved?</hi> or <hi>the beloved of another?</hi> By <hi>beloved,</hi> all alongst
is understood that which the soul <hi>loves</hi> and cleaves unto; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Christ is sometimes designed by the one name, <hi>the souls love;</hi>
and sometimes by the other, the <hi>Beloved;</hi> as we may see by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
<hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 1, 2, 3. with <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 16, 17. because he eminently
and above competition had the Brides heart. By <hi>other beloveds</hi>
are understood these things that men of the world set their love
and affections upon, and which bears most sway with them, as that
which in a singular manner their soul loveth; the same that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
are called <hi>Idols,</hi> because they are put in Gods room;
There is the same reason here, why they are called <hi>other beloveds,</hi>
and <hi>strange lovers</hi> else-where: Such are the <hi>belly,</hi> Phil. 3. 19. <hi>the
world,</hi> 1 Joh. 2. 15, 16. <hi>Love not the world, nor the things of it,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>the lust of the eye, the lust of the flesh, the pride of life:</hi> So it's as if
they had said, There are many things which the men of the world
seek after, it's none of all these that this Bride is enquiring for, she
rests not satisfied with these, nor valueth them; He must then be
some excellent person, a singular and non-such Beloved that she is
so serious in the enquiry after, and therefore they desire to know
from her self what he is. The question is doubled as being the
result of a serious desire to know, and of high admiration, what he
might be who was thus enquired for.</p>
                  <p>3. The words added, shew what is the rise of her question and
wondering, to wit, these, <hi>That thou dost so charge us:</hi> Every word
hath weight, it's <hi>thou,</hi> the <hi>fairest among Women,</hi> who certainly can
make the best choice. 2. Thou art not only in earnest thy self,
but <hi>chargest</hi> us also. And, 3. Not only thou chargest us, but <hi>so
vehemently,</hi> pressingly and weightily; This, sure, must be some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Beloved. This question carrieth in it not so much an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
who is the believers choice, as their desire to know what
Christ was indeed, in respect of his real worth, whose Name only
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:65401:150"/>
(or little more) they knew before; Therefore they say not, <hi>who</hi>
is, but <hi>what</hi> is thy Beloved? as knowing his Name, but being much
ignorant of his worth. Again, it supposeth such a question to be
moved by these professors, upon occasion of her exemplary car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage:
And indeed it cannot be told, what thoughts, serious chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges,
and exercising questions the convincing carriage of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
will have amongst those with whom they christianly converse;
and so it shews, that this seriousnesse in one may put others to it,
to question what the matter may be, and through Gods blessing
may commend Christ to them in the end, which is the scope.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. There may be some respect to godly persons, where
there is much ignorance of Christ himself. 2. Where there is
esteem of godlinesse and of these who study it, there is some be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
inquiry for Christ himself, and it leads on to further, although
the beginnings be weak. 3. True tendernesse in beginners ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
in nothing sooner, than in respect to these who were in Christ
before them; They are now but a-beginning, yet this shews it
self in the respect they carry to the Bride. 4. It's no shame for
these that are unacquainted with Christ, to inquire for him at
such as know him. 5. What Christ is, and the necessity of praying
for others, is a suitable subject of discourse in Christian-fellowship;
what is Christ? say they to her; and pray for me, saith she to
them. 6. Christ's Name may be known to many, to whom his
worth is unknown, or but little known, and who are not acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with what he is. 7. All men naturally have some lust, idol,
or <hi>beloved,</hi> that their affection is set upon beside Christ; It's
some other thing, from which he is distinguished, and to which he
is opposed. 8. Men lay out their affections liberally upon their
idols, and upon these things that their heart cleaves unto beside
Christ; They are <hi>beloveds,</hi> and opposed to Christ, as being that
to the men of the world, that Christ is to his own; they are as
Gods and Christs to them, they run so mad upon their idols,
and are so <hi>joyned</hi> to them, <hi>Hos.</hi> 4. 17. men naturally have an high
esteem of their idols, as placing some worth in them which is not,
and they have a low esteem of Christ, and prefer their idols to
him. 9. This mistake is a great cause of Christ's being slighted
in the world, that they think <hi>other beloveds</hi> as good as he, and
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:65401:150"/>
other lifes as good as the life of holinesse; therefore they go to
the <hi>farm, plough, market,</hi> and <hi>make light of Christ,</hi> Matth. 22. 4.
10. The questioning of this grand principle of corrupt nature,
that Christ is no better than other beloveds, or the inquiring
whether he be indeed better than these, is one of the first rises of
a souls making forward to enquire for him. 11. The growing of
the esteem of Christ in a soul, and the decay of the esteem of all
idols (formerly beloveds) go together; as the one stands, the
other falls, as the one grows, the other decayes. 12. The right
up-taking of Christ's worth, is the great thing that commends
Christ to a soul (therefore the Bride describes him afterward)
and the through conviction of the vanity of all other things, loos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the grips of our affections from them, and makes way for set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
up Christ more high. 13. The convincing-carriage of a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever
may stir and raise an exercise in these that formerly were se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure:
And God can make the words of a private humble Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
the rise of a serious enquiry after Christ in another; Thus
her serious charging of them doth so stick to them, as if that word,
<hi>I charge you,</hi> had pierced them. 14. Nothing more adorns the
Gospel, and commends Christ, and makes him lovely to others,
than the convincing, serious carriage of believers. 15. These who
are not acquaint with Christ's worth, or the exercises of believers,
are ready to wonder what moves them and puts them to make
such a stir about Christ, more than others that live satisfied and
contented without him.</p>

                  <p>From <hi>vers.</hi> 10. to the end (which contains the fourth part of
the Chapter) the Bride speaks: and (in answer to the daughters
of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> their question) in a sweet, pithy, taking-manner
commends her Beloved. She is not long in returning answer to
their question, as being fully clear and ready to demonstrate Christ
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:65401:151"/>
her Beloved his worth above all; and as impatient that any other
should be put in competition with him, (especially by the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> whose edification she studies by this to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move)
instantly she steps in with a large commendation of Christ,
(though in few words) whereby, she doth so demonstrate him to
be an Object infinitly worthy to be her souls Beloved beyond all
others, that <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. 1. they as convinced yield, acknowledging
that her Beloved was preferable to all other beloveds, and that
therefore they are ingaged to love and seek him with her.</p>
                  <p>In this commendation, she, 1. asserts Christ's preferablenesse
in the general, <hi>vers.</hi> 10. 2. She confirmes and illustrates it in
particulars, to <hi>vers.</hi> 16. And then, 3. <hi>Vers.</hi> 16. sums it up in an
universal expression, as being in it's particulars inexpressible.
Lastly, Having fully proved her assertion, she resumes the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
as unanswerable, <hi>This</hi> (saith she) <hi>is my beloved,</hi> a singular be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
indeed, and therefore it's no wonder that I am so serious in
pursuing after him, and so sick of love to him, and so much pained
at the very heart for the want of him.</p>
                  <p>The first general in this 10. <hi>vers.</hi> sets out Christ positively, and
comparatively: Do you ask (saith she) what my Beloved is? he is
a non-such, an incomparable Beloved, <hi>he is white and ruddy,</hi> O so
lovely as he is in himself! and being compared with all others, he
hath the preheminence by far, as being <hi>the chiefest among ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands,</hi>
By <hi>white and ruddy,</hi> we are to conceive Christ's qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
according to the strain of the Allegory, there being no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
qualification set out here, Christ at that time not being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnat,
yet even then was he white and ruddy: The due and just
mixture of these colours maketh a man lovely, and evidenceth a
good complexion of body; so by them in Christ is understood a
concurrence of all fit qualifications and excellencies, that may
make him lovely to the soul, when by faith looked upon, and taken
up; there is sweet beauty and comelinesse, or a comely, beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
sweetnesse that lusters and shines in him, through the excellent
qualifications wherewith he is furnished, as the Husband of his
Church, that ravisheth spiritual affections far beyond the greatest
beauty that can be in the fairest face; for, indeed he is fairer than
the sons of men, There is nothing that may make a Mediator
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:65401:151"/>
lovely but it is here. Again, as if that did not fully set out his
amiablenesse, she adds, <hi>He is the chiefest among ten thousand:</hi> This
is a definite great number for an indefinite; In sum it's this,
there are many beloveds indeed in the world, but compare them
all with Christ, they are nothing to him, without all controversie
he is the chiefest, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 5, 6. For, <hi>though there be gods many,
and lords many</hi> (to the world) <hi>yet to us there is but one God, and
one Lord Iesus;</hi> in all the world there is but one Christ. The
word used here is, He is the <hi>standart-bearer,</hi> or it may be rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
passively, He is <hi>standarted</hi> above ten thousand; all tending to

                     </gap>ethorick in seeking words to
prefer Christ, as having indignation that his precedency and prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence
(who is <hi>above all things,</hi> Col. 1. 17.) should so much as
once be questioned: It's like, that in these times the most come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
persons were chosen to carry the standart, a piece of dignity
being thereby put upon them; So then, if all the most choice,
comely, and excellent persons in the world were mustered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Christ would be preferred eminently and deservedly above
them all. Whence, <hi>Observe,</hi> 1. That Christ is the most lovely
and excellent Object that men can set their eyes on, that they can
cast their love and affection upon: There is not such <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
                     </gap> one as
Christ, either for the spiritual soul-ravishing beauty that is in
him, or the excellent desirable effects that flow from him. O what
a singular description is it which follows, if it were understood
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>2. Christ is the most singularly excellent Husband that ever was
closed with: Under that relation he is commended here, as singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
lovely, and loving; It's a most honorable, comfortable,
happy, and every way satisfying match to have him for a Husband.
3. Christ's worth in it self is not expressible, and whatever he can
be compared with, he doth exceedingly surpasse it. 4. Where
right thoghts of Christ are, there is nothing admitted to compete
with him, other excellencies and beloveds are in their greatest
beauty darkned beside him; he is set up as chief, and they are not
to be taken notice of beside him, but to be accounted losse and
dung. 5. Christ's absence, when believers are right, will never
lessen their esteem of him, but even then believers will be warm
and fresh in their love to him, and high in their esteem of him.
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:65401:152"/>
6. Neither will the great mistakes of others, shake believers that
have a through esteem of Christ's worth, but will rather with holy
zeal awake them to commend him the more. 7. As where there
is true love to Christ, there Christ will be lovely; so when he is
looked on as lovely, that makes the heart to flow and abound
with holy rhethorick in commendations of him. 8. True love to
Christ, and to others for his sake, will not suffer one to despise
the weaknesse of another, but make them rather take occasion
from it, to honour him and edifie them so much the more, as the
Bride doth he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>e in answering the question proposed. 9. The
more neerly and fully any thing be compared with Christ, though
it be otherwise lovely, yet then it will be seen to be nothing, he
so infinitly excells all things he can be compared with; and it's
ignorance of him that makes other things get such a place in mens
affections: but, when once they are set for-against him, he is found
preferable, as incomparably chief, for dignity, riches, and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
or whatsoever is delightsome, desirable and truly
excellent, <hi>vers.</hi> 11, 12, 13. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>She passeth from the general, to demonstrat it in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
and therein she insists in the following verses. If it
should be asked, why she descends into particulars, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
now, considering her deserted case? I answer, for these
good reasons, 1. That she might the more fully demonstrat, and
the more satisfyingly unfold Christ's worth; For, his worth can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be soon nor easily told, nor conceived, nor soon believed by
others, it needs to be demonstrated, amplified and insisted upon;
yet, his worth can bide the tryal: There is no truth may more
fully and demonstratively be made out than this, that Christ is
a most excellent object of love, and infinitly preferable to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
2. This is for the edifying of the daughters of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>
and in reference to their question, that they might be the more
convinced and satisfied anent the incomparable worth and match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
excellency of her beloved, she brancheth it forth and insists
upon it, that so a deeper impression of it might be left upon their
hearts. <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. There is nothing more useful for the gaining and
edifying of others, than to help them to the right uptaking of
Christ's worth. 2. That is a great part of the work that should
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:65401:152"/>
take up Christians in their fellowship together, to be spending
their mutual conferences on that subject for one anothers instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
3. To edifie another, is no diversion from pursuing after
him, to souls that love Christ, and would be helped by others to
meet with him; This is well consistent with her pursuing after
sensible presence for her self, to stay a while instructing them. A
third reason of her insisting is, that it's suitable unto, and agrees
well with her own sad condition, when he is away, she loves to
think and speak of him, and of his lovelinesse, and that gives her
some ease. <hi>Obs.</hi> Where love to Christ is, there will be a delight
in speaking of him, and setting out his commendation, even when
he is absent; it's a kind of ease to tell over his qualifications
when he is absent. 2. It's a good diversion under a deserted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
and a suitable way to an outgate, to be dwelling rather
upon the excellency of Christ, than on the comfortlesse aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of our own sad condition; this is more honourable to Christ,
more edifying to others, and more pleasant to our selves: O, it's
sweet to think of him! It's more useful also for confirming of our
faith in him, for warming our affections to him, and for keeping
the mind stayed in dependence on him for the outgate: Every
attribute or property of his, is a cordial to a soul fainting under
a deserted case. 4. Her insisting on this subject, shews the nature
of true love to Christ, that a soul affected with it, being once en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
to speak of this theme or subject (namely the excellency
of Christ) it expatiats in it, and is not soon withdrawn from it:
This (to say so) is the very native element of it, and it doth the
heart good to enumerat, and tell over distinctly the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
qualifications and excellencies of Christ: all which (being
his own) are unspeakably delightsome and refreshing to reckon:
If there were any good measure of love to Christ in mens hearts,
they would not be easily withdrawn from meditating on him,
nor from speaking of him; and the great haunt that other things
have in our heart, and the rarity of any expression that tends to
Christ's commendation, shews plainly that there are (alace!) o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
beloveds abounding with us beside him.</p>
                  <p>In opening of the following particulars, we would consider,
1. The scope, which is to demonstrat, that Christ Jesus is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:65401:153"/>
lovely and desirable beyond all other things, that the
hearts of men are set upon; The question proposed, <hi>vers.</hi> 9. and
the closing answer to it, <hi>vers.</hi> 16. makes this clear. This then
being the scope, these particulars must be so taken up, as they best
contribute to clear this scope, and so must necessarily imply the
excellencies that are in Jesus Christ; The Mediator himself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as the body, and the several qualifications, properties and
excellencies wherewith he is furnished, being as the several mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
and parts of that body. Now, seing Jesus Christ is so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
himself, and these being instanced as the choice excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
that are in him, they must needs be exceeding and passing
excellent, as the aggreging and heightning of every commendation
doth shew: There will be need therefore of much sobriety, holy
admiration and reverence, in the opening of them, lest we spill
so excellent a subject as is the transcendent excellency of our Lord
Jesus Christ. 2. That the Spirit intends by these parts, distinct
considerations of Christ's lovelinesse in so many distinct particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
seems also to be without all question; for, the particular
enumeration is brought in to demonstrat this general, that he is
the chiefest among ten thousand, which is done (as it were) by
an induction of so many commendable things that are in him:
Beside in other Scriptures, and especially, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 13, 14. where
our Lord is thus considered, and also in the second and third
Chapter of that book of the Revelation, particular respect is had
to the foresaid description, and these parts are there (being
equivalent to them that are here mentioned) expounded of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
attributes and properties of his, and not unlike in many
things to the description following, as the particulars will clear.
Consider, 3. that it is both difficult and dangerous to be perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptory
in the application of these particulars to the object describ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
it being so exceeding glorious, and the Spirits expressions so
very comprehensive, we dar not so limit the words to one thing,
as if they were exclusive of another, nor say this is meant and no
other thing; although such and such things as have a necessary
connexion with the scope to confirm it, may warrantably be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
and for instances pitched upon, especially when from the
Analogy that is in the expressions which are borrowed, and from
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:65401:153"/>
other Scriptures, we have some ground to fix upon: but to be
sure, the words would be so taken up as they best afford the most
solid general doctrines, which are sometimes (because of our
darknesse, and to prevent our curiosity) to be rested in; for,
whatever be meant, it's Christ, and he by these commendations
is set forth as most excellent: That all these are to describe a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
person, and no humane body, we conceive so clear that it
needs no advertisement. 4. All these parts hold him forth, not
only as excellent in himself, but as lovely to his people, and as
making up their priviledge and happinesse in having an interest in
him to be theirs; and therefore as this is the scope, so it's to be
applyed as setting out his excellency, and the blessednesse of all
that have him for theirs; as on the contrary, to cry down all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loveds
of the world, of whom these things cannot be said, for
they are singularly peculiar to him.</p>

                     <q>His head is as the most fine Gold,
his locks are bushy, and black as a Raven.</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>There are ten parts mentioned, that are brought in as proofs
of Christ's singular excellency, each of them almost having a
double commendation: two of them are in the 11. verse. The
first is, <hi>his head,</hi> the most eminent part of the body; that fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth
influence and direction to all the rest: It may signfie (if
we dar adventure) these three in Christ, 1. His Godhead, which
is the most eminent nature of Christ's person, sustaining the other,
and furnishing it for it's offices; Thus, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 3 as <hi>the head of the
woman is the man,</hi> in respect of his dignity; so <hi>the head of Christ
is God,</hi> as the Godhead <hi>dwells in him bodily,</hi> Col. 2. 9. by a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
and unspeakable personal union, the like whereof is not to
be found in any other. 2. It may hold out Christ's headship, or
soveraignty which he hath as Mediator, being made head of <hi>the
body, the Church,</hi> and <hi>over all things for the Church,</hi> Eph. 1. 12.
and his instalment into this office, is the rise of all the other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations
that follow, which are as parts thereof: Thus <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chad-nezzars</hi>
                     <pb n="304" facs="tcp:65401:154"/>
soveraignity, as being a King of Kings, is set out
by a <hi>head of Gold,</hi> Dan. 2. 32, 38. 3. It may signifie the qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
wherewith he, as head to the body, is furnished for it's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hove
and good: So he is an excellent head, for contriving of
what is for the good of the body, and for furnishing life and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to all his members; Thus, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 16. he is <hi>the head, from
whom the whole body, being fitly compacted together, doth make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of it self in love:</hi> And to this purpose, a man of a great
reach and profound wit, useth to be called a <hi>great head.</hi> All these
agree with the scope, being instances of Christ's excellencies, and
also with the commendation following; yet, the first seems most
agreeable to the Analogy of head and members, and it is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
that Christ's Godhead is begun-at in his commendation;
surely it cannot be excluded, seing, in <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 14. by his head
(as there described) is set forth his eternity, the same nature
may well be here understood, though Christ be otherwayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
in the colour of his locks, because here he is described
as a lovely Bridegroom, there as coming to judge, as also in <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.
But it must be some excellent thing that is meant, as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
annexed cleares. His head is <hi>as the most fine Gold:</hi>
In the Original, there are two words indifferently made use of,
to signifie God, the first because of it's shining brightnesse and
beauty; The second is applyed to it, because of it's solidity and
firmnesse; so it runs, <hi>his head is Gold of Gold,</hi> or <hi>Gold and Gold,</hi>
or <hi>fine shining and solid Gold,</hi> as if Gold were not enough to set
out the excellency of this head: Gold is rich in the quality, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
and strong as to the efficacy, (as in <hi>chap.</hi> 3. 10.) soveraign as
to usefulnesse and profitablenesse; It's above other metals, and
so in the heavenly <hi>Ierusalem, the streets are said to be of pure Gold,
Rev.</hi> 21. 21. Therefore that dominion of <hi>Nebuchad-nezzars,</hi> spoken
of, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 32. is compared to a <hi>head of Gold,</hi> for it's excellency a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the rest that followed, and especially for the shelter that
the Church of God had under it: And this being <hi>Gold of Gold,</hi>
must hold forth such soveraignty, riches of grace, solidity and
happinesse, as is unsearchable; Gold cannot reach it, no not Gold
raised to the highest worth conceivable.</p>
                  <p>This first particular may put us to a stand, when (as it were)
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:65401:154"/>
the Bride is at a stand in the commendation, and must double the
word, <hi>as Gold, Gold,</hi> and it's hard to draw observations from it,
yet warrantably this may be said, 1. Christ hath a head (however
we take it) that is exceedingly excellent, he is God, and in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
is unsearchable, <hi>being the brightnesse of the Fathers glory,</hi> and
<hi>the expresse image of his person,</hi> Heb. 1. 3. He, as Mediator, is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
with soveraignty and eminent graces for the good of the
body; and these, as they are for their nature most solid and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
so as to their vertue they are most efficacious and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
2. If we take it in general, <hi>Obs.</hi> That the excellencies
wherewith Christ is furnished, are in the highest degree of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency;
Therefore it's Gold of Gold, what ever it be, and this
general will necessarily infer the former, that he is God and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator,
and in such and such offices furnished for the good of his
people, and the former doctrine is the proof of this: all Christ's
properties, wisdom, love, counsel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are of more than an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
depth, being in him to the very <hi>uttermost,</hi> Heb. 7. 25. and
<hi>without measure,</hi> Joh. 3. 34. 3. Christ's excellency is not only
lovely in it self, but useful to others; he is not only rich in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
but inriching these that possesse him, as Gold doth inrich
the owners of it: Christ is a golden possession where there is a
well grounded claim to him. 4. Gold and all external riches, are
empty things to a spiritual discerner of Christ's worth; as it were,
a new sort of Gold must be invented, or imagined, to shadow
forth the excellencies of Christ, Gold it self is but an insufficient
and dark shadow to represent him; who ever loves Gold, may
have (and that freely) the most fine and choice Gold in him.
Yea, 5. this is peculiar to him, in opposition to all other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loveds,
mens idols and other beloveds may be gilded, like the
<hi>whores cup,</hi> spoken of, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 4. but Christ only is the <hi>golden</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved;
for, this is so attributed to him, as it's denyed to them,
which are but <hi>clay,</hi> or <hi>thick clay</hi>-beloveds, Hab. 2. 6.</p>
                  <p>The second thing commended is <hi>his locks,</hi> which are no essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
part of the body, yet are (when lovely) a special decore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and ever have been so esteemed: The signification of locks
(being joyned to the head) will be so much the more clear if we
consider the commendation given them, which is threefold,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:65401:155"/>
1. <hi>They are bushie,</hi> or curled, not such as old men have, hairs
here and there, but his are bushie, thick and handsome, such as
young men in the flower and vigour of their youth use to have.
2. They are <hi>black;</hi> and that, 3. as <hi>a Raven:</hi> Black hair in these
times and places was comely in men, and betokens strength of
youth, and vigour of age, Therefore the same word which is here
blacknesse, signifieth youth also in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> as <hi>Eccles.</hi> 11. 10.
<hi>childehood</hi> and <hi>youth,</hi> &amp;c. So black hair here, is opposed to white
hairs, whereby decay is signified (as <hi>Hos.</hi> 7. 9. by <hi>gray hairs</hi> on
<hi>Ephraim,</hi> is understood) and thus all other idols gets a dash, as
if they were gray haired, decaying beloveds; but Christ is alwise in
youth and vigour, He continues alway vigorous, as his love is alway
green. They are compared to the blacknesse of <hi>a Raven,</hi> because
that is native black, and lovely beyond other things that are black.
As by Christ's <hi>head</hi> then was signified that which is in Christ (to
speak so) most intrinsickly excellent; So here, by <hi>locks</hi> we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the most extrinsick thing that is in him (if we may say any
thing of Christ is so) that is, if any thing seem lesse necessary than
another, yet is it in it self excellent, and serves to commend Christ
to others. And again, by <hi>bushinesse</hi> and <hi>blacknesse,</hi> we understand
the vigour and perfection of Christ's lovely and desirable excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies,
that as lovelinesse and desirablenesse are in a man, when in
his youth, at their height and perfection, so are they in Christ,
with all commendable aggravations, as in their very prime and
vigour. <hi>Gold</hi> did set forth the intrinsick worth of Christ's quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications,
this aggreges it so, that it lifts up that worth to the
highest pitch that is conceivable: As a lovely man is yet loveliest
in the flower of his age and youth, so it's with Christ, his perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are ever in their flower, and never decayes, nor does he ever
fail in the exercising of them for his peoples good, <hi>Isa. 42. 4. He
shall not fail nor be discouraged;</hi> and, as <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 12. Christ's eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
is holden forth by <hi>white hairs,</hi> so by <hi>black hairs</hi> is signified
his continuing young, vigorous and flourishing (to say so) through
all eternity; which serves much to the scope of commending
Christ; for, whatever is attributed to him, is in an implyed way
denied to all other beloveds: otherwise he were not the chiefest
among them, and preferable to them all, which is the scope.
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:65401:155"/>
                     <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. There is nothing for compleating Christ's beauty but it
is in him; yea, even these things in him, that are least taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of by us (though nothing in him be little in it self) they are
in themselves, and in their use when discerned, exceeding lovely;
his <hi>locks,</hi> yea, all his <hi>garments</hi> are so, <hi>Psa.</hi> 45. 8. There is nothing
superfluous, and uselesse in our blessed Bridegroom. 2. What
perfections are in Christ (as there are none wanting) they are in
him in their perfection: What unspeakable commendation is
here? 1. He hath infinite numbers of perfections. 2. All these
are rich, like the <hi>most fine Gold</hi> 3. If there be a season (to
speak so) wherein these perfections may be conceived more lovely
and shining than another (for in themselves they are ever the
same) they are so in our Lord Jesus Christ; It's ever Harvest,
Summer and Youth with him; he is that tree spoken of, <hi>Rev.</hi>
22. 2. which bears fruit alwayes; this Sun is ever at the height,
and never goes down: Christ's perfections are continuing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
he is a beloved that never decayes, that never waxeth
sick, weak nor old, but is ever in youth with his hair black, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he be eternal, and the Ancient of dayes, for all his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
are unchangably in him, and ever agree to him, even now
as well as in <hi>Solomon's</hi> time, and will do so for ever: This is
good and very comfortable to his people, Christ fits not up nor
fails, his Spouse weeps not for the death, decay, or waxing old
of her beloved and husband, which can be said of no other. 3. All
other beloveds beside Christ, are decaying beloveds, they evanish
and are growing gray-headed; even all this clay-world shall wax
<hi>old as doth a garment,</hi> and the beauty of it shall be stained, and
it will become weak, like an old dying harlot with whom many
hath gone a whoring; for, if this, to be black and bushy, be pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to Christ, it cannot agree to them, for, <hi>they shall wax old,</hi>
but <hi>he is the same,</hi> Psa. 102. 27. which words are peculiarly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
to Christ, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 10. 4. This continued flourishing of
Christ's excellency in it's perfection, doth put Christ superemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
above all compare, as having no match amongst all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loveds;
they decay, but he is the same; they are broken cisterns,
and can hold no water of comfort, and appear with no beauty at
death and judgement, and through eternity they will be as
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:65401:156"/>
cloaths worn and failed; but, Christ is fresh and vigorous at
death to the believer, and will be so for ever: How blessed are
they, when they come to eat of the tree of life that never wants
fruit, to possesse him who is <hi>yesterday, to day, and for ever</hi> the
same, <hi>God over all, blessed for evermore!</hi> O the happinesse! the
eternal happinesse, that there is in being espoused to Christ,
when the breath of all clay-idols and beloveds will be out, and
Christ still fresh in the communicating of his fulnesse to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple!
O what a sad heart will many have, who have forsaken this
fountain of living-waters, and chosen such broken cisterns to
themselves as the creatures are, that have set their heart on <hi>that
which is not.</hi> Prov. 23. 5. and <hi>laboured for the wind,</hi> Eccles. 5. 16.
loading themselves <hi>with thick clay,</hi> Hab. 2. 6. and have neglected
him who gave, and who continues the being of all things, and
who then will be, when they will not be found, or have a being!
In sum (saith she) my beloved is the <hi>golden beloved,</hi> others are
but of clay and earth; my beloved is in his flower, and youth;
other beloveds are decaying, waxing old, and drawing to their
grave, therefore is he incomparable beyond them all.</p>

                  <p>The third thing commended in him, is in <hi>vers.</hi> 12. and it is
<hi>his eyes,</hi> which are several wayes described: Eyes in the natural
body are the Organs, whereby we discern external objects; the
Lord as he is a Spirit, hath nobody, nor bodily members, but
eyes are attributed to him, to hold forth his Omniscience, who
having <hi>formed the eye, cannot but see,</hi> Psal. 94. 9. and therefore
eminently is said to see, in opposition to the idols, <hi>who have eyes
and see not,</hi> Psa. 151. 5. This then, sets out our Lords Omnisci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
before whom, <hi>all things are naked and open,</hi> Heb. 4. 3. even
the most secret things are open to his view, as if by the most
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:65401:156"/>
sharp-sighted bodily eye he did behold them, and much more;
So, <hi>Prov. 15. 3. The eyes of the Lord are in every place, beholding
the evil and the good:</hi> And, <hi>Prov. 5. 21. The wayes of man are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the eyes of the Lord,</hi> he knows them, as if he were looking on
them with eyes, all things are so naked and discernable to him:
This agrees also with that, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 18. where Christ is said to have
<hi>eyes as a flame of fire:</hi> which title, <hi>vers.</hi> 23. is expounded, (as all
these titles throughout these Epistles are) and said to be given
him, that men may know that he <hi>searcheth the heart,</hi> and <hi>tryeth the
reins,;</hi> even the most inward things are fully reached by his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing
eye.</p>
                  <p>The excellency of his eyes (or Omnisciency thereby pointed
out) is held forth under several similitudes, 1. They are <hi>as Doves
eyes,</hi> such as were attribute to the Bride, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. 1. that is, eyes
that are quick, lovely and loving, having much affection in them
to his own. 2. They are, as Doves eyes <hi>by the rivers of water,</hi>
where Doves are most lovely after their washing, or bathing and
beeking of themselves at river-sides. 3. They are washen <hi>with
milk,</hi> that is, most clean, white and pure. 4. They are <hi>fitly set,</hi>
or (as the word is) <hi>set in fulness,</hi> like the stones in <hi>Aarons</hi> breast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate,
<hi>Exod.</hi> 39. 10. (where the same word is) signifying that there
is no deformity in them, but like curious Jewels, they are most
equally and beautifully set, being neither too hollow, nor sticking
too far out, which are the two extream deformities in eyes. In
sum, it saith, 1. That Christ's knowledge is sharp and peircing.
2. Pure and clean. 3. Pleasant to his people to look on. And,
4. that it's kindly vented, and well qualified for the good of his
people, whereby he is made exceeding lovely to them. These
notes are sure here, 1. That our Lord Jesus is Omniscient, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all the designes of enemies, knowing all the straits and necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of his people, he actually takes notice of all these. 2. Christ's
Omniscience is one of his chiefest excellencies, that qualifies him
for the good and comfort of his people, and doth exceedingly
commend him to them above all others: It's a very present com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
to his people, especially in the time of trouble, that their

good for us, and what is designed to our prejudice by any of all
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:65401:157"/>
our adversaries, and cannot mistake. 3. Christ's Omniscience,
though it be terrible to his enemies (so his eyes are as a flame
of fire) yet it is very amiable to his people, his eyes to them are
as <hi>Doves eyes,</hi> his Al-seeing knowledge is kindly and comfortable,
and exercised for their good (as all his other attributes are) and
is still on work for their good and advantage, 2 <hi>Chron. 16. 9. His
eyes run to and fro throughout the earth, to shew himself strong in
the behalf of them, whose heart is perfect towards him:</hi> He takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of the case of his own, that he may succour them in their
wants, as he takes notice of his enemies, that he may disappoint
and bring them down. 4. When the eye of the Covenant with
Christ is once fastened, these attributes in him which are most
terrible to flesh, and to men in nature, are exceeding lovely, and
make Christ beautiful to his people, as his Omniscience, Justice,
Faithfulnesse, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 5. As it is our duty, so it's our advantage to
walk under the conviction of Christ's Omniscience, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
before him with the faith of his beholding what we are do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
6. It's a good evidence of sincerity, when his Omniscience
becomes delightsome to us, and when the heart is made glad
with this, that Christ knowes the secrets thereof, as <hi>Peter</hi> speaks,
<hi>John 21. 17. Thou that knowest all things, knowest that I love thee:</hi>
It's much to abide Christ's search, as Omniscient, contentedly.
7. All other idols and beloveds are blind, they have no eyes, or
though they seem to have, <hi>they see not,</hi> Psal. 115. 5. that is, they
can take no notice of, nor give any succour to, their worshippers:
Our Lord's eyes, that are upon his people, make him singularly
preferable to all that come in competition with him. 8. It is a
singular commendation of Christ's knowledge, that it is pure and
holy, that it cannot approve of sin, nor take any complacency in
it; for, his eyes are <hi>as Doves eyes, by the rivers of waters, washen
with milk: He is of purer eyes than that he can behold iniquity,</hi>
O how doth he delight in purity! and what a strong motive may
and ought this to be with his people, to make a covenant with
their eyes, that they get not leave to wander and gadd on sinfull
objects?</p>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>The fourth and fifth instances of Christ's lovelinesse, are in this
verse. The fourth is, that <hi>his cheeks are as a bed of Spices, as sweet
flowers:</hi> The cheeks being comely, are a special part of the love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse
of the face: His cheeks are here commended from two
things, first, they are <hi>as a bed of Spices,</hi> that is, like garden-beds
furnished with excellent smelling and refreshful Spices: It sets out
1. A proportionable hight of them, as cheeks are in the face, and
as beds are higher than the rest of the ground. 2. A precious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and sweetnesse of Spirit-refreshing savour, as such beds use
to yield to these who walk in a garden. The second commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is, <hi>as sweet flowers,</hi> or as the words may be read, <hi>as towers of
perfume:</hi> It tends to the same purpose, but holds forth an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of delight, to the spiritual sense of smelling in the believer,
when Christ is made the Object of it; O the sweet savour he finds
in him! It's fit to be sober here, these excellencies being myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries:
It's not unlike, that lesser glimpses of Christ's manifestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
whereby he makes himself known, may be understood here;
as if she said, he is so lovely, that the least glimpse or wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>e of him,
when it is seen, if it were but of his cheek, is very delightsome:
And this sense may be gathered, 1. From this, that the cheek is
a part of the face and countenance, yet not the full countenance;
now by seeing his face and beholding his countenance, often in
Scripture (and it's like also, <hi>vers.</hi> 15.) is understood his most sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
manifestations of himself to his people; by proportion then
the cheeks would hold forth the same, though in a lesser measur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>
and lower degree. 2. It makes well for the scope of commending
Christ above all, whose incomparable worth by his manifestations,
is much evidenced and confirmed to his people, and when a little
glimpse of him doth this, how much more would a full view of
him demonstrate it? and indeed such a view doth effectually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:65401:158"/>
it to these who have experimentally known the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
that is in him, although others who are unacquaint with his
face, do therefore undervalue him, which may be hinted at as a
cause of their so doing. 3. This agrees with the commendation,
which sets him forth in this as pleasant to the spiritual sense of
smelling, and so would imply, that it must be somewhat whereby
Christ becomes sensibly sweet and refreshful, as his sensible mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festations
make him more delightsome and refreshing to the souls
senses, than towers of perfume are to the bodily senses; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is his love compared to <hi>ointment, Chap.</hi> 1. 3. and else-where:
However, these things are certain, 1. That the least glimpse of
Christ's countenance is exceeding refreshful and savory to the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
senses. 2. That Christ's excellencies are delightsome to
all the spiritual senses, to the smell as well as to the eye, ear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
the whole soul, and all it's faculties have abundant matter in
him, for delighting and refreshing them all. 3. The moe senses
be exercised on Christ, and the more sensible (to speak so) he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
unto us, he will be the more lovely and pleasant; beds of
Spices, and towers of perfume in a garden, to them that lye
amongst them, are not so savory as Christ is, when the senses of
the soul are exercised to discern him.</p>
                  <p>The fifth thing instanced, is, <hi>his lips,</hi> The Brides lips were spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. 3, 11. and cleared to signifie her speech: By pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
they hold forth in him the lovelinesse of his Word, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he is especially lovely, in that he <hi>magnifies it above all his Name,
Psal.</hi> 138. 2. and makes it often sweet as the honey and the honey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb
to his people. This may be looked on, 1. as it respects
the matter spoken by him, out of whose mouth many <hi>gracious
words</hi> proceeded (while in the flesh) even to the admiration of
his hearers, <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 22. So that upon conviction they say, <hi>never
man spoke as this man speaks,</hi> Joh. 7. 46. Or, 2. It may look to
Christ's manner of speaking, and his fitnesse to communicate his
mind to his people, (as lips are the organs of speaking) so he hath
<hi>grace poured into his lips,</hi> Psal. 45. 2. that makes all his words
gracious, as being formed or anointed by it. Thus it takes in
that holy Art, skil and dexterity wherewith Christ is furnished,
to speak for the consolation of believer, especially under sad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises,
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:65401:158"/>
as it is, <hi>Isa. 50. 4. He hath the tongue of the learned, to
speak a word in season to him that is weary:</hi> Both these in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
come to one; and this being a special piece of Christ's love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse
to his people, conducing exceedingly to the Brides scope
here, and the Analogy being clear, and <hi>lips</hi> being frequently made
use of in Scripture to signifie speech or words, we conceive that
they may well be taken to here, especially considering, that all the
parts of the commendation will agree well to his words. 1. They
are <hi>like Lilies,</hi> that is, pleasant and savory; so words spoken in sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
are often called <hi>pleasant</hi> and <hi>sweet like honey,</hi> Prov. 16. 24.
yea, they are said to be <hi>like apples of gold in pictures of silver,</hi> Prov.
25. 11. His words then may well be compared to Lilies. 2. They
are not common words, therefore it must not be ordinary Lilies
that will set them forth, but they are like <hi>Lilies dropping sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smelling
Myrrhe:</hi> such Lilies we are not acquaint with, and nature,
though excellent in it's effects, yet comes short in furnishing fit
resemblances to represent Christ, and what is in him to the full:
These Lilies <hi>dropping Myrrhe,</hi> signifie, 1. A favorinesse and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial
efficacy in the matter, like Myrrhe proving comfortable to
these it falls or drops upon. 2. <hi>Dropping</hi> shews abundance, sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonablenesse,
and continuednesse therein, so as he still furnisheth
such strengthning efficacy and influence, as if it were ever drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
and never dryed up, as the phrase was, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. 11. All these
agree well, either to Christ the speaker, who never wants a seaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
word; or, to the word spoken, which in respect of it's
effects, endures for ever. This must be an excellent Beloved
(saith she) who speaks much, and never a word falls from his lips,
but it's precious and savory, like any cordial to the souls of his
people, especially in their fainting fits; and there is ever some
good word to be gotten from him, far from the rough speeches
that many uses, but O so pleasant and kindly as all his words are!
<hi>Obs.</hi> 1. There is a special lovelinesse in our Lord Jesus words to
his people; how much of this appears throughout the 4. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of this Song? and what love appears in all his promises? yea,
in the titles that he gives his people, every one is (as it were)
big with childe of strong consolation to them. 2. Christ's words
have a special refreshing efficacy in them, and can comfort, refresh
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:65401:159"/>
and sustain drooping sick souls; he sends out his Word and it
healeth them. 3. These who love Christ himself truly, have
also an high esteem of his Word, and are much delighted with
that; and where there is little esteem of his Word, there is but
little esteem of himself: They who have tasted the sweetnesse of
the Word, do highly esteem of Christ himself. 4. The word of
Christ is as Christ's own lips, and doth sweetly set out his thoughts
of love to sinners; It's good reading of Christ's lovelinesse out
of his own Word, and from his own mouth. 5. Where there
hath been a sweetnesse felt in the Word, it should be turned
over to the commendation of Christ that spoke it, as a proof of
the reality of his excellent worth. 6. The Word is never right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
made use of, though it should fill the head with knowledge,
till it be savory to the inward man and spiritual senses; and it's
that which makes it lovely, when the vertue and consolation
that flowes from it is felt. 7. All the consolations of the Word,
they come not out at once, neither can we so receive them, but
it drops by little and little in continuance; and therefore daily
should men draw from these wells of Salvation. 8. Observe from
the scope, that Christ's Word known by experience, will lift and
set Christ up in the heart beyond all beloveds; and that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquaintednesse
of many with Christ's lips, and the consolations
that abound in his Word, makes them so ready to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>light him, and
set up their idols above him. The scope saith further, that she
was acquaint with his words, and the refreshfulnesse of them, and
in this she is differenced from others. Whence, <hi>Observe.</hi> 9. that
believers are acquaint with the sweetness of Christ's Words, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
than any in the world are; Christ is another thing to them,
and his Word is so also, than to all the world beside: It's a good
sign, where Christ's lips are so lovely.</p>

                  <p>The sixth and seventh particulars instanced to commend Christ,
are in <hi>vers.</hi> 14. The sixth is, <hi>his hands:</hi> The hands are the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
of action, as the lips are of speaking: They are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended,
that they are as <hi>Gold-rings,</hi> that is, as men or womens
hands are adorned with Gold-rings, so his hands have a native
lovelinesse beyond these: yet, this commendation (as all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer)
answers not fully, therefore it's added, they are <hi>set with
Beryl:</hi> This was a precious stone put in <hi>Aaron's</hi> breast-plate,
<hi>Exod.</hi> 39. 13. To be <hi>set</hi> with it, signifies, as preciousnesse, so
rare artifice, and such is seen in the right setting of precious
stones. By our Lord's <hi>hands,</hi> may be understood that powerfull
activity whereby he is fitted to bring about what he pleaseth, and
that power which he exerciseth especially in the works of grace,
as on <hi>vers.</hi> 4. was cleared: Or, we may understand the effects
produced by that his power, or his works which are exceeding
glorious, as, <hi>Psal. 109. 27. That they may know, O Lord, that this
is thy hand,</hi> that is, <hi>that thou Lord hast done it:</hi> So his hands sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
such works especially wherein his Divine power, art and skill
doth manifest themselves for the good of his people: Both agree
well together; for, excellent power and skill produce excellent
effects, and excellent effects demonstrat the excellent qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the worker; this being a main piece of Christ's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation,
and which doth hold him forth to be exceeding love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
above all to the believer (which is the scope) may well be
taken here as the meaning, especially being subjoined to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
of his words; for, our Lord Jesus doth not only say
well, but also doth well: he is a <hi>prophet, mighty both in word and
deed,</hi> Luk. 24. 19.</p>
                  <p>The commendation suits with his works, as if there were none
of them, but what are adorned (as it were) with excellent Gold-rings,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:65401:160"/>
there being much glory, grace, wisdom and skill shining in
them all, they are <hi>honourable and glorious,</hi> Psal. 111. 3. Yea, <hi>great
and marvelous are the works of the Lord God Almighty,</hi> Rev. 15. 4.
These are the deserved epithets of his actions: In sum, it is, as if
she had said, Ask ye what my beloved is, more than others? If
ye saw but a glimpse of the white and red that is in his cheeks,
and if ye heard the sweet words that proceed from his mouth,
and if ye knew the excellent works which he hath performed, even
to admiration, for the good of his people, and how much loveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
appears in all these, ye would (no doubt) say with me, <hi>He
is the chiefest among ten thousand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. Christ is an active husband, having hands, and working
with them for the good of his Bride: A piece of his work we
heard of, <hi>chap.</hi> 3. 9. in that noble Chariot: He is no idle specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor;
he <hi>worketh hitherto,</hi> Joh. 5. 17. 2. All our Lord Jesus his
works, are exceeding excellent and beautiful, and when rightly
discerned, they will appear wonderful, honourable and glorious,
as proceeding from him <hi>who is wonderful in counsel,</hi> and <hi>excellent
in working,</hi> Isa. 28. 29. What a curious and excellent piece of
work is that Chariot, or the Covenant of Redemption signified
thereby, <hi>chap.</hi> 3. 9? There are many shining well-set Jewels, and
Rings upon every finger of his hands: There is nothing that can
be done better than what he hath done. The works of Christ in
our redemption, do hold forth infinit skill, and gloriousnesse to
be in the worker, all of them are so wisely contrived, and exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitly
execute. 3. Christ's works do exceedingly endear him, and
that deservedly to his people, and do infallibly demonstrate his
worth above all beloveds in the world; Who is like unto him?
and who can do great works, such as he hath done? This makes
heaven to resound with the praises of what this beloved hath
done for his people. 4. Believers would be acquaint both with
Christ's words and his works, and would be well vers'd in the
knowledge of the excellencies that are in them both, that so they
may be the more affected with him themselves, and be more able
to commend him to others. 5. Where Christ is lovely, all his
works will be delightsome: and it's by acquaintance with, and
observation of, his excellent works, that the hearts of his people
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:65401:160"/>
come to take him up, and to be rightly affected with him. 6. As ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
of the excellency of Christ's works (especially of the work
of Redemption) makes many slight Christ, and prefer others to
him (for, she would discover the daughters of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> their
mistake of him, by instancing this amongst other things) so it's a
kindly-like thing, to have a honourable esteem of Christ's works
in the heart. 7. Although the devil and mens idols seem to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
much to their lovers, when they suit and intice them; yet
never one indeed can equal Christ, or compare with him, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of what he hath done for his Bride; and this sets him up
incomparably above them all: His hands, in respect of his mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent
works, are adorned, as it were, with Gold-rings; whereas
<hi>they have hands, but work not</hi> for the help and relief of their
lovers, <hi>Psa.</hi> 115. 7.</p>
                  <p>The seventh part of this demonstration of Christs worth, is
from his <hi>belly:</hi> The word in the Original is the same word,
which, <hi>vers.</hi> 4. is rendered <hi>bowels,</hi> and we rather use it so here as it
signifieth <hi>bowels,</hi> the native signification of it, as not knowing why
it should be altered in this verse; especially considering, that
wherever it is attributed to God, it's translated <hi>bowels,</hi> as,
<hi>Isa. 63. 15. where is the sounding of thy bowels?</hi> and, <hi>Ier.</hi> 31. 20.
<hi>my bowels are moved for him:</hi> Reading it then thus, <hi>his bowels
are as bright ivory,</hi> &amp;c. The words at the very first, would seem
to signifie the intense love and tender affection, wherewith our
Lord Jesus (who is full of grace) is filled and stuffed (to say so)
for the behove and good of his people, so that no mother is so
compassionatly affected towards the fruit of her womb, as he is
toward his own. This exposition is, 1. confirmed from the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
signification of the word <hi>bowels,</hi> when it is applyed to
God, as, <hi>Isa.</hi> 63. 15. and, <hi>Ier.</hi> 31. 20. and it is borrowed from
the affection that mothers have to their children, whose bowels
yerns on them, as, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 3. 26. and so <hi>Ioseph</hi> was affected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
his brethren, <hi>Gen.</hi> 43. 30. Hence the word, both in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
and Greek, in the Old and New Testament, which is made
use of to set forth the Lords tender compassion, flowes from a
root that signifieth bowels. 2. The scope will confirm this: for,
is there any thing that makes Christ more lovely and admirable
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:65401:161"/>
than his love? which makes the Prophet cry out, <hi>Mic. 7. 18. who
is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>because thou
delights in mercy;</hi> or, is there any other thing that more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
him as a beloved preferable to all, than his love? Love
in a husband is a special property. Now <hi>Christ loved his Church,
and gave himself for it,</hi> Eph. 5. 25. it is not like therefore, that
this is omitted: And, 3. it followes well on the commendation
of his works for, and about, his people, as shewing the fountain
from whence they proceed; The commendation of this is excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.
1. It is as <hi>bright Ivory: Ivory</hi> is rarely and singularly pure
and pleasant, being made of <hi>Elephants</hi> teeth: <hi>bright,</hi> is added,
to shew, that it's of the best sort, as all that is in Christ is. 2. It's
<hi>overlaid with Saphires;</hi> that was a stone in <hi>Aarons</hi> breast plate, and
also is reckoned one of the foundation-stones of the <hi>new Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
Rev. 21. 19. which shews, that it is very precious, though
we know not the particular properties of it: The word <hi>overlaid,</hi>
may be from the Original rendered <hi>curiously set,</hi> or, <hi>enambled:</hi>
In sum, here, his love is described as most lovely, clean and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant,
like Ivory; rich and precious like Saphires; and well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
and wisely vented for the good of his people, as bright
Ivory curiously enambled with Saphires: His love is a most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent,
curious and pleasant object, the like whereof is not to
be found amongst all the beloveds of the world. This verse com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
Christ's heart and in-side, which is unsearchable as to it's
heighth, depth, breadth, and length: It may therefore be hard,
and some way hazardous to offer doctrines on, or to form expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
concerning, that <hi>which passeth knowledge,</hi> Eph. 3. 18, 19. the
comprehending experimental knowledge of it, will be the best
commentary on it; yet these things are clear and safe,</p>
                  <p>1. There is singular love, affection and bowels in our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
to his people; so singular, that there is none can compare
with him in this, no husband, nay nor wife, it passeth the love of
women; No tender-hearted mother, and much lesse any idol can
compet with him in this; It's inconceivable in it self, and it's
wonderful in it's effects. 2. There is nothing that will contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
more to make believers see Jesus Christ as admirable in
himself, and lovely to them, than the right apprehension of his
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:65401:161"/>
love: This is the constraining, ravishing, ingaging, and soul-in-ebriating
consideration of Christ, the conceiving of him rightly in
his admirable love; and they will never esteem of Christ rightly,
who discerns not that, it is (as it were) his crown; and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
of it, is in a sort the putting of the crown on his head:
Amongst all his excellencies, none takes the believer more up than
his love, and nothing is more remarkable in him than that, and
right thoughts of Christ's love is no ill token. 3. Our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
his love and bowels are a rich Jewel when seen, a precious
stately sight; bright Ivory overlaid with Saphires is but a small
and dark shaddow of it; Christ's love is a possession beyond Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els,
a very beautiful object to look on, beyond the most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
creature: It's both a wonder and a heart-break that it is so
little thought of, and that men are not more delighted in it.</p>
                  <p>4. Although there be much in many mouths of Christ's love, yet
there are few that really knows and believes the love that he hath
to his people, 1 <hi>Ioh</hi> 3. 1. As this is the cause that so few loves him,
and why so many sets up other beloveds beside him; so, the solid
faith of this, and the expectation of good from him, hath a great
ingaging vertue to draw sinners to him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6. and for that
end it's made use of here. 5. Whatever seeming smiles, idols may
give to their lovers, yet will they not prove lovers in the end to
them; for, that is proper to Christ, he only hath strong love and bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els
of affection to his own to the end, but other lovers in the end
will fail men, Only our Lord Jesus continueth a loving Husband
to the end; for, whom he loves, he loves to the end. 6. It is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
all peradventure, good and desirable to be matched with Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, where so much honour, riches, power, wisdom, loveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and love meet all together; for, the scope of this, and of all
the rest of the commendations, is to ingage sinners to match with
him. 7. There is no cause to be jealous of Christ's love, his
people have a most loving Husband, and never a sport or ground
of jealousie hath defiled his bowels since the world began, but
they to this day are, and will be for ever <hi>as bright Ivory.</hi> 8. Christ's
love is excellent in it self, and is also excellent in the way of it's
communicating it self to his people; therefore it's not as Saphires
that are confusedly casten together, but that are artificially set;
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:65401:162"/>
or, our Lord Jesus vents not his love fondly (to speak with reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence)
or imprudently, but most wisely, skilfully, and seasonably,
so as it may be for the good of his people; not as a fond and too
indulgent mother, that gives that which is even hurtful because
the childe desires it, but as a wise father who gives that which is
useful, though it be unpleasant: He guids his love by discretion,
and according to expediency, as <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16. 7. It's <hi>expedient for you
that I go,</hi> and therefore he will <hi>go,</hi> though they were even made
sad with it. 9. Although some pieces of Christ's love, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
in themselves, seem not so pleasant and lovely, like preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
stones not rightly set, yet when all are seen together, and
every thing taken up as in it's own place, and proportionably
corresponding with one another, and especially in respect of the
fountain of love from which they come, they will then (being all
lookt on together) be seen to be very beautiful and pleasant and
well ordered, like <hi>bright Ivory,</hi> that is regularly and curiously
enambled, or indented with <hi>Saphires:</hi> The time comes, when
Christ's love will be thought to be exquisitly and wisely let out
and conveyed, even in these things wherein it is most suspected
now by his own.</p>

                  <p>The eighth and ninth particulars of Christ's commendation,
are in <hi>vers.</hi> 15. The first of them here commended is <hi>his legs:</hi>
The word <hi>legs,</hi> comes from a root in the Original, that signifieth
to walk; and so takes in things and feet, which are also useful in
motion. In Scripture, and by Analogy, they are made use of to
signifie these two, 1. A mans way in the series of his carriage and
deportment, as ordinarily his life is called a walk: So, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 5. 1.
<hi>Take heed unto thy feet,</hi> that is, to thy carriage; Hence the <hi>ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:65401:162"/>
of the heels</hi> are spoken of, <hi>Psal.</hi> 49. 5. to set out mens
defects, that cleave to them in their conversation, as their feet
leave prints or footsteps behind them in their walking. 2. This
metaphor signifieth strength and activity, as <hi>Psal. 147. 10. The
Lord delights not in the strength of an horse, nor in the legs of a
man;</hi> wherefore (very probably) <hi>Eccles.</hi> 12. 3. they are called
<hi>the strong men,</hi> because they sustain or bear up the body: Here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
applyed to Christ, we conceive they signifie his way, or admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration
of providence, which he useth with his people, it being
by his dispensations that he walks amongst them. Hence the series
of common providence is so often in Scripture called the way of
the Lord, as <hi>Ezek. 18. 25. The Lords way is equal,</hi> his carriage in
his dispensations is still just, opposite to their way, or walk, which
is there called unequal: And the dispensation of grace is called
a way, <hi>Rom. 11. 33. How unsearchable are his judgements, and his
wayes past finding out;</hi> which take-in the contrivance, and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration
of his grace, as the scope there doth clear. His way is
more general and comprehensive than his works, and takes-in these
three (for which it is called a way.) 1. His design and end, that
he proposeth to himself. 2. His wise and powerful plot in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving
and applying means suitable thereunto, for bringing it
about, especially the principle (to say so) by which he walks and
works, to wit, hs wisdom, power and love. 3. His convoy of,
and the progresse which he makes in, these, by which he is ever
proceeding towards his end, as a man doth in his way by walking
with his legs: In all these respects, the Lords way of carrying on
his design is said to be unsearchable: This we take as intended
here, to set forth and commend the gracious and glorious steps
of the Lord, in the administration of his grace, both in it's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance
and application amongst his people, whereby his wisdom,
power and goodnesse, are in these paths of his (that are <hi>all mercy
and truth</hi> to his own, <hi>Psal.</hi> 25. 10.) made exceeding lovely and
stately, as the commendation following imports. This is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
1. by the Analogy that is betwixt the legs and walking,
and the frequent use that the Scripture makes of this similitude
for that end, and no other thing can suit so well. 2. In <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 18.
Where Christ's <hi>legs</hi> and <hi>feet</hi> are spoken of, with a commendation
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:65401:163"/>
not unlike what follows here, namely, that they are <hi>like fine brass,</hi>
as his eyes are expounded, <hi>vers.</hi> 23. by this, that <hi>he searcheth the
heart, and tryeth the reins;</hi> so his feet are set out by this, <hi>that he
renders to every one according to their works,</hi> that is, he keeps an
equal and just way in his administration towards every one. 3. The
scope likewise confirms this, Christ being by his way to his people
commendable above all, and this being a special commendation
of his, that <hi>all his works are perfect, and all his wayes are judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
Deut. 32. 4. As also the property attributed to his legs,
and from which they are commended, will clear this, which is, that
they <hi>are like pillars of Marble:</hi> Marble is a stone that is firm,
good and pleasant, therefore was it prepared by <hi>David,</hi> for the
Temple, 1 <hi>Chron. 29. 2. Pillars</hi> signifie strength, orderlinesse and
beauty, as was cleared on <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 10. which may be applyed here:
So pillars of Marble say, that his wayes are curiously, skilfully
and sickerly contrived; and wisely, dexterously and infallibly exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted,
and firmly settled like pillars, and that of Marble, for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveablenesse:
The amplification of the commendation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms
this also, they are not only like pillars of Marble, but also like
pillars <hi>set on sockets of fine Gold;</hi> pillars are durable, according
to the bases or foundation upon which they are set and founded,
Now Gold (as often hath been said) signifieth preciousnesse and
solidity, so all of them are setled and fixed on a good and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ground, which cannot fail, and therefore they cannot shake,
slide, nor slip, but prosper he must in his wayes, and nothing can
mar his design, <hi>for he is of one mind, and who can turn him? and
what his soul desireth, that he doth,</hi> Job 23. 13. Yet not only are
his feet or legs of brasse, (which shews severity against enemies, in
his troding on them, <hi>Dan.</hi> 10. 6.) but the sockets are of Gold, as
his head was, <hi>vers.</hi> 11. all is of Gold that is in him, he is a golden
Mediator and Beloved from head to foot, whereas others are clay-beloveds:
The sockets are of Gold, to shew his graciousnesse to
his people, as <hi>Psalm 25. 10. all his wayes</hi> are setled on <hi>mercy and
truth,</hi> all his decrees anent them are made lovely and sure by
grace, and so cannot be but precious and excellent as to them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Observ.</hi> 1. Our Lord Jesus hath a design, a gracious design, that
he is carrying on amongst his people, and he is ever promoving
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:65401:163"/>
therein for the end which he hath proposed; he is not like the
idols of the Gentiles, <hi>Psal. 115. 7. which have feet and walk not,</hi>
but as he sees with his eyes, and works with his hands, so doth
he walk and make progresse with his legs. 2. Christ's way with
his people, is a most excellent and stately way; or, in all his convoy
of grace towards his people, there is a special excellency shining;
<hi>All his ways and works are holy and righteous,</hi> Psal. 145. 17. <hi>Iust
and true,</hi> Rev. 15. 3. Gracious and loving, even <hi>all mercy and
truth,</hi> Psal. 25. 10. This King of Saints is marvelous in his way
of grace, as he is in all his works. 3. Christ's purpose cannot
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ail, neither can his design be altered, the contrivance thereof is
so wise, and the execution so powerful, he cannot but attain his
point. 4. However men may quarrel with Christ's way, and say
it's <hi>not equal,</hi> as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 25. And although his way may be
sometimes <hi>in the deep waters,</hi> and not discernable, <hi>Psal.</hi> 77. 19.
yet, it is ever ordered in deep wisdom, that there can be nothing
more just, holy and glorious, so that there is no reason to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
thereof; and this holds, not only in one step or two, but in
the whole series of his way. 5. A right sight of Christ's wise,
glorious and Omnipotent way of grace, will make him singular
in the estimation of his people, and put him above all other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loveds,
whose ways are neither for wisdom, nor stability, any
way comparable to his; for, all the counsels and designs of the
world beside his, will come to nought, and be made, nill they
will they, subservient to his: clay-idols have their breath in their
nostrils, and in that same very day <hi>when it goeth out, their thoughts
perish,</hi> Psal. 146. 4. but it is not so with his, they are more so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidly
founded, and these strong legs, that are of Marble, can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be bowed nor broken: It must then be most sure and safe for
the Lord's people to drive this as their design, to side and share
with Christ in his designs; and it must be a most desperat thing to
drive contrary designs to him, whose <hi>legs are as pillars of Marble,</hi>
and before whom none can stand. 6. Where there is respect to
Christ, there will be an high estimation of his way; and it's a
good sign of an especial esteem of Christ, when his ways are admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and loved.</p>
                  <p>The ninth particular instance, brought to prove that he is the
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:65401:164"/>
chiefest among ten thousand, is, that <hi>his countenance is like Leba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non:</hi>
The word <hi>countenance,</hi> as it is in the Original, comes from
a root that signifieth to see, therefore <hi>countenance</hi> is used in
Scripture, not only to signifie the face, but the whole stature and
presentation of a person, or that which gives a full sight of one in
all his parts together; and so it's here, and differs from the cheeks
mentioned, <hi>vers.</hi> 13. as being more extensive and comprehensive:
Therefore that phrase, which, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 21. is rendered <hi>a goodly
man,</hi> or <hi>man of countenance</hi> (as it's in the Original) is, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi>
11. 23. (where that same story is recorded) expressed by this,
that the <hi>Egyptian</hi> was <hi>a man of stature,</hi> as if it were said, a brave
personage of a man, and so it takes-in face, legs, body and altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
when all these are so proportioned, as they make one, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
goodly to be seen and lookt on: Now this being applyed to
Christ, as subjoyned to the particulars formerly mentioned, we
conceive it takes-in his matchless stateliness, as it results from all
his properties together, so that not only this or that part of Christ
is lovely, but whole Christ, when seen, is exceeding stately and love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the view and faith of a discerning believer, whatever others
think of him; So then, the meaning is, ask ye what my Beloved is?
(saith she) as all his parts are beautiful severally considered, so
all being put together, he is a most stately and lovely Object to
behold, when he gives a full view of his countenance. It sets out
then, a more full view of Christ, or Christ in a more full view, as
if not only a mans head or legs were seen, but his whole stature,
whereby he is more fully discernable: Thus Christ's countenance
in Scripture, is put to signifie his manifestations to his people;
and here being subjoyned to the cheeks, as more extensive, it
signifieth more full manifestations, whereby a view (as it were)
of whole Christ is attained at once by the believers faith, as <hi>by
faith,</hi> Heb. 11. 27. <hi>Moses</hi> is said to have <hi>seen him that is invisible:</hi>
And this will agree well with the scope, and the commendation
following, which is in two things, 1. It is <hi>as Lebanon,</hi> a most plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant,
stately hill, and therefore that which is excellent, is often
compared to it, as was said on <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. 8. 11. 15. 2. It's ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
that it is <hi>excellent as the Cedars:</hi> They were useful, stately
and tal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap> trees, especially these that grew in <hi>Lebanon;</hi> The word is,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:65401:164"/>
                     <hi>elect,</hi> or <hi>choice as the Cedars,</hi> which agrees well with a goodly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation,
to be tal, straight and stately, as they were: Therefore
the Brides stature is compared to a <hi>palm-tree, Chap.</hi> 7. 7. In a
word, my Beloved (when seen) looks excellently and passing-well
(saith she) so as there is no other Beloved in the world that hath
such an aspect as he; who can look on him and not love him?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Observ.</hi> 1. Although there is no fully comprehensive view of
Christ to be gotten here, even by the faith of a believer (while
we are upon the earth we cannot see him as he is, that being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
for heaven) yet there are more full up-takings of him at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable,
even here-away, than ordinarily believers meet with;
yea, such full views of him are to be had, which in respect of our
other ordinary attainments may be called a beholding of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
whereas these are but a beholding of his cheeks, for he
hath a countenance which is discernable: neither doth the Bride
speak of that she never saw, but of what she hath seen; and it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
a more full, near, thorow and distinct <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ight of him than is
usual. 2. There is no such lovely, delightsome, spiritually gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant,
stately and glorious Object, as our Lord Jesus, complexly
considered as in himself; and there will be no sight more satisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to a believer than this, when admitted to behold it. 3. All
other beloveds, whatever they be in themselves, are yet exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly,
nay infinitly short of him when he is seen; this differenceth
him from them all, the more and the better other beloveds be
seen, they are found to be the more fecklesse, insignificant and
little worth; but the more full view be gotten of Christ, he is
found to be the more excellent. 4. Slight and passing views of
Christ, makes men think the lesse of him, whereas more full, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
and near beholding of him, doth highten the esteem of him,
and lessen the esteem of all others beside him. 5. Faith in Christ
will make a real impression of him, and of his excellency upon
the heart of a believer<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> even as if he had been seen by sense: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
she speaks so of his countenance; and it's a good sign, to be
distinct and confident in our apprehensions of Christ's excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>

                  <p>The tenth and last particular commended in him, is in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the 16. <hi>vers.</hi> and it is <hi>his mouth,</hi> which is compared to
<hi>sweetnesse,</hi> or <hi>sweetnesses</hi> in the plural number. By <hi>mouth</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
is understood the words of the mouth, but it's not so used
in this Song: The Brides words, and his also are set out by their
lips, and it's not like, that that being spoken of, <hi>vers.</hi> 13. is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
here. Again, the <hi>mouth,</hi> and it's <hi>sweetnesse</hi> especially,
may be mentioned to signifie friendlinesse and love, or rather the
sensible manifestations of these, as the husband doth by kissing his
wife; and in this sense is taken, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 2. and we take that to be
aimed at here, to wit, the sweetnesse of Christ's more immediat
manifestations of himself unto the spiritual sense of his people, by
<hi>shedding the love of God abroad in their hearts, by the Holy Ghost,
Rom.</hi> 5. 5. For, this sensible manifestation of his love, is a thing
that much commends him to his people, and is their satisfaction,
in opposition to all the creature-satisfactions that others have,
<hi>Psalm<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
                     </hi> 4. 6, 7. therefore it agrees well with the scope. Again, it's
a different commendation from any that is mentioned, 1. It dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
from his <hi>lips,</hi> or the comfort that one hath from the Word,
as from the Word (though it is not to be separate from that,
but to carry that alongst with it) yet this is more immediat and
sensible, and that is mediate, though real and sure unto <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>aith.
2. It differs from seeing <hi>his cheeks,</hi> in that this is more full, near
and immediate also, she being, as it were, admitted to enjoy
Christ's sweet embracements. 3. It differs from <hi>beholding his
countenance,</hi> because that may be, and only can be taken up by
faith, beholding him in his excellent qualifications and offices;
but this is discernable to the believers spiritual sense, when Christ
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:65401:165"/>
applyeth his love, as <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 2. In which (to say so) we are more
passive, as being fed by him, and having it infused and shed abroad
in our hearts by the Spirit. If we may in a holy way follow the
similitude in a spiritual sense (which is necessary for understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the thing) <hi>kisses of his mouth,</hi> are his applying and venting
of his love, as one doth by kissing another; this also will agree
with the commendation, it's <hi>most sweet,</hi> it's but one word in the
Original, in the abstract, and that in the plural number, <hi>sweetnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
to shew the exceeding sweetnesse and lovelinesse, the soul-ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishing
delight that is in that, to which no similitude or compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
can come up, clearly and perfectly to resemble it, it is very
sweetnesse it self. If we might allude to what Philosophers say of
fire in it's element, or water in it's element, that being there, they
are more properly and eminently fire and water; so sweetnesse is
in it's element here; or, Christ's mouth is the very element
thereof, in respect of it's sensible refreshfulnesse to the spiritual
senses of his people, to whom he manifests it. Ask ye then what
my Beloved is? (saith she) he is indeed stately to look on, but his
mouth when it's felt in his kissing of his own Bride, by manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his love to her sense, there, there, O there, exceeding unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressible
and unconceivable delight and satisfaction is to be found!</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Observ.</hi> 1. Christ hath more near and sensible ways of mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festing
himself to the spiritual sense of his people, as if he had a
<hi>mouth</hi> to kisse them. 2. There is nothing comparable to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing
sweetnesse, that these manifestations have with them; It's
a <hi>peace that passeth understanding,</hi> Phil. 4. 7. and <hi>a joy that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable
and full of glory,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 8. 3. This sensible feeling of
the sweetnesse of Christ's mouth, should be ai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ed at, and sought
after by believers, although the manner, measure, time, and other
circumstances thereof should be submitted to him, yet this is not
only commendable in it self, but also as such, is proposed and
commended to the daughters of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> to be sought after
by them. 4. The experimental feeling of this, doth notably
demonstrate Christ's worth to the soul that enjoyes it, and makes
him incomparably sweet and lovely above all things whatsoever,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 4. 7. 5. There is no other thing can have any such sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
or relish to a believer as Christ hath; and to a spiritual
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:65401:166"/>
taste, the excellency of all created beloveds will be as the white
of an egg in comparison of this. Only Christ's mouth is sweetness;
and so he differs from all others: And it's a good sign, when our
affections, or spiritual senses, can relish nothing but Christ.</p>
                  <p>Next, it is added; yea, <hi>he is altogether lovely:</hi> Although she
hath spent many sweet words (and indeed there hath been no
straitning in her) in commending Christ, and although all her
words be sweet, and especially when she drawes near the close, her
expressions be the more massy and significant, yet as being neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitate
to succumb under the great task of describing the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of her Beloved, she must give over particulars, and conclude
with a general, as if she would say, would ye know him? O, I, even
I cannot tell you all his excellent properties; for, he is most justly
called <hi>wonderful,</hi> Isa. 9. 6. but in sum, I may say, <hi>he is altogether
lovely:</hi> The word is, <hi>he is all desires,</hi> or, <hi>all he desires:</hi> The word
that is rendered lovely, comes from a root that signifieth to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet,
as in <hi>Ioshua</hi> 7. 21. It is said of <hi>Achan,</hi> when he saw the <hi>wedge
of gold,</hi> that he <hi>coveted</hi> it, so it's such a desire as ardently covets
the thing desired: And thus Christ is not simply lovely, but of
such an attractive excellency, as makes him the proper Object of
the most ardent and holy-cove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ing desires, or after which all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
should go forth, as towards the best and most desirable Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject:
The words are mean to expresse somewhat that is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressible,
or rather the unexpressiblenesse of that Beloved she had
been commending, lest they should think she were satisfied, as if
she had fully described him. We may consider the words several
wayes, 1. Negatively, as they shew there is nothing in him, but
what is desirable: As if she said, <hi>all he is desires,</hi> there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of any other nature in him, but such as I have mentioned,
he is a <hi>God of truth, and without iniquity, just and right is he.</hi>
2. Take them positively, and so they shew whatever is in him, is
exceeding desirable; go through all his parts, qualifications, attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
and works, whereof I have given you but a hint (saith she)
and ye will see them all exceedingly desirable. 3. Take them
conclusively or comprehensively, and so while she saith, <hi>he is all
desires,</hi> the meaning is, there is nothing truly desirable, but it is
to be found in him, the soul cannot rationally imagine that satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:65401:166"/>
that is not to be found in Christ, otherwise all desires were
not in him; this is sweet, even very<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>sweet, what idol is perfect?
there are many defects in all other beloveds, but (saith she) my
Beloved is perfect: All the beauties and perfections that are scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
amongst all creatures, are in an eminent and transcendent
way gathered together, contracted and to be found in him at once,
so that whatever can be desired, whether it be for this life, or
that which is to come, whether for sanctification, justification, or
consolation, it's eminently to be found in our Lord Jesus, in
<hi>whom all fulnesse dwells,</hi> Col. 1. 19. and who alone <hi>is all and in all</hi>
to his own, as being <hi>full of grace and truth,</hi> Joh. 1. 14. 4. We
may take them exclusively, or privatively, as they deny any thing
desirable to be in any beloved, but in Christ, he is all, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
they must be nothing, he is altogether lovely, and so
they must be altogether loathsome: Christ is never rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
of, nor commended, but where other things come down,
evanish and disappear, when compared with him; <hi>Whom have I in
heaven but thee? and I desire none on earth beside thee,</hi> saith the
Psalmist, <hi>Psal.</hi> 73. 25. as having full satisfaction, and all that can
be wished for in him. It's hard to observe what may be suitable
to Christ's lovelinesse, when the Bride gives it over: But we may
say, 1. The more that believers insist on Christ's lovelinesse,
their hearts will warm the more with it, and it will be found to
be the greater depth; for, now her expressions grow, till at last
they be swallowed up. 2. Where there is true respect to Christ,
no commendation of Christ that believers can invent (whatever
it be) will be satisfying to them: For, there have been, 1. many
excellent commendations given of Christ, as being like Gold,
Myrrhe, Spices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yea, 2. like such Gold, Lilies and Ivory, as
are not in the world; and finally she hath left and given over com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parisons,
and betaken her self to the abstract, <hi>sweetnesse</hi> it self;
yet all comes short, and she must quite the thing as unexpressible:
It's the very hight of souls love-rhethorick, to close with a kind of
holy amazement and admiration, which ends in silence, because
they cannot say enough, when they have said all they can say. O
what a lovely Object then must Christ Jesus be! They never knew
him rightly, who were satisfied with their own apprehensions of
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:65401:167"/>
him, or expressions concerning him. 3. There is an universal
lovelinesse in Christ, whole Christ is lovely, neither is he to be
divided in our apprehension and esteem, but as every thing in
him is wonderful and lovely, so is it to be admired and loved;
even his lowest sufferings, and seeming infirmities, his frowns and
seeming greater austerity, are lovely and profitable; he is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
lovely. 4. There is a wonderful desirablenesse in our Lord
Jesus, and incomparable satisfaction to be gotten in him; there
can be nothing more to draw a soul to love it, than what is here,
whatever may be attractive, is here; and there is nothing wanting
to satisfie the soul that injoyes him, and hath yielded to his call,
to such he is all desires. 5. Christ is never rightly taken up, so
long as any thing desirable is supponed to be gotten elsewhere, he
must be <hi>all desires:</hi> and therefore, where any thing hath the least
share of the affections beside him, he hath not his own place.
6. Empty and undesirable are all beloveds in the world befide
Christ, and broken cisterns will they all prove; and it's no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel;
for, all desires are in him, and therefore, not one desirable
thing is or can be found in them. 7. They have a good bargain
who have Christ; It's the short cut (to say so) and compendious
way to happinesse, and to the inheriting of all things, to unit
with Christ by faith, and to possesse him; for, all desires are in him:
and miserable will the persons be who shall misse Christ, although
they were gainers of the whole world.</p>
                  <p>Having somewhat answered the daughters of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> their
question, by insisting in this excellent description of Christ, now
by way of application and holy boasting in the close of the verse,
she reasons thus: Ye asked what my beloved was more than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
beloveds? and for your satisfaction, I have described him as
I can many several ways, though all fall very far short of full
expressing of his matchlesse worth: Now (saith she) this excellent
person is <hi>my beloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem;</hi>
bring all other beloveds, and compare them with him, and see
if he be not the chiefest and standard-bearer amongst them all;
and in this confident boasting of the excellency of her beloved,
she closes: Which sweet discourse wants not it's fruit on them,
as we will see in the Chapter following. Consider the words
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:65401:167"/>
four wayes, 1. In the matter, they hold forth two sweet relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
betwixt Christ and the believer, and this sweetens all, not
only that this beloved is an excellent person, but that he was
hers, she saith, he <hi>is my beloved,</hi> and also <hi>my friend;</hi> he is her
friend (as she is his friend, <hi>vers.</hi> 1.) that is, one that is friendly
to her, and will do for her, beyond what a brother, or mother,
or the nearest of all relations will or can do; he is one that is
born for the day of her adversity, and one whom she trusts as
her own soul, he is so dear to her, and she to him; for, this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ye
of friendship is mutual betwixt them. In a word (saith she) he
is much in himself, and much to me, unspeakably excellent in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and very dear and precious to me, <hi>my husband,</hi> and <hi>my friend:</hi>
In sum, my friendly husband, and my loving friend.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. There are many sweet relations that Christ <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>stands in
to the believer, as husband, friend, brother, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> even as there
are many relations that she stands in to him, as spouse, sister,
dove, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. Christ fills all the relations that he stands in to his
people, and that exceedingly well; he is a singularly loving, faithful,
kind and tender husband; and a singularly kind, faithful &amp; unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
friend, the best friend that ever a believer had; for, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
<hi>this is,</hi> &amp;c. saith, that what Christ is, he is indeed, and singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
so, as having no equal, he is a matchlesse husband and friend,
this is the scope. 3. Christ and the believer are upon one side,
they are friends, there is a league of friendship betwixt them, and
they have common friends, and common<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>

                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ersries. 4. These
who are Christ's friends (as <hi>vers. 1. eat, O friends</hi>) Christ may be
claimed by them as their friend, and what<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> that can<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>infer<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> they
may expect from him; for, he hath no bare title, neither sustains
he any empty relation. 5. Believers should lean much to Christ,
trust him, and expect good from him, as their friend. 6. It's a
notable and singular consolation for solks to have Christ their
friend, it's comfortable in life, death<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and judgement, in prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and adversity. It implyes these things in which he is forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
to his friends, 1. Constant kindnesse and faithfulnesse at
all times, he <hi>loves at all times,</hi> Prov. 17. 17. and, <hi>chap.</hi> 18. last:
he never fails, nor can at any time be charged with that which
<hi>Absalom</hi> casts up to <hi>Hushai, 2 Sam. 16. 17. Is this thy kindnesse
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:65401:168"/>
to thy friend?</hi> 2. Sympathy, and condescending to supply their
wants, <hi>he cleaves closer than a brother,</hi> Prov. 18. 24. It's such a
love, as one hath who aimeth at his friends good, as well as his
own. 3. Familiarity in mutual communion, as useth to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
friends, and freedom in conversing, as, <hi>Exod. 33. 11. the Lord
spoke with Moses as a man doth with his friend.</hi> 4. It takes in a
mutual confidence that one may have in another, as in his very
own self, and more than in any other; all which are eminently in
Christ, <hi>as ointment and per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>ume rejoice the heart, so doth the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of a man's friend,</hi> and eminently of this friend, <hi>by hearty
counsel,</hi> Prov. 27. 9. No other friends are comparable to <hi>this
friend,</hi> happy, happy for evermore are they, whose friend Christ
Jesus is. 7. Where Christ is a friend, there is he also the souls
beloved; or, believers choising of Christ for their beloved, and
his being kindly to them as a friend, go together; these two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
<hi>my beloved;</hi> and <hi>my friend</hi> are never separat. Now to be
the souls beloved, implyes these things, 1. That comparatively,
Christ is eminently and only loved by his people, and nothing is
admitted to share in their affections with him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8. 2. That
there is in the soul an high esteem of him, which begets this love.
3. That there is such an ardent affection to him, as makes them
long for union with him, as love naturally desires union with that
which it loves, it desires to <hi>be with Christ</hi> here, and hereafter, as
that which is far <hi>the best of all,</hi> Philip. 1. 23. 4. It suppons a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>ã€ˆâ€¦ã€‰</desc>
                     </gap> that their souls take in Christ, and expect
from union with him; their happinesse lyes in it, and they are
disquieted, and someway holily discontented and weighted, when
they misse it, and under desertion and absence, easily fear, lest
their heart beguile and de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ude them in that concerning-matter,
as the scope of this place, and her present exercise shews. 5. It
suppones a kindlinesse in their love, and a well groundednesse,
such as a wife hath to her husband, and not such as it betwixt the
adulteresse and the adulterer, which is all the love that the men
of the world have to their idols, but the love that the Bride
hath to Christ, is a native and avowed love, of which she hath
no reason to be ashamed (as men will one day be of all their
idols) but to boast and glory in him; and Christ is to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:65401:168"/>
not what idols are to the men of the world, but what a
most loving husband is to his wife, being the object of her heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contenting
and satisfying love: where ever these properties of
true love to Christ are, there may the soul lay claim to him as it's
friend, and be confident to find him it's true and kindly friend;
for, where he is the souls beloved, he is the souls friend. 8. This
is implyed, that whatever other beloveds men set their love
upon beside Christ, they will prove un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ound, and unfaithfull
friends in the time of need; or, confidence in any thing but
Christ, will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ail a man at the last; for, he is their <hi>friend,</hi> and no
other beloved deserves that name, all other things will be like
<hi>a broken tooth, or a foot out of joint,</hi> Prov. 25. 19. or like pools
in the wildernesse, that run dry in the heat, and makes the way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faring
men ashamed, such as <hi>Iob's</hi> friends did prove to him, <hi>Iob</hi>
6. 15. miserable comforters will they be to men, in the day of
their greatest need, but then especially will Christ Jesus be found
to be a friend indeed; for, there is an excellency in Christ in
every relation which he stands under to his people, and an infinite
disproportion betwixt him and all creatures, in respect of this.</p>
                  <p>A second way that we may consider the words, is as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
to the daughters of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> their question, <hi>vers.</hi> 9. ye ask
what he is more than other beloveds? now (saith she) <hi>this is he,</hi>
who is singular and matchlesse in all his properties; and so, it
looks not only to her choice of him, to be her beloved and her
friend, but saith also, that he is singularly and matchlesly such,
even a non-such beloved and friend, and one who will be found, after
tryal, only worthy to be chosen and closed with as such. <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
in their answers to others, would, as particularly as may be,
bring home what they say to some edifying use (for, this best clears
any question proposed) and would not insist on generals, much lesse
evanish in empty speculations, but would lavel at edification,
and frame what they say, so, as it may best reach that end, and
therefore she applyes her answer to their question. 2. When
Christ in his excellency and worth is a little insisted and dwelt
on, he will be found to be incomparable; and the more souls
search into him, the more confidently may they assert his incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
excellency; this, she here doth, and saith, as it were, Is
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:65401:169"/>
he not, and see ye him not now to be the chiefest among ten
thousand, and more excellent than all others? as having made
her assertion demonstrative, and undenyable. 3. Christ's worth
can bide the tryal, and there are, and may be gotten, good grounds
to prove that he is well worthy of all the respect, that can
be put upon him; and in reason, his worth and excellency may
be made convincing unto others, and it may be demonstrat to
consciences, that Christ is of more worth than all the world; and
her resuming of it thus, supposeth it now to be so clear, that
they could say nothing against it, as appears more fully from the
words following. 4. No other beloved, nor friend that men
choose beside Christ, can abide the tryal; the more they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
into, and searched out, they will be found to be of the
lesse worth: therefore she appeals (as it were) all men to bring
their beloveds before Christ, if they durst compare with him, as
being confident none durst enter the lists, purposly and professed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to compete with him.</p>
                  <p>3. We may consider these words, as her application made to
the daughters of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> holding forth her scope, to edifie
them by this description of Christ, and pressingly (for their good)
to bear it in upon them, that they might be made to fall in love
with this Christ, that had so high a room in her heart; for, so the
very strain of the words seem to run. Hence, <hi>Observe,</hi> 1. These
who love Christ themselves, will be desirous to have others
knowing and loving him also: and this may be a mark of love to
Christ, an earnest desire to have him esteemed of, and loved by
others. 2. These who love Christ and others truly, will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
nothing more, than to have Christ made known to them,
and to have them divorced from their idols, and ingaged to him;
thus love to them, as well as to him, manifests it self. 3. It's a
piece of the duty of mutual communion to which the Lords
people are oblieged, to instruct others in the knowledge of the
excellencies of Christ, that they may be brought in love with
him; and where that end is proposed, according to mens several
places and stations, no opportunity would be missed, nor pains
spared, which may attain it. 4. That this duty of commending
Christ to others, so as it may be profitable, would be exceeding
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:65401:169"/>
warrily and circumspectly gone about, as all the Brides strain
clears; For, she goes about it, 1. Tenderly, not upbraiding
their ignorance. 2. Lovingly, speaking still to them as friends.
3. Wisely and seasonably, taking the fit opportunity of their que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.
4. Fully, solidly and judiciously, bearing forth the main
things of Christ to them. 5. Affectionatly and gravely, as being
affected with the thing, and in love with Christ her self. 6. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplarly
and convincingly, as going before them in the practice
of that her self, which she endeavours to presse upon them; that
is, by loving and seeking Christ above all, her self, she studies to
commend that to others the more effectually. 5. <hi>Obs.</hi> That the
right uptaking of Christ in his excellency, and the pressing of him
upon the heart, is the most solid way of wearing all other beloveds
out of request with the soul: If he once get room, the esteem of
other things will quickly blow up; and there is no way to have
the heart weaned from them, but to have Christ great in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
of his people; therefore, when they ask, what he is more
than other beloveds? she answers, not by crying them down, or
by discovering their worthlessenesse, but by the describing of his
worth, and thereby giving them a solid proof of his excellency
to be a ground of their faith, which doth necessarily in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>er the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
for, <hi>who is he that overcomes the world, but he that believes
that Iesus is the Son of God?</hi> 1 John 5. 5.</p>
                  <p>4. We may consider this close, as it holds forth the holy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting,
and boasting of her soul in Christ, who is so far in excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
beyond all others: This is clear from her claiming of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
in him, and her repeating of the phrase, <hi>this,</hi> this singular
<hi>this,</hi> is my beloved; and again, <hi>this,</hi> is my friend; especially
compared with the scope, whereby now she holds him out, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as a matchless beloved and friend, but to be hers, and she thinks
no shame of him; her heart with holy gladness and joy doth exult
in this excellent choise of hers above all others: As if she said,
Ask ye what he is? <hi>this</hi> now so described, is he that is mine, he
is not like the worthlesse, empty and stinking beloveds, which
others have, I avow him, and count my self happy, and well come
to in him, the contentment I have in him is incomparably beyond
the counterfiet contentment, that all other beloveds can give.
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:65401:170"/>
This the manner of expression, and the frame of her heart in the
utering of it, and the scope (which is to shew her confidence in
this his commendation, as most worthy to be commended) do
imply. <hi>Observ.</hi> 1. That there is matter of boasting, and holy
bragging in Christ Jesus, whether we consider the excellency that
is in himself, or the confidence that his people may have in him,
as one who will make all that is in him forthcoming to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most,
for the good of his own. 2. That there is nothing beside
him, that one can confidently boast of; for, this her boasting is
so appropriate to him, as it's implyed, to be utterly unsuitable
that men should boast of any other thing, <hi>Let him that glorieth,
glory in the Lord,</hi> that is, in him, and in no other thing beside
him. 3. That believers who have interest in him, and have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
him to be their Beloved and their Friend, may make <hi>their
boast in him,</hi> Psal. 34. 2. <hi>may glory in him,</hi> Isa. 45. 25. and <hi>may
blesse themselves,</hi> as happy eternally <hi>in him,</hi> Isa. 65. 16. This
holy boasting implyeth, 1. an high estimation of him. 2. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
in him, without fear. 3. Satisfaction with him, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
full contentment in him. 4. An eminent joy resulting from
these, which cannot be shaken, all the former being in an eminent
degree. 4. <hi>Obs.</hi> That it is incumbent to the believer who hath
chosen Christ, sometimes to boast in him, and in a lovely and holy
way to vaunt and boast (if we may so speak) of him above all, so
are we commanded, to <hi>glory in his holy Name,</hi> Psal. 105. 3. and
this is one of the wayes we are to commend him, and Christ will
take it as a piece of notable respect put upon him, when it is se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
done. 5. When a believer is in a right frame, and clear
anent his interest, he will boast himself in Christ, as having <hi>the
lines fallen to him in pleasant places,</hi> Psal. 16. 6. whatever else be
his lot in the world: Christ is a bargain, that one day will be found
worth the boasting of.</p>

Chapter, and continued to the end thereof, betwixt the
Bride and the daughters of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> is further drawn
out in this Chapter; and first they return a new serious question,
<hi>vers.</hi> 1. In the second place she replyes, <hi>vers.</hi> 2. and 3. After which
in the third place, the Bridegroom himself comes in, with a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
expression of his love to his Bride, and an affectionat com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
of her graces: And so, according to the number of
the parties that speak, we have three parts of the Chapter.</p>
                  <p>The question proposed by the daughters of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> is, <hi>vers.</hi> 1.
and it supposeth them to be convinced of Christ's worth, by the
former discourse; and that they now are provocked, as being
deeply in love with him, to desire and thirst after him and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with him. Now as it depends upon the former discourse,
and is the continuance thereof, it gives ground to observe,
1. That serious and faithful endeavours to gain these that are
weak, are often followed with a blessing on these upon whom such
pains are taken; for, now the daughters are ingaged to seek him
with the Bride: And this should notably encourage to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
of this duty. 2. As it's the duty of one to admonish and
instruct another, so it's all mens duty to accept of admonition
and instruction from others, and in the Lord to yield themselves
thereunto, as these daughters do. 3. It makes christian-fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
sweet and pleasant, where there is faithful tendernesse upon
the one-side, and submissive yielding on the other: <hi>A wise repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

(especially concerning Christ) is one of the first things, whereby
desire of obtaining Christ doth appear; whereas such grumblings,
<hi>as who made thee a reprover, or instructer?</hi> &amp;c. evidence an unhum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
frame, out of case for any true desire after Christ. 4. This
may give some directions, for Christians profitable conversing one
with another: as, 1. A necessary and profitable subject, would be
proposed to be spoken of; for, so much the matter of the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
question imports. 2. It would be entertained by both sides
when once tabled, and all diversions barred out, and the subject
proposed, closely followed with answers suitable to it. 3. The
end designed, would be practice and edification (for, so it's here,
<hi>to seek him with them</hi>) and not a meer notional contemplation.
4. The manner would be grave and serious, suitable to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
5. Compellations and expressions that are used, would be
respective of each one to another. 6. These who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>re weak would
not shun to speak, and move questions, in these things that may
edifie them, as we may see in the daughters carriage here.
7. They who have knowledg would not despise these who are weak,
but condescend unto them. 8. It's sometimes useful to suspend
explicit following of our own case, (especially when these who are
present seem strangers to it) and to condescend to insist upon the
case of others for their edification; thus doth the Bride with the
daughters.</p>
                  <p>More particularly, in the words of, <hi>vers.</hi> 1. Consider, 1. the
title which the daughters give the Bride, <hi>O thou fairest among
women:</hi> It's the same which was, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 9. but here it shews
their continuing in respect to her, which they vent by suitable
grave expressions; It's not much at the beginning to carry re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectively
to the lovers of Christ, but it's much after some fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
acquaintance to continue so doing, which is the lesson that
may be learned here. 2. Consider the question, <hi>whether is thy
Beloved gone?</hi> and it's repeated, to shew how serious they were
in it, and how desirous of an answer. 3. There is the end, or
motive, that draws this question from them, and that is, <hi>that we
may seek him with thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="339" facs="tcp:65401:171"/>
She had told them that her Beloved was withdrawn; Now
they (when convinced of his worth) ask, <hi>whether?</hi> &amp;c. which is
a further step of their desire of being acquaint with Christ and his
way, than what was holden out in their question, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 9. yet
having infirmity also: And it shews, 1. that where there is any
conviction of what Christ is, then the great design and main en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
should be to know where he is, and how he may be attained.
2. There may be some acknowledgement of Christ's worth, and
affection to him, where yet there is much ignorance of the way
how to come by him. 3. It's no lesse necessary for a person, to
know rightly where and how to seek Christ, than to know what
he is. 4. There may be some honesty of desire after, and love to
Christ, where faith dar not claim him as the believers own; for, say
they, where is <hi>thy</hi> Beloved? they say not, where is <hi>our</hi> Beloved?
beginners are often very anxious and afraid to make this applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
although it may be, before their conviction and conversion,
they did never question it.</p>
                  <p>Next, we would consider, that the daughters here leave the
Brides case, and enquire for instructing of themselves, whence
<hi>Observe,</hi> 1. Whosoever have any affection to Christ, and any op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to be instructed anent him, would thriftily improve it;
if they had but the fellowship of an intelligent private Christian,
it should be made good use of to that purpose. 2. Young be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginners
often forget all others cases but their own, and the more
experienced should bear with that, and for others good passe
over their own case, and be content it be laid aside and forgotten
for a time. 3. They ask this, that they may be the more enabled
to sympathize, and concurr with her, in what she required of them:
which teacheth, that they can be most useful to others, that have
some distinctnesse in their own condition; for, confusion in our own
condition, doth much obstruct the sympathy, and faithful burthen-bearing
that we owe to others in theirs.</p>
                  <p>The end they propose, is, <hi>That we may seek him with thee:</hi>
Which may be considered, first, as their end in enquiring; Tell
us (as if they had said) for, we ask not for curiosity, but to be
helped in practice. Whence <hi>Observe,</hi> 1. The great end and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of all endeavours for knowledge, would not be to rest in spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation,
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:65401:172"/>
but to be furthered in practice. 2. It saith, no sooner
should folk be clear in a duty, but instantly should they set about
the practice of it. 3. Mens practice should be according to their
knowledge; their seeking, and knowing where to seek, should go
together. 4. The finding of Christ is the great end of all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
duties, wherein we are to seek him, as these duties are the
end of knowledge. 5. Often good desires after Christ, are much
impeded by ignorance and confusion, even in the judgements of
these that affectionatly love him.</p>
                  <p>Again, we may consider the words as a motive proposed to the
Bride, to make her to answer; which is, shew us we pray thee where
we may find him; for, we are in earnest, and would gladly seek
him with thee. And from the words so considered, <hi>Observe,</hi> 1.
Nothing will nor should more prevail with a tender believer, to
move him to be helpful to others, than this, that they are serious
and yet weak: Yea, 2. singlenesse of desire to profite by the
means, is a piece of that frame that's necessary in order to our
edification by them; for, thus they strengthen themselves in the
expectation of an edifying answer, which otherwayes they could
not have expected; they who are serious and single, though feck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
may look for God's guiding of them.</p>
                  <p>3. These words may be considered, as holding forth the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
purpose, and (as it were) an obligation that they come
under: tell us (say they) <hi>and we will seek him with thee:</hi> And this
teacheth, that humble, single purposes, are neither unsuitable,
nor unprofitable to beginners; yea, it's very necessary, that they
seriously devote, and ingage themselves in that blessed work of
seeking after Jesus Christ.</p>
                  <p>Further, the words, <hi>we will seek him with thee,</hi> considered in
themselves, import not only a seeking, but a joint seeking with
her, as coming in to share in the same exercise that she was taken
up with. Which shews, 1. that they acquiesced in the same way
of Religion, which they that were in Christ before them did fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.
2. That there is an union to be kept amongst the worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of Christ, and a joint cordial concurrence in going about of
duties. 3. That this united, or joint-way is profitable to all,
both to beginners, and to these that are more experienced; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:65401:172"/>
it would not be such a motive, as it is here held forth to
be. 4. Although believers, and all professors, have an union
and communion amongst themselves (as the Bride hath formerly
kept with the dauthters of <hi>Ierusalem</hi>) yet when sincerity is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
to be more fresh and lively, or when it is begotten where it
was not before, there follows a more near union and communion
than that which was before: Now they mind another joint way of
seeking him, than formerly they had done. 5. Often the persons
by whom souls have gotten good, are very dear to them, and in
much respect with them, so that their way hath a testimony from
them, as approvable; for (saith the daughters) we will seek him
with thee, who instructed us: It's true, that this may sometimes
degenerate (so that folks may drink in the dregs from such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
with their wine) yet it seems, in the main principles of
practical godllinesse, not to be unsafe, as, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 7, 8. 6. The
great, main, and native use of what is spoken of Christ's excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
is to have souls brought in love with him, and ingaged to
seek him; and if this be not gained, any other effect of what is
spoken, is little worth, as to what mainly concerns themselves:
As this was the scope of all the Bride spoke concerning Christ, so
it is attained on these daughters to whom she spoke; and it is
the great thing we should aim at, when either we speak of Christ's
worth, or hear it spoken of.</p>

                  <p>If it were asked, how the daughters could ask the Bride, where
Christ was, or how she now can tell them, when she her self is
seeking, and knoweth not (as she seemed to professe, <hi>chap.</hi> 5, 6,

distinct advice to others, in their difficulties, than they can take
to themselves in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

may complain they know not how to find him, not so much
from defect of light as of life, when either in their own practice,
or in their successe in duties, they are not answerable to what
they aim at; exercised souls are ready to aggrege their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities;
and what is indeed in them, is to their own account
as not in them, till the Lord shine upon it and quicken it, and so
bring it out and make it appear.</p>
                  <p>In the first part of her answer, <hi>vers.</hi> 2. she speaks to these two,
1. Where Christ is. 2. What he is doing. The first gives them
direction where to seek him; the second incourages them to fall
about it, as a thing acceptable to him: The place where he is,
is set forth by two expressions, 1. <hi>He is gone down to his garden,</hi>
which implyeth the simili<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ude formerly expressed, of a man's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiering
from his chamber, or closet to his garden: This <hi>garden</hi>
signifies the Church, as, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. 12. 15. and here, as opposed to
<hi>gardens,</hi> in the words following, it holdeth forth the Catholick
visible Church, as <hi>gardens</hi> signifie particular societies, or congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations:
The Church is like a garden that is within one precinct,
yet divided into diverse quarters and inclosurs: This being the
Church that hath the promise of Christ's presence, and where he
is ever to be found, must be understood of no particular Church,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:65401:173"/>
of which that cannot be asserted, that Christ shall be alwayes
there: it must therefore be the Catholick Church, distinguished
from particular Churches, or gardens. 2. He is gone <hi>to the beds
of spices:</hi> As gardens have distinct plots of flowers, and beds of
spices, and some particular parts are alloted for these, where es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
they grow; so in the Church, Christ hath his plants,
whereof some are sanctified with grace (therefore compared to
<hi>spices</hi>) and these in some parts of the visible Church, are more
abounding than in other parts (as spices in <hi>beds</hi> together that
may be elsewhere but in particular stalks, and not so frequent)
and as men love and frequent that plot of their garden most; so
doth Christ most manifest himself in his Ordinances ordinarily,
where he hath his spices and lilies in greatest abundance: And
thus this last part qualifies the former, he is in his Church, but es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
where his spices are most abounding; and therefore would
you have him? seek him in his Church and amongst his people, and
especially in such societies of his people, where true and lively
believers are most to be found. Here observe (beside what was
observed on <hi>chap.</hi> 4. 12.) Christ's Church, though it have many
subdivisions, yet is it one Church, one whole Catholick Church,
whereof particular Churches are parts, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. 2. It is in
that Church and no where else, that Christ's presence is to be
found, and where believers, the spices and lilies are planted.
3. There may be in that one visible Church, many moe real con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts
in one part thereof, than in another; <hi>spices</hi> in <hi>beds</hi> are not
in every place of the <hi>garden.</hi> 4. Though Christ hath a singular
care of, and respect for, his whole Church, and hath a peculiar
presence there where ever there is any part thereof, yet where
he hath much people, beyond what he hath in other places (as in
<hi>Antioch,</hi> Act. 11. 21. in <hi>Corinth,</hi> Act. 18. 10. and <hi>Ephesus,</hi> Act. 19.
20.) there especially is he present, and there ordinarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
he the power and life of his Ordinances. 5. These who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
Christ, would not run out of the Church to seek him, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
any way of finding him, which others have not found ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
before them; but would seek after him<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> by the ordinary means,
in his Church; for, this answers their questions, <hi>where is he?</hi>
proposed for that end, that they might s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ek him and find him.</p>

                     <pb n="344" facs="tcp:65401:174"/>
He hath a twofold exercise in his gardens, for he is not idle,
he is gone there, 1. <hi>To feed in the gardens.</hi> By <hi>gardens,</hi> in the
plural number, are understood the subdivisions, and particular
plots of that one garden, formerly mentioned; the Jews had
their Synagogues, where the people did meet, and the Law was
read (as we have our distinct congregations) as, <hi>Psal.</hi> 74. 8. and
<hi>Act.</hi> 15. 21. do evidence. To <hi>feed,</hi> taken actively (as <hi>chap.</hi> 1. 7.
<hi>where thou feeds,</hi> &amp;c.) signifieth his taking care, to provide for
his own in the Church; if taken passively, he is gone down <hi>to feed,</hi>
that is, that himself may eat, and it is the same with what was,
<hi>chap. 5. 1. I have come to my garden, I have eaten,</hi> &amp;c. and the
scope in both, looks to be the same, and so the meaning of the
similitude is, that as men have their gardens, wherein they solace
themselves, and feed upon the pleasant fruits that are in them,
so doth Christ delight himself in his Church, and take pleasure
therein, as, <hi>Psal.</hi> 147. 11. he <hi>taketh pleasure in them that fear
him;</hi> and <hi>he delighteth in the habitable parts of the earth,</hi> Prov.
8. 31. that is, where Saints dwell, and where the place of his rest
and haunt is; other places being but as an unhabited wildernesse
to Christ, the Church is the garden, wherein he delights and finds
fruit. He is said to feed in <hi>the gardens,</hi> and not in the <hi>garden,</hi>
1. To shew, that the way of his manifesting himself to his Church,
is by erecting his Ordinances in particular societies, and thus he
derives his blessings. 2. To shew, that though there be diverse so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties,
or particular Churches, yet his presence is not excluded
from, or tyed to, any one of them: <hi>He walks amongst the Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks,</hi>
as observing every one of them, and manifesting himself
among them, as he seeth good.</p>
                  <p>The second part of his exercise is, <hi>to gather lilies:</hi> By <hi>lilies,</hi> in
this garden (as often hath been said) are understood believers,
<hi>chap.</hi> 2. 2. 16. To <hi>gather,</hi> is a borrowed expression from men
that use to gather some flowers they delight in, to bring to their
chambers with them, or some fruits, that they may dresse and
prepare them, as we heard, <hi>chap.</hi> 5. 1. Christ's gathering of his
lilies, points, 1. At his calling of them effectually who belong to
him; the elect may be called lilies to be gathered, as they are
called <hi>sons of God to be gathered,</hi> Joh. 11. 51, 52. Thus also,
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:65401:174"/>
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 37. is Christ's expression, <hi>I would have gathered you,</hi> &amp;c.
whereby their bringing-in to him is signified. 2. It points at his
glorifying of them, which is in part, when particular believers are
gathered to their fathers, as the phrase is, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25. 8. and 35. 29.
This is, as his pulling of some lilies for his own satisfaction: and
this gathering will be perfected, when all the Elect shall be <hi>ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
from the four winds,</hi> Matth. 24. 31. and the <hi>Angels shall
gather the good fish into vessels, but cast the bad away,</hi> Mat. 13. 48.
In a word then, the sense and scope of the whole is this, Would
ye (saith she) have my beloved, or know where he is that ye may
seek him? he is in his Church, seek him in the way of his Ordinances;
for, he is there, purposly to delight himself in doing good to his
people, it's his errand to welcome and <hi>gather them as a hen doth her
chickens under her wings,</hi> therefore (saith she) seek him there; for,
ye can find no better opportunity. <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. Our Lord Jesus
takes pleasure to be amongst his people, and to do them good;
he feeds on this with delight, as a hungry man doth on his meat.
2. The moe Christ gains (to say so) he feeds the better, and is
the more cheerful: he <hi>feeds</hi> and <hi>gathers</hi> at once, and this ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
of souls, is as sweetly refreshing and delightsome to our
blessed Lord Jesus, as the plucking of the sweetest flowers is to a
man walking in a garden; and there is nothing more acceptable and
welcome to him, than a seeking-sinner. 3. Wherever Christ's
Ordinances are, there may his presence be expected, in one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Church, as well as in another; for, he feeds in the <hi>gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens.</hi>
4. The great scope of Ordinances, is to gather-in believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and build them up; and there is nothing more acceptable
to Christ, than to have some to gather, some whom he may save.
That's a refreshing feast to him, <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 34. 5. Our Lord Jesus
hath delight in all his people, and in every one of them, where
sincerity is, though it be not in the greatest measure: Therefore
it's said he gathers <hi>lilies</hi> indefinitly, that is, one of them as well
as another. 6. So long as our Lord Jesus hath a Church and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
in it, as long doth he continue to gather, and he is not
idle, but is still gathering, though at sometimes, and in some
places, this may be more sensible and abundant than ordinary. 7. It's
a great incouragement to poor sinners to seek for Christ, to know,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:65401:175"/>
that this is his very errand in his Ordinances, to gather them, and
that he is waiting on, like the Prodigals father, ready to run with
delight to welcome them; This is proposed as a motive to the
daughters, to seek him. 8. Although believers may seem for a
time to be neglected, and, as it were, forgotten, yet will the Lord
gather them all in at last, as his choice of all the world, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the flowers of his gardens; there is a good day coming to
believers, when not one of them shall be le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t to grow in this
fighting Church, but he shall take them in to the King's Palace,
there to be for ever with him. 9. The readinesse of Christ to
welcome sinners, and the delight that he hath in doing them
good, should exceedingly provock and hearten sinners to seek
him, while he may be found; This is the great scope of this verse.</p>

consider the words here, first, as in them her interest is repeated,
though it was once formerly asserted; Which shews, 1. that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
though once clear anent their interest, may have their
difficulties and doubts recurring upon them. 2. That when new
difficulties recur, there is no new way to be taken for discussing
of them, but the same way of believing, which is again to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
and kept in exercise. 3. It shews that miscarriages do
not break off that union, which is betwixt Christ and his people;
for, although there had been many failings in her former carriage,
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:65401:175"/>
yet her interest is still the same. 4. Believers, even over, and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding

and may and should not only aime to have it, but to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve

at asserting her interest in him, but here she begins at asserting
his interest in her, or her betaking of her self to him, for clearing of
her interest in him, <hi>I am</hi> (saith she) <hi>my Beloveds,</hi> or, <hi>I am to my
Beloved;</hi> and from her betaking her self to him, and adhering to
the bargain, she concludes he also is hers: Which shews, 1. that
they who are clear of their adhering to Christ, and of their fleeing
to him, as their choice, may warrantably conclude, that Christ is
theirs, even though sense would say the contrary. 2. When there
is nothing in Christ's dispensation to us, that looks convincing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
of his love to us, it's good to reflect on our acting on him,
and if it be found that we have fled to him, and closed with him,
then there is ground to conclude our union with him, and interest
in him, and there cannot be a sounder way of reasoning than that:
For, if we on our part be answerable to the call, we are not to
question his part (namely his bestowing of himself on us, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the tenor of his offers) but to believe it according to
his word: Believers may sometimes be put to this way of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and it's sure.</p>
                  <p>3. If we consider the words, as following on her former deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and exercise, and as being now intended by the Bride (as her
scope) to fix her self; they give ground to <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. That <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>aith is
still a refuge; when all God's dispensations, and every thing in
the believers case, seems to leave the heart in disquietnesse, faith
is then the last and great refuge. 2. Faith is then most satisfying,
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:65401:176"/>
when repentance is exercised, and all other means diligently gone
about; therefore may she now cast this anchor, after she hath been
in the exercise of repentance, and in the use of other means (as
we have seen in the former Chapter) which had been presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to have been done at first, these being slighted; faith will
sustain souls in duty, but presumption puffs up (as in <hi>vers.</hi> 3.)
even when they are out of it; faith preserves from fainting under
discouragements in the way of God, presumption strengthens
against just challenges, when folks are out of his way.</p>
                  <p>The second part of the verse, <hi>He feeds among the Lilies,</hi> was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
spoken to, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 16. It's brought-in here to remove that
objection, if he be thine, where is he? Is he not away? and if he
be away, why claims thou interest in him? She answers them,
though he be not present to sense, yet is he ever kind to his
people, and therefore cannot but be kind to me, which makes
me conclude, that though he be not present to sense, yet he is
mine, and I am his. Believers are called <hi>Lilies</hi> often, 1. For
their native beauty, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 29. 2. For their savorinesse, <hi>Chap.</hi>
5. 13. 3. For their <hi>growing,</hi> and making increase, as the <hi>Lilie,
Hos.</hi> 14. 5. And so the similitude points at these three excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of the believer, 1. The native beauty and lovelinesse of
Christ's grace in them. 2. The sweet relish and savorinesse of
their graces. And, 3. their spiritual growth in grace, from one
degree of it to another. Christ's <hi>feeding among his Lilies,</hi> shews,
the great delight he takes in them, and the pleasure he hath to
do them good, as was cleared, <hi>Chap. 2. 16. Observ.</hi> 1. Christ is
exceeding loving to, and tender of, all his people, of one as well
as of another, and hath been so from the beginning, that none
had ever any reason to complain. 2. Christ's way in general to
his people, when well taken up, may notably quiet, content and
comfort any of them, when a difficulty comes on, or when under
any darknesse or desertion, as the spouse here was; He never did
any of his own wrong. 3. A believer that hath clearnesse anent
his fleeing to Christ by faith, may draw comfortable conclusions
from, and comfortably apply, the way of Christ with others of his
people to themselves, and expect that same kindnesse from him,
that they have met with; for, the Covenant is one and the same
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:65401:176"/>
with them all. 4. Believers may sometimes be put to gather
their comfort, and to sustain their faith, more from the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of others, in what they have found, and how Christ hath ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to them, than from any thing that is in their own present
condition. 5. She propounded Christ's kindnesse to his people
(<hi>the Lilies</hi>) to encourage the daughters of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to seek
him, <hi>vers.</hi> 2. now here, she makes use of the same ground, for
quieting of her self. Hence learn two things, 1. That same which
warrands believers at first to approach to Christ, may encourage
them to renew, and continue the exercise of their faith, in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
application of him and his comforts. 2. It's good in our
own practice, to make use of the same grounds, and to walk by
the same rules, that we would propose to others.</p>

Christ, the Bridegroom, comes in and speaks: Our Lord Jesus
(as it were) hath been long silent, and here he breaks in, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any preface, and makes up all his former absence and silence,
by his singular kindnesse, when he manifests himself to his Bride;
which kindnesse, appears in the warmnesse and sweetnesse of his
many and various expressions. He continues speaking unto
<hi>vers.</hi> 10. of <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. after he had knocked at her door, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 2.
he had been longing, as it were, to be in, and now when he wins

the commendation of his Bride. This is, 1. generally propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in three similitudes, <hi>vers.</hi> 4. 2. It's aggreged in one instance
thereof, <hi>vers.</hi> 5.â€”3. He descends to particulars, <hi>vers.</hi>â€”5, 6, 7:
4. He takes her up in diverse considerations, that speak her to be
lovely and beautiful, <hi>vers.</hi> 8, 9. 5. This is confirmed by two
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:65401:177"/>
instances and proofs, 1. What the daughters did esteem of her,
and their praise is marked, <hi>vers.</hi> 9, 10. 2. It's instanced in the

6. he proceeds in a different method from what he had, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.
to set out the particulars of her lovelinesse, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.</p>
                  <p>Generally she is set out, <hi>vers.</hi> 4. by three comparisons, 1. <hi>She
is beautiful as Tirzah:</hi> This was a City of the Tribe of <hi>Manasseh,</hi>
The word in the Original comes from a root, that signifieth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable;
whereby it seems, that this City hath been exceeding
pleasant: It was the seat of one of the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Canaan,</hi> Josh. 12.
24. and of the Kings of <hi>Israel,</hi> after the rent of the ten Tribes
from the house of <hi>David,</hi> until <hi>Zimri</hi> burnt it; after which <hi>Omri</hi>
built <hi>Samaria,</hi> as is to be seen at large, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 16. Thus the
spiritual beauty of holinesse in believers (<hi>Psal.</hi> 110. 3.) is set out
as having in it so much lovelinesse as may commend it, and make
it desirable and acceptable to others. 2. She is <hi>comely as Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem:</hi>
This was the head City of <hi>Iudah, beautiful for situation,
and the joy of the whole earth,</hi> Psal. 48. 2. but most beautiful for the
Ordinances and worship of God, which were there; therefore glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
things are spoken of it, more than any thing that was to be seen
by carnal eyes, and it was loved on that account, <hi>more than all the
dwellings of Iacob,</hi> Psal. 87. 2, 3. It's ordinarily taken for a type of
the Church, which is set out by it, as, <hi>Psal.</hi> 122. It seems here the
Lord doth respect the believers spiritual beauty, with reference
to that comelinesse and orderlinesse, which is to be seen among
them, and is maintained by them in the exercise of his Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
and also in respect of his estimation, every believer is a <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi>
to him, where he dwells, where he is worshipped, and to
whom he hath given the promise of his presence: Believers are
to him as <hi>Tirzah</hi> and <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> the most beautiful Cities of that
Land, for the time. Or, the first similitude, taken from <hi>Tirzah,</hi>
may look to outward beauty; for, <hi>Tirzah</hi> was a beautiful City:
and the other similitude, taken from <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> may look to
Church-beauty, as the Ordinances were there; and so the sense
runs, my love thou art to me as the most excellent thing in the
world; yea, as the most excellent thing in the visible Church,
which is more precious to him than any thing in the world. 3. She
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:65401:177"/>
is <hi>terrible as an army with banners:</hi> An army is strong and fearful;
a banner'd army is stately and orderly, under command and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>
readinesse for service; an army with banners, is an army in it's
most stately posture: The Church is terrible as such an army, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
1. Considered complexly or collectively, her Ordinances
have power, authority and efficacy, like a banner'd army: So the
Churches spiritual weapons are said to be <hi>mighty</hi> and <hi>powerfull
through God, 2 Cor.</hi> 10. 5, 6. This being compared with the 9. and
10. verses, may have it's own place. But, 2. the scope here, and
the words following, look especially at the statelinesse, majesty,
and spiritual valour that is in particular believers, who are more
truly generous, valorous and powerful, than an army with banners;
when their faith is exercised, and kept lively, they prevail where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
they turn, they carry the <hi>victory over the world,</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 4.
over devils, which are enemies whom no worldly army can reach;
but by the power of faith they prevail, even to quench the <hi>vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of fire,</hi> as it's in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 34. and by faith they <hi>waxed vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
in fight:</hi> But mainly this holds in respect of Christ himself,
they prevail over him in a manner, by their princely carriage, as <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>
did, <hi>Gen. 32. 28. As a prince hast thou had power with God and
men, and hast prevailed:</hi> See <hi>Hos. 12. 4. he had power over the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel,
and prevailed:</hi> And indeed, no army hath such influence upon
him, as believers have, which is such, that he cannot (as it were)
stand before them, or refuse them any thing, that they with weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and supplications wrestle with him for, according to his will:
Now, that it is in this respect mainly, that the believer is called
terrible as an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>my with banners, is clear, 1. From the scope,
which is to comfort a particular believer, who hath been wrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
with him already under desertions. 2. The next words con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
it, <hi>Turn away thine eyes from me</hi> (saith he) <hi>for they have
overcome me:</hi> What statelinesse, or terriblenesse (might one say)
is in a poor believer? It's easily answered, that this is not any
awful or dreadful terriblenesse that is here intended, but the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
of faith, and the powerful victory which through the same,
by Christ's own condescending, the believer hath over him; and
so in his account, as to prevailing with him, Christ's Bride is more
mighty than many armies, in their most stately posture; therefore
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:65401:178"/>
(saith he) <hi>thine eyes</hi> (that is her faith) <hi>have overcome me</hi> (that's
her terriblenesse) <hi>turn</hi> them <hi>away,</hi> I cannot (to say so) abide
them: And these three together, make the believer (or rather
Christ's love, who useth these expressions) wonderful, 1. The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever
is beyond all the world for beauty. 2. The visible Church,
and believers in her, in respect of Ordinances and her Ecclesiastick
estate, is very comely and lovely; and yet the believers inward
beauty is beyond that also, <hi>the Kings daughter is all glorious with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</hi>
3. Believers in regard of the power of their faith, are more
terrible than armies, or all military power among men: Thou
art (saith he) so to me, and hast such influence on me, and may
expect thus to prevail with, and in a manner to overcome, me:
And so Christ is so far from quarrelling with her, for her by-gone
carriage now, that he effectually comforts and commends her.
Hence, <hi>Observe,</hi> 1. Our Lord Jesus is a most friendly welcomer
of a sinner, and the sweetest passer-by of transgressions that can be;
there is no upbraiding here for any thing, but every word speaks
how well he takes with her. 2. Our Lord Jesus, his manifestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are seasonable and wise: Seasonable, that now he comes when
the Bride hath left no mean unessayed, and was at a stand; wise,
that he comes not until she had found the bitternesse of her own
way, and was brought to a more lively exercise of faith, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
holinesse and profitable experiences therein; of which we
have spoken in what goeth before. 3. The Lord is not displeased
with humble believing, and with the claiming of interest in him
by his own, even when his dispensations to sense are dark, but
takes very well with it, and hath a special compl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ncy in it, and
therefore comes in with this intimation of his love here, impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his hearty accepting of her. 4. The Lords commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of his people, and the intimations of his love to them are
such, as it may be seen he conforms and proportions them to
their condition and exercise, and when they have been under any
long and sharp exercise, (as the Bride was in the former Chapter)
he makes, when he comes, his manifestations the more sweet and
full, as here. 5. Believers, when grace is exercised, must needs
be beautiful creatures, and much esteemed of by Christ, who thus
commends them. 6: Grace and holinesse in a believers walk, is
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:65401:178"/>
much more beautiful and acceptable to Christ, than the external
Ordinances (though excellent in themselves) as separable from
it; for, <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> that was very beautiful as to Ordinances, is
but an emblem of this. 7. There is an awfulnesse and terrible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in believers, as well as lovelinesse, which makes them ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
to the prophane, even whether they will or not, a godly
carriage puts a restraint on them. 8. Lovelinesse, terriblenesse
and authority in holinesse, are knit together; when a particular
believer, or Church, is lively in holinesse, then have they weight
and authority, and when that fails, they become despicable. 9. The
believer hath great weight with Christ, he is the only army that
prevails over him, as faith is the only weapon, being humbly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised,
by which they overcome: This is more fully expressed in
the next verse.</p>

                  <p>The first part of the fifth verse contains the amplification and
heightening of the Brides lovely<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> terriblenesse, and the great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
and proof thereof, is held forth in a most wonderful expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
<hi>Turn away thine eyes from me<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
                     </hi> and as wonderful a reason,
<hi>for they have overcome me,</hi> saith the beloved: Wherein consider,
1. That, wherein this might and irresistable terriblenesse of hers
consisted, It's her <hi>eyes,</hi> which are supposed to be looking on
him, even when she knew not, to her sense, where he was: By <hi>eyes,</hi>
we shew, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. 9. were understood her love to him, and saith
in him, whereby she was still cleaving to him under desertion,
and in the present dark condition she was in, seeking to find him
out. 2. This phrase, <hi>Turn away thine eyes,</hi> is not so to be taken,
as if Christ approved not her looking to him, or her faith in him;
but, to shew the exceeding great delight he had in her placing her
faith and love on him, which was such, that her loving and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
looks ravished him (as it's <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. 9.) and (as it were) his
heart could not stand out against these looks, more than one man
could stand out against a whole army, as the the following expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:65401:179"/>
clears: It's like these expressions, <hi>Gen. 32. 28. I pray thee
let me go,</hi> and, <hi>Exod. 32. 10. Let me alone, Moses;</hi> which shews,
that it's the believers strength of faith, and importunity of love,
exercised in humble dependence on him, and cleaving to him,
which is here commended; <hi>for</hi> (saith he) <hi>they have overcome
me:</hi> This shews, that it is no violent, or unwilling victory over
him. But (in respect of the effect that followed her looks) it
holds forth the intensnesse of his love, and the certainty of faiths
prevailing, that (to speak so with reverence and admiration) he is
captivat, ravished and held with it, as one that is overcome, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he will be so; yea, according to the principles of his love,
and the faithfulnesse of his promises, whereby he walks, he cannot
but yield unto the believing importunity of his people, as one
overcome. In sum, it's borrowed from the most passionat love
that useth to be in men, when they are so taken with some lovely
object, that a look thereof pierceth them: This, though in every
thing (especially as implying defects) it cannot be applyed to
Christ, yet in a holy spiritual manner, the effects, for the believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
comfort, are as really and certainly, but much more wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
in Christ. These expressions are much of the same nature with
these spoken of, upon <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 4. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. 9. and therefore the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
there, will follow here. But further from the scope and repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition.
<hi>Obs.</hi> 1. That the believers eyes may look, that is, their love
and faith may be exercised on Christ, even in their dark and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted
conditions; and it's their property to look alway to him,
even when their eyes are, as it were, blind through desertion, he
is still the Object they are set upon. 2. That when these graces
of faith and love are exercised on Christ, they are never fruitlesse,
but alwayes prevail and obtain, though it be not alwayes sensible
to the believer. 3. The love and faith of believers, have weight
with Christ and affect him, even when he keeps up himself, he
may be overcome even then; for, the expression in the text looks
to what was past. 4. Faith working by love, is a most gallant,
and holy darring thing, bold in it's enterprises to pursue after, to
grip, and stick to Christ over all difficulties (as may be seen in
her former carriage) and most successful as to the event. 5. The
more stayedly and stoutly, with love, humility and diligence, that

greater commendation, as the eleventh of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and his
commendation of that womans faith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. 25. do confirm:
Tenaciousnesse, and importunity in holding of, hanging on, and
cleaving to Christ by faith, may well be marvelled at, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
by Christ, but will never be reproved nor rejected: They
greatly mistake Christ, who think that wrestling by faith will dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please
him; for, even though he seem to keep up himself, it is
but to occasion, and to provoke to more of the exercise of these
graces, in which he takes so much delight.</p>

free forgiver of wrongs to his own, so he is the most full forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of them, when they return; and therefore he continues speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to her in the same terms as formerly, without any alteration,
as if no such wrong on her side had been committed. 3. Renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of repentance and faith by believers after failings, puts them
in that same condition and capacity with Christ, for laying claim
to his love, and their wonted priviledges and comforts, wherein
they were before, even as if such failings and miscarriages had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
been. 4. Our Lord Jesus would have his people confirmed,
and strengthned in the faith of the constancy of his love, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeablenesse
of their interest, and the priviledges following
thereon: And seing he thus loves his people, he allowes them to
believe it. 5. It is not easie to fix and imprint Christ's words on
believers hearts, and to get them affected with them: therefore
often, both promises and duties must be repeated; and what was
once spoken must be again repeated for their good, especially af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a slip and fit of security, the same word hath need to be made
lively again, and fresh to their relish, which the Lord doth here.
6. Unlesse Christ speak and make the word lively, the sweetest
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:65401:180"/>
word, even that which once possibly hath been made lively to a
believer, will not savour, but will want it's relish and luster, if he
repeat it not.</p>

                  <p>This kind Bridegroom proceeds in the commendation of his
Bride, <hi>vers.</hi> 8, 9. and shews the rich excellency that is in her, by
considering her several wayes, whereby she is preferable to what
is most excellent: And then in the following verses, he confirms
this by a twofold proof; and lastly, <hi>vers.</hi> 13. closeth the Chapter
with a kind invitation, whereby, as it were, by a new proof of his
love, he puts the commendation given her, out of doubt.</p>
                  <p>For understanding the 8. and 9. verses, we are to conceive, that
by <hi>Daughters, Virgins, Queens, Concubines,</hi> by this <hi>Dove</hi> that is
<hi>one,</hi> and the <hi>mother</hi> that <hi>bears,</hi> are not understood any party di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
from the Church or Bride, but the same Bride diversly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,
taking-in first the Church as visible, which is beautiful in
her Ordinances, external profession and order; for, she is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that <hi>bears</hi> the daughters (who are the daughters of <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>)
and that is said to be <hi>seen;</hi> both which expressions hold forth
this, and accordingly <hi>mother</hi> and <hi>daughters</hi> have hitherto been
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:65401:181"/>
understood in this Song, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 4, 5. Secondly, and especially,
the Church as invisible, and the real believers who are members
of the Church invisible; for, the scope here is to commend her
graces; and if we consider the commendation preceeding, and
the proofs given, it will appear that they especially belong to her,
and by Analogy agree to the visible Church, wherein she is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended.</p>
                  <p>This diverse consideration of the Church as one and moe, Is
not, 1. disagreeable to other Scriptures, in which Christ useth
to commend her, as we see, <hi>Psal.</hi> 45. 9, 13, 14. where there is
the <hi>Queen,</hi> called the <hi>Kings daughter,</hi> and the <hi>Virgins;</hi> or <hi>Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
her companions,</hi> who are with her, yet by all is understood
the same invisible Church, considered collectively as one body, or
distributively in her several members. Nor, 2. is it unsuitable
to the strain of this Song, nor is it absurd, as was shown in the
Preface, and needs not now be repeated. And, 3. it agrees well
with Christ's scope here (where he is (to say so) seeking how to
expresse fully the commendation of his Bride, as singular and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent)
thus to consider her; for, the moe wayes she be considered,
her excellency appears the more, she being excellent, whatever
way she be lookt on: And if as visible, she be glorious, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
one in him, much more as invisible she is so, which is the
scope, as is clear, <hi>vers.</hi> 9. By <hi>Queens, Concubines</hi> and <hi>Virgins</hi>
then, we understand believers of different growths and degrees:
I say, believers, 1. because these titles agree best to them, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the strain of this Song and of <hi>Psalm</hi> 45. 2. They are
supposed to be of one mother. 3. They praise the Bride, which
is an evidence of honesty and sincerity, and a greater argument of
her excellency, that she is praised and commended by such as had
discerning: I say, we are here to understand believers of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
growths and degrees, so that some believers are <hi>Queens,</hi> that
is, more glorious, and admitted to the highest priviledges; Some
are as <hi>Concubines,</hi> who were accounted lawful wives as to conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
fellowship, but differed in this, that they had not such govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
over the family, and their children had not right to inherit,
therefore they are as half wives, as the word in the Original will
bear; Some are <hi>Virgins,</hi> that are not so far admitted, yet are of
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:65401:181"/>
a chast carriage, and so differenced from others, as was said on
<hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 3. Next, the commendation is, that though there be
<hi>many Queens, moe Concubines,</hi> and <hi>Virgins without number</hi> (that
is, though there be many believers of different <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> and degrees)
yet there is but <hi>one</hi> Bride, which is a singular excellency in her,
and an unheard-of thing, that so many make up but one Bride; the
like whereof is not to be found in any marriage that ever was in
the world: Or, we may conceive thus, though men for their satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
sought out many Queens, Concubines and Virgins, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there was not to be found in any one what was satisfying,
yet, saith he, my one Bride is to me many virtually, as if the worth
of so many Queens, Concubines, and Virgins were combined in
one: And thus as she set him out chief of all husbands, so doth
he set her out as chief of all Brides, and as comprehending in her
alone, all that was desirable, as the next part of the 9. <hi>vers.</hi> clear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

By the number, 60. 80. and <hi>without number,</hi> we conceive an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definit
number is to be understood, that is, they are many, only
they of the inferior ranks are manyest, that is, there are moe
Concubines than Queens, far advanced in Christianity, and again,
moe Virgins than Concubines, because experienced believers of
an high degree are most rare, and these who are not grown up,
to have their senses exercised, are most numerous; In a word,
there are moe weak than strong believers. Which saith, 1. that
there are degrees amongst true believers, all have not the same
degree of grace, though all have the same grace for kind, and
though all be in the same Covenant; there are old men, or <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
young men,</hi> and <hi>little children,</hi> or <hi>babs,</hi> 1 Joh. 2. 12, 13.
2. Among believers, there are many moe weak than strong. 3. He
accounts of them all as honorable, and reckons even the Virgins as
commendable, though they come not up to be Queens. Yet, 4.
where grace is most lively, and faith most strong, there he dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies

and <hi>undefiled,</hi> we said is understood the Church, especially the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible

and property, and so of the same priviledges; the titles are spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:65401:182"/>
of before: The commendation is threefold, 1. She is <hi>one,</hi>
which sets her out not only with unity in her affections, but (to say
so) with a kind of onenesse in her self: Thus the visible Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church is one garden, <hi>vers.</hi> 2 comprehending many beds of
spices; one Church, made up here of many particular Churches:
And thus onenesse or unity, is a great commendation to her, or a
special part of her excellency. But, 2. the invisible Church is
but one, all believers make up one body; though there be many
of different growths, yet there is but one Bride: This is a singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
thing, and this makes for the scope, of commending the Bride;
and points out two things, 1. That all the excellencies in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
combine in one, and that must be excellent, every one of
them partakes of anothers excellency, by vertue of the mutual
union and communion they have with Christ, the Head and Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
and one with another, as the beauty of the face adornes the
leg, and the straightnesse of the legs commends the face, because
both hold forth one glorious body. 2. It illustrats her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
thus, There are many Queens stately, many Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines
and Virgins lovely amongst men, yet one cannot be all; but
(saith he) although there be many of these in the Church, yet is
she <hi>one,</hi> and although she be one, yet is she all, collectively sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up all.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>She is the only one of her mother:</hi> This sets her out singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
and exclusively, there is not another but she: By <hi>mother</hi>
here, is understood the Catholick Church, wherein children are
conceived and brought forth, she is the mother of all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
<hi>Gal. 4. 26. Ierusalem that is above, is free, which is the
mother of us all:</hi> This Church considered as from the beginning
of the world to the end, is one; and is the mother, in respect of
the Church considered as being in this or that place for the time
present, which is understood by <hi>us all,</hi> wherever we live, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to that mother, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 26. There is no Church but that
one, and who are begotten to God, are brought forth by her, and
belong to her.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>She is the choice one of her that bare her:</hi> This sets her out
comparatively, 1. She is the choice one in respect of the world,
this one Church is more excellent than the multitude of all the
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:65401:182"/>
societies that are there. 2. She is the choice one in respect of all
visible professors as such, she is beyond the daughters; amongst
all her mothers children, or prosessing members of the Church,
the believer doth excel. 3. The Church considered complexly
doth excel particular believers, as having all their excellencies
combined together: Or, the scope of these two verses, being to
prefer the Bride as singular, and eminently beyond all other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loveds,
whether Queens, Concubines, such as are joyned unto
men, or Virgins, such as are yet suited and sought for, we may
conceive it thus, my love, (saith he) my dove hath not a match,
but is chief; and as she called him the chief of all beloveds, <hi>Chap.</hi>
5. 10. so here he commends her as the most lovely of all Brides,
that can be wedded or wooed; although there be many of these:
Yet, 1. my dove is but <hi>one,</hi> that is, in respect of her singular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency,
she comprehends all. 2. <hi>She is the only one of her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
there are no moe of that family, that are born of that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
beside her self, that I can set my heart on, or can match with:
And thus, all the world beside the believer, is cryed down. 3. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively,
<hi>she is the choice one of her that bare her,</hi> that is, not
only by comparing her with the world, but by comparing her
with all meer external professors, she is still the choice of all.</p>
                  <p>That this is the scope, is clear, and the enumerating of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Queens, Concubins and Virgins, doth illustrat it, either by
shewing her singularity and perfection, as having all in her alone,
which is to be had in many; or, by preferring her to all, although
they be many: and thus in his commending of her, he is even
and equal with her in the commendation she gave him, which was
both comparative, that he was chief of ten thousand; and also
absolute and comprehensive, that he was all desires, that nothing
was wanting, but that all things desirable were comprehended in
him: so now he commends and extols her above all others, as
having more in her alone than was to be found in all others; to
shew that his love to her, and his estimation of her, was nothing
inferiour to hers of him, and that he was satisfied with her alone,
without seeking to multiply Queens or Concubins, as many men
of the world did.</p>
                  <p>This commendation out of Christ's mouth, of a Bride so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dutiful,
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:65401:183"/>
may seem strange; therefore, to make it unquestionable<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
he brings in a double confirmation, both which, respect what go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
before, to make it the more convincing. The first is in the
end of the ninth verse, and it is taken from that esteem that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
had of her, <hi>The daughters saw her, and they blessed her,</hi> &amp;c.
This beauty (saith he) is real and singular, even such that it
makes on-lookers, the most glorious and discerning (not only the
Daughters but even the Queens and Concubines) to be much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected;
the beauty of my Bride is such as takes them all up. The
<hi>daughters,</hi> that is, professors, <hi>saw her,</hi> they beheld this beauty
of hers (as <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 6.) and <hi>they blessed her,</hi> that is, 1. They
were convinced of her excellency, and accounted her blessed and
happy, as <hi>Mary</hi> saith of her self, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 48. And, 2. they wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
well to her, desiring God to blesse her, as, <hi>Psal. 129. 8. We
blesse you in the Name of the Lord;</hi> for, these two are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
in one man's blessing of another. Next, the <hi>Queens and
Concubins,</hi> that is, these who either in the world, or in the Church,
are thought most of, <hi>they praised her;</hi> by which is understood
some external expression of their esteem of her, and their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to paint out her excellency and beauty to the view of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
so as they might fall in love with her: As the first then
looks to the high thoughts, and inward esteem they had of her;
so this looks to the outward expression of that esteem, by which
they study to set her out in the eyes of all others: So they yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Bride to be excellent, and called her <hi>fairest among women,
Chap.</hi> 5. 9. which is an evidence of her lovelinesse, and of the
lovelinesse of grace in an exercised believer; and whatever o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
thought of her, yet that such praised her, it shews, there
was reality in the ground thereof. This is also spoken to their
commendation, who did thus commend her; And it holds out,
1. the notice which he takes of the thoughts and words which men
have of his Bride; our Lord knows what men say or think of his
people, and records it. 2. How pleasing it is to him, to have
them speaking respectively of her, especially when she is exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised
with any dark or afflicting dispensation.</p>

                  <p>The tenth verse may be taken as the expression of his own e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
of her, and so it begins the second proof of her excellency,
that not only they, but He esteems of her. Or, the words may
be looked on as the continuance of their praise, and be read thus,
<hi>They praised her,</hi> saying (as often that word is to be supplied)
<hi>who is she,</hi> &amp;c? If they be thus taken, the scope is the
same, holding forth their esteem of her; and his repeating of it,
shews his approbation thereof: and we incline to take the words
in this sense, because it continues the series better, and shews
their concurring in their thoughts of her, with what were his
thoughts, <hi>vers.</hi> 4. which is his scope. This is peculiarly taken
notice of by him as well grounded praise, upon this account, that
their thoughts were conform and agreeable to his. It will also
difference the two confirmations better to begin the second,
<hi>vers.</hi> 11. than to take the words simply as the Bridegrooms words,
wherein the same thing for substance with what was said, <hi>vers.</hi> 4.
is repeated. However, in these words, her lovelinesse is set out,
1. In the manner of expression here used, <hi>who is she?</hi> Like that,
<hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 6. which was spoken by the daughters, and so this looks
the liker to be spoken by them also, as wondering at her, What
is she? this <hi>she</hi> must be some singular person, and so it proves his
scope, laid down, <hi>vers.</hi> 9. 2. The matter of the words, sets out
her lovelinesse in four expressions or similitudes, tending to one
thing, namely to shew the lightsomnesse (to speak so) of the
Church, and her ravishing-beauty: The first similitude is, that
<hi>she looketh forth as the morning:</hi> The morning is lightsome, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with the night, and refreshful; so the Bride is like the
morning, compared with the world that is darknesse, and she is
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:65401:184"/>
lovely, chearing and heartsome to look-on beyond all others, so
the morning is often opposed to affliction and heartlesnesse, <hi>Isa.</hi>
58. 8. for, then birds and fields look chearful, that before were
dark and drooping. 2. She is <hi>fair as the Moon:</hi> The Moon is the
lesser of the two great lights, and was made to guid the night,
and is a glorious creature, shining above all stars; so is the Bride
like the Moon in a dark night, very conspicuous and beautiful,
and useful withall, to them that are acquaint with her. 3. She
is <hi>clear as the Sun:</hi> This speaks yet more of her splendor, her
taking-excellent beauty, and usefulnesse, for the direction and
comfort of the daughters that behold her; The Sun being the
most bright, lightsome and glorious creature of the world, and
the greater light that is singularly useful to the world. 4. She is
<hi>terrible as an army with banners,</hi> which was spoken to, on <hi>vers.</hi> 4.
and is here repeated, to shew that it is no common, effeminate
beauty, but a stately majesty, wherewith she is adorned, that hath
an awfulnesse in it towards men, and a prevailing efficacy towards
God. In sum, it describes the spiritual beauty of the Bride in
these properties, 1. That it is lightsome, and shining, there is
no true glory but this, which is like the light, all other beauty
is but dark; Grace maketh one shine <hi>like a light in a dark place,
Phil.</hi> 2. 15. 2. It's a growing beauty, every step of these simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
ascends higher and higher, till the Sun be rested in, <hi>The way
of the just is as the shining light, that shines more and more untill
the perfect day,</hi> Prov. 4. 24. 3. It's comprehensive, therefore it's
compared to lights of all sorts; There is somewhat in grace that
resembles every thing that is lovely, Gods Image being therein
eminently. 4. It is stately and awful, being convincing and cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivating
to on-lookers. 5. It is a beauty attended with a mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
and fighting condition, and therefore compared to armies:
The highest commendation of believers, doth insinuate them to
be in a fighting posture, and the more stayedly they maintain their
fight, and keep their posture, they will be the more beautiful.
6. A believer that prevails with Christ (as she did, <hi>vers.</hi> 4, 5.)
will also be awful to others, as here she is, and will prevail over
them, as the Lord saith to <hi>Iacob,</hi> Gen. 32. 28. <hi>Thou hast prevailed
with God,</hi> and then follows, <hi>thou shalt also prevail with men.</hi>

respecting what was said, <hi>vers.</hi> 4, 5. and it may be summed
thus, That must be stately beauty, that ravisheth me; (that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood)
but hers is such; This is proved from experience, <hi>I
went down</hi> (saith he) <hi>to the Garden of nuts</hi> (having withdrawn
from that sensible communion which was entertained with the
Spouse, as a man doth out of his chamber to his Garden) and was
looking to the case of my plants, according as the Bride had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed

ravished me, that I could not but return, and that speedily,

this cannot but be stately lovelinesse: Which agrees with,

whether he went, was to the <hi>Garden of nuts,</hi> that same which was
called the Garden and beds of Spices, <hi>vers.</hi> 2. His <hi>going down,</hi> is
his withdrawing from her sense, and as in that same place, so here,
his end is set out in two expressions (which expounds how he
feeds in his Gardens.) 1. It is to <hi>see the fruits of the valley:</hi>
The Church, called the Garden formerly, is here called the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,
because she is planted, as it were, in a good valley-soil,
where fruits use to thrive best. His going to <hi>see them,</hi> holds
forth his accurat observing in general how it is with them, and
his taking delight (as it were) to recreat himself by beholding
of them, as men do who visite their Gardens. Next, and more
particularly, it is <hi>to see whether the Vine flourished, and the Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granates
budded:</hi> By <hi>Vine</hi> and <hi>Pomegranate,</hi> are understood parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
believers, who are as several trees of his Garden, as was
cleared on <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. 13. Their <hi>flourishing,</hi> or <hi>budding,</hi> looks to
the beginnings of grace, scarce come to ripe fruit, but (as in the
bud, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 15.) being exceeding tender; and these are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
distinctly, beside the former general, of <hi>seeing</hi> the fruits;
To shew, 1. his taking particular notice of every particular be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever,
as a man that goes from tree to tree in his Garden. 2. His
special notice taking of beginners, and of the beginnings of his
work in them, as being especially delighted with the first buddings
of grace, and careful that nothing wrong them: This is his feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in his Gardens, and his gathering Lilies, to be delighted with
fruitfulnesse in his people, even with their weak and tender be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings,
and to be solicitously careful of their good, as men use
to be of the thriving of their fruit-trees.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Observ.</hi> 1. Where our Lord Jesus hath a Garden, which he
hath planted, and on which he takes pains, he looks for fruits; His
Garden should never want fruit. 2. There are diverse growths,
degrees or measures of grace amongst his people; for, some of his
trees have fruits, and some but blossoms. 3. Our Lord Jesus
takes special notice of his peoples fruitfulnesse, and that as parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
of every one of them, as if he went from one to another
(as the Gardener doth from tree to tree) to discover it. 4. Our
Lord Jesus is especially delighted with the kindly blossomings of
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:65401:185"/>
beginners, and he takes especial notice of the young and tender
buddings of their grace, and will be so far from crushing them,
because they are not ripe fruits, that he will more tenderly care
for them. 5. Our Lord Jesus accuratly takes notice of his Brides
carriage, and expects her fruitfulnesse, when he seems to her sense
to be absent, and is especially much delighted with it then; for,
when he is gone down to his Garden, this is the errand, to <hi>see the
fruits of the valley, whether,</hi> &amp;c. when he withdraws, he hath a
friendly design, yet, saith he, although that was intended, I was
made (as it were) to alter my purpose, and not to stay.</p>
                  <p>And so we come to the 12. verse, in which is set down, how
suddenly he is transported with affection to his Bride; while he
is viewing her graces in his absence from her, he is so taken with
love to her, that he can stay no longer from her. We may consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in the verse, these three things<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 1. An effect, as it were,
wrought on him, He <hi>is made like the Chariots of Amminadib,</hi> or,
<hi>set as in the Chariots of Amminadib:</hi> Chariots were used to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
with, and that for the greater speed; or, they were used in
war, for driving furiously (like <hi>Iehu</hi>) and mightily, over difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and obstructions in the way; The word <hi>Amminadib</hi> may be
read in one word, and it is to be taken for a proper name of a
Prince, and thus the expression sets out excellent Chariots, such
as belonged possibly to some such valiant men of that name; or
it may be read in two words, <hi>Ammi nadib,</hi> which in the Original
signifie, <hi>my willing people:</hi> So, <hi>Ammi</hi> signifieth, my people, as, <hi>Hos.</hi>
2. 1 Say to your brethren <hi>Ammi,</hi> that is, my people; And
<hi>Nadib</hi> is the same word that is rendered, <hi>Psal. 110. 3. willing,</hi>
Thy people shall <hi>be willing;</hi> It's a princely beautifulnesse and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingnesse.
The word, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. 1. O <hi>Princes</hi> daughter, is from
the same root, and we rather take it so here, as being more suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the scope, which shews what effect his Brides affection had
on him, and the word is often so elsewhere translated; and so it
may be rendered, the Chariots of my princely willing people:
They get this name for their princely behaviour, in wrestling with
him under difficulties. Again, the word, <hi>I was made,</hi> may be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
<hi>was set</hi> (according to the more usual interpretation of the
word) thus the effect may be taken two wayes, to one scope,
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:65401:186"/>
1. I was made like the most swift Chariots for speedy return,
that nothing could detain me from returning to my Bride. Or,
2. if we may call the prayers, faith and love of his people, their
Chariots, he is set on them, as taking pleasure to ride and triumph
in them, and to be brought back by them, as if by Chariots sent
from them he had been overcome: And this suits with what is
spoken, <hi>vers.</hi> 5. for, while he accounts her as an army; these must
needs be her weapons and Chariots, to wit, a longing willingnesse
to be at him, and soul-sicknesse, casting her eyes after him, and in
a manner, even fainting for him.</p>
                  <p>2. There is the manner how this effect is brought about, He is
suddenly, as it were, surprized, <hi>or ever I was aware,</hi> &amp;c. I knew
not (as if he said) till I was transported with an irresistable power
of love toward my Bride, who in the exercise of faith, repentance
and prayer, was seeking after me, while I had withdrawn my self.
The expression is borrowed from men (for, properly it agrees not
to him) who by sudden effects that fall out beyond their expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
use to aggrege the wonderfulnesse of the cause that brings
them about: Thus, I know not how it was, it was or I was aware,
or, while I was not thinking on it, so forcibly, and, as it were, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensibly
the thing prevailed over me: Christ expresseth it thus,
to shew the wonderfulnesse of the thing that came on him, that
he could not but do it, and could not shun it, more than if he
had had no time to deliberat about it. This narration of
Christ's, is not to resent that effect, but to shew how natively it
was brought forth, so that when they (to say so) sent their
Chariots to him, and did cast a look after him, he could not but
yield, because he would yield, as the third thing in the verse
shews, and that is, what it was that so easily prevailed with him,
the cause is within himself that set him on these Chariots of his
willing people, and made him to be overcome, it was even <hi>his
soul, my soul made me,</hi> or <hi>set me,</hi> that is, my inward soul, my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
my bowels were so kindled (as it's <hi>Ier.</hi> 31. 20.) and my
soul cleaved so to my loving and longing Bride, and was so stirred
with her exercise, that I could not but hastily and speedily yield,
because I could not resist my own affections. Hence, <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingnesse
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:65401:186"/>
is much prized by Jesus Christ, when the soul yields to
open to him, and longs for him, <hi>vers.</hi> 5. and cannot want him,
there Christ (as <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 6.) will not, and cannot continue at a
distance. 2. Although Christ's affection doth not properly sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
him, nor do the effects thereof fall from him inadvertantly,
but most deliberatly, yet both his affection and the effects there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
are most wonderful and astonishing in themselves, and ought
as such, in a singular manner to affect us. 3. The first rise and
cause of all the believers good, and that which makes their faith,
prayer, love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> bear weight with Christ, is in himself; It's his
own soul, and good-will that overcomes and prevails with him
in all these: It is not any worth or power in their graces, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
in themselves, that hath this influence upon him, but his
intimate love to believers themselves, that makes their graces
have such weight with him: All that ever came speed with him,
were prevented by his love. 4. The believer hath a notable
friend in Christ's own bosome, his soul is friendly to them, and is
in a kindly-way affected with their conditions, even though in his
dispensations no such thing appear: And while he is man, and hath
a soul, they want not a friend. 5. Considering this as the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of his soul, when he was withdrawn to her sense, and she was
complaining, <hi>Observe,</hi> That Christ's bowels and soul are never
more affected toward his people, then when he seems most offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with them, and when they are most affected with the wrongs
done to him, <hi>Ier. 31. 19, 20. Iudg.</hi> 10. 16. There be many incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable
turnings in his bowels, even when he seems to speak
against them to their sense, then he <hi>earnestly remembers them still,</hi>
and their friend <hi>love,</hi> steps to, and takes part for them, and so
prevails, that by his own bowels he is restrained from execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the fiercenesse of his anger (<hi>Hos.</hi> 11. 8. compared with 9.)
and constrained even when he is provoked to take some other
course, to expresse marvellous loving kindnesse to them.</p>

return, that we may look upon thee:
what will ye see in the Shulamite? as it
were the company of two armies.</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>The thirteenth verse continueth the same scope, and is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of the interpretation given of the former verse, and a
new expression of his love, whereby as a kind husband, having for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
bypast failings in his wife, he invites her to return to her
former familiarity, with a motive signifying the love which he
had to her, and that upon so good ground (in his gracious estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
as that by her yielding to return, he puts no question, but
what he had spoken of her stately terriblenesse, would be found
to be a truth. The verse contains these three, 1. A most affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionat
invitation. 2. A most loving motive proposed, perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to embrace it, which is his end. 3. An objection removed,
whereby the motive is confirmed and illustrate. In the exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or invitation, Consider, 1. the party invited, or called.
2. The duty called for. 3. It's repetition. The party called, is
a <hi>Shulamite:</hi> This word comes either from <hi>Solomon,</hi> as the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
name is named over the wife, <hi>Isa.</hi> 4. 1. and it's from the
same root that signifies peace, from which <hi>Solomon</hi> had his name;
and it is in the feminine gener, because it's applyed to the Bride:
Thus it holdeth forth, 1. the strict union betwixt him and her,
that she with him partakes of the same name: See <hi>Ier.</hi> 23. 6.
compared with <hi>Ier.</hi> 33. 16. where ye will find the like communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of his name to her. 2. It shews the priviledge she was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
unto, through her tye to him and union with him, by
which she is made his, and is admitted to share with him in all
that is his; for, it is not an empty stile she gets, while called by
his name, it being to signifie that she was his, and that whatever
he had (whereof she was capable, and might be for her good) was
hers. 3. It shews his affection that he so names her now, wishing her
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:65401:187"/>
a part of his own peace, and intitling her to it. Or, 2. this word
may be derived from <hi>Salem,</hi> which properly taken, is <hi>Ierusalem,
Psal.</hi> 76. 1. and <hi>Heb. 7. 1. Melchisedec</hi> was king of <hi>Salem,</hi> which
signifieth peace, and so, as Shunamitish comes from <hi>Shunem,</hi> so
Shulamite from <hi>Salem,</hi> and so taking the derivation thus, it
comes to the same thing with the former, both being derived
from the same root; And this holds forth his respect to her, as
acknowledging her new-birth and Original from the new <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem.</hi>
2. The exhortation is, <hi>return:</hi> This implyes, 1. a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
whether in respect of sin, <hi>Ier.</hi> 3. 1. for, sin breeds distance
betwixt Christ and his people, <hi>Isa.</hi> 59. 2. or, in respect of sensible
manifestations of his love; for, howsoever, the distance brought
on by sin, was in some measure taken away, and she returned to
her former obedience and wonted tendernesse, yet she wants the
sense of his love, and is seeking after it: <hi>return,</hi> here then, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth
somewhat of these. 2. A duty laid on her, to quite this
distance and to return; this the very expression bears. 3. A
kind offer of welcome, which is implyed in his offers and exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
whenever he calls: So <hi>Ier. 3. 14. Ier.</hi> 4. 1. and thus the
sense is, as if he had said, There hath been a distance betwixt us,
and thou art suspicious of my love; but, return and come hither,
and neither thy former <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>aults, nor present jealousie shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred;
and this shews, that the words are his, both because
the scope is continued, and also because none can call the Bride
properly or effectually to return, but he, neither would the voice
of another be so confirming to her of his affection, and his scope
is to confirm her, as to that.</p>
                  <p>3. This exhortation is twice doubled, <hi>Return, return,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
<hi>return, return:</hi> 1. To shew the hazard she was in. 2. Her
duty to prevent it. 3. The necessity of speedy putting the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation
in practice. 4. The difficulty that there was to bring
her over her discouragements. 5. His great and earnest desire to
have them all removed, and to have the duty performed. These
words shew, 1. That there may be a distance betwixt Christ and
his Bride; even the beautiful believer may fall into a distance of
sin, 2. of indisposition, 3. of comfortlessnesse, and 4. of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
and heartlessnesse, which follows on the former.
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:65401:188"/>
2. There is often a loathnesse to come home, when there hath been
a straying; discouragement and shame may prevail so far, as to s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ar
fainting believers (who fain would have him) from hearty apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his allowances to themselves. 3. Souls that are at distance
with Christ, whatever kind of distance it be, would not sit down
under it, or give way to it, but wrestle from under it, over all diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
that are in their way. 4. This would be done speedily, and
without all delay, dispute or dalying, therefore doth the Lord so
double his call; there will sure, be no advantage by delaying, or
putting off this great businesse of returning from our distance
to him. 5. The return of a believer after a slip, to confident
walking with Christ, and comforting of themselves in him, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
by him and well pleasing to him, as well as the conversion
and coming home of a sinner at first. 6. Believers after their slips,
are not easily perswaded of Christ's kindnesse, in the measure that
he hath it to them; nor are they easily brought to that confidence
of it, that formerly they had. 7. Our Lord Jesus allows his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to be fully confident of his love, and of obtaining welcome
from him; for which reasons this return, as a sure evidence and
testimony of his kind and hearty welcome, is four times repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
to shew that he is intreating and waiting for it, and cannot
abide to have it delayed.</p>
                  <p>2. The end proposed, that makes him so serious, is in these
words, <hi>that we may look upon thee:</hi> It doth him good (to speak
so) to get a sight of her: This looking of his, is not for curiosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but for delightsome satisfaction to his affection, as one desires
to look upon what he loves, so, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 14. speaking to his Bride,
<hi>Let me see</hi> (saith he) <hi>thy face, for thy countenance is comely.</hi>
This is to take away all jealousie from the Bride, and to shew how
he was taken with her, so that her returning would be a singular
pleasure to him, which is indeed wonderful.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. Our Lord Jesus allows the Bride, when returning to
him after her departings from him, to be confident in him, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
with him. 2. The more that nearnesse to him be sought
after and entertained, he is the more satisfied. 3. When believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
hide themselves from Christ, even though it be through dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement,
and upon just ground and reason, as they think; yet
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:65401:188"/>
doth it some way mar Christ's delightsome complacency, and he
is not satisfied till they shake off their discouragement, and shew
themselves to him with confidence.</p>
                  <p>Again, we would consider, that it is not said, that I <hi>may</hi> look
on thee; but, that <hi>we,</hi> &amp;c. Which is to shew, that she is delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
to many, her beauty may be seen by any that will look upon
her: This word, <hi>we,</hi> 1. may import the blessed Trinity, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Son and Spirit, as, <hi>Chap. 1. 11. we will make,</hi> &amp;c. A returning sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
will be welcome to all the persons of the Godhead. 2. <hi>We,</hi> that
is, I with the Angels, who (<hi>Luk.</hi> 15. 10.) <hi>rejoice at the conversion
of a sinner.</hi> And, 3. <hi>we</hi> may import, I and all the daughters that
admire thee. The thriving of one believer, or, the returning of
a sinner may make many cheerful, and is to be accounted a lovely
thing by all the professors of Religion.</p>
                  <p>3. The third thing in the verse, comes-in by way of question,
either to highten the lovelinesse that is in Christ's Bride; what is
it that is to be seen in her? as, <hi>Luk. 7. 24. &amp;c.</hi> what went ye
out for to see? No common sight: or, it is to meet with an
objection that strangers may have, what delightsome thing is to
be seen in her, that seems so despicable? Or, she her self might
object, what is in me worth the seeing? It may be, when it is well
seen, that it be lesse thought of. The Lord to prevent such
doubts, especially in her, moves the question, that he himself
may give the answer; <hi>what</hi> (saith he) <hi>will ye see in the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>lamite?</hi>
(that is) which may be pleasant, and delightful; and he answers,
<hi>as it were the company of two armies;</hi> which in general holds out,
1. We will see much majesty and statelinesse in her; even so much
as I have asserted, in comparing her to an <hi>army with banners.</hi>
2. Two armies may be mentioned, to shew, that when she is
rightly, and with a believing eye looked upon, her beauty will
appear to be double to what it was said to be; and so, <hi>two ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi>
signifie an excellent army, as, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 1, 2. God's hosts of
Angels get the same name in the Original, it's <hi>Mahanaim,</hi> that
same which <hi>Iacob</hi> imposeth as the name upon the place, where
these hosts of Angels met him; and there may be an allusion to
this, these two wayes, 1. Ask ye what is to be seen in her? even
as it were <hi>Mahanaim,</hi> that is, for excellency she is like an host of
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:65401:189"/>
Angels, such as appeared to <hi>Iacob;</hi> she is an Angelick fight, more
than an ordinary army: this is a notable commendation, and serves
his purpose well, which is to confirm her: and therefore, that
his poor Bride may be incouraged to presse-in on him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to him, he tells her, she may be as homely with him as An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
that are holy and sinlesse creatures; which is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
priviledge, yet such as is allowed on his people, by him
who hath not taken on the nature of Angels, but of men, that he
might purchase them a room amongst Angels <hi>that stand by,</hi> Zech.
3. 6, 7. 2. It may allude thus, what is to be seen in her? what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it be to the world, it is to me (saith he) excellent and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshful,
as these hosts of Angels were to <hi>Iacob</hi> at <hi>Mahanaim,</hi>
when he had been rescued from <hi>Laban,</hi> and was to meet with
<hi>Esau:</hi> either of these suits well the scope, and saith, it will be,
and is a sweet and refreshful meeting, that is betwixt Christ and
a returning sinner, a little view whereof is in that parable, <hi>Luk.</hi>
15. 20. of the Prodigal his fathers hearty receiving of his lost son,
and making himself and all his servants merry with him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. Our Lord is very tender of believers doubts and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities,
and therefore prevents their objections which they may
make, by giving answers to them, before the objections be well
formed or stated in their hearts. 2. Believers may, and usually
do, wonder what ground there is in them, for such kindnesse as
Christ shews to them, when he magnifieth them and their graces
so much, that are so defective and full of blemishes: And indeed
it's such, that are readiest to wonder most at his love, and esteem
least of themselves, whom he makes most of, and of whom he hath
the greatest esteem. 3. It's a wonderful welcome that Christ
gives to repenting sinners, he receives them as Angels, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
them to such freedom with him, and hath such esteem of
them, as if they were Angels; for, to be received <hi>as an Angel,</hi>
signifies honourable and loving entertainment, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 14. 4. The
returning of sinners to Christ, and Christ's loving welcome which
he gives them upon their return, makes a heartsome and refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
meeting betwixt him and them: And O what satisfaction and
joy shall there be, when they being all gathered together, shall
meet with him at the last day!</p>

scope, stile and expressions being so like unto, and co-incident
with what went before; and what is spoken in the first person,
<hi>vers.</hi> 8. can be applyed to none other, neither would it become
any to speak thus but himself, his love is inlarged and loosed (as
it were) in it's expressions, and this love of his is indeed a depth,
that is not easily reached. In this commendation, he doth first
enumerat ten particulars (as she had done when she commended
him, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.) Then, 2. he shews his acquiescing in her, as being
ravished with her beauty, <hi>vers.</hi> 6. &amp;c. We had occasion to say
something in the general of such commendations, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. 1. which
is now to be remembred, but not repeated; we take this to be
understood after the same manner as that was, and although the
visible Church be in some respect Christ's Bride, and therefore,
we will not condemn the application of some of the parts of this
commendation to her, as so considered; yet, since the scope is
mainly to comfort true believers, as differenced from others, and
that it is she to whom he speaks, who had ravished him with her
eyes in the former Chapter (which can agree properly to the true
believer only) and considering also, that some parts of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
do respect inherent grace in his people (and indeed it
is this which is the great ground of the Brides commendation)
we therefore incline still to take these commendations, as holding
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:65401:190"/>
forth the continuance of the expressions of Christ's love to these,
who are his own by sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ing saith; and so much the rather, as the
words being taken so, are of special and particular use for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.</p>
                  <p>There are four differences in this commendation, from that
mentioned, <hi>chap.</hi> 4. and that which was spoken to, on <hi>chap.</hi> 6. 6, 7.
which by answering four questions, we shall clear.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> 1. Wherefore is this subjoined now, after so large a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
in the words immediatly preceeding. <hi>Ans.</hi> The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
commendation shews Christ's love to his Bride (to say so)
immediatly after their marriage, or on the back of some agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
after an out-cast; but, this is added, to shew what is
Christ's ordinary way of carriage to his people, and what are his
usual thoughts (to say so) of them; he is not kind only at fits
(as men sometimes use to be, and do not continue) or, when he
was surprized (as it were) with a sudden gale of affection, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. 12.
no, he is constantly kind; and therefore, these expressions are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ow
renewed, to shew that such are his ordinary kind wayes of dealing
towards them, even when there is no connexion betwixt his
dealing and their present condition, nor any thing in them that
can be looked on as the immediat rise thereof: Our blessed Lord
is a most fair, loving and friendly speaker unto, and converser
with his Bride.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> 2. Why is this commendation inlarged beyond the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
having moe particulars in it? <hi>Ans.</hi> Thereby the Lord
shews, 1. the soveraignty of his love, in making the intimations
thereof, lesse or more as he pleaseth. 2. The last commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is most full, in expressing the riches of his love, to shew that
Christ never speaks so kindly to one of his own, but there is
more behind in his heart than hath yet vented it self, and that
there is more which they may expect from him, than they have
yet met with, however that may be very much. 3. It's to make
it the fresher unto them, when by this it is evidenced to be a
new intimation of his kindnesse, although it proceed on the same
grounds, on which former intimations did; and this may be a
reason also of the third difference, and question following,
which is,</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="377" facs="tcp:65401:190"/>
3. Why are the same parts named, as <hi>eyes, hair,</hi> &amp;c. and yet
the commendation is different from what it was, for the most
part? <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. This is to shew the beauty of grace, which is such,
that one commendation cannot reach it. 2. The account that
he in his love hath of her, which is so great, that one expression
doth not fully answer it. 3. The various and abundant wayes,
that love hath to speak comfortably to a believer, there is strange
eloquence and rhetorick in the love of Christ, when he thinks
good to vent it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> 4. Why is the way he followed before changed? He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
formerly at the head, now at the feet? <hi>Ans.</hi> This is also a
piece of his soveraignty, and shews how he delights to vary the
expressions of his love to his people; and that it may be seen,
that whatever way we will follow in looking upon grace in a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever,
it is still beautiful in it self, and acceptable to him.</p>

commended. 3. The commendation it self. 4. The manner of
expressing of it. First, the title is, <hi>O princes daughter!</hi> This was

general, to usher-in all that follows, and to make it the more
gaining on her affection: The word in the first Language is, <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

which signifies a bounteous prince, or, one of a princely dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
<hi>Isa.</hi> 32. 5. It's given to the visible Church, <hi>Psal.</hi> 45. 13.
<hi>The Kings daughter is all glorious within.</hi> For more full taking
up of the meaning, consider, that it doth here include these three,
1. A noblenesse and greatnesse in respect of birth, that the Bride
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:65401:191"/>
is honourably descended: From which we may learn, That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
(whatever they be in respect of the flesh) are of a roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
descent and kindred, <hi>a royal priesthood,</hi> 1. Pet. 2. 9. <hi>sons and
daughters to the Lord God Almighty,</hi> 2. Cor. 6. 18. 2. It respects
her qualifications, as being princely in her carriage, suitable to
such a birth, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 10. 17. Hence observe, the believer should
be of a princely disposition and carriage, and when he is right, he
will be so; for, he is indued with princely qualifications, with
noble and excellent principles, beyond the most generous, noble,
gallant and stately dispositions of men in the world: A believer
when right, or in good case, is a princely person indeed. 3. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
her provision and expectation; that she is provided for,
waited upon, and to be dealt with, and even dalted, not as chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of mean persons, but of princes, to whom it is her <hi>fathers
good pleasure to give a Kingdom,</hi> and such a one as is <hi>undefiled, and
fadeth not away,</hi> Luk. 12. 32. 1 Pet. 1. 4. Hence observe, That
the believer is royally dealt with by Jesus Christ, and hath a roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
princely allowance bestowed on him; the charter of Adoption
takes-in very much, even to <hi>inherit with him all things:</hi> No lesse
than this may be expected, and is the claim of a daughter to the
King of Kings, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 7.</p>
                  <p>2. The part commended is, <hi>the feet,</hi> by which a believers walk
and conversation, as grace shines in it, is understood, as we may
see frequently, <hi>Psal. 119. v.</hi> 59. 101. 105. So likewise shedding of
blood, or other defiling sins, such as leave soul prints upon a
mans conversation behind them, are called the <hi>iniquities of the
heels,</hi> Psal. 49. 5. by which the nakednesse and offensivenesse of
ones conversation is let forth: And on the contrary, the Brides
feet thus commended, set out her good conversation.</p>
                  <p>3. Her feet are commended from this, that they are not bare,
but, <hi>beautiful with shoes:</hi> To be bare-footed, imports three
things in Scripture, 1. A shameful condition, <hi>Isa.</hi> 20. 4. 2. A
present sad affliction, the sense whereof makes men carelesse of
what is adorning; So <hi>David,</hi> 2 Sam. 15. 30. under heavy afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
walks bare-footed. 3. An unfitnesse for travel: Therefore,
when the people were to be in readinesse for their journey, <hi>Exod.</hi>
1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>. 11. their feet were to be shod: So then, to have on shoes,
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:65401:191"/>
doth on the contrary import three things, 1. The honourable estate
and dignity to which believers are advanced; and more especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
it holds out a singular beautifulnesse in their walk, whereby
their shame is covered. 2. A thriving in their spiritual condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
3. A readinesse and promptnesse of obedience, to what
they are called unto: All which are beautiful in themselves, and
adorning to the believer. We take it, in a word, to hold out a
conversation such <hi>as becomes the Gospel,</hi> Philip. 1. 27. which is, to
have <hi>the feet shod with the preparation of the Gospel of peace,</hi> Eph.
6. 15. because, that as by shoes, men are enabled to walk with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
hurt in rough ground, and are in the company of others not
ashamed of their nakednesse; So, a Gospel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap> conversation quiets the
mind, keeping it in peace against difficulties, and doth exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
strengthen the confidence of believers in their conversing with
others, and becomes exceeding lovely, that they care not (as it
were) who see them, as, <hi>Ezek. 16. 10. I shod thee,</hi> &amp;c. whereas a
disorderly conversation is shameful, even like one that is bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>footed.</p>
                  <p>4. The manner of the expression is, to aggrege the lovelinesse
of a well ordered walk, <hi>How beautiful are thy feet with shoes!</hi> It
cannot be told how beautiful a tender and well ordered conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
is, it is exceeding lovely, and acceptable to me (saith he)
to see thy holy walk.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. Our Lord Jesus takes notice of every step of a believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
carriage, and can tell whether their <hi>feet</hi> be <hi>shod</hi> or bare, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
their conversation be such as adorneth, or shameth the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.
2. The believer hath, or at least ought to have, and if he
be like himself, will have a well ordered walk, and will be in his
carriage stately and princely. 3. A conversation that is well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
is a beautiful and pleasant thing; grace exercised in a
Christians practice, is more commendable to Christ, than either
greatnesse, riches, wisdom, or what the world esteems most of,
none of these hath such a commendation from Christ, as the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever,
who, it may be, is not much in the world's esteem: Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical
holinesse is a main part of spiritual beauty, and is valuable
above speculative knowledge and many gifts. 4. Believers should
be <hi>walking</hi> creatures, therefore hath the new nature <hi>feet,</hi> that is,
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:65401:192"/>
they should be much in the practice of holy duties, according to
the commands he hath given in his word; and in their way, they
should be making progresse towards perfection; for, that is their
mark, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. 13. Sitting still, or negligence, much more go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
backward is unlike a believer. 5. The conversation of all
others, though never so fairded with much civility, and great
profession, and many parts, is yet naked and abominable before
God, and subject to bruisings, stumblings, and such inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
as feet that are bare are lyable to. 6. A well ordered walk is
sure and safe: <hi>He that walks uprightly walks surely,</hi> Prov. 10. 9.
And, saith the Psalmist, <hi>Great peace have they who love thy law, and
nothing shall offend them,</hi> Psal. 119. 165. Their feet are shod against
an evil time, and there is nothing safer when offences abound
than that.</p>
                  <p>The second part of the commendation is to the same scope,
<hi>The joints of thy thighs,</hi> &amp;c. It's the coupling and turnings of them,
as the word bears; they are also useful in motion, and help the
feet to stir, the same thing is intended as in <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 15. by his
thighs or legs; only it seems to look to the principles of their
walk, as the feet do respect their way more immediatly: These
are compared to <hi>Iewels,</hi> which are precious and comely, serving
much for adorning; and it is not to ordinary Jewels, to which
they are compared, but such as are the <hi>work of the hands of a cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
skilful artificer, or workman,</hi> that is, such as are set orderly
and dexterously, by skill and Art; the work not of a novice, but
of one that is expert, by which, not only the matter of their
practice is holden forth to be solid, but also, in respect of the
principles from which their way and duties have their spring and
rise, and the manner of their performing them, they are rightly
gone about, with an holy kind of Art and dexterity: Which saith,
1. That there are many things necessarily concurring in a well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
conversation; there must be skill to do rightly, what is in
it self right, to make it commendable: It is needful that holy
duties, and what is on the matter called for, be done in the right
manner, and according to Art, and not put-by thus and so.
2. Believers are singularly expert, in doing of the same duties of
Religion which other men do, they do them in another manner.
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:65401:192"/>
3. The several pieces of a holy walk, are in a manner but spilt,
when not rightly ordered, and every one put in their own place,
like Jewels undexterously set by one that is unskilful. 4. There
is an holy Art required to these that would walk commendably,
and men naturally are unskilful in such practices, untill they be
taught them. 5. Being right in the manner, is no lesse necessary
to make a mans way commendable, than to be right in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as much of the commendation lyes in this, as in the other;
when these two go together in a believers conversation, it's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
and beautiful, there is no Jewel, most finely set, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to a well ordered walk. 6. Believers that use to walk in
the way of godlinesse, may attain to this spiritual dexterity and
skilfulnesse in a great measure; and there is no other way of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
of it, but by accustoming our selves to it; when her feet
are once shod, this commendation follows, that <hi>the joints of her
thighs are like Iewels.</hi>

                  <p>In the second verse, the Lord proceeds from the <hi>thighs,</hi> to the
<hi>navel</hi> and <hi>belly:</hi> which parts, were not touched in her commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>chap.</hi> 4. These parts in mens bodies have not much beauty in
them; and therefore, it seems, that by them the Lord points ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at what is inward and useful, in the spiritual complexion and
constitution of believers, than what is outward and visible in their
walk, that serving no lesse to their commendation than this.</p>
                  <p>The navel hath much influence on the intestines, and when it is
sound, it furthers much the health of the whole body; So, <hi>Prov.</hi>
3. 8. it's said, the fear of the Lord <hi>shall be health to thy navel, and
marrow to thy bones,</hi> that is, it will be exceeding useful and profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
for thy well-being, as it's useful for the body to have that
part in good case: And on the contrary, a wretched miserable
condition (such as is our condition by nature) is described by
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:65401:193"/>
this, <hi>Thy navel was not cut,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ezek</hi> 16. 4. It's known also, that
in nature, the navel hath much influence on the child in the
womb, which may be especially taken notice of here, as appears
by the following commendation, namely, that <hi>it's like a round
goblet,</hi> that is, well formed and proportioned (opposit to a <hi>navel
not cut,</hi> Ezek. 16. 4.) <hi>which wanteth not liquor,</hi> that is, furnished
with moisture for the health of the body, or entertainment and
nourishment of the child in the womb.</p>
                  <p>Before we further clear the words, or observe any thing from
them, we shall joyn to this the fourth part here commended, and
that is, <hi>the belly:</hi> The word differs in the Original, from that
which is translated <hi>belly,</hi> being spoken of him, <hi>chap.</hi> 5. 14. and it
is taken for the inward parts, <hi>Ier. 15. 35. Prov.</hi> 18. 8. It hath
a special influence on the health of the body, and on the bringing
forth of children: It's here compared to <hi>an heap of wheat;</hi> To
an <hi>heap,</hi> to shew her bignesse, as being with child, and still fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and that in abundance: To <hi>an heap of</hi> the grain of <hi>wheat,</hi>
To shew, it was not big with wind, but with good grain, even
the best, whereby she feeds him, her self, and others: And so, as
in the former similitude, she is represented to be furnished with
liquor, so here she is set forth to be furnished with bread, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
her spiritual livelinesse and healthfulnesse may be understood.
Again, this heap of wheat is said to be <hi>set about with lilies,</hi> not
only thereby to expresse it's beautifulnesse, with it's usefulnesse,
but also the fruitfulnesse thereof, in having particular graces as
lilies growing about it, which are moistened and nourished by
these two parts, the navel and the belly. Now we conceive, that
most likely (though it be hard to be peremptory) the graces of
the Spirit may be understood here, which being infused in their
habits, and drawn forth in their actings by the influences of the
Spirit, are compared to waters and liquor, and are said to be in
the <hi>belly</hi> of the believer, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7. 38. (<hi>He that believes on me,
out of his belly shall flow rivers of waters</hi>) because they have such
influence on the new man, and (to speak so) are the health of the
<hi>navel</hi> thereof. In sum, the sense of the words comes to this, O
princes daughter, thou hast a lively spiritual constitution, by the
inward flowings of the Spirit, whereby thy <hi>navel</hi> is formed and
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:65401:193"/>
beautified (which was by nature otherwise) and therefore thou
art not barren, but fruitful, and that of the most precious fruits.
Hence observe, 1. that believers inward constitution and frame,
is no lesse beautiful than their outward conversation and walk:
This <hi>Kings daughter is all glorious within,</hi> Psal. 45. 13. 2. Sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
within, or heart-soundnesse is no lesse needful than outward
fruits, for compleating a believers commendation; to have the
<hi>navel</hi> well formed, is as necessary and requisit, as to have the <hi>feet
beautiful with shoes.</hi> 3. Inward livelinesse, or a well furnished
inside, hath most influence on a believers livelinesse in all exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
duties: This keeps all fresh, being like precious liquor
which makes Christ's Spouse fruitful and big, and that not
with wind, but wheat.</p>

scope in short is to shew, that the believer is not only a beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
bride, but a fruitful mother for bringing forth, <hi>vers.</hi> 2. and
nourishing and bringing-up, v. 3. which was (especially in these
times) a great commendation of a wife, and a thing that ingaged

because they dwell in God, and in his son, Jesus Christ.
And so we may here observe, 1. Faith is a precious defence; for,
Christ is a precious hiding-place, and faith must be precious, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Christ is precious: Hence it is not only precious as Ivory,
but <hi>much more precious than Gold,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 7. 2. Faith is a sure
defence, and is the believers tower, whereto he betakes himself
when he hath to do. 3. It is lovely and pleasant to Christ, when
believers by faith betake themselves to him; He will never quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
with them for it, seing he so commends it. 4. There is no
safe tower to any of the world, but what the believer hath; for,
he, and he only, hath a tower of Ivory to make use of: Christ is
the only rock and sure foundation, and it's only believers that
build their house upon him.</p>
                  <p>The seventh part instanced, is <hi>her eyes,</hi> which were several times
mentioned before; they point at her spiritual discerning, and
understanding of spiritual things, and the believing-uptaking of
them; in which respect, all natural men are blind, because of their
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:65401:194"/>
ignorance and unbelief; she only hath <hi>eyes.</hi> They are compared
to <hi>fish-pools in Heshbon, at the gate of Beth-rabbim:</hi> This city
<hi>Heshbon</hi> is mentioned, <hi>Numb.</hi> 21. 25, 26. It was a royal city, where
<hi>Si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>on</hi> King of the Amorits dwelt; and it's like, there hath been
some place there called <hi>Beth-rabbim,</hi> for the great resort that was
made thereunto: And the fish-pools that were there, it seems,
were excellent and clear, and fit to give a shaddow to these who
looked into them. Now it would seem, that believers eyes are
compared to these pools, because of the clear, distinct and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
knowledge they have of themselves, of Christ, and of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
spiritual objects. And from this we may observe, 1. That
solid and distinct knowledge in spiritual things, is very commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable.
2. That a believer hath another kind of insight in spirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual
things, than the most understanding natural man, he hath <hi>eyes</hi>
in respect of him; The natural man (who hath no exprimental,
nor believing knowledge of spiritual things) is but blind. 3. He
is sharpest sighted that discerns himself, and can rightly take up
his own condition; <hi>the wisdom of the prudent is to understand his
way:</hi> So believers eyes, or knowledge is compared to a fish-pond,
that gives representations of a mans face to him.</p>
                  <p>The eight particular is, the <hi>nose</hi> (it was not mentioned in her
commendation, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.) It is not to be taken here for the whole
countenance, but for a part thereof: Therefore it is distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the eyes, and is described as being eminent (like a
tower) beyond the rest of the face, and so it is to be applyed to
the nose properly, which ariseth with a height on the face, like a
tower, and is the feat of smelling to discover what is hurtful, or
savory; also anger or zeal appear in it, therefore is it in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
Language in the Old Testament, sometimes put for these,
because it shews a real indignation, when a mans anger smokes
forth at his nose, <hi>Psal.</hi> 18. 8. It's said, 1. to be like <hi>the tower of
Lebnon:</hi> There is no particular mention of such a tower, but,
that <hi>Solomon</hi> built there a stately house, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 8. 3. called the
<hi>house of the forrest of Lebanon,</hi> wherein, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 9. 15, 16. he put
many <hi>targets</hi> and <hi>shields;</hi> and <hi>Lebanon</hi> being on the north of
<hi>Iulah,</hi> near to <hi>Syria</hi> (where enemies soon brake out against <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>)
it's not unlike, but either this house was made use of as a
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:65401:195"/>
frontier-tower, or that some other was there builded, for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
of hurt from that hand, to which this alludes. Next,
this tower is said to look toward <hi>Damascus: Damascus</hi> was the
head City of <hi>Syria;</hi> So, <hi>Isa.</hi> 7. 8. It's said, <hi>the head of Syria is Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mascus;</hi>
these that dwelt in it, were at that time amongst the
most malicious enemies that Israel had: They were so in <hi>Davids</hi>
time, a <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. 5. he slew two and twenty thousand of them;
They were so in <hi>Solomons</hi> time, 1 <hi>King. 11. 24. Rezon</hi> (whom
God raised up to be an enemy to him) did reign in <hi>Damascus;</hi>
and generally they continued to be so. They lay on the north
of <hi>Iudah</hi> (therefore it's called evil from the north, which came
from <hi>Syria</hi>) and <hi>Lebanon</hi> was on the north border of Israel next
to it: And it's like that for this cause, either <hi>Solomon</hi> did change
that place into a tower, or built some other of new, to be a
watch especially against that enemy, which was his chief enemy,
to prevent the hurt that might come from that hand; therefore,
it's said to look toward (or to the face of) <hi>Damascus,</hi> as having
a special respect to that enemy. Now we conceive, that by this,
the Brides watchfulnesse and zeal, in prosecuting and maintaining
her spiritual war against her enemies, is understood; As also, her
sagacity, in smelling and discovering the stirrings and motions of
her spiritual enemies, as the nose doth easily smell and discover
what is pleasant or hurtful to sense. Christ's Bride hath many e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
and some more terrible than others; therefore, she hath
her watches, and (as it were) sentinels at the post, to observe
their motions, especially she hath an eye upon her most inveterat
and malicious enemy, the enemy neerest her doors, that is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
most predominant, and her great care is to be kept from
<hi>her iniquity,</hi> Psal. 18. 21. This we conceive, agrees both with
the scope, and also with the description and comparison here
made use of.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. The most beautiful Bride of our Lord Jesus hath ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and such enemies, as are strongly seated and fortified (as
the <hi>Syrians</hi> at <hi>Damascus</hi> were) to watch against. 2<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> There are
some particular quarters, or enemies, from which, and by which,
believers often suffer most; and although they have enemies on
all hands, yet is there ordinarily some one particular enemy, more
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:65401:195"/>
terrible, malicious and predominant than others, from which
they are most in danger. 3. Believers should ever be on their
watch against those enemies, and must neither make peace with
them, nor be negligent to provide against them. 4. Although
the believer should not be secure or carelesse, in reference to
any ill, but every evil is to be carefully watched against; yet, where
one ill doth more often assault him than others, and is more
strong, by the concurrence of tentations from without, or from
his own inclination within, there the believer hath need of a
special watch. 5. This watchfulnesse impartially extended, and
constantly maintained, is a main piece of spiritual beauty, and
hath much influence on the adorning of a believer, and is a good
evidence of a person that is commendable before Jesus Christ.</p>

                     <q>Thine head upon thee is like <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel,</hi>
and the hair of thine head like Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
the King is held in the Galleries.</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>The first part of <hi>vers.</hi> 5. contains the ninth and tenth particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
that are commended in the Bride: The ninth is her <hi>head;</hi>
It looks here to be taken for the uppermost part of the head
(from which sense and motion do flow) as being distinct from
eyes and nose; therefore it is said, <hi>Thy head upon thee,</hi> to wit,
upon and above those parts before mentioned: Next it is said
to be <hi>like Carmel;</hi> which may be understood, 1. as it relates to
a fruitful place, mentioned with <hi>Sharon,</hi> Isa. 35. 2. <hi>the excellency
of Carmel and Sharon.</hi> 2. It may be translated <hi>Scarlet</hi> or <hi>Crimson,</hi>
as the same word is, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 3. 14. thus it's a rich colour, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
princes and great men used to be decored; and the hair be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the next words compared to purple, it's not unlike that it
is taken for a colour here also.</p>
                  <p>By <hi>head,</hi> we must understand either Christ himself, who stands
in that relation to the believer, and in respect of dignity is called
a <hi>head to all men,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 3. Or, 2. (which is not inconsistant
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:65401:196"/>
with the former) some grace in the believer, acting on Christ,
and quickning the new life; and seing the scope is to commend
the believer from inherent grace, and the new nature being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to an inner-man, which is described from it's several parts,
and so must have an head, we think that it is some particular grace
that is here especially aimed at. By <hi>head</hi> then, we conceive the
grace of hope may be understood, it being the grace whereby the
soul still sticks to Christ, expecting the injoyment of him; for,
not only is hope a grace necessary and commendable (and so it
cannot be unsuitable to the scope, to take it in upon one branch
or other) but it may be called the head, 1. Because it is above,
having Christ himself for it's object; and though the word may
be said to be the object of hope, yet it's not so much the word,
as Christ held forth in the word; and therefore, hope is said to
be <hi>within the vail,</hi> Heb. 6. 19. for, properly we hope for him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of his word, and so he is <hi>our hope,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 1. 2. Hope is a
grace, which hath it's rise from faith, and is supported by it, as
the head is by the neck; though hope be some way above faith,
yet doth faith sustain it, and give it a being; the believer hopes,
because he believes. 3. It hath much influence on all spiritual
duties, and especially on our consolation, and is useful in the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
war, as being an essential piece of the believer's spiritual
armour, and is therefore called the <hi>helmet</hi> or head-piece <hi>of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi>
1 Thess. 5. 8. and the head-piece may be some way called
the head; So hope, which keepeth (to say so) graces head,
may not unfitly be called the head, seing without it the head will
be at least without it's helmet: And taking it so, for this special
piece of the believers armour, it follows well on watchfulnesse:
however, it is certain, that hope bears up the believer under
difficulties, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 24. and that it rests on Christ, who therefore
is called our hope: And so, corelatively being considered, as
acting on him, it may get the name of head, as faith is upon the
like account called our righteousnesse, and thus our head is
Christ hoped upon: And the commendation, that it's like <hi>Crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
will suit well with this interpretation, the red or Crimson
colour having a special reference to Christ's death and sufferings,
which puts the right colour on our hope, and makes it of this
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:65401:196"/>
dye, that it's never <hi>ashamed</hi> nor stained, <hi>Rom. 5. 3. Obs.</hi> 1. The exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of hope is a necessary piece of a believers beauty, and as to
have the heart sustained and comforted in the hope of what is not
seen, is both necessary and profitable; so, when by the power of
hope, a believers head is helpt up, and kept above in all waters,
that he fink not, it is his singular ornament. 2. Hardly will a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever
be in good case, without this grace of hope, and when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
graces are lively, hope will be so also: These pieces of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
and spiritual decoring go together. 3. There is no other
in the world that hath a well grounded hope but the believer;
it's only the believer, <hi>whose head is like Crimson:</hi> all others, their
hope makes ashamed, and their confidence shall be rooted out,
whileas his will be alwayes fresh and green.</p>
                  <p>The tenth and last particular here commended in the Bride, is her
<hi>hair:</hi> This was spoken of, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. 1. But here, both the word in
the Original, and the commendation that is given of it, do differ
from that which is there recorded; The word here translated
<hi>hair,</hi> is not elsewhere to be found: It comes from a root that
gives ground to expound it <hi>smalnesse,</hi> or <hi>tendernesse;</hi> therefore,
it's taken by some, to signifie a pin, or some of the small decore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the head: and it is compared to <hi>purple,</hi> for it's preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,
lovelinesse, and other reasons formerly mentioned in
speaking of that colour.</p>
                  <p>We take the scope here to be, to shew the universal loveliness
and preciousnesse of grace in a believer, even in the least things;
What shall I say (saith he) that thy <hi>feet, navel, eyes</hi> and <hi>head</hi> are
beautiful? even thy <hi>hair,</hi> or the pins that dresse it, are lovely and
excellent: so glorious, princely and stately a creature is this
Bride, that there is not a wrong pin or hair to be found upon
her: And thus, all the commendation is well closed with this.
By the <hi>hair</hi> then, we conceive is understood, even the meanest
gestures and circumstances of a believers walk, which being or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
by grace, are beautiful, and serve much to the adorning
of the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. That grace makes an observable change upon the whole
man, it regulats even the least things, it orders looks, gestures
and circumstances, wherein often men take too much liberty.
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:65401:197"/>
2. Grace vented in the meanest piece of a Christian carriage, is very
beautiful; it puts a special beauty and lustre upon the meanest cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
of the Christians actions: Or, when a believer squares
all his walk, even in the least things, by the right rule, it makes
his way exceeding lovely; whereas, often a little folly, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>watchfulnesse
in such, proves like a <hi>dead flee, that makes a whole
box of ointment to stink,</hi> Eccles. 10. 1. 3. Our Lord takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of the smallest things in a believer, even of the <hi>hair,</hi> yea, of
the smallest thereof; There is nothing in his people so mean, but
he takes notice of it, and there is nothing so little, but grace
should be exercised therein: In a word, all things in a believer
should be suitable, <hi>eyes, hair, head,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The particulars of the Brides commendation, of which we have
spoken (if they were understood) certainly they contain much;
but, as if these were little, he proceeds in expressing this beauty
of, or rather his love to, his Bride, in three wonderful expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as proofs of what he hath said concerning her lovelinesse and
beauty, or (if we may improperly so call them) aggravations
thereof, whereby that commendation is raised and heightned to an
exceeding great height. The first is in the end of the fifth verse,
and it is this, <hi>the King is held</hi> (or bound) <hi>in the Galleries:</hi> The
sense in a word is, what ravishing lovelinesse is this that is to be
found in this Bride, that the King is thereby (as it were) held
and bound, and must stand to look upon it, he is so delighted
with it? 1. This <hi>King</hi> is our Lord Jesus, the Prince of the Kings
of the Earth; he is not only here, but elsewhere often styled <hi>the
King,</hi> because he is eminently so, and it's much to the believers
consolation that he is so, if the faith of it were fixed in them.
Our Lord is a most royal kingly person. 2. The <hi>Galleries</hi> here,
are the same that were, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 17. called there <hi>Rafters,</hi> The
word there is our <hi>Galleries:</hi> Galleries are places where great
men use to walk, and here (Christ and the believer having one
house, wherein they dwell together) the Galleries signifie the
means or Ordinances, wherein, in a more special way they
come to walk together. 3. To be <hi>held</hi> (or <hi>bound</hi> as the word is)
signifies a holy constraint that was on him, that he could do no
otherwise, because he would do no otherwise, it was so delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:65401:197"/>
to him, as, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 4. and, 4. 9. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. 5. 12. where, on
the matter, the same thing is to be found. The word here used,
is borrowed from the nature of affection amongst men, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
them to look on what they love: In sum, this in an abrupt
manner comes in on the close of the particulars of the Brides
commendation; as if it were said, So lovely art thou, that Christ
as captivat, or overcome, cannot withdraw, but is held (as, <hi>chap.</hi>
3. 4.) to look upon thy beauty; which is the more wonderful,
that he is so royal a person, whom enemies, death and devils
could not detain, yet he is so prevailed over by a believer. And
it is observable, that there is not one thing oftner mentioned
in this Song, than the wonderful expressions of Christ's yielding
himself to be prevailed over by them, as if his might were to
be imployed for them, rather than for himself, and as if he glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
in this, that he is overcome by them, which is indeed the
glory of his grace. <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. There are some more than ordinary
admissions to neernesse with Christ, that believers may meet with;
which are more than ordinary for clearnesse, so as they may be
said to have him in the <hi>Galleries,</hi> and also for continuance, so as
they may be said to have him <hi>held</hi> there. 2. Christ Jesus by the
holy violence of his peoples graces (so to speak) may be held and
captivat to stay and make his abode with them; it's good then to
wrestle with Christ, that he may be held and prevailed with.
3. Holinesse in a believers walk, hath much influence on the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
and entertaining of the most sensible manifestations of
Christ: Thus he is <hi>held in the Galleries.</hi> 4. Our Lord Jesus
thinks no shame to be out of love prevailed over by his people;
yea, he esteems it his honour, therefore is this so often recorded
for the commendation of his love, and the comfort of believers.</p>

thou, O Love, for delights!</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>This verse contains the second expression, whereby the Brides
commendation is heightned, in three things, 1. By the title he
gives her, <hi>O Love, for delights!</hi> He calls her in the abstract, love
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:65401:198"/>
it self, there can be no more said, she is not only lovely, but <hi>love</hi>
it self; <hi>for delights</hi> is added as the reason of it, because of the
various and abounding delights that are to be found in her; she
is (to say so) a person so excellently beautiful, and hath so many
lovely things in her. The second thing is the commendation he
joyns with this title, and it is in two words, 1. She is <hi>fair:</hi> This
looks to the external lovelinesse of her person. 2. She <hi>is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant,</hi>
this respects the sweetnesse, and amiableness of her inward dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position:
These two may be separate in others, but they meet in
the believer, as they do in Christ; therefore she had given him
these two epithets, <hi>chap.</hi> 1. 16. The third thing is the manner
of expression, which heightens all this: It's expressed with an
<hi>How? How fair,</hi> &amp;c? (as, <hi>chap.</hi> 4. 10.) shewing an incomparable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and an inexpressiblenesse to be in her beauty: whereby in
sum, the love of this blessed Bridegroom shews his satisfaction
in his Bride, by multiplying such wonderful expressions, as hold
forth the high esteem that he hath of her. <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
so lovely in all the world, as grace in a believer; the most
delightsome pleasant thing in the world is nothing to this. 2. The
love that Christ hath to his people, is inexpressible; although he
useth many significant wayes to expresse it, yet must it close with
an indefinite expression and question, to which an answer cannot be
made, <hi>How fair?</hi> It cannot be told how fair, and men cannot
take it up otherwise than by wondering at it. 3. This lovelinesse
of the Bride, and the Kings being kept in the Galleries, or the
sense of the injoyment of his presence go together; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is it subjoyned here, as the cause of the former, like one
that is ravished with the admiration of some excellent sight, he
stayes and beholds it, and O (saith he) how pleasant is it! The
believer is the uptaking object of the love of Christ, wherein he
delights. 4. There is no lovely nor delightsome thing in all the
world, that Christ cares for, or esteems of, as he doth of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever:
Grace makes a person Christ's <hi>love for delights:</hi> riches,
honour, favour, parts, will be of no value without this; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
one without these, may with this, have Christ's affection in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
to them.</p>

(to speak so) in a ravished, abrupt manner, by way of exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
The third way how he amplifies the commendation of the
Bride, follows, <hi>vers.</hi> 7, 8, 9. (as subjoyned to the preceeding
particular description) And this amplification is expressed these
three wayes: 1. By commending her stature, as the result of all
her parts (formerly described) put together, with a repetition
of one of these parts mainly taken notice of, <hi>vers.</hi> 7. 2. By shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his resolution to haunt her company, by which his respect to her
appears, <hi>vers.</hi> 8. 3. By promising gracious effects to follow on
his performing the former promise, of his keeping company
with her, <hi>vers.</hi> 8, 9.</p>
                  <p>The seventh verse then speaks to two things, Her stature and
her brests; Her stature respects all the bygone parts being now
put together, for so they represent the whole stature: And by
<hi>stature</hi> is understood the proportionablenesse and comelinesse that
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:65401:199"/>
is in the whole, being considered as jointly united in one body,

<hi>this,</hi> clears it, <hi>this,</hi> that is, <hi>this</hi> which is made up of all the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
parts I have been enumerating, they being put together, make
thy stature, and thy stature thus made up of these members and
parts, is <hi>like the Palm-tree:</hi> And so from this similitude, her stature
is commended: The <hi>Palm-tree</hi> is recorded in Scripture to have
diverse commendable properties, 1. It's straight; therefore it's
said of the idols that they are <hi>upright like the Palm-tree,</hi> Jer.
5. 10. straightnesse is comely in a stature, He was <hi>like to a Cedar,
Chap.</hi> 5. 15. she is like to a <hi>Palm-tree</hi> here. 2. A Palm-tree hath
good fruits, the Daits are the fruit thereof. 3. It's a tree of long
continuance, and keeps long green; Hence, <hi>Psal.</hi> 92. 12, 14. It's
said of the righteous, <hi>they shall flourish like the Palm-tree;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<hi>Ioel</hi> 1. 12. it's an evidence of great drought, when <hi>the
Palm-tree withereth.</hi> 4. They were looked on as most fit to be
used in times when men were about to expresse their joy in the
most solemn manner, and so when Christ is coming triumphantly
to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> Joh. 12. they cut down <hi>branches of Palm-trees,</hi> to
carry before him, and, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. 4. these Victors have <hi>Palms in
their hands,</hi> and in <hi>Levit.</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>. 40. we find branches of these trees
commanded to be made use of in the joyful feast of Tabernacles,
and the <hi>seventy Palm-trees</hi> that were found by the Israelits at
<hi>Elim,</hi> are mentioned, <hi>Numb.</hi> 33. 9. as refreshful, so is the City
of Palm-trees also mentioned as a most pleasant place, <hi>Deut.</hi> 34. 3.
All these may be applyed to believers, who, both by the change
that is wrought upon them by the grace of Christ, and also, as
they are in him by faith, are such; They are straight, not crooked,
but beautiful and flourishing, and to him refreshful, as the next
verse shews, being the living signs and monuments of his victory
over Death and the Devil. <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. There ought not only to be
in a believer, a thriving of graces distinctly, but a right joyning,
ordering, and compacting of them together, that they may keep
a proportionablenesse, and make up complexly a lovely stature:
that is, not only should all graces be kept in exercise together,
but as members of one new man, each ought to be subservient to
another, for making up of a sweet harmony in the result; love
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:65401:199"/>
should not wrong zeal, nor zeal prudence; but every grace, as
being a distinct member of the new man, should be settled in it's
own place, to make the stature lovely. 2 When this proportion
is kept, and every grace hath it's own place, it is exceeding
lovely, like a beautiful stature; whereas grace, when acting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly
(if then it may be called grace) is like an eye, beautiful
in it self; but not being in the right place of the face, doth
make the stature unlovely and disproportionable: It's not the
least part of spiritual beauty, when not only one hath all graces,
but hath every one of them acting according to their several na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
even when they are acting joyntly together. 3. This fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
much believers fruitfulnesse, and continues them fresh and
green, when the whole stature of grace is right, and kept in a due
proportionablenesse.</p>
                  <p>The particular that is again repeated, is her <hi>breasts,</hi> which are
compared to a <hi>cluster of grapes,</hi> or <hi>wine,</hi> as it is in the eight verse,
We conceive, by <hi>brests</hi> here, is signified her love and affection,
whereby he is entertained, So, <hi>Chap. 1. 13. he shall lye all night
between my brests;</hi> and so it agreeth well with that expression, <hi>Prov.
5. 19. let her brests satisfie thee at all times, and be thou alwayes
ravisht with her love:</hi> This is confirmed from the similitude unto
which it is compared, and that is, <hi>grapes,</hi> or <hi>wine;</hi> Shewing, that
her love is refreshful, and cordial (to speak so) to him: Thy
brests (saith he) that is, to lye between thy brests, and to be
kindly entertained by thee, is more than wine to me: And this
is the same thing which was said, <hi>Chap. 4. 10. How much better is
thy love than wine?</hi> And the similitude being the same, we think
the thing is the same that is thereby set forth and commended,
and it is singularly taken notice of by Christ through all the Song,
and marked in <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. and here, as that which makes all her sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
so lovely in it self: Love makes every grace act (therefore
is it <hi>the fulfilling of the law</hi>) and makes grace in it's actings beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
and lovely to him. These words then, may either express,
1. the lovelinesse of her love: Or, 2. the delight which he took
in it, as esteeming highly of it; she was so very lovely, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
refreshed him so much as her brests: Which expression (as
all the rest) holds out intense spiritual-love, under the expressions
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:65401:200"/>
that are usual amongst men. And it sayes, 1. that the beauty
of grace is a ravishing beauty; or Christ's love delights in the
love of his people; a room in their hearts is much prized by
him. 2. Christ hath a complacency and acquiescense in his people,
which he hath in none other, and where more grace is, there his
complacency (though one in it self) doth the more manifest it self.
3. When a believer is right and in good case, then his love to
Christ is warm: And particularly, a right frame is by nothing
sooner evidenced, than by the affections; and it's ordinarily ill
or well with us, as our love to Christ is vigorious or cold.</p>
                  <p>The second way how our Lord expresseth his love to his Bride,
is in the beginning of <hi>vers.</hi> 8. and it's by expressing of his resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to accompany with her, beyond any in the world: She was
compared to a Palm-tree in the former verse, Now (saith he)
<hi>I will go up to the Palm-tree</hi> (that is, to the Palm-tree before
mentioned) It's on the matter the same with that promise, <hi>chap.
4. 6. I will get me to the mountain of Myrrhe,</hi> &amp;c. Consider here, 1.
the thing promised or proposed, and that is, <hi>his going up to the
Palm-tree, and taking hold of the boughs thereof:</hi> That the scope
is to hold forth his purpose of manifesting himself to her, is clear,
1. By the dependence of this on the former, He had said, <hi>Thou
art a Palm-tree,</hi> and now (saith he) <hi>I will go up to the Palm-tree,</hi>
which speaks his prizing that tree above all others. 2. The ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
also of his going up, in the following words, do clear it;
It's such a going up as hath refreshful and comfortable influence
upon her: The importance of the similitude is, as men love the
trees they converse much about (and it's like, Palm-trees were
much used for that end) or as climbing up upon trees, and taking
hold of their boughs, do shew the delight and pleasure men have
in such or such a tree, and how refreshing it is to them to be neer
it; So having compared her to a Palm-tree, he expresseth his
delight in her, and his purpose of manifesting himself to her, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the same similitude, as is ordinary in the strain of this Song.
2. Consider, that this resolution is laid down as no passing thought,
but is a deliberat and determined resolution, <hi>I said I will go,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I
will take hold,</hi> &amp;c. Which doth shew, 1. Christ's inward thoughts
and conclusions with himself, this is his heart-language. 2. The
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:65401:200"/>
expression of these, and so the words come to be a promise, which
the believer may make use of, as of a thing which Christ hath said.
3. It shews a deliberatnesse in both, that they were not sudden,
but the advised result of a former deliberation, and that of old,
<hi>I said it:</hi> In a word (saith he) my Bride is my choice in all the
world, the tree that I have resolved, for my delight, to climb up
upon, beside all others. <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. The scope and result of all
Christ's commendations of his Bride, is, that she may be brought
to look for, and expect to be made happy with his own company,
and to be unspeakably made up in the injoyment of his presence.
2. It's not every one that hath the promise of Christ's company
and fellowship, or that may expect it; It's the believer only who
may look for it, he hath Christ's word for it, and none but he
3. Christ's most passionat expressions of love are not from any sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
of affection in him, but are deliberatly resolved, and that
of old, so that now they cannot be altered; his delight was in
the habitable parts of the earth, and his resolution was laid down
to go up to the <hi>Palm-tree</hi> before it was. 4. Christ's thoughts
to his people (if known) would be found to be precious, thoughts
of peace and not of evil; many a good purpose hath been in his
heart of old, and there is no greater evidence of love, neither
can be, than to intimat and accomplish these, as he doth here: I
laid down this resolution (saith he) long ere now, and I will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
it out. 5. A holy tender walk in believers (which is indeed
to have the stature lovely as the Palm-tree) will obtain the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation
of Christ's heart to them; And there is no greater
evidence of Christ's respect, than that, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 21, and 23.</p>
                  <p>The third way how he expresseth his love, is by the effects,
which he promiseth shall follow on his presence with her, as his
presence is subjoyned to her lovely stature (which connexion is
observable) The effects that follow, are three, the first two are
in the second part of the eighth verse, and the first of them in
these words, <hi>Now also thy brests shall be as the clusters of the Vine;</hi>
This is the first fruit of his going up to the Palm-tree, which (as
also the rest of them) may be taken as comprehensive of these
two, 1. Of some gracious effect that shall be wrought in the
Bride, and so these words bring him in speaking to this purpose,
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:65401:201"/>
when I come to thee, then by my presence thy graces shall flow,
and thou shall be in a capacity to edifie others, and to satisfie me,
as if thy brests were clusters of the Vine, to furnish what might
be refreshful: Thus he comforts her, from what should be wrought
in her, by his presence with her: And the scope and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
shews, that this cannot be excluded, it being a native con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
of his presence, and comfortable in it self to her.
2. They are to be looked upon as comprehensive of his gracious
acceptation of her and her fruits, as being well satisfied with her;
And thus the meaning of these words, <hi>thy brests shall be as clu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of the Vine,</hi> is this, When I shall come to thee, thy love and
company, thy bosome (to say so) shall be to me more refreshful
than clusters of the Vine, I will feed upon it, and delight in it,
as, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. 10. This compleats her consolation, and the evidence
of his love, that he undertakes it shall be well with her inward
condition, and that he shall accept of her also, and be well satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with her: These are not only consistent together, but do
necessarily concur for making up the scope, which is to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
his love, and to comfort her; and the one of these follows
on the other, therefore, we comprehend both in all these effects.
<hi>Obs.</hi> 1. Christs presence hath much influence on believers liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
their <hi>brests</hi> run when he is present. 2. Livelinesse is a
singular and comfortable mercy in a believers estimation; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is it promised as a thing that is in a special way comfortable
to her. 3. Christ's presence, or neernesse with him, and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse,
go together: And where the brests are not as clusters,
no conditon the believer can be in, is to be accounted presence.</p>
                  <p>The second effect is in these words, <hi>And the smell of thy nose
like Apples:</hi> Apples are savoury fruit, the smell of the nose is the
savour of the breath, that comes from it, which in unwholsome
bodies is unsavoury; Saith he to the Bride, thine shall not be so,
but thy constitution shall be lively, and all that comes from thee
shall be savoury, and so shall be accepted of me; It shall be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury
in it self, as Apples are to the smell, and it shall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
in by me, as having a sweet air and breath with it: This
imports a conspicuous inward change, by the growth of mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
whereby believers being purified within from all filthinesse
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:65401:201"/>
of the flesh and spirit, there proceeds nothing from them but
what is savoury, whereas a loose and ragged conversation, as cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
breath (<hi>Iob.</hi> 17. 1.) evidenceth much inward rottennesse.
<hi>Obs.</hi> 1. Christ's presence, is of an healing, cleansing vertue, and
makes an observable inward change. 2. An inward change
evidenceth it self in the outward fruits and effects, the very smell
and savour of the conversation, and of all externall duties, is chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
3. This inward purity is very desirable to the believer; for
so it's here a piece of his comfort, to have a promise that the
smell of his nose shall be as Apples, and it's a speciall evidence of
Christs respect, to have that performed.</p>
                  <p>It may also take in the savourinesse of the believers breathing,
in respect of themselves; when Christ is present, they shall draw
in a wholesome, pleasant and refreshfull air; whereas now ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
we breath in a corrupt air: It shall not be so then, saith
he, the smell of thy nose shall be as if thou did savour of Apples:
Christ's company makes all both fruitfull within, and refreshfull
to the believer, and also makes all duties and all dispensations,
he is exercised with, savoury and acceptable to himself; All which
follows on Christ's presence, and suits with the scope, that saith,
both taste and smell are satisfied.</p>
                  <p>The third lovely effect of Christ's presence, is in the ninth verse;
And 1. the effect it self is set down: then it's commendation is
amplified. The effect, or advantage of Christ's presence, is in
these words, <hi>The roof of thy mouth</hi> (or thy palat) <hi>shall be as the
best wine:</hi> The palat, or roof of thy mouth, is the instrument of
taste, and so is sometimes taken for the taste it self, and is so tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated,
<hi>Chap. 2. 3. his fruit was sweet to my taste:</hi> So, <hi>Iob.</hi> 34. 3.
Or, by palat may be understood the mouth, as, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 16. Next,
it's compared to <hi>wine,</hi> yea, the <hi>best wine</hi> (the reasons of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
have been often spoken to) The best wine is that which
is most refreshing and exhilerating: Now this wine is three ways
set out in it's excellency (for, that the following expressions are
to this purpose, is clear) 1. It's <hi>for my Beloved,</hi> that is, such
wine as he allows his friends, whom he styles <hi>beloved, Chap.</hi> 5. 1.
(and this shews what kind of wine is understood) and so it must
be excellent wine, being that which is allowed on Christ's special
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:65401:202"/>
friends. Or, it's an abrupt expression, whereby he speaks in name
of the Bride; It's such wine as I (as if she were speaking) allow
on thee, my beloved, and which I reserve only for thee: For
which reason, she is called <hi>a Fountain sealed,</hi> and <hi>Garden</hi> inclosed,
as being set a-part for him, and not common to others; and
thus is he expressing in her name, what she expresseth her self
in the last words of this Chapter, It's all <hi>for thee my beloved;</hi>
And it implyeth both a commendation of its sweetnesse, and her
devoting of it to him. However, the words hold forth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that proves it to be excellent, and not common, but such
as is found amongst these who stand in this spiritual relation.
2. It's commended from this, that <hi>it goeth down sweetly,</hi> that is,
it's pleasant to the taste, and is not harsh, but delightsomely may
be drunk of: Or, it may respect that property of good Wine, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
<hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 31. (that it <hi>moves it self rightly</hi>) if the words
be translated as the margent imports. 3. It's commended from
the effects, It drinks sweetly, and when it is drunk, <hi>it causeth
the lips of those those that are asleep to speak:</hi> Wine is cordial and
refreshful, but this Wine must be in a singular way refreshful, that
makes men that are infirm, or old (as the word may be rendered)
and almost dead, to revive and speak, or those that were secure
(as the Bride was, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 2.) and in a spiritual drousinesse, it
can quicken them, and make them cheerfully speak; Thus the
Wine is commended. Now we conceive, by this comfortable
effect, that is promised to her upon Christ's coming to her, these
two things are here holden forth, 1. How refreshing it shall be to
her self, all her senses shall be taken with it, both the smell and
the taste; it shall be singularly sweet to her spiritual taste, as it
is, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 3. And thus the Wine of the Spirit is commended,
which accompanies his manifestations, and is reserved for his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,
<hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 1. and is a joy that no stranger is made partaker
of: This Wine is indeed peculiar for his beloved, (and is suitable
to himself) and is the Wine that goeth sweetly down; and is
most refreshful, and makes secure sinners to speak, and those that
are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>aint it revives them, as <hi>Eph. 5. 18. Be not filled with wine,</hi> &amp;c.
but <hi>be filled with the Spirit, speaking to your selves in Psalms, sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and making melody in your hearts to the Lord:</hi> This effect agrees
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:65401:202"/>
well to the Spirit, yea, only to this Wine of the Spirit; and it
suits well the scope, which is to shew what comfortable influence
Christ's presence should have on her, so that when he comes to
his Palm-tree, her taste shall relish as with the best Wine; his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
shall thus revive and quicken her, and be a special evidence
of his singular respect to her.</p>
                  <p>2. It holds out (which follows on the former) that not only
her breath shall savour well to him and others, and her inward
senses abound with refreshings to her self, but also the expressions
of her mouth, to others shall be savoury, and to him refreshful,
as a delightsome fruit flowing from her: Thus (saith he) when
I betake me to fellowship with thee, and comes near by sensible
embracements, to take hold of thy boughs (as a man embracing
one whom he loves, for thus the Allegory is spiritually to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood)
thou shalt be to me, and in my esteem, exceeding
lovely; thy brests, smell, and mouth, will be che<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ring and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury,
like Grapes, Apples, and the best Wine: And here spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
affections and holy reason would be made use of, to gather
the life of Christ's love from the effects of it, with some resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
of what useth to be betwixt man and wife, in their mutual
loving carriage (for so runs the strain of this Song) although our
carnalnesse makes it hazardous, and unsafe to descend in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of these similitudes: And thus, as <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 16. by his
<hi>mouth</hi> or palat, was understood the kisses thereof, or the most
sensible manifestations of his love to her: So here, by her palat or
mouth, is understood her most affectionat soul-longings of love to
him, which being warmed and melted by his presence, doth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
it self in a kindly way, in spiritual embraces and kisses (as
from <hi>vers.</hi> 11. and 12. will be clear) which are exceedingly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightsome
to him: and so the sense of this promise is, when I
come to thee, then, yea even now, thy love with the sense of
mine shall be warmed and refreshed, so that it shall in an affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionat
way vent it self on me, and that shall be as the most exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerating
cordial unto me, as the manifestations of my love will be
chearing and refreshing unto thee; both which are notably com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
to her, and special evidences of his respect, which is the
scope. <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. Ther are some secret flowings of love, and soul-experiences
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:65401:203"/>
betwixt Christ and believers, that are not easily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood;
and that makes the expressions of this love so seeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
intricat. 2. These flowings of love that are betwixt Christ
and his people (how strange soever they be) are most delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
to the soul that partakes of them, they are as <hi>wine that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
down sweetly.</hi> 3. Christ's presence hath many benefits and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
waiting on it, which contribute exceedingly both to
the quickning and comforting of the believer; many things hang
on this one, <hi>his going up to the Palm-tree.</hi> 4. The joy of the
Spirit hath notable effects, and can put words in the mouth of
these that neverspoke much before, yea, can make the dumb to
sing, with a sensible warming of the heart and inward affections,
stirring up melody in their souls, which yet will be distinct in the
impressions and effects of it. 5. Our Lord Jesus hath designed
the comfort of the believer, which he holdeth out in comfortable
promises, and alloweth them to make use of it, and it is pleasant
and delightsome to him to have them so doing.</p>

                  <p>The Bride hath been long silent, delightsomely drinking in
what she hath been hearing from the Bridegrooms sweet mouth,
and so suffering him to say on: Now in this tenth verse, and these
that follow, she comes-in speaking, and having well observed
what he said, the result and effect thereof upon her heart doth
appear in what she saith. And, 1. she comforts her self in her
union with him, as now being clear in it from his owning of her;
and she layes down, and begins with this conclusion, <hi>vers.</hi> 10.
Now (saith she) I may say, <hi>I am my Beloveds,</hi> &amp;c. Then, 2. look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his promise, <hi>vers.</hi> 8. she puts up her great desire after com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with him, that according to her interest in him, she might
be admitted to injoy him; which suit is put up, qualified or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged,
and by several arguments pressed on him, <hi>vers.</hi> 11, 12, 13.</p>
                  <p>The conclusion which she gathers, <hi>vers.</hi> 10. from his discourse,
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:65401:203"/>
comes not in altogether abruptly, but is the expression of a heart
comforted with the intimations of Christ's love, and wakened
with the wine that makes them that are asleep to speak; and so
breathing out the great ground of her consolation: Now (saith
she) seing he loves me, and out of the infinit freedom of his
grace is pleased to commend unworthy mee so much, certainly, I
may conclude, <hi>I am my beloveds, and his desire is towards me.</hi>
The first part of this verse, wherein she asserts her interest in him,
was spoken to, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 16. and 6. 3. and it's now repeated on this
occasion, for these reasons, 1. Because it's the great compend of
all her consolation, and that wherein it consists, that she is Christ's,
and Christ is hers: This is indeed matter of solid consolation,
and whatever is comfortable doth flow from it. 2. To shew
that she kept the clearnesse of her interest in him, in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
constantly, and carried it along with her in the several parts
of her exercise, she can assert it this day, and the next day,
and the third day. 3. It's now a full tide with her, as to Christ's
manifestations, and the flowings of his Spirit; he hath been libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
and large in the intimations of his love, and she makes this
use of it, to put her interest in him out of question, while the
evidences of it are so legible. <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. Believers may at some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
more clearly and distinctly gather and conclude their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
in Christ, than at other times. 2. When believers are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to neernesse with Christ, and clouds that would darken
their faith are scattered, then they would endeavour to fix their
confidence, and put their interest out of question; that when
their sun comes under a cloud, and they see not to read their evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
so distinctly, they be not put to question their interest,
and all by-past experiences, as delusions. 3. When the Lord
owns his people, and speaks comfortably to them (as he hath
been doing to the Bride) then they should owne him, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiesce
in that consolation allowed upon them by him.</p>
                  <p>The last part of the verse, in these words, <hi>and his desire is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
me,</hi> shews not only that the interest was mutual, and that
he loved her, as she did him; but that he loved her affectionat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
so that in a manner he could not be without her, <hi>His desire
was to her.</hi> 2. That he condescended to love her with such a
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:65401:204"/>
kind of love and respect as a woman hath to her husband; for,
so this is spoken of the first woman, <hi>Gen. 3. thy desire shall be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him,</hi> that is, subordinat to his, or seeking to conform to
his, that she may please him: And so here it shews Christ's great
condescending, to have the believer carving (as it were) to him,
so ready is he to please and satisfie his people for their good.
3. It shews a deal of satisfaction that she had in this, it was the
matter of her humble spiritual boasting, that Christ so loved her,
hath or contemn her who would. 4. She thinks still much of this
priviledge of an interest in Christ, and esteems nothing the lesse
of it that she had attained clearnesse in it before now: Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
is ever of much worth, and these who are clearest anent this,
will esteem most of it: That holy fainnesse (to say so) that this
word, <hi>My beloved is mine,</hi> brings-in to the soul, easeth and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteth
the more that it is often renewed.</p>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>When she hath laid down this ground of her interest in him,
she proceeds to improve it, <hi>vers.</hi> 11. by giving him a kindly and
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:65401:204"/>
familiar invitation, which she, first, qualifies in the end of the
eleventh verse, and beginning of the twelfth, and then in what
followeth, adds some motives to presse it. The similitude of a
loving wifes carriage to a kind husband is continued, as if such
a loving wife, desirous of her husbands company, did invite him
to the fields, thereby in a retired way to be solaced with his
company, especially by going abroad with him in a pleasant spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,
and staying some nights in villages for that end, and
that they might the more seriously and comfortably view the
state of their Orchards and Gardens, which is both pleasant, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
and delightsome to be done in the husbands company:
Even so doth the Bride follow the similitude, to shew what she
desired from Christ in desiring of his company, and for what end,
to wit, both for the profit and comfort she expected to reap
thereby.</p>
                  <p>The invitation she gives him, is, <hi>Come my Beloved; Come,</hi> is
a word much used betwixt Christ and the believer, and is a kindly
word. He saith, <hi>Come,</hi> Chap. 2. 10. and now she useth the same word;
Her putting up this desire, expresseth a desire of communion
and neernesse with him, and also much affection, and is the lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uage
both of the Spirit and the Bride, who saith, <hi>Come,</hi> Rev.
22. 17. Here it imports a petition, pressing for a greater degree
of communion, which, by comparing this with the former words,
may be gathered; for, she possessed it in a good measure for the
time, and yet here she saith, <hi>Come.</hi> First, considering this invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
in it self, we may observe, That communion with Christ
is the one, principal and common suit of the believer, wherein
he is never satisfied till it be perfected. Next, comparing these
words with the preceeding, <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. The more that Christ be
manifested to his people, the more neer they be admitted to
him, and the better that their frame be, and the more clear they
be anent their interest in him, the greater will their desire be of
more neer communion with him. 2. Clearnesse of interest in
him, when it's solid, is a ground to presse for his fellowship, and
still it presseth the person who hath it to pursue after more
full manifestations of Christ. Again, considering these words as
they respect his promise, <hi>vers. 8. I said</hi> (saith he) I will go up to
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:65401:205"/>
the <hi>Palm tree,</hi> &amp;c. Now she having heard it, layeth hold on this
promise, and is not long in saying, <hi>Come. Obs.</hi> 1. That believers
should improve the promises they have, for attaining what is
promised in them, and should not suffer promises to lye by them
not made use of. 2. What is promised to a believer may, and
should be prayed for, by them, 3. Believers in their prayers and
suits to Christ, would have a special respect to the promises, not
only to conform their desires to them, but to ground them upon
them. 4. The more tender believers be in their frame, they
will the more carefully gather up all Christ's words and promises,
and strengthen their faith thereby in their dealing with him.</p>
                  <p>Next, she contents not her self to put up this suit, but she fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
qualifies it, in several repeated petitions (whereby the ardency
of her desire, and the strength of her faith doth appear) all which
are recorded, both as a pattern to teach believers how they should
carry in prayer, and also as evidences what will be their way and
manner in that duty, when their spirit is in a good condition.
The first qualification of the former petition is, <hi>Let us go forth
into the field. Going forth into the field,</hi> holds forth these two,
1. The extent of her desire, she would have him at home and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
also, she desires not to go out of doors without him. 2. A
desire of retirednesse with him, that she might be alone in his
company, as a wife going abroad to fields alone with her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
as, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. 63. It's said, that <hi>Isaac went out to the fields
to pray,</hi> that is, that he might be the more retired in that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
<hi>Obs.</hi> 1. That where desire of fellowship with Christ is right,
it breaths after a walk with him every where, at home and abroad,
they cannot endure to go out at doors, or to the fields without
him. 2. Dilight in Christs company seeks to be retired with
him, to be alone with him, to be freed from all other companies,
and abstracted from all distraction, the more freely to be solaced
with him.</p>
                  <p>Again, the Pronown, <hi>us, Let us go,</hi> is not without good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
added; It's not, Go thou, nor, I will go: but, <hi>Let us go,</hi>
as bearing in it a double motive, and evidence of her affection.
1. That she offers her self to bear him company. <hi>Obs.</hi> When
Christ's company is loved and respected, the soul will be content
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:65401:205"/>
to leave all others, and go with him, for the entertaining of it.
2. It implyes, that though she had an errand, and desire to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad;
yet, she could not endure to go about it without him:
therefore (saith she) <hi>Let us go. Obs.</hi> 1. The fields, and most
pleasant recreations, are heartlesse and wearisome without Christ's
company, in the believers esteem. 2. His company is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
great incouragement to undertake any thing, and that
which makes his out-going and in-coming pleasant: She is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to go with him, and cannot abide to go without him. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
it shews her respecting that which was her part in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise,
as well as his, and her resolution to conform her practice to
her prayers; for, as she desires him to go, so she is willing to
go her self: If we would expect the answer of prayer, our pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
should be like our prayers.</p>
                  <p>The second qualification is, <hi>Let us lodge in the villages: Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages</hi>
are rural, or land-ward places, by that name distinguished
from Towns or Cities; In these, men travelling, or continuing
a time in the fields for their recreation or businesse, do lodge, as
retired from their ordinary vocations in Cities. Her desire,
<hi>Let us lodge in these</hi> (or, as the word is, Let us <hi>night</hi> or <hi>dwell</hi>
there) shews that she desired him abroad with her, not for a
piece of a day, to return at night, but for a greater length and
continuance of time, as loving rather to lodge with him in the
villages, and to take what might be had in his company, for
lengthning their reteirment, than to return hastily to the City,
or businesses whereby she might be distracted, and in hazard of an
interruption of her communion with him. <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. True desire
of communion with Christ in the injoyment of his presence, as it
presseth for retirednesse with him, so is it desirous to have that
lengthned, and cannot endure to think of parting with him, when
it gets him in a corner. 2. A back-side, or a corner alone with
Christ's company, is good lodging to a lover of Christ: Solita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinesse
with his presence, is more frequented and delighted in by
such, than more publick fellowship and societies.</p>
                  <p>In the twelfth verse we have some moe qualifications of her
petition, and some of the motives, that presse her to seek after
Christ's company. The third qualification is in these words,
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:65401:206"/>
                     <hi>Let us go up early to the Vineyards:</hi> The similitude is continued,
but this word <hi>early,</hi> is added, And it implyes (as it's used in
Scripture) 1. timousnesse, so the women came to Christ's grave
<hi>early,</hi> Luk. 24. 1. <hi>while it was dark.</hi> 2. Seasonablenesse, so it's
taken in that expression, <hi>the Lord will help and that right early,
Psal.</hi> 46. 5. 3. Seriousnesse, so, <hi>Hos. 5. 15. they shall seek me early,</hi>
that is, seriously. Here it implyeth, that she, as one impatient of
delayes, desires to go with expedition, and for that end offers him
her company. <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. Sincere desire of fellowship with Christ
cannot endure delayes, but would presently be at enjoyment.
2. There is a season or earlinesse, a fit opportunity of keeping
company with Christ, and that would not be neglected. 3. As
privacy is a great friend to communion with Christ, so is earli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and timousnesse in setting to it: The more early one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,
they may expect to speed the better. 4. As no duty would
be put off, or delayed, so especially this great and concerning-duty
of endeavouring for fellowship with Christ, would by no
means be delayed or shifted, but early and timously would be
gone about.</p>
                  <p>The fourth qualification follows in the motives, that she
<hi>might see how the several fruits budded:</hi> And it shews, that she
desired not his company only for her satisfaction, but for her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
also, that thereby she might be helped to thrive in her spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
condition, and might be enabled the better to do her duty.
<hi>Obs.</hi> A sincere and right desire of communion with Christ, studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to improve it for spiritual advantage, when it is attained.
So then, all these put together, shew, that she desires Christ's
presence retiredly, constantly, timously, and in order to her spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
advantage and profit: This last will appear more in the
motives, especially the first. This is indeed a main desire, and
therefore, in what follows she presseth it with motives, which
put her to it, and also (as being well pleasing to him) give her
ground to expect it from him: And though she useth these mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
as if they were arguments to induce him to grant her desire,
yet they are mainly for strengthening her own faith in pressing her
suit. The using of motives, and her thus qualifying of her desire,
saith, That believers in their petitions, would insist and presse
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:65401:206"/>
them; for, although Christ be not informed by words, nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
by our arguments, yet this both helps to warm the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
and strengthen the saith of the believer himself, and is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
believers in their prayers to him, who calls for, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
of reasonable service. The motives in particular are four,
The first is taken from the end of her petition, which is to see
how her graces prosper: The similitude continues, as a wise in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to visit her husbandry (to say so) is helped and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
therein by her husbands presence, and therefore desires his
company; So, the believer hath a husbandry, <hi>Vineyards, Grapes,
Pomegranates,</hi> and diverse plants to oversee, which are the graces
of the Spirit, and diverse duties committed to him (as was said
upon <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. 12, 13. and 6. 11.) and his visiting of these, is the taking
of a reflect view of himself, in an abstracted retired condition,
that thereby he may be distinctly acquainted how it's with him,
and with his graces: In following of which duty, Christ's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
in some secret corner is exceeding helpful; therefore, for
that end doth the Bride seek it, and makes use of this motive to
presse it, because it's a duty of concernment to her to search her
self; It's pleasing to him, and a thing that she would be at, yet,
cannot win to it in a common ordinary frame, it's so difficult;
therefore doth she propose this (which is her end) as that which
would be respected and well taken off her hand by him. <hi>Obs.</hi> 1.
Believers have a task, and husbandry committed to them to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage,
that is, several duties and graces, holden forth under the
similitude of <hi>Vines, Pomegranates,</hi> &amp;c. which they are carefully
to notice. 2. It's necessary, in the managing of this task, for a
believer to be well acquainted with the condition of his graces,
and it's his duty to be reflecting on himself for that end; and if
men ought to look to the state of their flocks and herds, <hi>Prov.</hi>
27. 23. how much more ought they carefully to look to this.
3. This duty should be purposly, retiredly, and deliberatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
undertaken and gone about, with a resolut design for at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
to the discovery of our own case, as she doth here. 4. This
duty hath difficulties in it, and ordinarily the heart is not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
with to be kept serious about it, except the frame
thereof be more tender than ordinary. 5. To a tender believer
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:65401:207"/>
it will be a great favour to get this duty of self-examination pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably
and unbyassedly discharged: It's a mercy worth the seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from God, and the more tender believers be, they will be
the more in this. 6. Although believers be clear as to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
(as the Bride was, <hi>vers.</hi> 10.) yet may they be indistinct as
to the knowledge of their own condition, and therefore ought
not to neglect this duty of self-examination; but, where clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
is solid, they will be the more careful in the searching of
themselves. 7. Christ's presence, as it's a notable help to all du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
so particularly, it's in a special way helpful to believers in
searching themselves, by making the heart willing and plyable,
to follow it sweetly, by discovering things as they are, and by making
the eye single, rightly to judge of every thing, and impartially to
take with that which is discovered: Much presence would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
the Lords people to follow this duty, which otherwise
is gone about in a heartlesse way. 8. It's a good use of Christ's
presence and company, when it's improven for attaining of more
through and distinct knowledge of our own condition; and then
especially believers would take the opportunity of putting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to tryal. 9. A believer, when tender, will be particular in
his search, he will search even to the least, he will not disapprove
any thing of Gods grace th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>s real, although it be weak and
tender, therefore she looks to <hi>buds,</hi> as well as more mature fruit,
and acknowledgeth them, because Christ doth so, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. 11.
10. Believers promise not much in themselves, or, they expect
not great things anent their own fruitfulnesse; therefore, it is
to see what is <hi>budding</hi> or appearing, rather than what is ripe,
which she proposeth here to her self, as her design. 11. A ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
believer will esteem much of little grace where it is real, a <hi>bud</hi>
is much to him, if it look fruit-like, as it's the evidence of
Christ's Spirit in him, and the work of his grace: he that is hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
will have a high esteem of it, though he expect no great
thing, nor yet thinks much of it, as it is inherent in him, yet he
will not cast what is least, if solid. 12. The more tender one is,
he will be the more desirous to search his own condition, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unsatisfied with what he hath attained. Again, if we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
this with <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. 11. where it's said, <hi>he went down to his
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:65401:207"/>
Garden</hi> for this very end, for which she desires his presence; We
may see, 1. A co-incidence betwixt Christ's work and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
(to say so) they have one task. 2. A going alongst both
of their ends and wayes to attain them, he takes pains on his
people by the means of grace to make them fruitful, and they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
haunt and improve the means for that same end. And,
3. Christ's words are neer the same with hers, the more to
strengthen her faith in obtaining what she sought, when it so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred
with his design: A believer that aims at fruitfulnesse
and tendernesse by Christ's company in the means and Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
may expect to obtain his desire; for, that same is his work,
which he drives by the means of grace amongst his people.</p>
                  <p>The second motive which makes her presse for Christ's compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
in this retiered way, is in these words, <hi>there will I give thee
my loves;</hi> That is (in short) as in reteirments the Bridegroom
and the Bride rejoice together, in the expressions of their mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
love, with more than ordinary familiarity; So (saith she) let
me have thy company continued with me, that thereby my heart
being warmed, I may get opportunity to let out my love in a
lively manner on thee. By <hi>loves</hi> here, love simply is not meant,
but love in the highest degree of it, manifesting it self in the
most sensible manner, when the heart is melted, as it were, and
made free to pour out it self in love to him: It's therefore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>loves</hi> in the plural number, to shew the many wayes it will
vent it self, as, in thoughts delightsomely making the heart glad,
in cheerful exulting in him, and affectionat imbracing him in it's
arms, feeding and delighting on him, and such like wayes; there
is nothing kept up from him, and all doors, whereby love useth
to vent, are opened. While she saith, <hi>I will give thee my loves,</hi>
it is not to be understood, as if then she would begin to love him
(for, the thing that made her put up this suit was her love to
him) but that then she would with more freedom do it, and
with ease and delight get it done, which now would not do for
her (till his presence warmed her) at least in the manner she
would be at. The word, <hi>there,</hi> that in the letter relates to the
<hi>fields, villages,</hi> &amp;c. is to be understood of that reteirment in fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship,
which she desired with him; in the scope, it looks to his
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:65401:208"/>
secret manifesting of himself to her, in admitting of her to his
bosome; O! (saith she) come, my heart longs to be neer thee,
and this advantage I expect from it, I would then get my heart
drawn from idols, and my affections ingaged to thee, which in
thy absence I cannot get done so as I would; as a person cannot
vent love so in company, as when he is alone in solitarinesse with
his bosome-friend, thus, <hi>Ioseph</hi> being to manifest his love to his
brethren, <hi>Gen.</hi> 45. 1. commanded all to go out, that so he might
with the greater freedom let forth his affections on them; and as
<hi>Ionathan</hi> sent away his boy, when he was to embrace <hi>David</hi> in the
fields, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20. 40. &amp;c. So here, the secret manifestations of
Christ, by his Spirit to his people, being that which gives them
liberty to let forth their hearts on him, especially in their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
accesse to him, to which no man is witnesse, are by this
word <hi>there,</hi> signified. <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. There are many moe good things
than one which accompanies Christ's presence; and where love is
in a believers heart, there will be no scarcety of arguments to
hold forth the advantage thereof. 2. As there are some moe
than ordinary manifestations of love from Christ to his people,
which are not constant; so, there are some moe than ordinary
flowings of the love of believers towards him: There are some
times and cases, wherein especially the heart will melt in affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to him, and wherein it will be made to pour out it self with
ease and delight upon him. 3. It's no lesse the desire of believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to love Christ, and to have their affections flowing on him,
than to have the manifestations of his love to them; therefore
speaks she of this, as of a benefit she exceedingly desired, to get
leave to pour her heart out in love upon him. 4. Believers that
love Christ, will not be satisfied with the degree of their own love,
but will be desirous to have it more withdrawn from other things,
and more fully venting on him. 5. Although sometimes, yea,
oftentimes, the believers heart comes not up that length in love to
Christ that he would have it, yet he designs to set it on Christ
alone, and there is none that willingly he gives it unto with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
but Christ, it's on him only he allows it. 6. There is no
greater gift can be given to Christ, than his peoples love; This
is therefore the motive that is proposed by the Bride in her
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:65401:208"/>
dealing with him, as holding forth the propine or intertainment
which he should receive. 7. Christ's presence, and the manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of his love conduceth notably unto, and hath great influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
upon, the gaining of our affections to him; It doth not only
(as it were) give us the opportunity of his company, but it gains
the heart, softens it, ravisheth it, and heightens the esteem of
Christ in it (which no report of him can do so effectually as his
own presence) and also it oyleth all the affections, that they have
a freedom to flow out (like the Ice before the Sun) which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
are key-cold. 8. Love to Christ loves solitarinesse and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirements
with him; It's neither so stirred it self as when it's a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
with him, nor are the men of the world able to bear or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the intimat familiarity, that will be in the flowings of
the love of Christ to a believer, or of a believers liberty and
holy boldnesse with Christ; nor were it meet, that they should be
witnesses of the love-secrets that are betwixt him and them.
9. It's an evidence of single love to Christ, when his presence is
longed for, that we may the more ardently and affectionatly love
him, and when all opportunities are sought for that may increase
this; this is singlenesse and spiritualnesse in a great length, when
this makes us glory in Christ's love to us, and desire the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festations
thereof, that we may have accesse thereby to love him:
A believer will love heaven, because there he will have accesse fully
to love Christ, as well as to be loved of him; and will abhor hell,
not only because there are no intimations of Christ's love there,
but also, because there is no accesse to love him there: To get
the heart loving Christ, is indeed the believers great delight,
and in a manner his heaven. 10. Love in a believer to Christ, is
the result or reflex of Christ's love to him, it's that sun which
begets this heat in the soul that loves him; and the more bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he shine on believers, the more is their love hot towards him;
for, <hi>here is love, not that we loved him, but that he loved us first.</hi>
11. It's an evidence of true love to Christ, and esteem of him,
when the heart is longing, praying and using means that it may
love him, and get it's love to him heightned till it be all bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on him alannerly.</p>
                  <p>In the thirteenth verse, we have the third and fourth motives,
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:65401:209"/>
whereby the Bride presseth her suit: The third is, <hi>The Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drakes
give a smell,</hi> &amp;c. It's like that motive which he useth in
pressing her to hearken to his call, <hi>Chap. 2. 12. The flowers appear
on the earth,</hi> &amp;c. The graces of the Spirit, growing up (as in a
Garden) in the believers walk with Christ, are like flowers in
the Spring, which by their pleasantnesse and favour, invite men to
the fields: Thus the sense of this motive comes to this, all
things (saith the Bride) are in a good condition, and there is a
thriving amongst my graces, which are for pleasantnesse as flower;
therefore <hi>Come.</hi> This avowing of the flourishing of her graces,
is not from any vain boasting, but in humble sincerity, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
what she sound in her self to his praise, and what she knew
to be acceptable to him, as a confirmation to her faith in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of what she prayed for; for (which is a lesson we would
learn) although the goodness of our condition can me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>it nothing
which we pray for; yet, it may give us confidence and boldness in
prayer, when we have a good conscience and testimony within us,
1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 20. This fruitfulnesse of hers is four wayes set forth,
1. That these her fruits are ripe, and in their flower, <hi>the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drakes
give a smell:</hi> Mandrakes were much longed for by <hi>Rachel,
Gen.</hi> 30. 14. and by their savourinesse of taste there, and of smell
here, it appears that they were some lovely fruit, and now in
their prime most pleasant, because they give their smell. 2. Her
fruitfulnesse is set forth in it's comprehensivenesse and variety,
She is adorned <hi>with all manner of pleasant fruits;</hi> whereby is
holden forth, that as believers have many diverse graces, like va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of Spices, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. 13. 14. which they should entertain, so
all of them were in good case with her. 3. These fruits were
<hi>new and old,</hi> whereby the plenty of the same kind is set forth,
both (to say so) of this and the former years growth; whereby
is signified, a thriving or increase of the believers grace, there
being a new degree of faith and love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of this year, added
to the former degree she attained before; she preserves the old,
and she brings forth new, as, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 52. the Scribe taught, in
the Kingdom of God, <hi>brings out things new and old;</hi> he hath the
old stock, and the new increase, the talents that were given him,
and five more gained by them. 4. These fruits are said to be <hi>at
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:65401:209"/>
our gates;</hi> This looks most simply to signifie this, that it's plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
to have such fruits at the doors, and it betokens a frequency
or plenty, and great abundance of them, when not only in the
Garden, but at the gates they so abound; so this abounding of
grace in a believer, makes (to say so) Christ's entry savoury and
pleasant, and shews, that all things are in a good readinesse for
him, as the last motive (<hi>that they are laid up for him,</hi> even while
they are at the gates) doth shew: In sum, all things (saith she)
are in readinesse, and for thee only my beloved; although not in
perfection, yet in sincerity, provision is made for thy entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<hi>Obs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>.</hi> 1. There are many various kinds of graces in a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever;
and when it's right with one, or when one of them is
thriving, it's ordinarily so with all. 2. Grace hath it's growth,
and should be increased by new additions, where it is begun; and
when it goes well with the believer, there will be of these spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
fruits, <hi>both new and old.</hi> 3. There is no keeping in good
case of the old stock of grace, but by continuing and growing in
fruitfulnesse; where the old is preserved, there will be found new
also, otherwise, what seemed once to blossome, becomes almost
withered. 4. These who are seriously desirous of Christ's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
should be making ready for him, by livelinesse of all manner
of graces, new and old; and they who aim at such a condition,
may with some confidence expect his presence and company.
5. Believers who seriously, tenderly and humbly follow holinesse,
may attain a great length in it, as this expression of her case sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies:
And therefore, the blame is only our own, that our at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments
in grace are so small.</p>
                  <p>The last motive is in the last words, These are the fruits (saith
she) <hi>which I have laid up for thee, O my beloved!</hi> These fruits
are many, and at the doors, yet they are laid up for him; they
are then such fruits, as are reserved for Christ. And this motive
compleats the former, whereby having asserted her fruitfulnesse,
lest she should seem to boast of it, that her graces did so abound,
whatever increase they have made, O my beloved (saith she) I
have devoted them to thee; they shall not be for my own satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
or boast, but for thy glory; therefore (saith she) <hi>Come:</hi>
as one would say, I have such good fruits of purpose kept for
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:65401:210"/>
thee, which no other shall share of, and therfore I invite thee
to come and enjoy them: which is a kind invitation, turning
over the acknowledgment of what she had on Christ, as indeed
belonging to him, and as only to be made use of for his honour:
So then, to <hi>lay up,</hi> signifies, 1. A carefulnesse and solicitous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
carefully to gather together, as covetous worldly men use
to lay up riches, and to gather them together. 2. It signifies
the successe which she had in her endeavour, that there was much
gathered, a store of fruits, as in a treasure; so we find <hi>laying up,</hi>
to have this sense, <hi>Psal. 31. 19. How great is thy goodnesse which
thou hast laid up,</hi> as it were in store? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3. It signifies a setting
apart of that store from common uses, as men do what they lay
up, and a reserving of it for some peculiar use: And the peculiar
use for which she laid them up, follows in these words, <hi>for thee,
O my beloved!</hi> Which implyes, 1. that in her gathering and
storing up, respect was had to Christ; and that her provision
was not to rest her self upon it, but to honour him with it.
2. That even when it was attained, she was denyed to it, and did
not look upon it as if it could be any stock to her self to live upon,
but that she had prepared it as an offering to propine or enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
him with: Even as a kind wise would provide what might
be for the husbands refreshment and honour, and would be still
laying up till he return, aiming singly to satisfie and entertain
him with it; So (saith the Bride) this store is for satisfying and
honouring of thee, and for thee only, O my beloved! It's for
thy cause, because thou commands it, loves it, and is honoured
by it. <hi>O my beloved,</hi> is added, to shew how affectionatly she in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
in this discourse; and in particular, how well bestowed she
thought all that she had laid up was, when it was bestowed upon
him; <hi>O my beloved!</hi> it's for thee, and I have willingly and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionatly
laid it up for that use, therefore come and lodge and
dwell with me, which is the scope. <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. Increasing in fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse,
or growing in holinesse, is a work that will not be done
in one day; but it will take time, and both carefulnesse and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
to gather together and lay up these spiritual fruits.
2. When Christ is absent to sense, it is a suitable and seasonable
duty to be laying up provision by fruitfulnesse in holinesse, for
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:65401:210"/>
his coming and return: Or, when Christ seems not presently to
come and accept of a believers prayers, duties or graces, yet are
they not to be rejected, and cast at as null and uselesse; nor is
the believer to desist from performing of them, but to continue
and persevere in stirring himself up in the exercise of graces and
duties, untill he come. 3. Although Christ come not at the first,
but suffer many of the believers duties, and the exercise of his
graces (if we may say so) to ly long on his hand, yet they are
not lost, but laid up (and grace is no ill treasure) and Christ will
one time or other come and make good use of them. 4. It's no
lesse practick (to say so) or it is no lesse difficult in believers
walk, to reserve what store they have gathered for Christ's use
alone, and to be denyed to it themselves, than to get duties per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
and spiritual provision laid up. 5. It's not enough to
do duties, and to lay up fruits, unlesse they be laid up for Christ;
and this is no lesse a duty than the former. 6. It's no small at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
in a believer, and a strong motive for attaining of Christ's
company (without which all will be nothing) when not only he
hath store of fruits, and is painful in holinesse, but also is denyed
to these, as to any use-making of them for his own ends, more
than if he had never been taken up in attaining them, and when
he reserves the praise of them to Christ Jesus alone, that they
may be subservient to his honour; This laying up fruits for him,
is opposit to the laying up for our selves, as <hi>living, eating, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting,</hi>
&amp;c. to him, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 15. Zech.</hi> 7. 5, 6. are opposite to <hi>living,
eating, fasting to our selves,</hi> which in Gods account is to be as
<hi>an empty vine,</hi> Hos. 10. 1. 7. Grace is of a durable nature, it
can keep, or it will endure laying up; all other treasures are fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
if men lay them up, they will rust and canker; but, the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up of this spiritual treasure, which makes men rich in good
works, is profitable, commendable; and the riches thereby
treasured up, are most durable.</p>

                  <p>THis Chapter carries on the copy of that spiritual commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
which is betwixt Christ and the believer: The Bride
speaks most here, and the neerer she come to a close, her
expressions become the more massy. It may be divided into these
parts, 1. The Bride continueth, and heightens her one great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,
of more intimate familiarity with Christ; which is propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
amplified and pressed, with the infinuation of her successe, and
after-carriage, in the first four verses. 2. The daughters of <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>
being charged by her, <hi>v.</hi> 4. break out with a commendation
of her, <hi>v.</hi> 5.â€”3. She forbears to owne them, but proceeds,
<hi>vers.</hi>â€”5. to speak to him (as loath to be interrupted or diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted)
with two further petitions: The first whereof, is for fixed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in her fellowship with him, that it be not lyable to the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
interruptions of a declining heart, <hi>vers.</hi> 6, 7. The second,
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:65401:211"/>
is for these not yet brought in, <hi>v.</hi> 8. 4. The Bridegroom replyes
to this last suit, in good words and comfortable, <hi>vers.</hi> 9. From
which, in the fifth place, she gathers a comfortable conclusion to
her self, <hi>vers.</hi> 10. which she confirms, <hi>vers.</hi> 11, and 12. 6. The
Bridegroom gives his farewell-request unto her, <hi>vers.</hi> 13. Which
seventhly and lastly, she meets with the ardent expression and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
up of her first, last, and great suit to him, to wit, that he
would <hi>make haste,</hi> that is, haste his coming for compleating her
happinesse, beyond which she hath nothing to say, and untill
which, she is never silent, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 17. So then, this Chapter doth
consist of seven parts, according to the several intercourses of the
speakers.</p>
                  <p>In the first part, the Bride first propounds, and amplifies, or
qualifies her suit, <hi>vers.</hi> 1.â€”2. It's pressed with motives,
<hi>vers.</hi>â€”1, 2. 3. Her attainment and successe in her suit is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
<hi>vers.</hi> 3, 4. And 4. her care of entertaining Christ, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded,
<hi>vers.</hi> 4.</p>
                  <p>The suit is in the first words, <hi>O that thou wert as my brother:</hi>
This I conceive looks not mainly to Christ's incarnation, but to
something that might have been by believers obtained even then
before his incarnation, and may yet be desired by these who now
love him: but, that which is chiefly intended in these words, is
the following forth of the love-strain of a heart-longing for Christ's
company, in the terms and expressions that are in use amongst
men: It hath been ever thought unseemly for Virgins, too fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly
to converse with men that are strangers, even though they
were suited for by them, this hath been cause of reproach to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;
but, for brethren and sisters to be familiar, hath not been
subject to mistakes: They who are in that relation may use more
freedom, than without offence can be used by others; Therefore,
<hi>Abraham</hi> fearing to call <hi>Sarah</hi> his wife, gave her out to be his
sister, that their conversing together might be the lesse suspected;
thus, the scope here is to presse, that Christ would condescend to
be so homely with her, as she with boldnesse and without fear
might converse with him: O! (saith she) that thou wert so fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
with me, that I might confidently converse with thee, as a
woman may do with her brother: and because, there is great
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:65401:212"/>
odds betwixt brethren that are of the same father, yet born of
diverse mothers (as <hi>Ioseph, Simeon</hi> and <hi>Iudah</hi> were) and breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
that are also of the same mother (as <hi>Ioseph</hi> and <hi>Benjamin</hi>
were, who therefore more dearly loved one another) she doth
therefore add that qualification, <hi>that sucked the brests of my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
that is, such a brother as hath been conceived in the same
womb, and nourished by the same brests (mothers being then
both mothers and nurses to their own children) whereby, a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the most neer and warm relation is signified: In sum, The
sense is this, O! if thou wert to me so condescending, as a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is to one born of that same womb with him, that I might
with the more freedom, boldnesse and confidence, and sensible
out-letting of my affections, converse with thee: Such sensible
breaking forth of affections, we find to have been betwixt <hi>Ioseph</hi>
and <hi>Benjamin,</hi> Gen. 43. 34. She looks upon all the familiarity
that she had attained, but as that which might be amongst stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
in respect of that which she longed for and expected: and that
this is the scope of this part of the Allegory, the words after do
clear, <hi>then I would kiss thee, and not be despised,</hi> or reproached for it;
whereas now in her present condition, which had much of estrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in it, any claim she made to Christ, was by tentation cast
in her teeth, and she upbraided, as if it were unsuitable for her
to carry so to him; but (saith she) if thou would condescend to
me, and be familiar with me as a brother, I would not be ashamed
for any challenge of that kind.</p>
                  <p>This suit, and it's qualification, import, 1. That there should
be much loving tendernesse betwixt these that are in so neer a
relation as this, to be born of one mother, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. That mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
who bear children, and are fitted to give suck, should not
decline that duty to their children, The giving of such being a
duty no lesse natural, than bringing forth, where the Lord
hath put no impediment to the contrary in the way. 3. It im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports,
that there are steps of accesse to Christ, and degrees of
fellowship with him, beyond any thing that the most grown be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
have attained: There is somewhat of this, even by the
Bride to be wished for, that she hath not yet attained. 4. There
ought to be no haulting or sitting down, in any attainment of
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:65401:212"/>
neernesse with Christ, till it be brought to that measure that no
more can be enjoyed, and till it be at the utmost height that is
possible to be attained. 5. To have sensible warmlinesse, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descending
familiarity from Christ, and confident freedome
with him, is the believers great design; that is, to have him as
a <hi>brother:</hi> And these two, to wit, confident freedome with
Christ, and his warm condescending to them, go together;
which the reasons following will clear. They are set down in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
motives, or advantages, which his being as a <hi>brother</hi> would
bring along with it to her; and hereby it will be further cleared,
what it is that is here intended. The 1. is hinted at in these
words, <hi>when I should find thee without: when,</hi> is supplied, and
the words read in the Original, <hi>I would find thee without:</hi> Now
(saith she) I have sought thee often without, and have for a
long time not found thee (as <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 2, 3. and 5. 6, 7.) but if
thou were thus familiar with me, I would have thy company eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
where, and think no shame of it. This suppons, 1. that Christ
may be without, or at a distance, even with his own Sister and
Spouse: The most sensible manifestations have interruptions.
2. When Christ is without, or at a distance, then the believer's
work is to seek him till he find him; he loves not to be separate
from Christ, and therefore he pants after his manifestations: An
absent Christ, and a seeking, painful, diligent believer, should
go together. 3. That where Christ is familiar, all interruptions
of presence are easily superable, yea, more easily superable then
to others, with whom he is not so familiar and intimat; he may
be found by them even <hi>without,</hi> that is, in cases that have in
them some obstructions unto intimat fellowship, as <hi>without</hi> is a
place that is not convenient for familiar communion. 4. It's a
great benefit to a believer, to have Christ's presence easily reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable,
or recovered; It's no small mercy to find him when he
is sought. Other things rising from this expression may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
from <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 2, 3. and 5. 6, 7. 5. In general, from all
these arguments we may observe, that they all include advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
to the believer, yet she makes use of them as motives to
presse her suit; which sayes, That whatever may be any re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                     </gap> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to a believer, doth sway much with Christ.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="422" facs="tcp:65401:213"/>
The second reason why she desires this, is, that she may imbrace
and <hi>kisse</hi> him, and it follows on the former (as each of them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
upon another) I would find thee without (saith she) and
<hi>I would kisse thee,</hi> having found him, she would with delight let
out her affections on him. Kisses amongst men, are the most
kindly evidences of their love, as was cleared, <hi>Chap. 1. vers.</hi> 1.
upon these words, <hi>Let him kisse me:</hi> His <hi>kisses</hi> are kindly intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of his love to her; and therefore her <hi>kissing</hi> of him must be
a most sensible flowing and abounding out-letting of her affections
on him, as affectionat relations do when they kisse one another;
It's much to the same purpose, with what she said, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.â€”12.
<hi>There will I give thee my loves:</hi> In sum, if thou wert familiar with
me (saith she) when I find thee, I would sensible, confidently,
and with freedom solace my self in thee, which now I dar scarce
do when I find thee, being possessed with fear of thy removal.
The difference between this expression, and that in <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.â€”12.
seems to be this; There, she desired communion with him, that
her heart might be by his presence disposed (to say so) for let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
out her love on him, and that she might have the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to do it: Here, she desires that he would manifest himself
more familiarly, that with the greater holy boldnesse and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
she might satisfie her self in pouring forth her love, by
spiritual soul-imbracings, and kissings of him whom she loved.
This imports, 1. That there are degrees in the way of believers
letting out their love on Christ, as there is in his manifesting of
himself to them; There are sometimes they <hi>give him their love,</hi>
when they have no accesse to <hi>kisse him;</hi> and other times they are
admitted to <hi>kissing</hi> of him, as at sometimes he doth them. 2. The
more familiarly his love lets out it self on them, the more doth
their love flow out on him. 3. It's a mercy to the believer, and
highly prized by him, to have accesse to <hi>kisse</hi> Christ, and to let
out his heart and love on him. 4. It sayes, that at all times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
will not get themselves solaced in Christ; This is an exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ise
to which their heart doth not frame, till he familiarly mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
himself; they cannot kisse and embrace him, untill his em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracements
come first. More particularly, if we consider the
scope of these words, <hi>I would kisse thee,</hi> and that, <hi>without:</hi> they
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:65401:213"/>
imply, 1. A more present sensible object, such as may be <hi>kissed:</hi>
Whence, <hi>Obs.</hi> Christ's familiar out-letting of himself, makes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
                     </gap>
exceedingly obvious unto the believer; it makes him so sensibly
present, as he may be in a spiritual way embraced and kissed. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>. It
holds out the out-letting of the believers love on him: From
which, <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. The great duty of one that finds Christ, is to love
him, and to let the heart flow out on him. 2. This should be
done whenever, or where ever, Christ is found; and so soon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
                     </gap>
opportunity is offered, the heart should close with it without
delay. 3. Familiarity with Christ will not be displeasing to him,
but exceedingly acceptable; otherwise, this could be no motive
to presse her suit.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Kissing him,</hi> imports, both a holy confidence, and satisfaction
or delight, in her letting out her heart upon him: Which shews,
that it's sweet not only to have Christ loving us, but to get him
loved; and so this is both satisfying to her, and acceptable
to him.</p>
                  <p>The third motive or reason (which depends on the former
two) is, <hi>yet I should not be despised,</hi> or, <hi>they should not despise me:</hi>
that is, although I found thee without, and were seen <hi>kissing</hi> thee,
and by confident boldnesse delighting in thee; yet, if thou wert
familiar with me as <hi>my brother,</hi> and according to the neernesse of
that relation would familiarly owne me, neither men, devils, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
nor any thing else, would have accesse to despise, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid,
or reproach me for it, I would be confident against all; as
a Virgin that is shewing her respect to her own born brother,
needs fear no reproach from that. <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. Believer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap> are subject
to be despised, even the beloved Bride of Jesus Christ is not
freed from this tryal, to be little esteemed of, even as the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourings
of all things, to be reproached and shamed by men (as
she was, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 7.) to be baffled (to say so) as an hypocrite, by
the devil and tentation, as <hi>Iob</hi> was, <hi>Iob,</hi> Chap. 1. and 2. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
are not senslesse or stupid, when reproached or despised,
they may be affected with it, and my endeavour rightly to have
it prevented, or removed. 3. Often the more tenderly that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
let out their affection on Christ, or their zeal for him,
they are the more subject to be despised; for, when she <hi>kisses</hi>
                     <pb n="424" facs="tcp:65401:214"/>
Christ, she looks upon <hi>despising</hi> then<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> as waiting on her, if he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
it not. 4. Christ's familiar presence, or, his being as a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
owning his Bride, is the great thing that guards off, and
prevents <hi>despising,</hi> and procures freedom from reproach, or at
least is a Bull-wark to the soul against reproaches: It's no little
advantage that familiarity with Christ brings alongst with it; for,
by his owning of believers, either their carriage is made so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing,
that malicious mouths are stopped, as having nothing to
say against them; or they are so sustained, under all these out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
or inward <hi>despisings,</hi> that they trouble them not, and so they
are to them as if they were not. 5. Christ's keeping up of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
is the dispensation under which the believer is most obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to be despised: The devil, tentations, and men, usually cast
up to them then, <hi>Where is their God?</hi> Psal. 42. 9, 10. and that pierces
them: So our Lord was dealt with on the Crosse: <hi>Iob</hi> calls this
the Lords renewing of his witnesses against him, whereby (as it
were) tentation is confirmed in what it asserted.</p>
                  <p>There follows in the second verse, four moe arguments, she
makes use of to presse her suit: We heard of three in the first
verse; The fourth is in these words, <hi>I would lead thee:</hi> The
word in the Original, signifies such a leading, as useth to be in
triumph, a leading that is joyned with respect and honour to the
person who is led. Christ leads his people as a shepherd doth his
flock, or a nurse her child; and this signifies tendernesse in him,
and weaknesse in them: The believer again, leads Christ, as a
servant or usher doth the master, or as men do Kings and victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Conquerors whom they honour; and this suppons stateli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in him, and respectivenesse and attendance in the Bride, she
looks upon him as a glorious, magnificent person, in whom, and
with whom, she desires only to triumph. In sum, the meaning is
this, If (saith she) thou wert as my brother, when I found thee
my self, I would not soon quite thee, but wait with all honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
attendance upon thee. <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. Honourable attendance on
Christ, and respective service, is a duty that well becomes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.
2. To give him this honour, is a thing which they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
aim at. 3. It's a great mercy to them (and they will so look
upon it) when they are helped, in a way suitable to his Majesty
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:65401:214"/>
and statelinesse, to wait upon him, and do him service. 4. Christ's
familiar presence, both gives believers the occasion, and also the
fitnesse and disposition, for giving him this honourable attendance;
she speaks here, as if one would say to another whom they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected,
If thou wert in our quarters, I would wait on thee, and
think it a favour to have the opportunity to do so: This, or the
like, is alluded unto here.</p>
                  <p>The fifth Argument follows on this, and it is, <hi>I would bring
thee into my mothers house:</hi> This is a resolution, to perform what
she had practized, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 4. and was spoken to there: The
sense is, If thou wert familiar with me (saith she) I would usher
thee in to the Church, whereof I am a member, for the good of
all the family; as if a Virgin, living in her mothers house, should
presse one whom she loved, and with whom she might be fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
as with a brother, when she had found him without, to go
in and abide with her in her mothers house, as the greatest evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of her respect, and that they of the family might have the
benefit of his company, as well as she: So it is here. And it
shews, 1. That she would leave no respect, that was possible to
her, unexercised towards Christ; She would not only honour
him her self, but she would endeavour to have him made known
to others, that they might have a high esteem of him also: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
whom Christ is familiar with, they will not be satisfied
with any respect they can put upon him, but are careful to have
him known, and honoured by all others that live in the Church
with them. 2. That in her seeking for him, she minded the
publick good of the Church, as well as her own: which teacheth
us, to propose to our selves the publick good, as well as our
own particular advantage, whenever we haunt the means, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we are called to seek him. 3. That she thought it a great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
to be any ways useful for the good of her mothers house:
And so believers will look upon it, not only as their duty, but
also as their mercy, to be useful to others. 4. That Christ's
presence, familiarly manifested to particular believers, doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
capacitat them, for being usefully instrumental in the
Church wherein they live.</p>
                  <p>The sixth Argument amplifies this, from the benefit that she
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:65401:215"/>
she would have by his being brought into her mothers house, in
these words, <hi>who would instruct me;</hi> That is, then she would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
me, if thou wert there: the Ordinances in the Church,
whereby believers are edified and instructed, would then be lively
and profitable, in a greater measure than formerly: Whereby it
appears, that by <hi>Mother,</hi> is understood the visible Church; for,
there only are the Ordinances which do instruct; and by the Bride,
is understood particular believers, because it is to them that
these Ordinances become <hi>the power of God unto Salvation.</hi> Or,
the words may be read, <hi>Thou would instruct me;</hi> that is, if thou
wert brought to the Church, thou by thy Ordinances would teach
me. The scope in both these readings is one, To shew, that by
Christ's presence in the Church, she expected to be taught, which
she looked for no otherwise, nor by any immediat way, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
she would have him there. <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. The most grown be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever
needs instruction, and is still a Scholar while he is in the
Church upon earth. 2. The Ordinances in the visible Church,
are the means, whereby Christ ordinarily teacheth his people;
otherwise, there were no force in this reasoning, to desire him
to her mothers house, that she might be instructed. 3. The most
eminent believer, even the Bride of Jesus Christ, is no above the
reach of Ordinances, but is to be instructed by them in the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Church. 4. Believers should endeavour the enjoyment of
Christ's company in the same Church that was their mother, and
seek to be instructed there, and should not endeavour to carry
Christ away from their mother-Church. 5. Christ hath a more
full way of manifesting his presence in his Church at one time than
at another; even as also at different times, there are different
measures of his manifestations to particular believers. 6. Christ's
presence in his Church and with his people, singularly furthers
their edification and instruction, and gives a blessing to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances.
7. Believers, when in a right frame, will account it
no little mercy to be instructed by Christ in his Ordinances, and
to have the word blessed unto them. 8. The most sensible and
full manifestations of Christ, should not, yea will not, lessen the
esteem of the Ordinances; but both should, and will put the
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:65401:215"/>
Lords people in a capacity to be edified by them, and will incline
and fit them to profit under them.</p>
                  <p>The last motive is taken from the entertainment she would
give him; If (saith she) thou wouldst familiarly manifest thy self,
and if once I had found thee, and gotten thee brought to my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
house, then <hi>I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine, of the
juice of my Pomegranate:</hi> In a word, I would entertain thee as
well as I might, and thou should be very welcome, and kindly
taken-with, as Guests, who are respected, use to be. By <hi>spiced
wine,</hi> and <hi>the juice of the Pomegranate,</hi> is understood the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
entertainment; as in these Countries, it's like (as we may
see from <hi>Prov.</hi> 9. 2. and Song, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 1.) they used to mix the
wine they gave their friends, that it might be the more favoury.
Now through this Song, by such similitudes are understood the
graces that are in believers, as, <hi>Chap. 4. 10, 13. &amp;c. Chap.</hi> 5. 1.
and in sum, the sense comes to this, if thou wert familiar with
me, and by thy presence in my mothers house, were making the
Ordinances lively, then I would feast thee on my graces, and my
love, faith, hope, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (which are to thee, more savoury than
wine, with which men use to entertain their most special friends)
should flow out abundantly on thee. Hence, <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
design and aim, at the feasting and entertaining of Christ,
when they have his company, as well as to be entertained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
themselves. 2. It's no little mercy to get respect to Christ
discharged<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and a believing soul will think it no small priviledge
to get him to entertain, if he have wherewith to entertain him.
3. Christ's coming to a soul brings sufficient provision for his own
entertainment: The Bride makes no question, but there shall be
a feast, if he will come; and if he come, not, there will be, nothing
but emptinesse there: She doubts not, but if once he would
come to her mothers house, his presence would make enough of
good provision. 4. The Lord respects even the offer of welcome
from his people, when he is not actually entertained as they
would: or though they be not in case for the time to entertain
him, yet their serious desire to do it, is very acceptable to him;
Otherwise, this would be no argument for our Lord Jesus, to
grant her suit.</p>

a return, which the Bride had to her suit; Our Lord Jesus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and putting in his left hand under her head, and as a kind
brother taking her in his arms, answereth her suit, and satisfieth
her desire: This agrees best with the words, as they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
used, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 6. and with the scope here. The verse fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
confirms it also, where she chargeth the daughters not to
stir him up, which suppons him to be present: So we find the
same charge following the same words, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 7. as also, her
finding him, and bringing him to her mothers house, is followed
with the same charge, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 5. and she is said to be leaning on
him here, <hi>vers.</hi> 5. and yet is by the daughters commended, and
not despised, which is a proof that he was present; for, this
is it that made her not to be despised. The meaning then is,
Now (saith she) I have obtained what I desired, and he is become
very friendly and familiar with me, like a brother, which was my
desire. And this shews, 1. that Christ easily condescends to his
longing Bride, to give her such a degree of his presence as she
called for; and that he doth this so suddenly, is great kindnesse
and confidence: Christ will in this sometimes condescend very
quickly to the desires of his longing people. 2. That she ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
and acknowledgeth it; It's no lesse duty to observe and
acknowledge a return, than to put up a prayer. 3. Christ hath
a singularly tender way of communicating his love, and of embrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his people, he can take them in his arms, and make much of
them, when he sees it fit. 4. There is a sweet satisfaction, and
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:65401:216"/>
unspeakable heart-quieting refreshment to be found in Christ's
arms; She thinks it so good to be here, that she speaks of it
with much complacency, and carefully sets her self not to have it
interrupted in the verse following.</p>

that ye stir not up, nor awake
my Love, untill he please.</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>Having now accesse to much familiarity with Christ, as she de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired,
and being in his arms, she expresseth her care in this verse,
to prevent any new interruption of his blessed presence; as if a
woman having her friend or husband sleeping in her arms, should
command all in the house to be quiet, lest he should be awaked:
So the Bride sets her self to watch so tenderly over every thing
that is in her, that nothing give him just ground to withdraw:
and though she speak to the daughters of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> yet the scope
shews, she looks to her self; but it's thus expressed, partly, to
keep the form used in this Song, and so having spoken of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him to her mothers house, she makes use of the similitude of
keeping the house quiet; partly, to shew her seriousnesse and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality
in this her care, and the great need that there is of being
watchful, even as <hi>David</hi> often provokes all creatures to praise,
and layes that charge on them, thereby to shew his own serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in the thing, and the greatnesse of the work of praise which
he was taken up with: so to the same purpose is this resemblance
here. The same words were found, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 7. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 5.
where they were opened: there are two little differences in the
Original, which yet alter not the scope: 1. That expression, <hi>by the
Roes and Hindes</hi> (which was formerly used) is here left out, not
because this charge is lesse weighty, but it shews a haste and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptnesse
in her speaking, which makes her omit that, the more
speedily to expresse her charge. 2. It was before, <hi>If ye stir or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake:</hi>
Here it is (as the margent reads from the Original) <hi>why
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:65401:217"/>
will ye stir or awake?</hi> Which doth more plainly import, 1. a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse,
or ben<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>il in them to stir him up. 2. A certainty of the
effect of his withdrawing, if they should stir him up, or awake
him. 3. An unreasonablenesse and absurdity in the doing of it,
Why will ye do it? saith she. 4. A pressing seriousnesse, in her
proposing of this question, and urging it so vehemently. From
this, and the frequent repetition of this charge, <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. That it's
a difficult piece of work, to keep the heart tender and watchful
for entertaining of Christ, even when he is present. 2. The
strongest believer will take one charge after another, and all will
have enough to do, to make him watchfully tender in keeping
Christ; There is so much lazinesse in the hearts of the best, and
there is so great need to stir them up to renew their watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
3. When the heart hath had frequent proofs of it's own
declining, there is the more need to be very serious in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
of it again. 4. There is nothing that a kindly loving be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever
will have more indignation at, whether in himself or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
than at this, that Christ should be provoked, and thereby
put to withdraw; this he cannot abide, <hi>Why</hi> (saith she) <hi>will ye
stir him up?</hi> 5. They who have Christ's presence, will not be
peremptory with him, for the constant continuing of the sense
thereof, although they love it; but will be peremptory with
themselves, that by their sin they provoke him not to withdraw
before he please. 6. Communion with Christ is an uptaking ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
to the believer, it takes him so up that he is never idle:
If he be waiting for Christ, he is breathing, <hi>O that thou wert,</hi> &amp;c.
and seeking to find him; If he enjoy him, he is endeavouring to
keep and entertain him, and these two takes him up: Believers
are either seeking while they obtain, or watching that they may
entertain what they have attained.</p>

                  <p>The daughters of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> come in speaking to the Brides
commendation, in the first part of the fifth verse, <hi>Who is this,</hi>
say they, (or, who is she?) <hi>that cometh up from the wilderness, lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on her beloved?</hi> This part of the verse stops the Bride from
following the purpose she was upon, with a kind of an abrupt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation
to her commendation. The daughters now beholding
her resting in her beloveds arms, as it is, <hi>vers.</hi> 3. to shew the
commendablenesse of that posture of leaning on him, they are
brought in admiring it; And therefore, both the Bride and the
Bridegroom are spoken of in the third person, and that by way of
question, which supposeth no doubt in the thing, who it was of
whom they speak, but implyeth an exceeding high estimation of
the party spoken of, as being (especially in that posture) exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
lovely. The words hold out a believers walk, 1. In the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of it, it's a <hi>coming up,</hi> or <hi>ascending.</hi> 2. In the term from
which, it's <hi>from the wildernesse:</hi> By which two (as was cleared,
<hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 6.) is understood the believers spiritual progresse hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven-ward,
with their backs on all the contentments of the world,
as being unsuitable for them to rest in: These two are spoken of,
<hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 3. There is added here a more expresse description of
her posture, in this ascending, she is <hi>leaning on her beloved;</hi> that
is, as they who are weak, make use of a staff, in climbing of a strait
and steep ground, or ease themselves by leaning upon one that is
strong, and especially one whom they love, for helping them in
their way; So the believer is said to come up from the wilderness,
<hi>leaning on her beloved,</hi> because she being weak in her self, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
for such a difficult voyage, by faith rests on Christ, for helping
her in the way, whereby she is sustained, and carried through in
the duties of a holy walk, and the difficulties in her way, till she
come through the wildernesse unto the land of rest. So then,
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:65401:218"/>
this <hi>leaning</hi> imports, 1. felt-weaknesse in her self, for encounter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with the difficulties of this walk or journey. 2. Strength in
Christ, sufficient for enabling her. 3. Her use-making of this
strength by faith; for, that is to <hi>lean</hi> or rest on him, or to be
<hi>joined</hi> or <hi>associat</hi> to him, as the word is rendered by some; and
it is ordinary for faith to be expressed by leaning, resting, taking
hold; and so leaning to Christ is opposed to <hi>leaning to our own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,</hi>
Prov. 3. 5. 4. Her quieting of her self delightsomly
in her leaning or resting on Christ, which gave her security against
all fears and difficulties in her way, as <hi>Iohn</hi> when he leaned on
Christ's bosome, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13. 23. So the believer thinks himself sure
and safe, when admitted to lean his soul there. 5. A progresse
that she made by this in her way and journey, and that this lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
had much influence on her advancement therein, and upon
this account is her leaning mainly commended. <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. That
even believers are insufficient of themselves, as of themselves,
for the duties of a holy walk. 2. That believers should walk un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the sense of this their insufficiency and weaknesse, and when
they come the greatest length in a holy walk, they should not lean
unto themselves, or any inherent stock of gifts or grace; which
two suppons, that a believers conversation, when right, is a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
and tender walk. 3. Christ Jesus hath a sufficiency and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
in him, not only for the justification of believers that rest
on him, but for the furthering of their sanctification also, and
helping of them to a victory over the world; Hence, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30.
<hi>He is our sanctification,</hi> as well as our <hi>Iustification.</hi> 4. Believers
in their way, would not only by faith rest on Christ, for attaining
pardon of sin by his righteousnesse; but, would also by faith de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
on him, for furthering of their mortification and sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
And thus, in the exercise of faith and holy dependence,
we are to <hi>acknowledge him in all our wayes,</hi> which is opposed to
<hi>leaning to our own understanding,</hi> Prov. 3. 5. This was practized
in an examplary way, by the Worthies, recorded, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 5. The
exercising of faith on Christ for sanctification and life, and for
performing of the duties of holinesse, hath much influence on the
believers successe in all these; for, <hi>this is our victory,</hi> whereby the
world is overcome, <hi>even our faith,</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 4, 5. And therefore,
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:65401:218"/>
these that are most in the use-making of Christ, for the helping
them foreward in their way, cannot but come best speed; for, <hi>lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on him,</hi> and <hi>going up,</hi> are here joyned together: And so they
can never make progresse in holiness, that make not use of Christ
in their endeavours after it; God hath so coupled use-making of
Christ, and progresse in holinesse together, that Christ may bear
all the glory of the believers successe in the way of holinesse, and
that he that glories may glory in him. 6. The believers walk
toward heaven is both a stately, and also an easie and successful
walk; for, he is to go about all duties in the strength of Christ,
and so Christ bears the burden, and his yoke becomes easie: It's
the neglecting of him, that makes all duties wearisome. 7. It's
no little piece of the dexterity of a holy walk, and is the great
commendation of it, to do all we do by faith, to walk and go on
in the faith of his strength, as leaning on him; This makes the
Brides posture wonderful, for it's rarity and commendablenesse.
8. Although doing of duties will not prove an interest in Christ,
and although believers come not to perfection, or any exact suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ablenesse
in them, yet the doing of them in the strength of Christ,
and walking, as leaning on him, will make out an interest in him:
None can actually imploy him, for bearing them through in duty,
who have not first closed with him, as their beloved, for obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of pardon: This is the Brides property, Christ is first her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,
and then she <hi>leans</hi> upon him, to be helped in her walk.
9. That is solid faith, which doth empty the believer of himself
in the performance of all duties, as well as of righteousnesse in
the point of his justification: The native work of saith, is to make
the soul rest on Christ, yea, and actually it makes the soul rest on
Christ alone; for, all true faith layes the burden of all duties
and difficulties upon him, and so is it compared to <hi>leaning.</hi>

                  <p>The second part of this verse, in these words, <hi>I raised thee
up,</hi> &amp;c. are not without obscurity: We take the words to be a
new argument of the Brides, whereby (a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ter this exclamation of
the daughters of <hi>Ierusalem</hi>) she comes in to presse her former
suit upon the Bridegroom, and proceeds in it, as being loath to
be interrupted or diverted from her direct application to him;
wherefore, she seems to take no notice of what the daughters
spoke, and makes no reply, but instantly goes on in her wrestling
with him, as if nothing had been spoken by them. That they are
words spoken to him, the <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>â€¢â€¢â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>xes</hi> in the Original make it clear;
for, although there be no such difference in our Language, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we may discern whether the word <hi>thee,</hi> be masculine or femi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine,
as spoken to man or woman, yet in the Hebrew there is a
clear difference; And so, the word <hi>thee, I raised thee,</hi> being in
the Original of the masculine gener, it's <hi>thee</hi> man, or <hi>thee</hi> my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,
or husband; and therefore, they cannot be understood as
his words to her, but as hers to him, seing it may be clearly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in the Original that they belong to a man, and it's a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
word from that which is ordinarily spoken of a woman;
and there being no convincing example to the contrary, we must
so understand the words here, and to understand them otherwise,
would bring-in needlesse confusion in that Language. Next, that
her scope is to presse for neernesse with him, both what went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and what follows, do demonstrat: which also the opening
of the words will confirm. In them there are two experiences
asserted, which tend both to this scope: The first is her own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:65401:219"/>
                     <hi>I raised thee up under the Apple-tree.</hi> The second is,
the experience of all other believers, <hi>there thy mother brought
thee forth, there she brought forth</hi> (for <hi>thee</hi> in this repeated ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
is not in the Original) <hi>that bare thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By the <hi>Apple-tree,</hi> we understand Christ himself, who is so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 3. because of his fruit and shadow, under which she
sat down. To be <hi>under the Apple-tree,</hi> suppons her to be neer
him, and actually delighting her self on him, as being abundantly
refreshed under his shadow, as was cleared, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 3. Her
<hi>raising up</hi> of Christ, imports these three things, 1. A duty on her
part (to say so) putting him to shew himself someway for her,
more than formerly he had done: So to <hi>raise,</hi> or <hi>awake,</hi> when it
is applyed to God, signifies, as, <hi>Psal. 7. 6. Psal. 44. 23. Awake,
why sleepest thou? arise, cast us not off?</hi> So then, the meaning of
this expression, <hi>I raised thee,</hi> is, I dealt with, and importuned
thee in this. 2. It implyes importunity in dealing with Christ,
incessantly she stirred him, and with petitions pressed him; So,
when it is said, <hi>Isa. 64. 7. No man stirrs up himself,</hi> &amp;c. The word,
<hi>stirrs up,</hi> is the same word, and imports more than to pray: It
signifies livelinesse and wrestling in it, as fowls use to stirr their
young ones when they would have them flying, from which the
word is borrowed. 3. It implyes successe, I not only made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
to thee, and was helped to be serious; but I prevailed,
and thou was awaked and raised, and did make thy self in more
than an ordinary way manifest to me, and for me, when I being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
under thy shadow, took that opportunity to deal with
thee. This then is the scope and strength of this first assertion,
It's no marvel (saith she) that I long for thy company; for, by
former experience I have found the good of it, not only for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
ease under sad difficulties, but also I have been thereby help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to more liberty in prayer, and have had successe for attaining
new experiences of thy love; Therefore, I desire thy company
still, and cannot but desire it.</p>
                  <p>The second assertion is more broad and extensive, Not only I
(saith she) have found it so; but all thy people have found ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
to thee, or thy blessed company and presence singularly use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
to make them fruitful, as having much influence thereon.
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:65401:220"/>
So, by Christ's <hi>mother,</hi> here we conceive, is understood the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever,
in whom he is formed and brought forth, as we cleared
on <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 11. and they <hi>bring forth Christ,</hi> 1. By giving him a
beeing in their hearts, where he had it not before; his image is
in some respect himself, and when his image is brought forth in
the soul, Christ is said to be formed and brought forth there.
2. By bringing forth of the fruits of Christ's Spirit before others;
when being, as it were, in travel in the pursuit of holiness, they
are helped to manifest his image (after which they are created)
in their conversations. 3. By attaining to the knowledge of this,
that Christ is in them; believers being, as it were, in travel,
till they know their delivery; but when that is clearly made out,
and intimate to them, then (as the woman that brings forth a
man-child, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16. 21.) they are at quietnesse, as being deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
The force of the Argument lyes in the word <hi>there,</hi> which
relates to the <hi>Apple-tree;</hi> under the Apple-tree (saith she) where
I raised thee up, being admitted to thy fellowship; <hi>there</hi> also
they were made fruitful, and delivered from their former pangs
and travel, even as I was; and when it is found in the experience
of all thy people, as well as by me (saith she) that thy presence
and company is so useful, it can therefore be no delusion, nor
is it any wonder that I so presse after it: And by this it seems,
that <hi>bringing forth</hi> of Christ in this second part, is the same in
substance with <hi>raising of him up</hi> in the former, to wit, the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of some sensible manifestation of Christ's respect, by which,
these who were formerly in pain to have Christ formed in them,
are now delivered and eased from the flames of jealous love, that
are as pangs to such as travel in birth (as it were) to have their
interest in Christ made clear, as the words in the following verse
expresse. <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. That which in a believers experience hath
proven useful, is in a special manner lovely and commendable to
them: Experience is a most convincing demonstration of the
worth of any thing, and leaves the deepest impression thereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
it. 2. The more any by experience have learned Christ's
worth, and the more they have <hi>tasted that he is gracious,</hi> their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
do the more vehemently stir after him. 3. Christ's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
hath many great and excellent advantages waiting on it;
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:65401:220"/>
It brings <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ase and quietnesse to the soul, and gives refreshment
under his shadow, it gives accesse to pray with freedom, and
duties then have usually a sensible successe. 4. The believer
looks upon it as a great mercy to have freedom in prayer, and
to be heard when he prayes; That by prayer she <hi>raised Christ up,</hi>
is remembred as a mercy not to be forgotten, and this yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
unto her the good of sitting under his shadow. 5. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
to Christ is no time for security, but for prayer; and when
the believer is admitted to solace himself in Christ's presence,
then should he be diligent in wrestling with him, and improving
that opportunity for pressing after a further manifestation of him.
6. There are some experiences that are unquestionable to all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
though they be mysteries to all others in the world.
7. It is not a little strengthning, yea, exceedingly confirming
to believers, when their experience and the experiences of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
believers co-incide, and jump in the proof of the same
thing. 8. Although believers may in some things differ, yet
there are some things commonly found good in experience by them
all: This is the advantage of Christ's company, there was
never a believer that attained it, but he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ound much good of
it; and these who still travel for it, apprehend groundedly that
there is an unspeakable good in it.</p>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>In the sixth verse, she proceeds to her second petition, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
she is strengthned from her former experience: The suit is
in two expressions, to one purpose; and it is pressed with seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
reasons, in the end of the sixth and seventh verses; whereby
she shews, that lesse could not be satisfying to her, and this much
she behoved to have granted her. The first expression, holding
forth her suit, is, <hi>Set me as a seal upon thine heart:</hi> The second is
to the same purpose, in the words that follow, and <hi>as a seal upon
thine arm.</hi> By Christ's <hi>heart</hi> is signified his most inward affection;
for, it is frequent in Scripture by the <hi>heart</hi> to signifie the most
inward affections; So, <hi>Matth. 6. 12. where the treasure is, there
the heart will be:</hi> And, <hi>Chap. 4. 9. Thou hast ravished my heart,</hi> &amp;c.
A <hi>seal</hi> is used for confirming evidences, or closing of letters:
They have some peculiar ingraving on them, serving to distinguish
the deed of one man from the deed of another; wherefore men
use to have a special care of their Signet or Seal: (for both are one
upon the matter and in the Original) Thus <hi>Ahasuerus</hi> kept his Seal
upon his own finger, <hi>Esth.</hi> 3. 10, 12. So then, from this we may see,
that a Seal, or Signet, signifieth, 1. What one hath a precious
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:65401:221"/>
esteem of; and therefore, <hi>Ier.</hi> 22. 24. the Lord saith of <hi>Coniah,
though thou wert the Signet on my right hand,</hi> &amp;c. And, <hi>Hag.</hi> 2. 23.
the Lord expresseth his love to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> in this, that he would
take <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> and make him as a <hi>Signet.</hi> 2. By <hi>Seal</hi> is signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
something that makes an impression, and leaves a stamp there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
behind it, that doth not wear out again, as a Seal doth on the
Wax. Next, by <hi>Christ's arm,</hi> may be understood, his care of
his people, outwardly expressed in the effects, wrought by his
power for their good: So, <hi>Isa.</hi> 40. 11. it's said, he <hi>will gather the
Lambs with his arms,</hi> &amp;c. Thus then, to be <hi>set as a seal on his
heart,</hi> doth imply, 1. Exceeding great neernesse to Christ, e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>en
to have a special room and seat in his heart. 2. It imports, a
settlednesse in that condition, that she may be <hi>set</hi> there, as the
Lord saith of <hi>Ierusalem, 2 King.</hi> 21. 4. there I have <hi>put</hi> or <hi>set</hi>
my Name, and as it is, <hi>Psa. 132. 14. there will I dwell.</hi> 3. To
be <hi>set as a Seal on his arm,</hi> takes in further, that, as she would be
always minded by Christ, and have him loving her; so would she
have him in all his dispensations making that manifest, and that (as
it were) they may bear it ingraven upon them, that he minds her;
like that expression, <hi>Isa. 49. 14. I have graven thee upon the palms
of my hands,</hi> whereby he expresseth his mindfulnesse of her, that
he could look to nothing in all his works, but he saw (as it were)
her name ingraven thereupon; for, all his works expresse love to
her. In sum, we conceive the words look to one, or both of
these similitudes, or allusions: 1. In general, to men who had
such respect to their Seals or Rings, that they wore them on
their fingers, and carried them still about with them; Now,
she would be carried about on his heart, and have him sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thizing
with her in every thing that she meets with. 2. And
more especially, it may allude to <hi>Aaron's</hi> Brestplate, whereby he
did carry the names of the children of Israel on his heart, <hi>Exod.</hi>
28. 12, 29. which ingraving is said to be like the <hi>ingraving of a
Signet,</hi> in which the High-priest was certainly a type of Christ:
However, this is certain, that she would be established in her u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with Christ, so that neither desertions on his part, nor back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slidings
on hers, might marr that; but that she might be fixed
as to her union with him, and made to abide in him, as the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:65401:222"/>
of a Seal is fixed upon the Wax, and made to abide in
it. <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. True love to Christ, will be bold, pressing and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunat,
in it's suits to him; It will not stand to seek any thing
that may endear him to the soul, to have him as <hi>a brother,</hi> and
to be worn <hi>upon his heart,</hi> &amp;c. 2. Christ's heart and inside, is
most heartsome to the believer, who hath had any discovery
thereof made unto his soul; and true love can settle no where,
till it get a lodging in his very heart, that is the proper resting-place
of a beliver, and that is the refreshing, which can make
the weary to rest. 3. Love to Christ would not only be neer him,
but would be fixed and established in neernesse with him. 4. A
stayed, immovable condition, or frame of heart, in the enjoying
of communion with Christ, is most desirable and profitable; and
therefore, it is no marvel it be longed for. 5. There is no stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or settling of a believer, till he be admitted to dwell (as it
were) in Christ's heart, that is, to dwell neer him in the believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and enjoying of his love; all other grounds are wavering, but
this is stable; and dwelling here, if it were pressed after, would
bring more establishment.</p>
                  <p>This seems to be a peremptory suit, she doth therefore give
two reasons to presse it, both which shew that it will not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasant
to Christ, nor can it be condemned in her; for (saith
she) the love that presseth me to it is of such a vehement nature,
I cannot resist it, more than death, the grave, or fire can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted.
This reason is contained in the rest of the sixth verse.
The second reason in the following, wherein she shews, that the
love that pressed her, was of such a peremptory nature, and so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractable
(if we may so speak) as to this, that there was no deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with it, if it did not obtain it's desire, no other thing could
quench or satisfie it. The strength of her love is amplified in the
sixth verse, by three steps, in several similitudes. By <hi>love</hi> here,
is understood that vehement, ardent desire, after Christ's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
which is kindled in the heart of the believer. And first,
it is called <hi>strong,</hi> in respect of it's constraining power, whereby
the person that loves, is led captive, and brought down as weak
under it, so that he cannot withstand it: Saith she, love masters
and will undo me, if it be not satisfied; Love-sicknesse so weakens
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:65401:222"/>
the soul, when it once seazeth on the heart, till it be cured with
Christ's presence. Next, it's called <hi>strong as death,</hi> which is so
strong, that it prevails over the most powerful, wise, mighty and
learned in the world, <hi>Eccles. 8. 8. there is no discharge in
that war;</hi> neither can the most mighty Monarch encounter death,
and stand before it: So (saith she) I can no more stand against
the strength of this love, it overpowers me, and is like to kill
me, if it be not satisfied. The second step or degree of this love,
and the similitude illustrating it, is in these words, <hi>jealousie is
cruel as the grave:</hi> It's the prosecution of the same purpose,
only, what she called <hi>love</hi> before, is here termed <hi>jealousie; Iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie</hi>
may be taken in a good sense, or an evil: In a good sense,
jealousie is the highest degree of love, or love at it's heighth, and
and is the same with zeal: Thus the Lord is said to be <hi>jealous
for his glory:</hi> And it imports, 1. ardent affection. 2. Desire of
injoying. 3. Impatiency of delay. 4. A deep measure of grief,
mixt with love, for any seeming appearance of a disappointment
in the injoying the person they love, or, when they do not meet
with love again from the person whom they dearly love: So jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie
in this sense is applyed to both God and men, but proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
it agreeth only to men; for, there are no such passions in God,
though he, condescending to our capacity, speaks thus of himself,
after the manner of men. Now this jealousie is said to be <hi>cruel,</hi>
or <hi>hard:</hi> It's called, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6. the <hi>rage of a man;</hi> and this was the
jealousie, or <hi>zeal</hi> that did eat up <hi>David,</hi> Psa. 69. and so it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to the <hi>grave,</hi> which, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. is the first of these four
things that are never satisfied, but wasts all the bodies that are
laid in it: So (saith she) this love of mine, being at a heighth,
torments me restlesly, as if it were cruelly persecuting me, till it
be satisfied with a good answer from thee, O! my beloved. In
an evil sense, <hi>jealousie</hi> signifies not a simple fear of missing the
thing men desire, or a suspition of their own short-coming in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
of it, but a groundlesse suspition of them whom they
love, as if they did not entertain their love as they ought; and
thus, jealousie is called <hi>the rage of a man,</hi> Prov. 6. 34. and so here,
this cannot be altogether excluded; jealousie thus taken, having
in it some unbelief, which torments believers horribly, when
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:65401:223"/>
the suspition of Christ's not taking notice of them grows; and
this is frequently to be found in the Saints cases, in times of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion;
they are then very apt to suspect God's love, and this
exceedingly disquiets them, the want of the faith and sense of his
love being a death unto them, <hi>Psal.</hi> 77. 8, 9, 10. And so the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
runs thus, let me be admitted to thy heart, for my love will
be satisfied with no lesse; and if this be not obtained, jealousie
and suspition of thy love may steal in, and that will be torturing
and tormenting: And therefore, she puts up this suit, that she
may be set as a Seal upon his heart, to have that prevented; for,
she cannot abide to think of it. 3. She compares this jealousie
to <hi>coals of fire (the coals thereof are coals of fire)</hi> for their vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
heat, tormenting nature, and consuming power; all which
are to be found in this strong and jealous love, it is vehement
for heat, painful and destructive as fire is: yea further, it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to coals that have <hi>a most vehement flame,</hi> or as it is in the
Original, the <hi>flame of God;</hi> for, so the Hebrews do name any thing
that is superlative in it's kind, and this is added, to shew the
horrible torture that Christ's absence, and love-sicknesse hath
with it, to a tender loving soul, especially when carnal unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
jealousie enters and prevails, they cannot abide it, but would
choose any rod before that, if it were at their election. <hi>Obs.</hi> 1.
Love to Christ, where it is strong and vigorous, will make strange
and mighty impressions on the heart, which others are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
with, and will break out in such expressions, as men of the
world may wonder what they mean, none of them having any such
feeling or sensiblenesse of Christ's absence or presence. 2 Where
true love to Christ is, it's a most constraining thing, the soul that
hath it, cannot but pursue for Christ, and go about all means
which may any way further it's communion with him. 3. Where
love begins to pursue after Christ, the longer it be in meeting
with him, it increaseth the more, where it is real; and the moe
disappointments it meet with, it grows the more vehement, till
it break out in jealousie and zeal. 4. Believers that have true
love, are ready to fall in jealousies of Christ, and to be suspitious
of his love, especially in his absence; This is supposed here, that
where true love to Christ is, there may be jealousie of him.
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:65401:223"/>
5. Where jealousie enters, is cherished and prevails, it's not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
dishonourable to Christ, but exceedingly torturing to the
believer: There is not a more vexing guest can be entertained,
than jealousie of Christ. 6. Jealousie of Christ's love may be
where there is little cause, and often where there is least cause,
it is most ready to enter; The reason whereof may be taken from
the ardency of the souls love to him, joyned with the mistakes
they have of his way, So, <hi>Isa.</hi> 49. 13, 14. For, considering what
is gone before, it might be thought, that whatever any other
might seem to have, the Bride had no cause of jealousie. 7. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
would endeavour to prevent all jealousie of Christ and his
love, and by all means seek to be established and confirmed in the
saith of his love to them, as that which can only keep and guard
the heart against these sinful suspitions and jealousies. 8. Though
this jealousie be vexing, yet sometimes the believer cannot rid
himself of it, it will so prevail, and is so <hi>cruel</hi> against him. 9. In
the similitude of <hi>death</hi> and the <hi>grave,</hi> that is here made use of,
it is implyed, that no man shall escape death and the grave, they
are as strong and mighty Conquerours, that prevail over all that
come in their way: It's clearly hinted here, that the believer
carrieth this conviction in his heart, that sometime he will be
prevailed over by death and the grave, This is no ill impression,
<hi>the graves are ready for me,</hi> and, <hi>I have said to corruption, Thou
art my father; to the worm, thou art my mother, and my
sister,</hi> Job, 17. 1, 14.</p>
                  <p>Her second reason is contained, <hi>vers.</hi> 7. and it's taken from the
peremptorinesse of her love; for, her love is such as it will have
love from Christ again, or no other thing will satisfie it. This
is two wayes illustrat, 1. From it's invinciblenesse, which appears
in this, no opposition can extinguish it, <hi>many waters cannot quench
love, neither can the floods drown it:</hi> Waters will quench fire,
but nothing will quench this love. By <hi>waters</hi> in Scripture,
often (as <hi>Psa.</hi> 42. 7. and 93. 4. and frequently) are understood
afflictions, crosses, and even spiritual desertions, <hi>Psa. 42. 7. all thy
waves and billows have gone over me,</hi> Psa. 109. 1, 2. And so here
it saith, Love to Christ is of that nature, and is so strongly fixed
on him, that no crosse or rod, nay not the blackest dispensations
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:65401:224"/>
and desertions can make it alter; but it will stick to him through
and over all, as, <hi>Rom. 8. 35. neither famine, sword, pestilence,</hi> &amp;c. can
do it, but it triumphs over all, though floods of tryal and opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
were let out upon it. The second way how the peremptori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of love is illustrat and proven, is, that it rejects all offers,
that may be made to it by any other that would have Christ's
room: There are two sorts of tryals, that ordinarily carry souls
away from Christ, The first is on the left hand, from crosses;
and when these will not do it, but the thorny ground will abide
the heat of the Sun; yet, the second sort of tryals, to wit, the
cares of the world, and the deceitfulnesse of riches, which are
tentations on the right hand, may choak the word, and carry the
soul away: But (saith she) true love to Christ, will be prevailed
over by neither, it will tryst and capitulat with other lovers upon
no terms; nay, though a man would give it <hi>all the substance of
his house;</hi> that is, all that can be given, though he would leave
nothing behind, but give it all to one that loves Christ, for <hi>love,</hi>
that is, to purchase and buy away the souls love from Christ, that
it may be given to some other thing that comes in competition
with him, so to bud and bribe the souls love from Christ, that it
may settle on some other thing that is offered in his place: What
entertainment would be given to such offers and treaties? True
love (saith she) in so far as it is true, and lively in exercise (o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
where something of true love is, the soul may often be
insnared) <hi>would utterly contemn it,</hi> or as it is in the first Language,
<hi>contemning it should be contemned;</hi> that is, not only would all such
alluring offers be rejected, but with a holy disdain and indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
they would be despised, abhorred and abominated, as unsuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
once to be mentioned: So that true love to Christ, will not
once enter to capitulat, what to have in Christ's room; but all
possible overtures, which may be made by the flesh and the world
to divert it, will be abhorred and loathed utterly, and <hi>accounted
as loss and dung,</hi> Philip. 3. 8. And therefore, the reason concludes,
at thy heart I must be, for my love will neither be boasted from
thee, nor bribed or allured to be satisfied with any other thing
in thy room; but thee I must have upon any terms, and must not
be refused of this my suit, of being set as a Seal upon thine heart:
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:65401:224"/>
And this sort of peremptorinesse from love, will not be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
presumption by Christ, nor is any-wayes displeasing, but most
acceptable to him. <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. Where true love to Christ is, there
will be many essayes to cool it, or to divert it, and draw it away
from him: It's no easie thing to get love to Christ kept warm; for,
the devil and the world, will especially aim at the throwing down
of this hold and bul-wark, that maintains Christ's interest in the
soul. 2. The devil hath several kinds of tentations, which do all
drive especially at this, to cool the believers affections in the love
of Christ: and these tentations may be contrary, some of them
mustering the difficulties that follow these that love him, and such
as the tempted seekers of Christ may be oftentimes exercised with;
for, they often meet with reproaches, or other afflictions in the
world: Others of them again, alluring the heart to embrace
some other thing in Christ's room, and making fair offers of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
to these that will take the way of the world in following
of them. 3. The lovers of Christ may be assaulted by both these
extrems successively, and when tentations from the one hand fail,
then tentations from the other begin, so that the believer would
constantly be on his guard. 4. The tentations that come from
the right hand, and entice the soul with the offers of worldly
pleasure, honour, riches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are more strong and subtil than the
other, and more frequently do prevail, yea sometimes when the
other may be rejected; Therefore, this is mentioned after the
other, as being that wherewith the soul is assaulted, when the
first cannot prevail, and so the devil leaves this till the last; when
he was permitted to tempt Christ, having tryed him with se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
tentations, at last he makes offer of the world to him, <hi>Mat.</hi>
4. 9. 5. Tentation will sometimes make great offers, as if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more could be offered, <hi>even all the substance of the house;</hi>
and still it offers more than it can perform, when it is in it's of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
most specious: The devil at once offered all the world to
Christ, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. 9. though he had not power of himself to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of one of the <hi>Gadarens</hi> swine. 6. The great scope of the
worlds courting a man with it's offers, is to gain his love from
Christ; This they had need to look well to, on whom the world
smiles most, for then the tentation to this ill is strongest. 7. It's
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:65401:225"/>
a proof of true love to Christ, when it can endure and hold out
against tentations upon all hands, and that when they are most
speciously adorned. 8. Where love is true, although it may be
sometimes (as it were) violented, or the soul in which it is cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumveen'd
and beguil'd by tentations (as the experiences of
Saints do clear) yet when it is at it self, or in good case, it will
not deliberatly capitulat to admit any thing in Christ's room,
but will reserve it self wholly for him: where love ceds, and
yields finally, it's a sign that it was never true. 9. Tentations
though most pleasant, yet tending to divert the love of the soul
from Christ, should be with indignation, at their first moving and
appearing, rejected. 10. Love will not only refuse a consent to
some tentations, but will have a great abhorrency at the moving
of them; whereas others, though they may, as to the external
actings, resist these tentations, yet their wanting of this indignation,
bewrayes their want of love. 11. As it's good to be acted in
doing of duty, from a principle and motive of love; so is it
good and commendable, to reject tentations upon that same
account.</p>

no brests: what shall we do for our sister
in the day when she shall be spoken for?</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>The Brides third petition, for these that are not yet brought
in to Christ, followeth in this eighth verse: Her love is strong in
pressing for the injoyment of Christ, and seing it hath two arms,
as it reacheth out the one to embrace Christ, so it reacheth
out the other to bring others in to him: Love is very desirous
to have others injoying him with it self: And by this arm of
love, the Bride is pulling in these that are yet strangers, that they
may be ingaged to love Christ; and she forgets them not, even
when she is most serious for her self; this being an undoubted
truth, that when ever our love is most fervent after Christ for
our selves, it will also be most sensible and sympathizing, in respect
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:65401:225"/>
of the condition of others; when love is hot and fervent the one
way, so will it be the other way also, and when it cools to the
one, it also decays in respect of the other. We may take up this
verse in these three, 1. She remembers and propounds her little
sisters case to Christ. 2. There is her suit, in reference thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.
3. This suit is qualified, in the last part of the verse. First,
her little sisters case is proposed in these words, <hi>We have a little
sister, that hath no brests:</hi> Here much love and sympathy appears
in these three things, 1. That she is called a <hi>sister, 2. our sister,
3. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap> little sister,</hi> and <hi>without brests,</hi> which do expresse much
tendernesse of affection and sympathy. By <hi>sister,</hi> is sometimes
understood, more strictly, such as are renewed converts to the
saith, whether in profession only, or really, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 15. but that
is not the meaning here; for, the sister here mentioned <hi>hath no
brests,</hi> and is <hi>not yet spoken for.</hi> Again, <hi>sister</hi> may be more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
taken, for one, or all of these three, 1. For all men, as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
of one common nature. 2. For men of one stock and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
so <hi>Samaria</hi> was <hi>sister</hi> to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 46. 3. For
the Elect who are yet unconverted, who are sisters in respect of
God's purpose, as they are Christ's <hi>sheep,</hi> Joh. 10. 16. and <hi>sons of
God,</hi> Joh. 11. 52. even before their conversion; for which cause,
the <hi>sister</hi> here spoken of, is said <hi>to have no brests,</hi> as not being
yet changed from her natural condition; and so we take this espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
to look to the unrenewed Elect, not secluding the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
two. The sense then is, There are yet many who have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
in, and many that belong to, thy election, yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
                     </gap>.
Now, it's their in-bringing, and the making of them ready to be
Christ's Spouse and Bride, that she breaths after, and prayeth for.
Next, it's said, <hi>We</hi> have a sister, and so she is called <hi>our</hi> sister, that
is, thine and mine, Christ's sister, because of his purposed respect
to her; the believers sister, not only because of their native and
kindly sympathy, but also because of the common adoption, to
which they are designed. She is called <hi>a little sister,</hi> and that
<hi>hath no brests,</hi> 1. To shew the sad condition that the unconvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
elect are in, like little young children that are unfit to do any
thing for themselves, and altogether unmeet for the duties of
marriage, as these at age, who have brests, are: Thus, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 7.
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:65401:226"/>
the wretched condition of that people, before they were taken
in to God's Covenant, is set out by this, that their <hi>brests were not
formed;</hi> and the good condition that followed their being in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
is expressed thus, that their <hi>brests were fashioned.</hi> This
then is the scope here, to show that this little sister was yet in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
unmarried to Christ, yea, (as to many of the unconverted
elect)
not spoken for, or called. 2. She is called <hi>little,</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
the Brides pity and sympathy, as one would say of a young
one, that cannot do any thing for her self, what will become of
her? she is a little one.</p>
                  <p>2. The suit is, <hi>What shall we do for our sister?</hi> This is a peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that seems to have more affection than distinctnesse in it:
It's proposed by way of question, the better to expresse her sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy;
where she disputes not, but again asserts his relation to
her, and puts no question but he will be tender of her; and
withall acknowledgeth that there is a duty lying on her self, in
order to the case of her little sister, but would be informed and
taught by him in the right discharge of it: and so this question
supposeth necessity and wretchednesse in this sister, affection and
duty in her self, but unclearnesse how to discharge it. Now the
way she takes to be helped in it, is the putting up this petition
to Christ, <hi>What shall we do?</hi> saith she; Not as if Christ knew
not what he would do, but it shews her affection to this sister,
and her familiarity with him, and also that she will not separat
his doing from hers but looks upon it as her duty to co-operat
with him, in bringing about the conversion of their little sister.</p>
                  <p>The qualification of her suit is, <hi>What shall we do for her, in the
day that she shall be spoken for?</hi> This phrase, <hi>to speak for her,</hi> is in
allusion to the communing that is used for the attaining women
in marriage: We find the same phrase in the Original, 1 <hi>Sam.
25. 39. David sent messengers to commune with Abigail, that he
might take her to wife:</hi> Now (saith she) our little sister is not
ready, nor spoken for, but when she shall be suited or commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with, what shall we do then? This communing, is the Lord's
dealing by his Ministers in the Gospel with people to marry and
espouse his Son Christ Jesus, so it is often called, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 3.
<hi>He sent forth his servants, to call them that were bidden to the wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding:</hi>
                     <pb n="449" facs="tcp:65401:226"/>
The Ministers of the Gospel are his Ambassadors, to tryst
this match, and to close it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19. and 11. 2. <hi>The day</hi>
when they shall be spoken for, is either whilst the means are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
people, and so that is <hi>the acceptable time,</hi> 2 Cor. 6. 2.
or more especially, when the means have any force on them, and
God seems in a more than ordinary way to treat with them, then
it's the day of their visitation, as it was in the days of Christ's
Ministery, though that people were treated with before. In sum,
the meaning of the <hi>vers.</hi> is this, There are many who in thy pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
are designed to be heirs of life, who yet are strangers, and
not suited or ingaged; now when the Gospel comes amongst
such, or, by stirring them now and then, puts them in some capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to be dealt with, what shall we do for them, to help on the
bargain, that the marriage be not given up, when it hath come
to a treaty, and thou hast by the Gospel bespoken them, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
it? It may look to sister-Churches, and no question
the believing Jews, who understood the Prophesies of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
conversion, did then long for their in-gathering, and the
in-Churching of them (for we were then to them a little sister
without brests) yet we cannot astrict it to that, but now, and to
the worlds end, it speaks out the believers desire of the perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Saints, and the building up of Christ's body, as well as
it spoke out their desire after this then: And by the same
sympathy, the converted Gentiles long, and should long for the
in-bringing of the elder sister, the Jews, who now have no brests,
and also of the fulnesse of the Gentiles, who are as yet unconver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
And according to the strain of the Song, it takes in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
respect to the conversion of other Church-members, who
being indeed not converted, and not effectually called, they are
without brests, and so to be helped forward in the time when
God is bespeaking them, and trysting with them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. There may be relations betwixt one in grace, and these
who are yet in nature, which grace doth not dissolve, but sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie;
the little sister is <hi>a sister,</hi> though unrenewed, and the Brides
desire is to have her gained. 2. There is a jointness, and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of relations betwixt Christ and the believer, they have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
friends and interests, and as it is betwixt husband and wife,
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:65401:227"/>
the <hi>sister</hi> of the one is the <hi>sister</hi> of the other. 3. Before men be
by faith married to Christ, even the Elect in that estate are lying
in a most miserable, wretched condition, as we may see, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 3.
They are loathsome before God, and indisposed and unfit for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fruitful to Christ in any duty, as a little damosel without brests
is unfit for marriage. 4. The converted Elect should be tenderly
affected with the sad condition of the unconverted, especially of
these that are in any relation to them, and to whom God hath
respect in his secret purpose, though definitly they be not known
unto them: And this tender affection ought to appear, in sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathizing
with them, pitying of them, holding up of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
to God, and praying for them, as the Bride doth for the
little sister: And when the case of believers is right, they will
be making conscience of longing, and praying for the gathering
in of all the Elect, that Christ's work may be throughed and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
and that his Kingdom may come in the earth. 5. It's a
most difficult businesse, how to get the conversion of sinners pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,
and Christ's Kingdom advanced; Believers will be non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plussed
in it, as being put to say, <hi>What shall we do?</hi> 6. The
Lord hath a way of espousing, and marrying to Christ Jesus, even
such as are by nature most sinful and loathsome; It's such that
he futes, wooes and speaks for, that they may be married to him.
7. Christ's great design in the Gospel, by sending Ministers from
the beginning, was, and is to espouse a bride to himself, and to
make up a spiritual marriage betwixt him and such as by nature
were lying in their blood. 8. He hath a special time of carrying
on this treaty of marriage, a <hi>day</hi> before which he treats not, and
after which, there is no opportunity of a treaty of grace; It's the
day of sinners merciful visitation, and an acceptable time for a
people. 9. In this treaty, by the Ministery of his Ordinances,
the Lord will sometimes more effectually drive the design of the
Gospel, namely the matching of sinners to Christ, than at other
times, and will bespeak them more plainly and convincingly, as
he doth, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 2. 10. When the Lord presseth closing and
matching with Christ home upon sinners, there is great hazard
lest it miscarry, and be given over unconcluded, through their
own default. 11. It's a main and special season for believers to
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:65401:227"/>
step in, to further the engaging of others to Christ, when the
Lord is putting home upon them the suit and offers of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
and when they are put to some stir, and made something se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and peremptory about it. 12. It's a great happinesse to be
spoken for to Christ, every one is not admitted to that priviledge;
and it's our great concernment, to see how we make use of that
our day, when he treats with us. 13. There is nothing wherein
a belivers love to his friends, or to any others, will appear more,
than in endeavouring their conversion, and in longing to have
them ingaged to Christ. 14. As God's call in the Gospel, is a
wooing, or bespeaking for marriage betwixt Christ and sinners,
so believers believing, is their consenting to accept of Christ for
their husband, according to the terms of the contract proposed;
and this closeth the bargain, and makes the marriage; for, then
the proposed offer of matching with Christ is accepted of.</p>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>This verse contains the Bridegroom's answer unto the Brides
last petition: Our Lord loves to have his people praying for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
as for themselves, and therefore, he so accepts this petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for the little sister, that instantly he returns an answer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
by a gracious promise; in which we are to consider these
four things, 1. The party to whom the promise is made. 2. The
promiser. 3. The promise it self. 4. The condition that it's
made upon. First, the party to whom this promise is made, is
implyed in the words, <hi>she,</hi> and <hi>her,</hi> that is, the little sister yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted,
who is mentioned in the former verse. 2. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miser
is, <hi>we,</hi> that is, the Bridegroom and the Bride, to whom
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:65401:228"/>
this sister stands in relation, <hi>vers.</hi> 8. Or rather, <hi>we,</hi> the Father,
Son and Spirit (as we took the like expression, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 11.) for,
this work which is undertaken and engaged for in the promise,
doth belong especially to them. 3. The promise is in two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
(as is also the condition) 1. <hi>We will build upon her a
palace of silver:</hi> A palace (if the word be so rendred) is a place
for dwelling in; and here it signifieth the adorning of her to be
a mansion for his Spirit, and wherein himself will dwell, which is
a priviledge that the believer in him is admitted unto, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.
16, 17. and 6. 19. and this is more than to be a <hi>wall,</hi> which is an
house, but not so compleated and adorned. He is no common
Guest that is to dwell there, therefore it's no common palace,
but <hi>of silver,</hi> both precious, and also durable, and stately for it's
matter, which he must have to dwell in: We will make her such,
saith he. The condition proposed in this part of the promise,
is, <hi>If she be a wall:</hi> A wall is different from stones, considered in
themselves, and supposeth them to be built on a foundation:
Now Jesus Christ being the only <hi>foundation,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 10. upon
which the believer, who is the spiritual Temple, is built. This
to be a <hi>wall</hi> suppones her to be by faith united to him, whereby
she becomes fixed and settled as a wall, who before was unstable:
And so the sense runs thus, If she, the little sister, when she shall
be spoken for by the Gospel, shall receive the word, and by faith
close with Christ, then (saith he) we will throughly adorn her,
as a mansion fit to be dwelt in, and we will <hi>make our abode</hi> with
her, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 23. If we render the word, <hi>towers, We will build
on her towers of silver,</hi> it comes to the same scope; Walls are
for defence, and they are defective till towers be built on them:
And so the promise is to strengthen and adorn her more, if Christ
be received by her. The second part of the promise, is, <hi>we will
inclose her with boards of Cedar:</hi> Cedar was a precious wood, and
durable (as hath been often said) And to be inclosed with it, sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
the adorning of her, and strengthning of her more. The
condition annexed to this part of the promise, is, <hi>If she be a door:</hi>
Doors makes way for entry, and are the weakest part of the wall:
The opening of the heart to receive Christ, is compared to the
opening of a door, <hi>Psa.</hi> 24. 7. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 4. here he saith, although
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:65401:228"/>
she be weak (possibly like a door of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ir) yet if she be a door, and
give entrance to Christ (for, all, without saith, are as houses with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doors to Christ, that cannot receive him) we will not only
adorn her, but also fix and strengthen her more. From all which
it appears, that these two things are clearly to be found in the
scope, 1. That there is an accesse, and addition of beauty and
strength promised to the little sister, even so much as may fully
perfect her beginnings, and carry them on unto perfection; as a
<hi>palace,</hi> or <hi>towers of silver,</hi> are beyond a wall; and <hi>boards of Cedar,</hi>
beyond an ordinary <hi>door.</hi> 2. That these things promised, are
here made to hang upon the condition of her receiving Christ,
and being by faith united unto him, and built on him. That
this is the meaning of the supposed condition, is clear, 1. From
the promise that is annexed to it, faith in Christ is the condition,
upon which all the promises of increase of grace, and establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
do hang; and the thing promised her can be no other
thing: therefore, the condition must be her union with him by
faith. 2. It agrees with Scripture, to expound her being a <hi>wall,</hi>
to signifie her union with Christ; for, Christ being the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and believers being the <hi>wall,</hi> there must be supposed an
union betwixt them, otherwise these names could not denote
that relation which is betwixt Christ and the believers, even such
as is betwixt the wall and the foundation: Now this union, by
which believers are built on him, is made up by coming to him,
which is believing, 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 4, 5. To whom coming as unto a living
stone</hi> (or foundation) <hi>ye also as lively stones, are built up a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
house:</hi> Their coming to him builds them upon him, as the
foundation: And, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. these that are by nature <hi>aliens to the
Common-wealth of Israel</hi> (as the little sister is here, while she hath
no brests) are by their believing on Christ, said to be of <hi>the
houshold of faith, and to be built on the foundation of the Prophets
and Apostles</hi> doctrine, whereof <hi>Christ is the chief corner-stone,
vers.</hi> 19, 20. &amp;c. 3. It's clear by the opposition implyed; for,
to be a wall supposeth her to be that which she is not now, when
she hath no brests; and what that is, is clear from the next verse,
where the Bride saith, <hi>I am a wall, and my brests like towers,</hi> and
<hi>so I have found favour in his eyes:</hi> Therefore, to be a wall, is to
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:65401:229"/>
be a believer, whatever it includes more; for, none is a wall
but the Bride, and who find favour in his eyes, as her argument
will conclude; and therefore, to be a wall, must include faith. So
then, the meaning of the words comes to this, I tell thee (saith
he) what we will do with our little sister, when she shall be spoken
for, if she by faith come to Christ, and be built to him, we will
perfect that work, for her eternal communion with him; yea,
though she be weak and unstable, yet if she yield to Christ, we
shall make her grace to grow, till she be stable and firm, even as
thou by becoming <hi>a wall,</hi> hath thy <hi>brests</hi> made <hi>as towers,</hi> and
hath found favour to be friendly dealt with, so shall she, and upon
the same terms.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. That receiving of Christ by saith, puts them that have
been strangers to him in that same capacity, for acceptation and
communion with Christ, that his Bride hath, or that these who
were formerly believers have by their union with him. 2. All
that are bespoken by the Gospel, have not interest in the things
promised, nor can they apply them, till by faith they be united to
Christ, and fulfill the condition to which the promise is annexed,
and that is saith. 3. One may really close with Christ, and so be
<hi>a wall,</hi> and yet have many things to be perfected: Grace is not
perfect at the beginning, but that <hi>wall</hi> hath a <hi>palace</hi> or <hi>tower</hi>
to be built upon it. 4. The believers growing in grace, even
after his union with Christ, is a great mercy, and is as such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
here. 5. Growth and increase in grace after conversion,
is no lesse a work of Christ's, and a gift of Gods, than conversion
it self. 6. Christ hath given a promise to the believer, for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
and perfecting of his sanctification, as well as of his justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
7. Where there is any honest beginning or foundation
laid by real union with Christ, although it be weak, yet it will
be perfected, and that may be expected; for, Christ's word, is here
ingaged for it. 8. There are none of the promised blessings that
can be expected from Christ, without performing of the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of believing in him, and they who rest on him by faith may
expect all.</p>

                     <q>I am a wall, and my brests like
towers: then was I in his eyes as one
that found favour.</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>In this tenth verse, and the two verses that follow, the Bride
comes-in speaking and accepting the Bridegrooms gracious an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
and promise: And first, she doth confirm the truth of it from
her own experience, <hi>vers.</hi> 10. and then, she doth more fully clear
and strengthen her experience, by laying down the grounds from
which she draweth that comfortable conclusion (<hi>of finding favour
in his eyes</hi>) in reference unto her self, <hi>vers.</hi> 11, 12.</p>
                  <p>First then, in the tenth verse, the Bride brings forth her expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
for confirmation of the truth of what the Bridegroom
had spoken: That they are the Brides words, we conceive is
clear; for, this <hi>I,</hi> is she that put up the suit for the little sister,
and by her description is opposed to her, as being <hi>a wall,</hi> and
having <hi>brests as towers,</hi> which <hi>she,</hi> the little sister had not; and there
is none other that hath found favour in Christ's eyes but she. What
the scope is, shall be cleared when we have opened the words;
which have three things in them, 1. A short description of her
own good condition. 2. An excellent advantage that followed
thereupon. 3. The connexion of these two. First, her condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is set forth in two expressions, 1. <hi>I am a wall:</hi> That is,
what the little sister was not, and what the condition, proposed
by the Bridegroom in the former verse, required: In a word,
that condition is fulfilled in me (saith she) by faith I am built on
Christ, and like a wall stand stable on the foundation. The second
expression, setting forth her condition, is, <hi>and my brests like towers:</hi>
This supposeth a growth, and further degree of her faith and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
graces, as having not only brests, which the little sister had
not, <hi>vers.</hi> 8. but brests like <hi>towers, i.e. well fashioned,</hi> Ezek. 16. 7.
and come to some perfection; and so she is a <hi>wall</hi> with <hi>towers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="456" facs="tcp:65401:230"/>
Next, the priviledge, or advantage which accompanies this her
good condition, is held out in these words, <hi>I was in his eyes as
one that found favour,</hi> or <hi>peace:</hi> To <hi>find favour in his eyes,</hi> is to
be kindly and affectionatly dealt with, and to have that manifested
by some suitable evidence: So it's said, <hi>Esther found favour in
the eyes of the King,</hi> and <hi>he held out the golden Scepter to her,</hi> Esth.
5. 2. The thing that <hi>Moses</hi> pitcheth on, as the evidence that he
and the people found favour in Gods eyes (<hi>Exod.</hi> 33. 16, 17.) is,
that <hi>his presence might go with them,</hi> whereby (saith he) should it
be known <hi>that we have found grace in thy sight,</hi> is it not in that
<hi>thou goest with us?</hi> So then, to find favour in his eyes, is to have
his presence in a gracious manner manifested to his people, as,
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 23. And in sum, this expression implyes these three,
1. Love in Christ's bosom to her. 2. His manifesting of this by his
complacency in her, or his making the delight which he had in
her, manifest in the effects of it on her. 3. Her being comforted
and delighted in the favour that she found from him.</p>
                  <p>3. The connexion of this comfortable attainment, with her gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
state, is implyed in the word <hi>then, Then was I,</hi> &amp;c. That
is, when I was a wall, and by faith rested on him, I found this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
and not before: It holds out no causality betwixt the one
and the other, but a peremptory connexion of order and time;
for, though Gods love of benevolence, whereby he purposeth
good to us (such as was his love to <hi>Iacob, before he had done good
or evil,</hi> Rom. 9. 13.) and also his love of beneficence, whereby he
actively confers, and brings about our conversion and regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
go before our believing in him, and our love to him, and is
the cause of our loving of him (who love him because he first
loved us) yet his love of complacency, whereby he shews himself
delighted with the graces, which by his love he hath bestowed
on us, doth follow, in order of nature, upon our faith in him,
and love to him: So, <hi>Ioh. 14. 21, 23. He that loveth me shall be
loved of my father, and I will love him,</hi> and what is meant by this
love, the words following clear, <hi>I will manifest my self to him,</hi>
and so, <hi>vers.</hi> 23. having said, <hi>my father will love him,</hi> it's added,
<hi>we will come and make our abode with him.</hi> This then is the sum
of this verse, I am by faith founded on him, and united to him,
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:65401:230"/>
and so am a <hi>wall,</hi> and have <hi>brests,</hi> who by nature once was not a
wall, and had no brests, by which union my brests becoming as
<hi>towers,</hi> I did find favour from him, and had his presence friendly
manifested to me. The scope, as appears from the coherence of
this verse with the former, is to make good from her experience
the truth and certainty of the promises, which he had made for
the encouragement of the little sister, and for comforting of her
self, who had been seriously pleading with him on her behalf:
Thus, these promises are faithful, saith she; for, in my comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
experience I have found it so, I was once without the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of his love, as now others are; but being by faith engaged
to him, I have found favour of him, so as others may be assured
of obtaining the like, and on the same terms, if when he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speaking
them by the Gospel, they will close with Christ, and
by faith unite with him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. There are great, real, and discriminating differences
betwixt one in nature, and one that is in Christ; The one is not
a <hi>wall,</hi> and hath no <hi>brests,</hi> the other is a <hi>wall,</hi> and hath <hi>brests,</hi> which
shew<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap> a great odds. 2. Believers may come to know that marches are
cleared betwixt their estate and condition, now while they are
in Christ, and their estate and condition as it was before: Or, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
should set themselves to know, whether marches be cleared
or not, or if they may say that of themselves, which cannot be
said of others that are not in Christ. 3. It's no little advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to be able upon good grounds to assert our union with
Christ, to say that <hi>I am a wall,</hi> &amp;c. each one cannot do it. 4. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
none ought to be proud of their attainments, yet may
believers humbly (where there is good ground) acknowledge the
reality of grace in them, 5. Although the Lord loves the Elect,
and the believer alwayes, yet there are special times or occasions
upon which, or wayes by which, he manifests his love to them.
6. The believer hath Christ's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>avour otherwise let forth and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested
to him, than it was before his conversion, although this
love, as it's in God himself, be ever the same. 7. It's a singularly
refreshful thing to find favour in Christ's eyes, and to have that
love of his sensibly manifested, and clearly made out unto us.
8. There is an inseparable and peremptory connexion betwixt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:65401:231"/>
in a believers walk, and Christ's manifesting of his favour
thus unto them. 9. These that have felt by experience, the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling
of Christ's promises, are both more clear in the meaning
of them, and more through in the faith of them: Experience is
both a good commentary upon, and proof of, the promises of
Christ, which the Bride makes use of here. 10. The experience
of one believer in the way of grace, which is founded upon the
essentials of the Covenant, and is agreeable to it, may be an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to strengthen others, in expectation of the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment
of the same thing, when the same way is taken in sueing
for it. 11. Believers that are more versed in, and acquainted
with experiences than others, should fitly and conveniently bring
them out, and communicat them for the benefit of others, who
yet have not attained that length. 12. It's the duty of hearers,
when they hear Gospel-truths and offers (such as were held forth
in the ninth verse) to reflect on themselves, and try if their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
suit with them, if they have such conditions in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and have felt the fulfilling of such promises in their own
particular experience: And it's comfortable, when their experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
and the promises agree so together, that when he saith, <hi>If
she be a wall, we will build on her;</hi> or, <hi>who loveth me, I will mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
my self to him,</hi> they may groundedly answer, and say,. <hi>I am a
wall,</hi> and so <hi>have found favour in his eyes; I love him, and so he
hath manifested himself to me.</hi>

                  <p>It is a great assertion which the Bride laid down, <hi>vers.</hi> 10, that
she was a wall, and had found favour in his eyes, and it being of
high concernment, if well grounded; therefore, to make out the
warrantablenesse thereof, she proceeds to demonstrat it, <hi>vers.</hi>
11, 12. thereby to give believers advertisement, that they should
be well seen in the grounds of their own peace, and to shew the
solid way how the well groundednesse thereof may be found out:
And because, the conclusions, asserting our union with Christ and
interest in him, follow on premisses, whose major proposition is
in the word, and whose assumption is to be searched, and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
from the conscience, speaking from inward experience and
feeling, she doth formally proceed, First, by laying down a sum
of the Gospel, in a complex general doctrine, <hi>vers.</hi> 11. to this
purpose, Christ had a Church, which he took pains on, for this
end, that it might be fruitful, and that in such a measure. Then
in the twelfth verse, she compares her practice with that rule, and
finds it suitable, therefore the conclusion follows. We may take
it up thus in form, They who improve the trust well that is put
upon them, to bring forth such fruits as Christ calls for in his.
Covenant, may conclude that <hi>they are a wall, and have found fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
in his sight:</hi> This truth is confirmed in the eleventh verse,
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:65401:232"/>
because it's for that very end, and on these very terms, that
Christ hath appointed the Ordinances in his house, and made the
promises to his people, that they should <hi>bring forth a thousand
for the fruit thereof to him,</hi> and he will not reject a consequence
drawn from that which he himself hath appointed in his Covenant;
for, such grounds, as the Word and Covenant confirm, are only
sure to reason from. Then she assumes, <hi>vers.</hi> 12. but I have been
sincere in that trust which was committed unto me, conform to
the terms of the Covenant, and have a thousand (according there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to)
to give to Christ, Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And because this hath
need to be well grounded also, she proves it, partly, by instancing
the fruits that belonged to him and to the keepers, which she had
brought forth, to shew that his Ordinances were not in vain to
her; and partly, by attesting himself immediatly, in these words,
<hi>Thou, O Solomon,</hi> speaking to him in the second person, thereby
to evidence her sincerity before him, who alone could bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
thereof, and that it was not meer external performances
(which as such, are manifest to others) upon which she grounds
what she asserts in the assumption. This is the native series and
scope of the words, whereby they depend on the former, and by
which, now before death, leaving this way of communion with
Christ, which she enjoyed here-away mediatly in Ordinances, and
before that eternal and immediat way beyond death (which is
prayed for, <hi>vers.</hi> 14.) she doth collect her interest, and confirm
her assurance: The particular exposition of the words will clear
it more. From the scope, <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. That through perswasion of
interest in Christ had need to be solidly grounded, and believers
would be distinct in the grounds thereof, and not go beguesse
with their confidence. 2. The neerer that people come to dying,
they would be the more accurat in this search, and have the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
of their interest in Christ the more clear. 3. We may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from her example, that the solid and only way to be throughly
cleared of our title to Christ, is when the grounds thereof are
comprehended in the Lords Covenant; as he that believes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents,
hath the fruits of the Spirit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he is justified, sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> And when the assumption, bearing the application of
these grounds to our selves, will abide the tryal in Christ's sight,
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:65401:232"/>
and may be instanced before him in the effects thereof, thus, but
it's so with me, Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is her way of concluding.</p>
                  <p>We come now to expound the words more particularly: And
first, we conceive it is out of doubt, that they are mystically and
spiritually to be understood, That is, by <hi>Solomon,</hi> Christ is meant,
and by the <hi>Vineyard,</hi> the Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for, so the strain and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Allegory throughout this Song, and the manner of
speaking all along doth require; And there being but one <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
that is spoken of in this Song, his having of a Vineyard must
be understood as his making of a Chariot, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 9, 10. which
being paved with love, could not be a piece of work framed by
<hi>Davids</hi> son: We are not therefore, curiously to enquire here,
what place this is, called <hi>Baal-hammon:</hi> Or, whether <hi>Solomon</hi>
had such vineyards or not, let out at such a rent? these things
make not to the scope.</p>
                  <p>Again, that they are the Brides words, is clear not only from
the scope and matter thereof, but also from these things, 1. She
not only speaks of Christ (by the name of <hi>Solomon</hi>) in the third
person, <hi>vers.</hi> 11. but to him, <hi>Thou, O Solomon, &amp;c.</hi> in the second
person, <hi>vers.</hi> 12. It cannot therefore be the Bridegroom that
here speaks, but the Bride, as personating a believer. 2. She is
differenced from strangers and hypocrites, in this, that she hath
fruit to give him, and hath that proposed to her self for her end:
and she is differenced from the keepers of the vineyard, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
<hi>vers.</hi> 12. they get from her two hundred; It must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be the Bride, as personating a believer, who was speaking
in the former verse, and continueth here in speaking. 3. The
expressions, <hi>vers.</hi> 12. where she applyeth to her self what she had
in the general asserted, <hi>vers.</hi> 11. agree well to her, as the opening
of them will clear.</p>
                  <p>The words do contain the proof of a believers sincerity and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality
in the Covenant of God, made out by two things put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
1. By laying down distinctly the nature and terms of the
Covenant, <hi>vers.</hi> 11. 2. By comparing her self exactly and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
therewith, <hi>vers.</hi> 12. The general doctrine of the Covenant,
<hi>vers.</hi> 11. runs on three heads; The first looks to the sum and end
of all, that Christ had a Church or <hi>Vineyard,</hi> committed or given
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:65401:233"/>
him. The second looks to Christ's administration in his Church,
by external Ordinances, <hi>he let it out to keepers.</hi> The third holds
forth the ends of his letting out this Vineyard, or the terms u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
which it is lea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ed, <hi>Every one was to bring for the fruit thereof,
a thousand pieces of silver.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For explaining of the first, we are first to remember, that by
<hi>Solomon,</hi> we are to understand Christ; for, as ever hitherto, so
here, the Allegory is continued, to expresse and set forth Christ
in his way with his Church, under that name. Next, the <hi>Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard</hi>
here is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
                     </gap> Church, <hi>Isa.</hi> 5. 7. &amp;c the visible Church in some
respect is his Vineyard, as she is separat from others, and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to bring forth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ruits to him; but especially the Church invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
and elect, who in a peculiar respect are Christ's as given to
him and purchased by him, and so frequently in this Song, the
believer is called a <hi>garden</hi> or <hi>vineyard.</hi> 3. The place where this
vineyard is planted, is called <hi>Baal-hammon;</hi> which is the name
of no proper place any where mentioned in Scripture, but is bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
for it's signification, and it signifieth <hi>father of a multitude,</hi>
and so it points out that Christ's vineyard is planted in a foil that
is fruitful, and bringing forth much; and it is on the matter
the same with that, <hi>Isa. 5. 1. my beloved had a vineyard in a fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
hill,</hi> or, <hi>horn of oyl,</hi> as the word there in the Hebrew signifieth,
to shew that it was well situate in a good soil, and did lye well,
and was by his industry well fitted for bringing forth of fruit.
Now, Christ is said, and that in the preterit time, to have <hi>had</hi>
this vineyard, which shews his interest and propriety therein, and
title thereto, and that by an eternal right, and a far other kind
of title than he hath to the rest of the world beside: Now this
right of Christ's (in respect of which it is said he <hi>had</hi> this vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard)
is not to be understood with relation to his essential domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
and soveraignty, whereby with the Father and holy Ghost, he
created all things, and so as Creator, hath a conjunct interest in
them; but this looks to that peculiar title, which Christ hath to
the Church of the Elect, especially as Mediator, by the Lords
giving of such and such particular persons to him to be saved,
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. 38. 39. &amp;c. for, he hath this Vineyard as distinct from the
world, and claims title to the given ones, when he disclaims the
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:65401:233"/>
world, <hi>Iohn,</hi> 17: 6, 8. <hi>They are mine</hi> (saith he) <hi>because thou gavest
them to me:</hi> yet, in so far as the visible Church is separated to
him by external Ordinances (and so all Israel are said to be ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
<hi>Deut.</hi> 6.) they may be said to be Christ's; but it's these
who are by Gods election separated from others, given to Christ,
and undertaken for by him, in the Covenant of Redemption, that
especially are intended here: And it's necessary to advert, that
there are four diverse parties, to which the Church in diverse re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
is said to belong, 1. She is the Lords, the Father, Son,
and Spirit, his by eternal Election; This is the first right, <hi>Ioh.
17. 6. Thine they were,</hi> to wit, by thy eternal purpose: And from
this flowes the second, to wit, the Mediators right, <hi>and thou gavest
them me;</hi> The Father is the owner and proprieter of the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 21. 40. called, <hi>Ioh. 15. 1. the husband man;</hi> for, the
Church is first his, and next Christ's, who as Mediator is the great
Deputy, and universal Administrator of grace, to whom the Elect
are given as to the great Bishop and Shepherd, and to whom all the
ordering of what concerns their good is committed: This right
is by donation, and differs from the former. 3. The Vineyard is
said to be the Brides, <hi>vers.</hi> 12. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 6. in respect of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
particular trust, with oversight of, and interest in, these
things that Christ hath purchased for them, and bestowed on them,
which they are to improve and trade with; In which respect, <hi>Mat.</hi>
25. and <hi>Luk.</hi> 19. the talent is said to be not only the masters, but
also the servants, because the right improving of it, brings ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
unto the servant more properly than to the master: and
each believer in some kind hath a Vineyard, because each of them
shares of all the graces, priviledges, benefits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that are saving.
4. The Vineyard is also the Ministers, they have a title as under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keepers,
overseers and dressers, therefore it's said to be let out
to them by Christ; they are as farmers: Hence, when Christ,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 5. writs to the Angel of the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> speaking to
the Angel, he calls the Church, <hi>thy Candlestick,</hi> and <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 15.
while the vines are called <hi>our vines,</hi> the Ministers interest is assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as well as Christ's; so all these interests mentioned in these
two verses are well consistent. <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. That our Lord Jesus hath
some who beyond all others are his, by peculiar right and title;
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:65401:234"/>
and he had this title to them before ever actually there was a
Church, this Vineyard did belong to him otherwise than others
in the world, even before it was, which could not be but the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
giving the Elect to him. 2. Christ hath a notable right to,
and propriety in, these Elect who are given to him, so that the
Vineyard is <hi>his,</hi> and it cannot be that one of these perish, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the imparing and prejudice of the propriety of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus.
3. There is an old transaction, concerning the salvation of
the Elect betwixt the Father and the Son, which can be no other
thing but the Covenant of Redemption; for, the Son's having an
interest in some and not in others, supposeth that some were given
to him and accepted by him, as that word, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. 6. bears out.
<hi>Thine they were, and thou gavest them to me,</hi> and so they are mine.
4. Christ's Church or Vineyard, hath the only choise soil in all
the world to live into, it's <hi>Baal-hammon</hi> where they are planted,
though often their outward lot be not desirable, yet their <hi>lines
have fallen in pleasant places.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second part concerns Christ's managing of his Church,
when he hath gotten it; He doth not immediatly dresse it by
himself, but <hi>he lets it out to keepers,</hi> as a man having purchased
a field, or planted a Vineyard, doth set it, or farm it for such a
rent; So hath Christ thought good to commit his Church to
keepers, that is, to watchmen and farmers, that by their Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
he might in a mediate way promove their edification and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
which he accounts his rent: The very same parable, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
in the same words, pressing this scope, is recorded, <hi>Matth.
21. 33. A certain housholder planted a Vineyard, and let it out un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
husband men, and sent servants to gather the fruit;</hi> The hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
men are the ordinary Office-bearers in the Church (the
Scribs and Pharisees did fill that room for the time) the servants
are extraordinary Prophets raised up of God, to put them to
their duty; so here the <hi>keepers</hi> are the Ministers, who are intrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the Churches edification under Christ, as Stewards are
with distributing provision to the Family, or shepherds with feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their flocks, or a farmer with the labouring of his farm that
he possesseth: And this name of <hi>keepers</hi> given here to Ministers,
agreeth well with the names that Ministers have in Scripture,
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:65401:234"/>
watch-men, overseers, stewards, builders, husbandmen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and
also with the nature of that office, which, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. is to <hi>plant</hi> and
<hi>water</hi> this Vineyard: And lastly, with the scope of this and the
like parables, whereby Christ's mediat way of building up of his
Church, by the intervention of Ordinances and Ministers, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed.
Particular Professors are as Vines, the Ordinances like
the presse that presseth the grapes, the Ministers like the dressers
that dig, dung, prune and water the trees, and put the grapes in
the presse, and gather the fruits, by applying of these Ordinances
convincingly to the consciences of hearers. Next, his <hi>setting of
this Vineyard,</hi> or Church to the keepers, is borrowed from a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieter,
his farming of his heritage, and giving of a lease, or tack
under him, to some other, both for the better labouring of his
land, and for the furthering of his rent; and this is opposed to
his immediate labouring of it himself: So here, as Christ is the
proprieter (whose own the Vineyard is) Ministers are the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers:
Which implyeth, 1. that the Minister hath a title and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
in the Church of Christ, which no other hath, he is a farmer
and keeper of it. 2. It supposeth, that it's but a subordinat title
the Minister hath, he is not as a Lord of Christ's Vineyard, or
master of the faith of God's people, but as a farmer or subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat
overseer, he is to be a helper of their joy. In sum, the sense
comes to this, That this trust that was put on Christ of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Church, he thought meet not to discharge it all immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly,
but hath appointed some others as instruments under him,
to promove their edification, whom singularly he hath intrusted
for that end. <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. Since our Lord Jesus had a Church mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant,
he hath thought good to guide it mediatly, by a standing
Ministery and Ordinances; and that is to <hi>set out</hi> his Vineyard to
<hi>keepers.</hi> 2. There ought none without Christ's tack or lease, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
upon the Ministery, and become keepers of his Vineyard; for,
they are but tacksmen, and what right they have it's from him:
Thus that which is here called his setting a lease, is, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 4, 5.
called the <hi>Covenant of Levi.</hi> 3. Although Christ imploy Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
yet he makes them not masters, but he reserves the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety
of his Church to himself, and they are such as must give
an account. 4. Though Ministers be not masters, yet are they
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:65401:235"/>
keepers, and have a special trust in the Church; they are intrusted
with the affairs of Christ's house, for carrying on of his peoples
edification; which is a trust that no others have committed
to them.</p>
                  <p>The third thing in this verse, is the end for which he lets it
out, or the terms upon which; and these are, <hi>that every one may
bring a thousand pieces of silver, for the fruit thereof:</hi> And so the
condition upon which it is set out, is, that he might have a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
revenue and fruit, as is clear from, <hi>Isa.</hi> 5. and, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.
and the rent is agreed on by himself, and it is <hi>a thousand silver lings,</hi>
which is mentioned, <hi>Isa.</hi> 7. 23. as a great rent. The number is
a definit for an indefinit, saying in sum, that Christ's scope in let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
out his Church, is thereby to make her fruitful, that by his
servants Ministery he might have rent from her, as he saith, <hi>Iob.
15. 16. I have chosen you, and ordained you, to go and bring forth
fruit,</hi> &amp;c. Which is especially to be understood in respect of their
Ministerial-fruit (to say so) or the fruit of their Ministery. The
sum required is alike to all, <hi>that every one may bring,</hi> &amp;c. not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying,
that all Ministers will have alike fruit in effect, or <hi>de facto,</hi>
but to shew, that all of them have one commission, and <hi>de jure,</hi> or
of right, ought to aim at having much fruit to the Land-lord,
and would by no means seek to feed themselves, but seek the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
profit. The words aim at these four things, 1. That Christ's
great design in planting of a Church, and sending of a Ministery,
is to have souls saved, that is the fruit which he aims at, for the
travel of his soul: And so to have his people brought on towards
Heaven, by every step of knowledge, conversion, faith, repentance,
holinesse, till they be brought compleatly through. 2. It sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth
the peoples duty, that they who are planted in the Church,
should be fruitful: This Vineyard bears well, else the keepers
could not pay so much. 3. The Ministers duty is here implyed
also, and it is to crave in Christ's rent, that is his office, as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,
or Chamberlane to gather it in; So, <hi>Matth. 21. 31. he sent
his servants to gather in the fruits of the Vineyard,</hi> Ministers are to
labour amongst the people, and either to bring fruit, or a report
of ill successe unto Christ. 4. What ever fruits the Minister have
to render to Christ, he must return a reckoning; So the word,
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:65401:235"/>
                     <hi>bring,</hi> imports a returning of an account to the owner that sent
him<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> The last thing is the peremptorinesse of this lease, in
respect of the fruits or rent, which is held forth in two things,
1. It's determined it must be <hi>a thousand:</hi> which saith, 1. It is not
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ree to Ministers to call for, or to accept of what they will<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> or what
men will, as enough for Christ's due; he must determine himself
what he will have, and none other, and he hath determined it.
2. There can be no alteration of the terms which Christ hath set
down and imposed, it's definit in it self what every one must
bring. Again 2. It's peremptorinesse appears in this, that <hi>every
one,</hi> none excepted are put at for this rent: This is the great
a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ticle in all their lea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>es, <hi>fruit, fruit. Obs.</hi> 1. Every Minister of
the Gospel hath a weighty trust put on him, in reference to the
C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>urche<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap> edification. 2. Ministers right discharging of their
trust, may have much influence on a peoples thriving, and Christ's
getting of his rent from amongst them. 3. All Christ's Ministers
have every one of them the same commission, for the same end,
and every one of them should endeavour fruits proportionable
thereto. 4<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> The Lord hath every Ministers fruit, as to the event,
determined, as well as their duty is appointed them. 5. Though
all Ministers have not alike successe, in respect of the number of
souls brought in by their Ministery; yet, where there is honesty
and diligence, the Lord will account it <hi>a thousand,</hi> as well as
where the fruit is more: Therefore are they alike in his reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
though not in the event. O! but an unfruitful Minister, and
unfaithful also, who, beside what fruit a common Christian should
render, ought to render a thousand for his Ministery, will be
much in Christ's debt, when he shall reckon with him! Let Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
consider well this double reckoning.</p>
                  <p>Having laid down the general doctrine, <hi>vers.</hi> 11. she doth now in
the twel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>th verse make application thereof to her self; and this she
doth, 1 By asserting of her own sincerity. 2. By proving it in
two instances. Her assertion is, <hi>My Vineyard, which is mine, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
me:</hi> The Brides <hi>Vineyard</hi> is the particular trust which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to her, in reference to her souls estate; called a Vineyard,
1. Because every particular believer, intrusted with his own souls
concernment, is a part of, and of the same nature with the Church
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:65401:236"/>
of Christ, which is called a Vineyard in Scripture. 2. Because of
the variety of graces bestowed on her, and the Ordinances and
priviledges, whereof she is a partaker with the whole, as is said.
It's called <hi>hers,</hi> because she must make a special account for her
own soul, and the talent that is given to her, according to the
trust that is put on her. We have almost the same phrase, <hi>Chap.</hi>
1. 6. where the Bride calls it, <hi>mine own Vineyard:</hi> This Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard
is said to be <hi>before her,</hi> which is like the expression, <hi>Psa.</hi> 18. 22.
<hi>all thy judgements were before me,</hi> which the scope, by the words
foregoing and following, shews to be, not a pleading of innocency,
but of sincerity and watchfulnesse in <hi>keeping himself from his ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity;</hi>
and it's to be understood in opposition to <hi>departing wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
from God,</hi> mentioned <hi>vers.</hi> 21. And thus to have her Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard
before her, signifieth watchfulnesse and tendernesse, as these
who have their eye alwayes on their Orchard or Vineyard. And
it doth import, 1. Watchfulnesse, as hath been said. 2. Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
and carefulnesse, so it's opposed to the hiding of the talent,
<hi>Luk.</hi> 14. she did not so, but had the talent she was intrusted with,
still before her, and among her hands, that she might trade with
it. 3. It imports tendernesse and conscienciousnesse, and so is
opposed to mens casting of God's Law <hi>behind their backs,</hi> Psal.
50. 16. This she did not, but the work God had appointed to
her, and the trust which was committed to her, was alwayes in
her eye. 4. It implyes sincerity, and honesty in aiming at her du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and that by a constant minding of it, as suffering it never to
be out of her sight: All which being put together, holds forth
the sense of the words, Christ hath given every one in his Church
a trust (which is, as it were, the Vineyard that every believer
ought to have before him) and that (saith she) which was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to me, I have been singly and conscienciously carefull to
do my duty in reference thereunto, so as I have a testimony in
my conscience of it: And thus her case is far different from what
it was, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 6. where she acknowledgeth that her own Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard
she had not kept. <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. It's no matter how well one be
acquaint with the general truths of the Gospel, if there be not
a conformity of practice: Whatever knowledge Christians have,
it will never further their peace, except their practice be suitable.
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:65401:236"/>
2. Every member of the Church, and every believer, hath a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
trust committed to him, and he must be countable for
his carriage in reference thereto. 3. The right discharging of)
this trust, calls for watchfulness and diligence, and it will require,
daily oversight and attendance, that so the believers Vineyard
may be alwayes before him. 4. They who assiduously wait upon
the work committed to them, may through grace make good
progresse in it, and attain to a good testimony from their own
consciences thereanent. 5. It's exceeding comfortable to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
when they have a testimony within them, that they have
been diligent and careful in the duty committed to them. 6. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
would reflect on their carriage in the trust committed to
them, that they may be able to make some distinct report con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the same. 7. They who are most tender in their duty, are
also most diligent to search how it is with them, that they may
know the condition of their Vineyard, whether it thrive or not.
If it be moved here, how she could assert so much of her condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
seing, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 6. she acknowledgeth the contrary, that her
<hi>own Vineyard,</hi> or, <hi>the Vineyard which was hers, she had not kep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi>
And it's evident, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 3. that she was under a great measure
of security; in which case she sell into many escapes? I answer,
both may be true, in diverse considerations, 1. A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>David</hi> in one
place acknowledged sin, yet, <hi>Psa.</hi> 18. 21, 22. &amp;c. pleadeth sin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>eri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
so doth' she here. <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. There may be a just ground of a
plea for sincerity, where there is much guilt to be acknowledged<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
These are not inconsistent, otherwise she could not assert her sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
so confidently here. 2. Believers plea for peace in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
of their duty, and the testimony of their conscience there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anent,
is not founded on perfection of degrees, but on sincerity.
2. Ans. <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 6. contains the Brides case at one time; This
speaks of her case afterward, when by repentance she was recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and restored to his friendship. <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. There may be a great
difference in the way of one and the same believer, in respect of
different times: At one time (possibly in youth) most unwatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>t other times tender and serious. 2. These that sometimes
have been under many challenges for unwatchfulness, may through
God's blessing afterward attain a good outgate, both from their
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:65401:237"/>
sins and challenges. 3. Bygone failings, will not, nor should not,
marr a present favourable testimony from the conscience, when
God hath given to one the exercise of faith, repentance and true
tendernesse. 3. <hi>Ans.</hi> Since these failings, Christ hath spoken peace
to her, and therefore now she remembers them not, for marring
of her peace, though otherwise she hath regrated them for her
humbling. <hi>Observe.</hi> When Christ speaks peace, believers would
not obstruct it, by continuing the resentment of former provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
and quarrels to the prejudice thereof, though they should
still mind them for furthering of their own humiliation.</p>
                  <p>She comes, in the next place, to make out this assertion: which
is done, 1. By the matter of her words, while she instanceth the
fruits, that belonged both to the owner and to the keepers. 2. By
the manner of he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap> words, while she turneth her speech over to
Christ himself, <hi>Thou, O Solomon, shall have a thousand</hi> (for so it
will read as well as <hi>must have,</hi> &amp;c. seing either of the words, <hi>shall,
or must,</hi> may be supplied) and this shews both what he should
have, and with what cheerfulnesse she bestowed it on him. And, 1.
she instanceth the fruits that Christ should have, and these are <hi>a
thousand:</hi> By the <hi>thousand</hi> that Christ is to get, is understood
that which was appointed and conditioned in his lea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>e of the
Vineyard, find is mentioned, <hi>vers.</hi> 11. It's, in a word, thou shalt
have what thou hast appointed, the terms shall not be altered by
me. Hence it appears, that the <hi>thousand</hi> which the Minister was
to bring in as the revenue of the Vineyard, is the engaging of
souls to Christ, and the making of them fruitfull; for, then gets
Christ his rent from his people, when this is effectuated by the
Ordinances. <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. That fruits are the best evidence of sincerity.
2<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> That thene can be nothing offered to Christ as fruit, or which
can be an evidence or proof of sincerity, but that same, for the
matter and manner, which is prescribed by him in his Covenant;
our fruits must be suitable to what is called for, and accepted by
him, or they will be no ground of peace. 3. True sincerity will
never alter the terms that Christ hath set down in his Covenant,
no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap> lessen his rent, which he hath prescribed as his due, but will
think that most suitable which he hath prescribed, and will think
it's mercy to have that to render to him.</p>

The second instance, proving her fruitfulnesse, holdeth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>orth
what the keepers should receive; <hi>the keepers shall have two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred:

and their pains taken on her, by her fruitfulnesse, should redound
to their commendation and glory, yet (as it becomes) in a lesser
degree than to the master, and without wronging of the rent due
to him; this <hi>two hundred</hi> (saith she) ought not, and shall not dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
his thousand. Now, this may relate either to the reward
that faithful Ministers shall have from Christ, spoken of, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 3.
O what joy and glory will result to them, from the peoples fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse
(amongst whom they have laboured) in the day of the
Lord! that they have not run in vain, but with much successe,

ye in the presence of our Lord Iesus Christ, at his coming? For ye

                  <p>If it be asked, why her giving of <hi>two hundred</hi> to the keepers,
is subjoined to the giving of him <hi>a thousand?</hi> The answers to this
are so many observations from the words, and the first is, That
these who are trusted by Christ to be keepers of the Vineyard,
and his Ministers, ought also to be respected by the people over
whom they are set; and Christ allows this on them. 2. Where
Christ is respected and gets his due, there the keepers will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected
and get their due: If Christ be made welcome, <hi>the feet
of them that bring glad tidings will be beautiful,</hi> Isa. 52. 7. 3. It's
a good sign of honesty and sincerity before Christ, when Minsters
and Ordinances are respected in their own place, with subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the respect that is due to Christ; Therefore is it men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
here. 4. It's no burden to an honest believer to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
Christ's Ministers, to obey their doctrine, and submit to
their censures; For, sincere believers both willingly do this, and
engage to do it, as the Bride doth here. 5. The respect that is
given to Ministers, should be given to them as to his Ministers,
without derogating from, or incroaching upon, that which is the
master's due; Therefore, his <hi>thousand</hi> is reserved whole for him,
and this two hundred is no part thereof. 6. Where Christ gets
his due amongst a people, and where his Ordinances be received,
there, and there only do Ministers get their due; for, it is (as
<hi>Paul</hi> saith) not <hi>yours,</hi> but <hi>you</hi> that we seek? and lesse will not be
accepted by faithful Ministers: they will never think they get their

                  <p>The last thing in the verse, is the way she takes to prove her
uprightnesse, by attesting Christ to bear witnesse to the sincerity
of her fruits; and this is held forth in the change of the person,
from the third to the second, <hi>Thou, O Solomon</hi> (saith she) <hi>shall
have a thousand:</hi> which, in short, is done for eviden<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ing of her
sincerity, that it was such as might abide his tryal and so she
doth passe sentence upon her self, as in his sight, who knew what
was truth: And this doth not proceed from boasting, but from
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:65401:238"/>
humble confidence, being desirous that he would accept of it,
and approve her in it. <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. Sincerity gives one boldnesse in
approaching to Christ. 2. It's a good evidence of sincerity, when
believers are not very anxious, and careful what is the judgement
of men concerning them, if they may have Christ's approbation;
and therefore they consider their case and practice as speaking to
Christ, and before him. 3. It's delectable, in the most spiritual
passages of our inward walk, to turn them over into addresses to
Christ, and to speak them over betwixt him and us. 4. It's best
gathering conclusions concerning our condition, and best learning
how to esteem of it, when we are set as in Christ's presence, and
are speaking to him: Every thing will then be best discerned, and
the soul will be in the best posture for discerning it self.</p>

                  <p>The thirteenth and fourteenth verses contain the last part of
this kindly conference, that hath been betwixt these two loving
parties, and expresse their farewel and last suits, which each of
them hath to the other. He speaks in this verse, and being to
close, as a kind husband, leaving his beloved wife for a time, he
desires to hear frequently from her till he return; this is his suit:
And she, like a loving wife, intreats him to hasten his return, in
the next verse, and this is the scope of both these verses. That
the words in this thirteenth verse are spoken by him, appears by
the title he gives the Bride, <hi>Thou that dwellest, in the Gardens,</hi>
which in the Original, is in the feminine gener, as if one would
say, <hi>thou woman,</hi> or, <hi>thou bride,</hi> or, <hi>thou my wife<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Or, take it in</hi>
one word, as it's in the Original, it may be rendred, <hi>O inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresse
of the Gardens;</hi> which can be applyed to none other, but
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:65401:239"/>
to her; and therefore, these words must be spoken by him to
her, and thus the scope laid down is clear.</p>
                  <p>There are three parts in the verse, 1. The title he gives her.
2. A commendation, that is insinuated. 3. A request made to
her, or duty laid on her. The title is, <hi>Thou that dwellest in the
Gardens:</hi> By <hi>Gardens,</hi> in the plural number, we understand (as
<hi>Chap.</hi> 6. 2.) particular Congregations, where the Ordinances are
administrat; called <hi>Gardens</hi> in the plural number, as contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished
from the Catholick Church, and from a particular be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever,
who are also called a Garden in the singular number. To
<hi>dwell in,</hi> or inhabit these Gardens, imports three things, 1. A
frequenting of these meetings. 2. A continuance in them ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as if there were her residence. 3. A delight in them, and in
the exercises of his worship and service there. And in sum, the
meaning is, Thou, my Bride, who frequent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap> and loves the assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
of my people, and my publick Ordinances, <hi>&amp;c. Obs.</hi> 1. That
Christ Jesus loveth to leave his people comforted, and therefore, is
distinct in this his farewel, that there be no mistakes of him in his
absence: And this way he used also with his Apostles, <hi>Iohn,</hi> 14.
13, 14, 15. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> before his ascension. 2. Christ hath ordinarily
ever preserved the publick Ordinances, by particular assemblies,
in his Church. See, <hi>Chap.</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>. 2. 3. Where God's people are in
good case, there the publick Ordinances are most frequented and
esteemed of; and still the better in case they be, the Ordinances
are the more prized, and haunted by them; for, this is a special
character and property of such, that they love to dwell among the
Ordinances, <hi>Psa.</hi> 27. 4. Also, this is pleasant and acceptable to
Jesus Christ, and the title he gives the Bride here, shews his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
thereof.</p>
                  <p>The second part of the verse, namely the commendation he
gives her, is infinuate in these words, <hi>The companions hearken to
thy voice:</hi> By <hi>companions</hi> here, are understood particular belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
members of the Church, called also <hi>brethren</hi> and <hi>compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,</hi>

<hi>Psal.</hi> 45. 14. and 119. 63. <hi>I am a companion of all that fear thee,</hi> &amp;c.
and this title is given them for these two reasons, 1. Because
there is joyntnesse and communion amongst them, in all their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests,
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:65401:239"/>
both of duties and priviledges, and also in sufferings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and so <hi>Iohn,</hi> Rev. 19. calls himself their <hi>brother</hi> and <hi>companion</hi>
in tribulation: They are all <hi>fellow-citizens</hi> of one city, <hi>Eph.</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>. because they have a familiar way of living together, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that joynt interest, by sympathizing with each other,
freedom to each other, and kindlinesse of affection to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
opposite to that strangenesse and particularnesse that is
amongst the men of the world: And this is the right improving
of the former, and results from it. Next, by the Brides <hi>voice,</hi> is
here understood her instructions admonitions, and such parts of
Christian-fellowship which tends to edification, wherein that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panionry
(so to speak) doth most appear: An example whereof
we find in the instructions she gave to the daughters, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.
The companions their <hi>hearkning to her voice,</hi> is more than simple
hearing (for hearkning and hearing are much different, and have
different words in the Original) and It implyeth, their laying
weight on what she said, by pondering of it, and yielding to it, as
the daughters did, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. 1. to which this may relate. And so
the meaning is, thy fellow-worshipers (saith he) with reverence
and respect, receive thy words, thou speaks so weightily unto
them. And this doth import not only the practice and duty of
the Bride and her companions, but also a commendation of them,
both which we may take up in the doctrines. <hi>Observ.</hi> 1. That
there is a most friendly union and familiar relation amongst all
believers; they are <hi>companions</hi> in this respect, though their may
be many differences in externals, which this takes not away. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers;
ought to walk friendly together, according to that relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and it's pleasant when they converse together as such<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
                     <hi>Psal.</hi> 133. 3. Believers ought not to be uselesse in their fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
and mutual conversing one with another, but would be speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
by instructions, admonitions and exhortations, that others
with whom they converse may hear their voice. 4. Believers
would not only hearken to publick Ordinances, and the word
spoken by Office-bearers in the Church, but also to that which is
spoken by a <hi>companion,</hi> when it's edifying. 5. It's a thing plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
to Jesus Christ (who takes notice how companions walk to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether)
when there is conscience made of mutual fellowship<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> with
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:65401:240"/>
fruit and freedom amongst his people: This were good compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nionry.
6. God's making the stamp of his Spirit on a particular
believer to have weight on others, so as their fellowship with
them hath successe, should provoke the believer to pursue more
after fellowship with Christ himself; which is the scope of this
part of the verse, compared with that which followes.</p>
                  <p>The last part of the verse, containing his desire to her, or the
duty he layeth on her, is in these words, <hi>cause me to hear it:</hi> The
words, as they are in the Original, are, <hi>cause me to hear me;</hi> which
occasioneth a twofold reading, 1. <hi>Cause me to be heard,</hi> and let
me be the subject of thy discourse to others, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>eing they give ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>
unto thee, improve that credit which thou hast with them for
that end: Thus this same phrase is rendered, <hi>Psal 66. 8. make the
voice of his praise to be heard,</hi> or, as it is in the Original, <hi>cause to
be heard</hi> the voice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. They may be read as they here stand,
<hi>cause me to hear it;</hi> and thus Christ desires, he may be the Object
spoken unto, as by the former reading he is to be the subject
spoken of: So this same phrase is rendered, <hi>Psal. 143. cause me
to hear</hi> thy loving kindnesse: And this translation agrees well
with the scope here, where before he brake off communing with
the Bride, as in the first part of the verse he had commended her
for her frequenting of publick Ordinances, and in the second, for
her keeping fellowship with others, in both which her duty is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuated;
so here he calls for her keeping of fellowship with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
by her sending frequent messages to him in prayer; which he
not only requires as a duty, but now requests for as a savour (to
speak so) that he may hear often from her, which he will account
as much of, as any man will do of hearing from his wife in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.
And, thus, to make him hear her voice, is by frequent
prayer to make addresses to him, as, <hi>Psal.</hi> 5. 3. In the morning
shalt <hi>thou hear my voice;</hi> and, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 14. of this Song, speaking
to the Bride, <hi>Let me hear thy voice,</hi> saith he. <hi>Observ.</hi> 1. That
though Jesus be a great Prince, and sometimes be absent to the
sense of his people, yet hath he laid down a way how his Bride
may keep correspondence with him, and let him hear from her
when she will, in his greatest distance: He hath, as it were, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
posts for that end, prayers, ejaculations, thoughts, looks, if
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:65401:240"/>
wakened by his Spirit, which will carry their message very speedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and faithfully. 2. The Bride ought to be frequent in sending
posts and messages to her blessed Bridegroom, that he may hear
from her; and both duty and affection call for this. 3. Messages
from the believer are most welcome and acceptable to Jesus Christ,
they are as messages from a loving wife to an husband at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
and believers may expect that such messages shall be well
entertained; they cannot be too frequent in suits and prayers to
him, when these duties are rightly discharged; and there will be
no letter sent to him so short, or ill written, but he will read it:
And sure, the neglecting of this, is a sin doth exceedingly displease
and wound our kind Bridegroom. 4. In this verse, frequenting
publick Ordinances, fellowship with believers, and much corres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponding
with Christ in secret prayer, are all put together, to shew,
that they who rightly discharge the duties of publick worship,
and the duties of mutual fellowship, and the duties of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
and corresponding with Christ in prayer, must necessarily joyn
all together; and when it goes well with a believer in one of
these, they will all be made conscience of; and this last is subjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
as the life of both the former, without which they will never
be accepted by him.</p>

suit to the Bride; Let me often hear from thee that I may know
how it is with thee, said he: So here, she sums up all her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
in one suit, which to her is both first and last, I beseech thee
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:65401:241"/>
(saith she) my Beloved, <hi>make haste</hi> and do not tarry. In the
words there are, 1. her suit. 2. The title she gives him. 3. Her
repeating and qualifying of her suit. Her request is, <hi>make haste:</hi>
The word, in the Original, signifieth <hi>flee away,</hi> importing the
greatest haste and speed that may be, so would she have Christ hast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his coming in the most swift manner; whereby the holy im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience
of her affection, that cannot endure delayes, doth appear;
therefore abruptly she breaks out with this as her last suit, and
that which especially her heart desires of him. That it's for a
speedy return, the scope, her love that expresseth it, and the
manner which she useth through the Song, doth clear; and there
being two comings of Christ spoken of in Scripture, 1. His com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in grace, which already she had prayed for, and it's promised,
<hi>Iohn</hi> 14. 21, 23. 2. His coming in glory at the last day to judge
the world; we conceive that it will agree with her scope here,
to take in both, but principally the last, that is, her desire, that
Christ Jesus would hasten his second coming: Not that she would
have him to precipitat, or leave any thing undone that is to go
before the end; but her desire is, that in due time and manner
it may be brought about, and that what is to go before it, may
be hastened, for making way for it: For, the phrase, <hi>haste,</hi> my Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,
is indefinite, and therefore it may look both to his second
coming, and to all that must necessarily preceed it; and therefore
so long as there is yet any thing to be performed, as previous to
his coming, she bids him hasten it. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>. We take this desire to
look mainly to his second coming, because that only can perfect
believers consolation, and put an end to their prayers: Till he
come, their consolation cannot be full, and all <hi>shadowes are not
away, Chap.</hi> 2. 17. There is ever something to be done, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they have ever something to pray for (to wit, that his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
may come) till that time. 3. This is the great, joynt, and
main suit of all believers; they all concurr in this, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 17.
<hi>The Spirit and the Bride say, Come,</hi> &amp;c. It's essential to all who
have the Spirit, to joyn in this suit; and the Bride cannot but be
supponed to love the last appearing of our Lord Jesus, which will
perfect all her desires: And this coming of his, was <hi>prophesied of by
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:65401:241"/>
Enoch, the seventh from Adam,</hi> Jude <hi>v.</hi> 14. and was delighted in
by believers (<hi>Psal.</hi> 96. 12, &amp;c. <hi>Psal.</hi> 98. 6, 7.) before <hi>Solomon</hi>
wrote this.</p>
                  <p>2. The title which she gives him, is, <hi>my Beloved,</hi> That which
ordinarily she gave him, and is here insert, 1. To be a motive to
presse her suit, and it's the most kindly motive which she could
use to him, that there was such a relation betwixt him and her,
and therefore she prayeth, that he would not leave her comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
but return again. 2. It's made use of as a stay to her faith,
for sustaining of her against discouragement: And that there is
such a tye standing betwixt him and believers, is a notable conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
seing he is faithful and kind in all his relations; and by
this she sweetens this her farewel-wish. 3. It's an expression of
her affection, she cannot speak to him, but her heart is kindled,
and must speak kindly: And it shews, that their patting is in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
good terms, like friends. 4. It shews her clearnesse of her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
in him, on which she grounds this suit, so as heartily she
thereby makes ready, and prepares for his coming, knowing that
he is hers.</p>
                  <p>3. The qualification of her suit is in these words, <hi>Be thou like
to a Roe, or a young Hart, upon the mountains of Spices: Roes</hi> and
<hi>Harts</hi> frequent mountains, and do run swiftly, speedily and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly

the allusion and scope here is, as Roes and Harts run swiftly over
mountains, so, my Beloved (saith she) make haste to return with
all diligence: or, because <hi>the mountains of Spices</hi> signify some <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent

                     </gap> words, thus, <hi>my Beloved, be thou
upon the mountains of Spices, like a Roe,</hi> &amp;c. and so Heaven may
be compared to such savory and refreshful mountains. The scope
is one, and speaks thus, Now my Beloved, seing there is a time
coming, when there will be a refreshful meeting betwixt thee and
me, never to be interrupted, therefore I intreat thee, so to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pede
thy affairs which are to preceed, which in reason I cannot
obstruct, that that blessed and longed-for meeting may be haste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:65401:242"/>
and thou may come to receive thy Bride at the last day.
From all these, <hi>Observ.</hi> 1. which is supposed, that there is a
final and glorious coming of our Lord Jesus to Judgement, which
will be when all that he hath to do in the earth in perfected;
otherwise this could not be prayed for by the Bride. 2. It is
implyed, that this coming of Jesus Christ, is a most comfortable
and desirable thing to believers; There is nothing that they
more aim at and pant for, than his company; and that being so
desirable here, it must be much more so hereafter, when all his
people shall be gathered to him, and the Queen shall be brought
to the King in rayment of needle work, and shall enter into the
palace with him, there to abide for ever: That cannot but be
desirable, and therefore it is pressed as her farewel-suit. 3. This
suit of the Brides implyes, that this glorious coming of our Lord
Jesus is much in the thoughts of his people, and useth to be me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated
on by them; for, this prayer of hers, is the expression of
what useth to be in her heart. 4. It implyes, that believers
ought to be established in the faith of Christ's second coming, so
as it may be a ground of prayer to them. 5. Even the thoughts
of this second coming, which flow from the faith thereof, long ere
it come, will be refreshful to the believer. 6. It's peculiar to
the believer to be delighted with, and to be longing for Christ's
second coming; for, it agrees with this relation the Bride hath
to him as <hi>her Beloved:</hi> And whatever others may say, yet this
coming of Christ Jesus, really is, and will be dreadful to them:
And therefore are believers differenced from all others by this
name, that they are such <hi>who love his appearing,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 8.</p>
                  <p>That we may further consider this prayer of the Brides, we
may look upon it, first, mor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap> generally, and so gather these.
<hi>Observ.</hi> 1. Faith and love will compend much in few words,
and will thrust together many suits in a short expression: There
is much in this same word, <hi>flee,</hi> or <hi>haste;</hi> It's not the longest
prayer that is made up of maniest words. 2. Faith in Christ,
and love to him, where they are in exercise, will make the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to meddle in his prayers with things of the greatest concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
so doth this prayer of the Brides, it looks not only to
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:65401:242"/>
his second coming, but also takes in the overturning Satans king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
the calling of Jews and Gentiles, the dissolution of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which go alongst with, and before, Christ's
coming: These are great things, and yet that they may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished,
is that which she here prayeth for. 3. Faith will
look far off in prayer, it will be minding things that are to be
performed long after the persons removal out of this life.</p>
                  <p>Again, we may consider this suit as it followeth on the former
long conference, and goes before the off-breaking thereof: And
so, <hi>Observe,</hi> 1. That the most lively and longest continued en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments
of Christ, that believers have here upon earth, may,
and will have their interruptions and off-breakings for a time:
Uninterrupted communion is reserved for Heaven. 2. Believers
that have been admitted to familiar accesse unto, and fellowship
with Christ Jesus, would endeavour to have it distinctly breaking
off; so that although they cannot entertain it alway, yet they
would be careful that it slip not away, and they not knowing how,
nor understanding in what terms their souls stand with Christ;
neglects here occasion many challenges. 3. These who are best
acquainted with fellowship with Christ here-away, and are clearest
of their interest in him, will be most desirous of, and most pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
after, his second coming: And the little acquaintance that
many have with him here-away, is the reason that so few are taken
up with this suit. 4. When believers have been admitted to
much sweet fellowship with Christ, before their sun decline, or
before his sensible presence be withdrawn, they ought to have a
new design and desire tabled for his returning; and this is a
good way to close such sweet and comfortable conferences with
Christ, by referring distinctly to a new meeting, especially to
this last, which will never admit of a parting again. 5. When
temporal enjoyments of Christ break off, believers would endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
the clearing of their hope of that eternal enjoyment which
is coming, and would comfort themselves in the expectation of
that, which no time will put an end unto.</p>
                  <p>3. We may consider the words in themselves, as this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
prayer holds forth a pattern and copy of prayer to believers,
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:65401:243"/>
and as the Bride evidenceth the nature of true love by this suit.
And so we may, <hi>Observ.</hi> 1. That it's the duty of a believer to
long and pray <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>or Christ's second coming, and when they are in a
right frame and case, they will do so: Love to Christ himself,
who at his appearing is to be glorified; love to the Church in
general, which that day is to be adorned as a bride for her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
and fully to be freed from all outward crosses and inward
defects; and love to a believers own happinesse, which that day
is fully to be perfected, do all call for this. 2. This second com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of our Lord doth fully satisfie the believer in all respects;
they have no suit nor prayer after this, when that day is once
come, there will be no more complaints, all sorrow and fighing
flies then away; there will be then no more prayer, for there will
be no more necessities and wants, but all they can desire will be
then enjoyed, and praise will be the work of that blessed world,
amongst all the Saints to all Eternity: There will be no such
use of the promises and of faith, as we have of them now, but all
will be in possession; Our warfare will be ended, and our victory
compleated, when we shall see him as he is, and be like him:
It's no marvel then that the Spirit and the Bride say, come, and
cry constantly, <hi>haste, my Beloved,</hi> until this desire be fulfilled.
<hi>Even so, come, Lord Iesus.</hi>
