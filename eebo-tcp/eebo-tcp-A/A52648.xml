         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

in the reducing of the revolting Troops.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ome Generall account hath beene given
from <hi>Burford,</hi> of the great mercy of God
vouchſafed this Nation in delivering
into our hands, moſt part of the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiniers
that lately revolted from their
obedience; a more particular account
ſhall now be given, of the deſignes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendments,
and wayes they were invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in, which did ſo greatly indanger the Deſtruction of
this Nation, and of the ſequell and preſent iſſue thereof;
to the end that all perſons, who indeed, and in truth, and
not in word onely, beare regard to the welfare of this Land,
may themſelves receive ſatisfaction, and have where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
to convince others that may have beene ſeduced or
miſled.</p>
            <p>The grounds and manner of the proceeding of theſe
men that have ſo much pretended for the Liberty of the
People, have beene as followeth. There was a Paper ſtiled
<hi>The agreement of the People,</hi> framed by certaine ſelect per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
and debated at a Generall Councell of Officers of the
Army, to be tendred to the Parliament, and to be by them
commended over to the People of the Nation. It being
hoped that ſuch an expedient if aſſented unto, at leaſt by the
honeſt part of the People that had appeared for this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Cauſe to which God hath ſo witneſſed, It would have
tended much to ſettlement, and the compoſing of our diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences,
at leaſt have fixed honeſt men to ſuch grounds of
certainty as might have kept them firme and intire in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the common enemy, and ſtand united to publique In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:29747:3"/>
The Generall Counſell of the Army, and the other ſorts
of men, going then under the name of <hi>Levellers</hi> (who by
their late actings have made good the ſame, which we then
judged but an imputation) had (as now it appeares) diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
ends and aymes, both in the matter and manner of their
proceedings; That which was intended by thoſe men was
to have ſomewhat tendered as a Teſt, and Coercion upon
the People, and all ſorts of men and authorities in the Land:
That which theſe, to wit, the Counſell of the Army aymed
at, was to make an humble repreſentation of ſuch things as
were then likely to give ſatisfaction, and unite, and might
be remitted to mens judgements to be owned or diſ-owned
as men were ſatisfied in their Conſciences, and as it ſhould
pleaſe God to let men ſee reaſon for their ſo doing, that ſoe
it might not be only called, <hi>an Agreement,</hi> but through the
freedome of it, be one indeed, and receive its ſtamp of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
from the Parliament, to whom it was <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>umbly
ſubmitted. Hereupon thoſe other men tooke ſo much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfaction,
that they forthwith printed and ſpread abroad
their Paper, which was different from that of the Army<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
uſing all poſſible meanes to make the ſame to paſſe, but
with how little effect is very well knowne, and finding by
the Armies Application to the Parliament, that they were
likely according to their duty to ſtand by and owne them
as the ſupreme Authority of the Nation, They have by all
meanes aſſayed to vilipend and make odious that authority
preſenting them to the People (in Printed Libels and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe)
as worſe tyrants then any who were before them, (if
they did not anſwer every unſeaſonable &amp; unreaſonable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
of theirs, or correct their inſolence, &amp; laboured likewiſe
to divide and withdraw the Army from their obedience and
to make it hated by the People as the prop of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
ſuppoſed Tyranny, decrying it alſo as acting tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,
if it did but maintaine a juſt and neceſſary diſcipline,
without which it is impoſſible to keepe any order at all. For
if foure or five ſuch unlimitted and ungovern'd ſpirits can
by themſelves and their Agents diſturbe the Peace of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
what would an Army do if brought into the ſame
diſtructive Modell?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:29747:3"/>
What their carriage hath beene towards the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſhall not here be mentioned, but onely what they
have practiſed toward the Army, To diſaffect men of
honeſty and conſcience in the Army. They have ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted
that the Parliament is unfaithfull to their Truſt,
unwilling to ſettle the Liberties of the Nation, miſplace
Officers of Power and Truſt, and intend to perpetuate
themſelves, with many other ſuch like clamours, the
product onely of a ſlaunderous ſpirit; To ſuch as have
an eye to their Arreares and pay, they inſinuate that the
Parliament will not conſider their hard travell, &amp; ſervice,
nor make a juſt proviſion for their ſatisfaction. And to
all they have endeavoured what they can to render the
ſervice of <hi>Ireland</hi> either as unlawfull (wherein they
comply with Popiſh deſignes) or exceeding difficult
and ſo diſcourage many, or elſe to be poſt-poned to
their fancies of Libertie, as if the Liberties of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
could not or would not be ſettled without their
inſpection; and thus by applying themſelves to men of
ſeverall affections, intereſts and tempers they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
and ſeduced ſome honeſt men, and fed the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents
and ſinfull homours of many.</p>
            <p>The courſe they have taken to divide the Souldiers
from their officers (thereby inſnaring and precipitating
them into unlawfull and ſinfull engagements) hath been
by exerciſing the ſame ſpirit of falſhood, to decry, not
onely the Lawes of Warre as tyrannicall, but the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration
therof by the Councell of Warre much more
ſo. Although it be an undenyable truth, that in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of all the Armies that ever any hiſtory did menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
there never was ſo little ſeverity exerciſed by Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall
Councells, or with more tenderneſſe and regret in
what hath been at any time through neceſſity executed
upon offenders.</p>
            <p>When they h<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d laid ſuch a foundation of Lies and
Falſhood (wherein they have not been inferiour, if not

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s we had liſt to deale with,) and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:29747:4"/>
had thereby occaſioned ſo many of Commiſſary Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<hi>Iretons,</hi> and Coll: <hi>Scroops</hi> Regiments to revolt, and
caſt off their Officers (an Act not to be paralell'd) and
that their buſineſſe began to grow to an head, they ſent
their Emiſſaries and Agents into all parts (as we have
good intelligence) pretending from one Regiment to
another, that each regiment had declared that ſo by that
Artifice they might draw each to declare, and to the
end they might not onely confirme diſcontents in thoſe
Regiments they had drawne into that unwarrantable
courſe but heighten a reſolution in their minds to ſtand
it out: they reported that the Regiments waiting on
the Generall in this ſervice were ſo diſſatisfied that
they would not ſtand by him, nor ſtrike a ſtroake in this
buſineſſe, although the Generall hath a ground of as
much confidence of their reſolution to venture their lives
againſt a diſobedience of this nature, as ever they did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
an enemy, of which they gave a ſufficient teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
when they came to the Tryall, going on with
as much chearfulneſſe and alacrity as they were wont
to doe upon any other Ingagement. But by this falſhood
and wile they had drawne in many of them, and made
uſe of it to keep them together: To the forces in <hi>Wales,</hi>
and the Weſt they gave aſſurances that the forces about
<hi>London</hi> would revolt. To thoſe about <hi>London,</hi> that thoſe
in <hi>Wales,</hi> and the Weſt would do the ſame. And to the
Forces in the North uſed they the like Arguments, and
nouriſhed alſo the diſtemper of the forces in the South.
By theſe lies &amp; boaſtings, labouring to heighten diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
in all places. The knowledge hereof we have alſo
by a full atteſtation from the mouths of ſome conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
perſons who were deluded with theſe vile and
forged pretences, and out of conſcience diſcovered, and
ſince do exceedingly lament and abominate the ſame.</p>
            <p>When the Lord Generall was come to <hi>Aulton</hi> in
Hampſhire, he had intelligence of the joyning of part of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:29747:4"/>
the Commiſſary Generalls, and Colonel <hi>Scroops</hi> Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
making tenne Colours, and about 600 Horſe,
They having diſſerted all their Commiſſion Officers
(except two or three) marched away to <hi>Marlborow,</hi>
with intention to make what ſpeed they could to get a
Conjunction with Colonell <hi>Harriſons</hi> Regiment. The
Lord Generall Marched to <hi>Andover,</hi> and thence ſent
Major <hi>White,</hi> Captain <hi>Scotten,</hi> Captain <hi>Peuerell,</hi> and
Captain <hi>Bailey,</hi> with a Letter to the Revolters, excite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their preſent returne to their obedience, with offer
of pardon upon their ſo doing, or otherwiſe, to declare
to them, he would endeavour to reduce them by force,
and withall giving in charge to the Meſſengers, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
a preſent Reſolution and conformity thereunto,
and letting them alſo know, that he would ſend a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
immediatly after them, which is ſince publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
in Print, and entituled <hi>A Declaration from his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency,
with the advice of his Councell of Warre, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the preſent diſtempers of part of Commiſſary Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
Iretons, and of Colonell Scroopes Regiments to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceive
the deluded party, and to leave thoſe excuſeleſſe
who refuſe (upon pardon herein offered) to returne to their
former obedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Generall intended to abide at <hi>Andover</hi> untill he
could receive from his ſaid Meſſengers an anſwer to his
Meſſage and commands ſent by them, which he expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
and required ſhould be returned next morning.
But Major <hi>White</hi> and the reſt letting his Excellency
know, that the ſaid Troopers were marching towards
<hi>Wantage</hi> in order to a conjunction with Colonell <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons</hi>
Men, His Excellency Marched the ſame day
being Sunday the thirteenth of <hi>May</hi> to <hi>Theale</hi> about
foure miles from <hi>Reading,</hi> and appointed the Rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
of his Horſe to be next morning at <hi>Inglefield</hi> a
mile from thence, with purpoſe to March towards <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bingdon,</hi>
to prevent if poſſible the deſigned conjunction
with Colonell <hi>Harriſons</hi> men: And in the mean time,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:29747:5"/>
his Excellency having received a Letter from the Revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
that they would be obedient to Orders from his
Excellency, and come under his protection, His Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
diſpatcht Coll. <hi>Scroop</hi> that night (being Saturday
the 13) to them to make triall of their obedience, but
they in the interim wee marched from <hi>Wantage</hi>
to <hi>Blagrave,</hi> where they expected to meete Collonell
<hi>Harriſons</hi> men, and abiding there for ſome time had the
Acceſſion of two Colours of Horſe of that Regiment.
So that they became 12 Colours in all, beſides Collon:
<hi>Eyres,</hi> with ſome other ſtraglers and Citizens. At this
Randezvouz Collon: <hi>Scroop</hi> found them, and here alſo
Major <hi>White,</hi> and the reſt did with faithfulneſſe and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty
communicate the Generalls command offers of
pardon and his Declaration, but they by the increaſe of
number heightned in their ſpirits, continued in their
contempt and diſobedience, ſlighting Coll: <hi>Scroop,</hi> and
his meſſage, and preferring the reading of their owne
Declaration before the Generalls, the Leaders of them
and their Agents being unwilling the ſame ſhould be
publiſhed to the reſt of the Souldiers, or the Lord Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals
Meſſenger ſhould have full and free diſcourſe
with them: or that his Excellencies Declaration
ſhould be communicated to any but the Agents.</p>
            <p>At this Place a principall perſon amongſt them and
of the greaueſt intereſt, had two Meſſages (as he hath
ſince ingenuouſly, and conſcientiouſly confeſſed) The
