         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </head>
            <p>HAving been lately at <hi>London,</hi> upon occaſion of a Meeting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ſome of the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> and ſome of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple called <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> and other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates; wherein I was ſomewhat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, being charged or brought in by <hi>Thomas Hicks,</hi> in his Second Book of Dialogues, called <hi>Continuation, page 4.</hi> To prove that the <hi>Quakers</hi> account the blood of Christ, no more than a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon thing. And having been at that Meeting, to clear my Innocency in that particular: but the thing not then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in queſtion, and I being to return to my Habitation in the Country (though I ſtaid alſo a Second Meeting for that purpoſe) it was on my heart, in the clearneſs and Innocency thereof; to give forth this Teſtimony, to take of that untruth and calumny of <hi>T. H.</hi> both
<pb facs="tcp:101579:3"/>
from the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> and my ſelf, being both of us greatly therein in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured, as the Lord God of Heaven and Earth knoweth. I have had experience of that deſpiſed People for many years; and I have often heard them (even the ancient ones of them) own Chriſt, both inwardly and outwardly. Yea, I heard one of the ancients of them thus teſtifie, in a publick-Meeting, many years ſince, that if Chriſt had not come in the Fleſh in the fulneſs of time, to bear our Sins in his own body on the Tree, and to offer himſelf up a Sacrifice for mankind, all mankind had utterly periſhed. What cauſe then have we to praiſe the Lord God for ſending his Son in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh, and for what his Son did therein! O Profeſſors, do not pervert our words (by reading them with a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced mind) quite contrary to the drift of Gods Spirit by us. If ye ſhould thus read the Holy Scriptures, yea, the very words of Chriſt himſelf therein, and give that wiſdom of yours, which fights
<pb facs="tcp:101579:3"/>
against us, ſcope to comment upon them, and pervert them after this manner, what a ſtrange and hideous appearance of untruth and contradiction, to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Scriptures of the old Teſtament, might ye make of that wonderful appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of God? For the words of Christ ſeemed ſo fooliſh &amp; impoſſible, to the wiſe men of that Age; that they freequently contradicted, and ſometimes derided him. If we be not of God, we ſhall come to nought: nay, we had not ſtood to this day, if his mighty power had not upheld us. We could not have ſtood inwardly, nor could we have stood outwardly, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the fierce aſſaults we have met with both wayes. And as we have not had by-ends to move us inwardly: ſo neither have we had by-ends to move us outwardly, as our God knoweth. O <hi>T. H.</hi> doſt thou believe the eternal judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, at the great day; not outwardly only in notion, but inwardly in heart? O then conſider, how wilt thou anſwer it to God, for ſaying ſo many things in the
<pb facs="tcp:101579:4"/>
name of a People, as their belief and words, which never were ſpoken by any one of them, nor ever came into any of their hearts! Innocency in me, life in me, truth in me, the Chriſtian Spirit and Nature in me, is a witneſs againſt thee, that thou wroteſt thy Dialogues out of the Chriſtian Nature and Spirit: and thy Brethren, <hi>William Kiffin</hi> and the reſt, who have ſtood by thee, to justifie thee (or at least ſeemed ſo to do) muſt take notice of theſe things, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them in thee, or they will expoſe themſelves (and their Religion) to the Righteous judgment of God, and of all who love Truth, and hate Forgery and Deceit. I pity thee: yea, I can truly ſay, I forgive thee the injury thou haſt done me (though indeed it is very great, thus to repreſent me publickly, what thou couldſt not have done, if thou hadst equally conſidered the things written in that Book) and I alſo deſire, that thou mayeſt be ſenſible of what thou haſt ſo evilly done, and confeſs it before God;
<pb facs="tcp:101579:4"/>
that he alſo might forgive thee. O I would not bear the weight of this Sin at the Judgment ſeat of Chriſt, for Ten thouſand Worlds! And that theſe Books ſhould be ſo long publick, and thy Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren take no notice of them, but rather at laſt apply themſelves to juſtifie thee; O how will they anſwer this thing, when they come to anſwer it for ever! Oh what will ye ſet up an intereſt againſt our Lord Chriſt (who is the Truth and teacheth Truth) and bend all your ſtrength and underſtanding to make lies, falſhoods and forgeries to appear, as if they were Truth, and not forgeries. If ye will judge your ſelves and repent of theſe things, ye ſhall not be condemned of the Lord: but if ye will go on, to cover and hide this great iniquity, ye ſhall not proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per therein. As for my particular, I had committed my cauſe to the Lord, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have been wholly ſilent, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Innocency will be cleared by him in this particular, at the great day, and the love, truth and uprightneſs, wherein
<pb facs="tcp:101579:5"/>
I wrote thoſe things, owned by him. But in the love of God, and in the ſtilneſs and tenderneſs of my Spirit, I was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by him to write what follows. And Oh that it would pleaſe the Lord to make it ſerviceable, even to <hi>T. H.</hi> himſelf, for his good,</p>

            <head>THE FLESH &amp; BLOOD OF CHRIST, Both in the Myſtery, and in the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; briefly, plainly, and uprightly acknowledged and teſtified to, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IN the Second part of <hi>Thomas Hicks</hi> his Dialogues, called Continuation, <hi>page</hi> 4. He maketh his perſonated Quaker ſpeak thus. <hi>Thou ſayeſt, we account the blood of Chriſt no more than a common thing, yea no more than the blood of a common Thief: To which he makes his perſonated</hi> Chriſtian anſwer thus. Iſaac Penington <hi>(who I ſuppoſe is an approved Quaker) asks this queſtion, can out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward blood cleanſe? Therefore ſaith he, we muſt enquire, whether it was the blood of the Vail, that is, of the humane nature, or the blood within the Vail,</hi> (viz.) <hi>Of that ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual man conſiſting of Fleſh, Blood and Bones, which took on him the Vail, or humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; 'tis not the blood of the Vail, that is
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:101579:6"/>
but outward, and can outward blood cleanſe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to ſatisfie any, that deſire to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Truth as it is, and to know what the intent of my heart and words (as ſpoken by me) were; I ſhall firſt ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to his ſtating the queſtion: and then open my heart nakedly and plainly, as it then was, and ſtill is in this matter.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I anſwer, theſe were not my words, which he hath ſet down as mine, but words of his own patching up, partly out of ſeveral queries of mine, and partly out of his own conceivings upon my que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, as if he intended to make me appear both ridiculous and wicked at once. For I no where ſay, or affirm, or did ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that Chriſt is a ſpiritual man conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Fleſh, Blood and Bones, which took on him the Vail or humane Nature: Thus he repreſents me as ridiculous. It is true, Chriſt inwardly, or to his inward being, was a Spirit, or God bleſſed for ever manifeſted in Fleſh, which (to ſpeak pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly) cannot have Fleſh, Blood and Bones, as man hath. And then, beſides his altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions at the beginning, putting in only four words of my query, and leaving out that which next follows (which might have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted my drift and intent in them) he puts in an affirmation which was not mine, in theſe his own words. <hi>'Tis not the Blood
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:101579:6"/>
of the Vail, that is but outward</hi>; and then annexeth to this affirmation of his own, the words of my former query. Can out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Blood cleanſe? as if theſe words of mine (can outward Blood cleanſe?) did neceſſarily infer, that the Blood of Chriſt is but a common thing. Herein he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents me wicked, and makes me ſpeak by his changing and adding, that which never was in my heart, and the contrary where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to I have ſeveral times affirmed in that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Book, where thoſe ſeveral queries were put (out of which he forms this his own query, giving it forth in my name.) For in the Tenth page of that Book, beginning at line 3. I poſitively affirm thus, that <hi>Chriſt did offer up the Fleſh and Blood of that body</hi> (though not only ſo, for he pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out his Soul, he poured out his life) a Sacrifice or Offering for ſin, <hi>a Sacrifice unto the Father, and in it taſted death for every man; and that it is upon conſideration (and through Gods acceptance of this Sacrifice for ſin) that the ſins of Believers are pardoned, that God might be juſt; and the juſtifier of him who believeth in Jeſus, or who is of the Faith of Jeſus.</hi> Is this common Fleſh and Blood? can this be affirmed of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Fleſh and Blood? ought not he to have conſidered this, and other paſſages in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101579:7"/>
my Book of the ſame tendency, and not thus have reproached me, and miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented me to the world? Is this a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Spirit: or according to the Law or Prophets, or Chriſts Doctrine? Doth he herein do, as he would be done by? O that he had an heart to conſider it! I might alſo except againſt thoſe words, <hi>Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> (which he twice putteth in) being not my words, nor indeed my ſenſe: for by humane Nature as I judge, is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood more than the body, whereas I by the word Vail intended no more than the Fleſh (or outward body) which in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is expreſly ſo called, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.20. <hi>through the Vail, that is to ſay, his Fleſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, I cannot but take notice of this, That he hath not cited the place, page or pages; nay not ſo much as named the Book, where thoſe words or ſayings which he attributeth to me are written, whereby any perſons that were not willing to take things upon bare Report (eſpecially in ſo deep charges, reflecting not only upon one perſon, but an whole people) might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult the place, and ſee whether they were my words or no, and whether the queries I did put (indeed to the hearts of people) had any ſuch drift or no, and might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the words (if they were mine) both
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101579:7"/>
with what went before, and alſo followed after; and with what was ſaid in ſeveral other places of the Book, which ſpeak of Chriſt's Fleſh and Blood as of no common thing, but as that which God made uſe of toward the Redemption of Mankind.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The drift of all thoſe Queries in that Book, was not to vilifie the Fleſh and Blood of Chriſt, by repreſenting it as a common or uſeleſs thing: but to bring people from ſticking in the outward, to a ſenſe of the inward myſtery, without which inward ſenſe and feeling, the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying and crying up the outward doth not avail. Indeed, at that time, I was in a great exerciſe concerning Profeſſors. Love was deeply working in my heart, and I was in a very tender frame of Spirit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, as any may perceive, who in the fear of God, and in meekneſs of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſhall read that Book (It is Entituled, <hi>A queſtion to the Profeſſors of Chriſtianity, whether they have the true, living, powerful, ſaving knowledge of Chriſt, or no,</hi> &amp;c.) And in this tender frame, in the midſt of my crying to God for them, thoſe Queries from a true ſenſe and underſtanding ſprang up in my heart, even to neceſſitate them, if poſſible to ſome ſenſe of the myſtery, which there is an abſolute neceſſity of, unto true Chriſtianity and Salvation. This
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101579:8"/>
was the very intent of my heart in the ſeveral Queries, which generally ſpeak of one and the ſame thing, under ſeveral Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphors and Figures. And that this was my intent, theſe words following in the ſecond page of my Preface to that Book, do plainly expreſs, the words are theſe. <hi>Now to draw mens minds to a ſenſe of truth, to a ſenſe of that which is the thing, that they might know the Bread indeed, that they might know the living waters, come to them and drink thereof, and find Chriſt in them a Well of water ſpringing up to eternal life; therefore was it in my heart to give forth this Queſtion and the enſuing Queries, which he that rightly anſwers, muſt know the thing; and he that doth not know the thing, by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability to anſwer, may find that he doth not, and ſo may wait upon God, that he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the knowledge of it, and come to it, for the eternal life which it freely giveth</hi> And that I did mean the myſtery, when I ſpeak of Bread, Water, the Vine, the live-coal from the Altar, the leaves of the Tree of life, the putting on Chriſt, the Fleſh and Blood of Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is very plain to him that reads ſingly. But to make it mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt particularly, concerning the Fleſh and Blood of Chriſt, I ſhall recite one Query, it is the 33. Query, <hi>page</hi> 29. The Query is thus. <hi>Is not the true Church, Fleſh of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:101579:8"/>
Chriſts Fleſh, and Bone of his Bone? Is not the falſe or Antichriſtian Church, Fleſh of Antichriſts Fleſh, and Bone of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts Bone? What is the Fleſh of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Whore, which is to be ſtripped naked and burnt with fire? Shall ever the Church which is of Chriſts Fleſh, be ſtripped naked and burnt with fire? Nay, doth not his Fleſh make able to abide the devouring fire, and to dwell with the everlaſting burnings?</hi> Can this poſſibly be underſtood of outward Fleſh and Bone? is it not manifeſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended of Fleſh and Bone in the Myſtery? yea, that I did relate to the Myſtery in that very Query, out of which he takes the four firſt words, and no more, is very manifeſt by the following words of the ſame Query. It is the 17. Query, <hi>page</hi> 25. The Query runs thus, <hi>Can outward Blood cleanſe the Conſcience? ye that are ſpiritual conſider (can outward water waſh the Soul clean?) ye that have ever felt the Blood of ſprinkling from the Lord upon your Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and your Conſciences cleanſed thereby? did ye ever feel it to be outward? It is one thing what a man apprehends (in the way of notion) from the letter concerning the things of God, and another thing what a man feels in ſpirit</hi>: Is it not manifeſt by the expreſs words themſelves, that I ſpake of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward feeling of the Blood in the myſtery?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:101579:9"/>Fourthly, This Query, <hi>Can outward Blood cleanſe the Conſcience,</hi> &amp;c. doth not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily, nor indeed at all infer, that the Blood of Chriſt, as to the outward, was but a common thing, or uſeleſs. If I had been to anſwer this Query my ſelf, he doth not know what my anſwer would have been. It was put to Profeſſors to anſwer, inwardly in their hearts; who, I did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, upon ſerious conſideration, could not but confeſs, in way of anſwer thereto, that outward Blood it ſelf (or of it ſelf) could not cleanſe and purge away the filth that was inward; but that muſt be done by that which is inward, living and ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. Then hereby they had been brought to ſee the neceſſity of the myſtery, the ſpirit, the power, the life of the Son to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly revealed in them: and then had I obtained my end. Nor was I their enemy in deſiring or aiming at this for them, or in ſetting Queries before them, which to my eye (as in the ſight of God) ſeemed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and conducible in themſelves (howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they might fail as to them) towards the obtaining of this end. And if they could once come to this, to own the Fleſh and Blood in the myſtery, and ſo come to partake of its cleanſing and nouriſhing vertue, and not fix and appropriate that to the outward, which chiefly belongs to the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:101579:9"/>
myſtery; I ſay, if they could but go thus far with me, in owning the inward life and power, in the ſenſible feeling and operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof; I could meet them a great way in ſpeaking glorious things of, and attributing a cleanſing or waſhing vertue to the outward, in and through, and with the inward. For I do not ſeparate the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and outward in my own mind, but the Lord opened my heart, and taught me thus to diſtinguiſh, according to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, in love to them, and for their ſakes. For that was not my intent, to deny the outward, or make it appear as a common or uſeleſs thing. There was never ſuch a ſenſe in my heart, nor was ever word written or ſpoken by me to that end: which to make more manifeſt I ſhall now plainly open my heart, how it hath been, and is ſtill with me, in this reſpect, ſince it pleaſed the God and Father of mercies, to reveal the myſtery of himſelf, and of his Son in me.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, I freely confeſs, that I do own and acknowledge, as in Gods ſight, <hi>Our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, his Fleſh &amp; Blood in the myſtery.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of the myſtery of God, and of the Father and of Chriſt, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.2. The Son was revealed in him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.16. and ſo he knew the myſtery of Chriſt, and Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:101579:10"/>
the myſtery of Chriſt, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 4.3. He was made an able Miniſter of the new Covenant; not of the Letter, but of the Spirit, or myſtery: and ſo he Preached the wiſdom of God in the myſtery, or Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.7. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1.25, 26, 27. and he had great conflict to bring people to the rich knowledge, and acknowledgement of the myſtery, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.1, 2. He was ſent to turn men from dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, &amp; from the power of Satan, (which is a myſtery, and works in mens hearts in a myſtery) to the light, to the Spirit and power of God, which is a myſtery alſo: and remiſſion of ſins is received in and through this myſtery, <hi>Act.</hi> 26.18. And I deſire every ſerious and tender heart to conſider, whether this knowledge of Chriſt in the myſtery, was not that which he called the excellency of the knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt his Lord, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8. Certain I am, that the knowledge of God and Chriſt in the myſtery, is the moſt excellent knowledge, and no leſs then life eternal, inwardly revealed and felt from God in the heart. And here no legal righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, no ſelf-righteouſneſs can ſtand: but the vertue and power of Chriſts Death and Reſurrection, inwardly revealed and felt in the myſtery, ſubdues and deſtroyes it all. Indeed ſelf-righteouſneſs may be
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:101579:10"/>
given up in way of notion, or ſeemingly deſtroyed as to mens apprehenſions, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the revealing or working of the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: but it cannot be deſtroyed in reallity, but where this is felt. But where the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery is known, is received, and throughly works: ſelf-righteouſneſs can have no place there. Now the Apoſtle, who was acquainted with the myſtery of Chriſt, he ſpeaks of his Body, Fleſh and Bones in the myſtery, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.30. (And if there be Fleſh and Bones in the myſtery, is there not alſo Blood in the myſtery?) yea the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks of Spirit, Water and Blood, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.8. Now conſider ſeriouſly, are all theſe of one and the ſame nature? or are they of a different nature? the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of one nature, &amp; the Water and Blood of another nature? Bleſſed be the Lord, the birth which is born of the Spirit, and is ſpiritual, knoweth the nature of the ſpirit which begat it, and knoweth water which is inward and heavenly, and blood which is not at all of an inferiour nature to it. And Jeſus Chriſt, our Lord and Teacher, ſpeaketh of Fleſh which came down from Heaven, which Fleſh is the Bread of life, which he that lives, feeds upon; and none can feed upon, but they that live. And by this it is manifeſt (to all to whom God hath given underſtanding in
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:101579:11"/>
the myſtery) that his Fleſh and Blood in the myſtery is intended by him, in that he ſaith, <hi>He that eateth my Fleſh, and drinketh my Blood, dwelleth in me and I in him,</hi> John 6.56. This dwelling in each other, is an effect of the myſtery, and is witneſſed by none that know not the myſtery. And to this effect Chriſt himſelf expreſly expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it, <hi>ver.</hi> 63. <hi>It is the ſpirit that quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, the Fleſh profiteth nothing: the words that I ſpeak to you, they are ſpirit, and they are life.</hi> As if he had ſaid, I am ſpeaking of the Souls food, I am ſpeaking of the Heavenly bread, I am ſpeaking of ſpirit and life, I am ſpeaking of the myſtery, which ye look upon and underſtand as out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly intended by me, and ſo miſs of the myſtery, of the ſpirit, wherein is the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vertue, and look only at the outward Body or Fleſh, which without the ſpirit profiteth not, nor ever can profit any man.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I confeſs further, that I have the ſenſe, experience, and knowledge of this alſo, that in the myſtery is the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vertue, the cleanſing vertue, the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing vertue unto life eternal. The ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, the water, the blood inwardly ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, inwardly poured by God upon the Soul, inwardly felt and drunk in by the thirſty earth, do cleanſe, do feed, do nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, do refreſh. Doth not God promiſe
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:101579:11"/>
to ſprinkle clean water upon his <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the new Covenant, and they ſhall be clean? and to pour water on him that is thirſty, and Floods upon the dry grounds? is it not by the ſpirit of judgment and burning, that God waſheth away the filth of the Daughter of <hi>Sion, &amp;c. Eſay</hi> 4.4. Doth not the live coal from the Altar, purifie and take away the iniquity? <hi>Eſa.</hi> 6. O read inwardly, O wait to be taught of God to read inwardly, that ye may know what theſe things mean. Why ſhould ye quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel at the precious and tender openings of truth, in love to your Souls.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I have likewiſe this ſenſe, and have alſo had this knowledge and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that the outward, without this, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not avail. A man is not cleanſed by noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or apprehenſions concerning the thing: but by the thing it ſelf. Let a man believe what he can concerning the blood of Chriſt, and apply to himſelf what promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes he can, yet this will not do (O how grievouſly do men miſtake herein!) but he muſt feel ſomewhat from God, ſomewhat of the new Creation in Chriſt Jeſus, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of his light (ſhining from him the Son, into the heart) ſomewhat of his life, ſomewhat of his power, working againſt the darkneſs and power of the enemy in him. Now a man being turned to this,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:101579:12"/>
joyned to this, gathered to this ſtandard of the Lord, tranſlated in ſome degree out of himſelf into this: here ſomewhat of the myſtery is revealed, and found working in him; and ſo far he is of God, and hath ſome true ſenſe, and ſome true underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from him. And here alſo he hath right to Chriſts Fleſh and Blood in the outward, and to all the benefits and precious effects that come thereby. For by owning the myſtery, and receiving the myſtery, we are not taught of God to deny any thing of the outward Fleſh and Blood, or of his obedience and ſufferings in the Fleſh, but rather are taught and enabled there rightly to underſtand it, and to reap the benefits and precious fruits of it.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The Lord hath ſhewn me this alſo, very manifeſtly and clearly, That in former times (in this Nation, as well as elſewhere) before Profeſſors ran ſo into heaps (I mean, into ſeveral wayes and forms of Church fellowſhip ſo called) they had more inward ſenſe of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, than now they have; and were a great deal more tender (both unto the Lord, and one towards another) than now they are. For then grace in the heart, and the inward feeling was the thing that was moſt minded among the ſtricter ſort. They did not mind ſo much bare reading, or
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:101579:12"/>
hearing, or praying, or any outward ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation whatſoever, as what they felt therein. Let men have ſpoken never ſo many glorious words concerning the things of God, yet if they had not been ſpoken warmly and freſhly by him that ſpoke them, there was little ſatisfaction to the Soul that hungred after that which was living, but rather an inward grief and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfaction felt. So that in that day there was an inward ſenſe of the myſtery (though not a diſtinct knowledge of it) which was pretious in the eye of God, and very ſavoury inwardly in the heart. But now, in ſo long time, by looking ſo much outward, and beating their brains, and diſputing about the outward, many have very much (if not wholly) loſt the ſenſe of the inward, and are found con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending for the outward, againſt the very appearance and manifeſtation of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and ſo are in danger of being hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and ſealed up in that which is dead and litteral, out of the limits of that which is living and ſpiritual. It is a dreadful thing to fight againſt the living God, and his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving appearance in the hearts of thoſe whom he chuſeth, in any Age or Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: The Lord hath been pleaſed to bring us (a poor deſpiſed remnant) back to that which firſt gave us life, in the dayes of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:101579:13"/>
our former profeſſion. O that ye were brought thither alſo, that that might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the vail, hardneſs, darkneſs, and deep prejudices from you; which can never be removed, while ye ſtick in litteral appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, without the light and teachings of Gods ſpirit!</p>
            <p>Now, as touching the outward, which ye ſay we deny, becauſe of our teſtimony to the inward, I have frequently given a moſt ſolemn teſtimony thereto; and God knoweth it to be the truth of my heart, and that the teſtifying to the inward (from which the outward came) doth not make the outward void, but rather eſtabliſh it, in its place and ſervice. God himſelf, who knew what vertue was in the inward, yet hath pleaſed to make uſe of the outward: and who may contradict or ſlight his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Council therein? Glorious was the appearance and <hi>manifeſtation of his</hi> Son in Fleſh, pretious his ſubjection and holy obedience to his Father; his giving himſelf up to death for ſinners, was of great eſteem in his eye It was a ſpotleſs Sacrifice of great value, and effectual for the Remiſſion of ſins: and I do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, humbly unto the Lord, the Remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my ſins thereby, and bleſs the Lord for it, even for giving up his Son to death for us all, and giving all that believe in his
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:101579:13"/>
name and power, to partake of Remiſſion through him. And ſeeing it is thus with me, ſeeing the Root of the matter is in me, O how can any man that hopes to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed by my Lord and Saviour, reproach me for ſpeaking of the myſtery, without the leaſt Derogation to the outward, or what was done by him in the outward! But if I ſhould ſpeak vehemently concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning mens neglecting the myſtery, and ſetting up that which is outward inſtead of it, and without it; I ſhould not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, but juſtified of the Lord in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Indeed there is a great and weighty charge from Gods ſpirit, upon the Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of this age, for departing from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward (I mean that ſweet ſenſe, which in ſome meaſure God gave them in former times of the inward) and magnifying and ſtriving to eſtabliſh that which they apprehend concerning the outward, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, and againſt it. O that it were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe with them, that God may not have this charge to manage againſt them, when at the great day they are to appear before him, and be judged by him: When all that have ſlighted or ſpoken contemptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly of his Sons appearance in Fleſh (and have not come to a ſenſe thereof, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance for it) ſhall be condemned, and they that have ſlighted or ſpoken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuouſly
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:101579:14"/>
of his appearance in ſpirit, ſhall not be juſtified: which appearance is now made manifeſt in the hearts of many, bleſſed be the Lord for it. O what cryes have been in my heart many years con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning you! (O ye Profeſſors of all ſorts, who have had any tenderneſs towards the Lord,) that ye might ſee and know the Lords Chriſt, and confeſs him in ſpirit, in the Myſtery, even in his inward appearance in the heart, and might feel his redeeming power and vertue there, and ſo be brought into Union and Fellowſhip with him!</p>
            <div type="conclusion">

               <head>The Concluſion of this Part.</head>
               <p>THere is a pretious promiſe of Gods making a Feaſt of fat things on his holy Mountain, and of deſtroying there the face of the covering caſt over all people, and the vail that is ſpread over all Nations, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 25.6, 7. Now, what is this Mountain? was there not a <hi>Mount-Sion</hi> under the Law, which was figurative? And is there not a <hi>Mount Sion</hi> under the Goſpel, which is the ſubſtance of that figure? And did not the Chriſtians in the Apoſtles dayes, who were called of God and ſanctified, come to this <hi>Mount-Sion,</hi> and to the City of the living God, the Heavenly Jeruſalem, where they had fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with God the judge of all, and with Jeſus the Mediator of the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, <hi>&amp;c. Heb.</hi> 12.22, 24. And was not the vail here done away, in him who was their Lord, their light, their life, their ſtrength, their Son of Righteouſneſs, their bright and morning Star? ſo that with open face they could behold the glory of the Lord, and were changed thereby into his Heavenly Image, from glory to glory, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. But alas, how hath that life, ſpirit and power been loſt, ſince the dayes
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:101579:15"/>
of the Apoſtles! Men have ſtill owned the Apoſtles words, and formed many notions and apprehenſions out of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: but loſt the Apoſtles ſpirit, loſt the knowledge of the holy Mountain, where the vail is taken away, and where the Feaſt of fat things is made: and ſo are only dreaming about eating and drinking ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, but know not what it is to feed on the living ſubſtance. And ſo (being igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of that) the vail is over their hearts, while they read the Prophets words, and Chriſts and his Apoſtles words: and the myſtery of life, and of the redeeming power is hid from their eyes: and that which God intended to them for a Table, is become their ſnare (as it was with the Jews) and their back is ſo bowed down under the loads and burthens of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, that they cannot ſo much as hope or believe in the power of life for Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there-from, but conclude it muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily be ſo with them all their dayes. O where's the faith that gives victory over the Enemys? Where's the ability in the faith ſo to reſiſt him, as to make him fly? Where's Satans falling like lightning (oh his ſtrength before the power of the Lord is but a flaſh!) and the God of peace his treading him under the feet of his Saints? O where's that truth, or that knowledge
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:101579:15"/>
of the Son, which makes free from him? (<hi>Joh.</hi> 8.32, 36.) Where's that ſpirit, wherein liberty from his power and ſnares is felt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.17. Where's living in the ſpirit, and walking in the ſpirit, and in the pure light of the Lord, when he cannot come? Where's reading of the Scriptures in that which gives to witneſs them, and which fulfils them in the heart? O the myſtery of godlineſs, the power of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, where the life is revealed, and the vail taken away, and an underſtanding given, opened and kept open to read and underſtand the Scriptures aright, yea and the hidden glory alſo! Where it cannot be ſaid in truth, to thoſe that are there, ye know not the Scriptures, nor the power of God; but ye have received power to become Sons of God, and ye are in him that is true, who truly opens the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in your hearts, and gives you the enjoyment, inheritance and poſſeſſion of the pretious promiſes, whereby ye are made partakers of the Divine nature, and live in him who is the head and ſpring of that nature! O that people, that profeſs Chriſt, were here! O that they did know him who begets! and then they would not be ſo ignorant of thoſe that are begotten by him: but would come into the true faith, into the true love, into the true
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:101579:16"/>
knowledge and obedience of him, whom God hath appointed to guide and govern, and build up the whole living body! The Lord guide men inwardly thither, where the myſtery is revealed, and the fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with God and his Son and Saints held in the Myſtery: for our fellowſhip is not in a notional knowledge concerning Chriſt; but in the life it ſelf, which the Lord God gather his people more and more into, and build them more and more up in, <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <head>We are a People of God's gathering, who (many of us) had long waited for his appearance, and had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone great Diſtreſs, for want thereof.</head>
               <p>Q. <hi>B<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t ſome may ſay, what appearance of the Great God and Saviour did ye want?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> We wanted the preſence and power of his ſpirit, to be inwardly mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in our ſpirits. We had (as I may ſay) what we could gather from the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and indeavoured to practiſe what we could read in the Letter: but we wanted the power from on high, we wanted life, we wanted the preſence and fellowſhip of our beloved; we wanted the knowledge of the Heavenly Seed and Kingdom, and an entrance into it, and the holy Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Reign of the Lord of life over the Fleſh, over ſin and death in us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:101579:17"/>Queſt. <hi>How did God appear to you?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Son of Righteouſneſs did ariſe in us, the day-ſpring from on high, the Morning Star did viſit us, inſomuch that we did as really ſee and feel the light and brightneſs of the inward day in our ſpirits, as ever we felt the darkneſs of the inward night?</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>How did God gather you?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> By the voice of his Son, by the Arm of his Son, by the vertue of his Sons light and life, inwardly revealed and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in our hearts. This looſed us inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the darkneſs, from the bonds of ſin and iniquity, from the power of the Captiver and Deſtroyer: and turned our minds inwardly towards our Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, to mind his inward appearance, his inward ſhinings, his inward quicknings; all which were freſh from God and full of vertue. And as we came to be ſenſible of them, joyn to them, receive and give up to them, we came to partake of their vertue, and to witneſs the reſcuing and redeeming of our Souls thereby. So that by hearing the Sons voice and following him, we came to find him the way to the Father, and to be gathered home by him to the Fathers houſe, where is Bread enough, and Manſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of reſt and peace for all the Children of the moſt High.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:101579:17"/>Now, as touching the bleſſed principle of truth, which we have had experience of, and teſtifie to (for how can we conceal ſo rich a Treaſure, and be faithful to God, or bear true good will to men!) it is no new thing in it ſelf, though of late more clearly revealed, and the minds of men more clearly directed, and guided to it, than in former ages. It is no other then that which Chriſt himſelf abundantly Preached, who Preached the Kingdom, who Preached the truth which makes free, and that under many Parables and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblances: ſometimes of a little Seed, ſometimes of a Pearl or hid Treaſure, ſometimes of a Leaven or Salt, ſometimes of a loſt piece of Silver, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now, what is this, and where is this to be found? What is this, which is like a little Seed, a Pearl, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And where is it to be found? What is the field? is it not the World, and is not the World ſet in mans heart? what is the houſe, which is to be ſwept and the Candle lighted in? Is it not that houſe, or heart, where the many Enemies are? A mans Enemies, ſaith Chriſt, are thoſe of his own houſe. Indeed the teſtimony concerning this was pretious to us: but the finding and experiencing the thing teſtified of, to be according to the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, was much more. And this we ſay, in
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:101579:18"/>
perfect truth of heart, and in moſt tender love to the Souls of people; that whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver tries, ſhall find this little thing, this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Seed of the Kingdom, to be a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to be a Pearl, to be Heavenly Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, to be the Leaven of Life, leavening the heart with life, and with the moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious oyl and oyntment of Healing and Salvation. So that we teſtifie to no new thing; but to the truth and grace which was from the beginning: which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in Jeſus Chriſt the Lord and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and diſpenced by him in all all Ages and Generations, whereby he quickned, renewed, and changed the heart of the true believers, in his inward and ſpiritual appearance in them, thereby deſtroying the Enemies of their own houſe, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them from them. For indeed there is no ſaving the Creature, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying that in the Creature, which brings ſpiritual death and deſtruction upon it. <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old was ſaved by the deſtroying of their outward Enemies: and <hi>Iſrael</hi> now (the new <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the inward <hi>Iſrael</hi>) is ſaved by the deſtruction of their inward Enemies. O that people could come out of their own wiſdom and wait for Gods wiſdom, that in it they might come to ſee the glory, the excellency, the exceeding rich vertue and Treaſures of life, that are
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:101579:18"/>
wrapped up in this principle or ſeed of Life; and ſo might receive it, give up to it, and come to partake thereof.</p>
               <p>And as touching Doctrines, we have no new Doctrine to hold forth. The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines held forth in the holy Scriptures, are the Doctrines that we believe. And this doth farther ſeal to us our belief of this principle, becauſe we find it a Key, by which God openeth the Scriptures to us, and giveth us the living ſenſe and evidence of them in our hearts. We ſee and have felt in it to whom the curſe and wrath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs, and to whom the love, mercy, peace, bleſſings and pretious promiſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long; and have been led by Gods holy ſpirit and power, through the judgments, to the mercy, and to the partaking of the pretious promiſes. So that, what ſhould we publiſh any new faith, or any new Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines for? (indeed we have none to publiſh) but all our aim is to bring men to the ancient principle of truth, and to the right underſtanding and practiſe of the ancient Apoſtolick Doctrine and holy Faith once delivered to the Saints. Head-notions do but cauſe diſputes: but heart-knowledge, heart-experience, ſenſe of the living power of God inwardly, the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and demonſtration of his ſpirit in the inward parts, puts an end to diſputes,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:101579:19"/>
and puts men upon the inward travel and exerciſe of ſpirit, by that which is new and living, which avails with God. Now whereas many are offended at us, becauſe we do not more Preach Doctrinal points, or the Hiſtory of Chriſt, as touching his Death, Reſurrection, Aſcention, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eclaration and Teſtimony is chiefly concerning a Principle, to direct and guide mens minds thereto.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>To give a plain account of This thing, as it pleaſeth the Lord to open my heart at this time, in love and good will to ſatisfie and remove Prejudices where it may be: thus it is in brief.</head>
               <p>FIrſt, that which God hath given us the experience of (after our great loſs in the litteral knowledge of things) and that which he hath given us to teſtifie of, is the myſtery, the hidden life, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and ſpiritual appearance of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, revealing his power inwardly, deſtroying Enemies inwardly, and working his work inwardly in the Heart. Oh, this was the joyful ſound to our Souls, even the tydings of the ariſing of that inward life and power
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:101579:19"/>
which could do this? Now this ſpiritual appearance of his, was after his appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in fleſh, and is the ſtanding and laſting Diſpenſation of the Goſpel, even the appearance of Chriſt in his ſpirit and power inwardly in the hearts of his. So that in minding this, and being faithful in this reſpect, we mind our peculiar work, and are faithful in that which God hath peculiarly called us to, and requireth of us.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There is not that need of publiſhing the other, as formerly was. The Hiſtorical Relation concerning Chriſt, is generally believed, and received by all ſorts, that pretend to Chriſtianity. His death, his miracles, his riſing, his aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, his intercedeing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is generally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by all people: but the myſtery they miſs of, the hidden life, they are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with; but alienated from the life of God, in the midſt of their litteral own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and acknowledging of theſe things.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The knowledge of theſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the knowledge of the myſtery, is not ſufficient to bring them unto God; for many ſet up that which they gather, and comprehend from the Relation concerning the thing, inſtead of the thing it ſelf; and ſo never come to a ſenſe of their need of the thing it ſelf; nay, not ſo far, as rightly
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:101579:20"/>
to ſeek after it. And ſo, many are builders, and many are built up very high in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in a way of notion and practiſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out acquaintance with the Rock of Ages, without the true knowledge and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the foundation and corner-Stone. My meaning is, they have a notion of Chriſt to be the Rock, a notion of him to be the foundation-ſtone: but never come livingly to feel him the Rock, to feel him the foundation-ſtone inwardly laid in their hearts, and themſelves made living ſtones in him, and built upon him the main and fundamental ſtone. Where is this to be felt, but within? And they that feel this within, do they not feel Chriſt within? And can any that feel him within, deny him to be within, the ſtrength of life, the hope of glory? Well, it is true once again (ſpiritually now, as well as formerly lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally) <hi>The ſtone which the builders refuſed</hi> (Chriſt within the builders of this age refuſe) <hi>is become the head of the Corner,</hi> who knits together his ſanctified body, his living body the Church, in this our day, more gloriouſly than in former Ages and Generations, bleſſed be the name of our God.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The myſtery, the hidden life, the appearance of Chriſt in ſpirit compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends the other, and the other is not loſt or
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:101579:20"/>
denyed, but found in it, and there diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and acknowledged more clearly and abundantly. It was to be after it, and comprehends that which went before it. <hi>Paul</hi> did not loſe any thing of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent knowledge of Chriſt, when he ſaid, <hi>Hence forth know we no more after the fleſh; yea though we have known Chriſt after the fleſh, yet henceforth know we him no more.</hi> If he did not know Chriſt after the fleſh, how did he know him? Why, as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inwardly revealed him. He knew him in his ſpirit and power. He knew his death inwardly, he knew his Reſurrection inwardly, he knew the ſpirit, the vertue, the life, the power of it inwardly. He knew the thing in the myſtery in his own heart. O pretious knowledge! O the excellency of this knowledge of my Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt! what is the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly moſt exact litteral knowledge without this? But what then! do I now deny or ſlight the outward? No, I have it here, and I have the inward feeling of the ſpirit of life, how it dwelt in him, how it wrought in him, and of what wonderful value all his actions and obedience were, in and through the vertue of this ſpirit. Was <hi>Abrahams</hi> offering his Son ſo preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in Gods eye? O then what is this! Never was ſuch a body ſo ſanctified, ſo
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:101579:21"/>
prepared: never ſuch a Sacrifice offered. O the infinite worth and value of it! For by the inward life and teachings of Gods ſpirit, am I taught and made able to value that glorious outward appearance, and manifeſtation of the life and power of God in that Heavenly fleſh (as in my heart, I have often called it) for the life ſo dwelt in it, that it was even one with it. Yet ſtill it was a vail, and the myſtery was the thing, and the eye of life looks through the vail into the myſtery, and paſſes through it, as <hi>I</hi> may ſay, as to the outward, that it may behold its glory in the inward. And here the fleſh of Chriſt, the vail is not loſt, but is found and known in its glory in the inward. Be not offended at me, O tender hearted Reader, for <hi>I</hi> write in love, things true, according to the inward feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and demonſtration of Gods ſpirit, though not eaſie perhaps to be underſtood at preſent by thee: but in due time the Lord can make them manifeſt to thee, if thou in uprightneſs and tenderneſs of heart, and in the ſilence of the fleſhly part wait upon him.</p>

            <head>A few WORDS Concerning the way of PEACE.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <q>
                  <p>The way of Peace they have not known,</p>
                  <bibl>
                     <hi>Rom. 3.17.</hi>

               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THere is a way of Peace, of true Peace with God, who is an Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to all that is unholy and unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Thoſe who have been unholy and unrighteous, who have been awakened, troubled, and could find no reſt, but the ſevere and righteous judgments and wrath of the Lord, lying upon their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits night and day; having at length had their ears opened by him, and being led by him out of the unholy and unrighteous way, into the holy and righteous way, have felt both Life and Peace therein.</p>
            <p>Now there are two ſorts, which the Apoſtle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> here mentions (or two ſtates, which the Apoſtle here ſpeaks of) which
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:101579:22"/>
have not known, nor can know the way of Peace with God; who is an Adverſary to them both, and will one day ſpeak trouble to them both, when their Souls and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences come to be ſearched and judged by him.</p>
            <p>The one is the Prophane or Gentile-ſtate, which is without the ſenſe of God, not heeding any appearance of his, or any inward voice of his Spirit, or the writing of his Law upon their heart. Theſe never knew the way, wherein the heart is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly and ſpiritually circumciſed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, ſin forgiven, and Peace obtained.</p>
            <p>The other is the profeſſing, or outward Jewes-ſtate, who may ſtudy the Letter, and apply themſelves to conform outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Letter, but never were acquainted with the inward ſpirit and power. Theſe greatly differ from the Gentile or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane-ſtate, both in outward appearance, and in their own eye: but are the ſame in the ground, with the Gentiles, and know no more of the way of Peace, than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But what is the way of Peace, which neither the Prophane, nor any ſort of Profeſſors out of the life and power, ever knew or can know?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is an inward way, away for
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:101579:22"/>
the inward Jews, for the inwardly renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and circumciſed to walk in. It is an holy or ſanctified way, for the ſanctified ones to walk in. It is a living way, which none but the living can find. It is a new way, which none but thoſe to whom God hath given the new eye can ſee. <hi>It</hi> is a way that God prepares and caſts up, and leads mens ſpirits into (who hearken unto him) and guides the feet of his Saints in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>It</hi> is a ſtrait and narrow way, which no luſt of the fleſh, nor wiſdom of the fleſh can find out, or enter into. O how little, how low, how poor, how empty, how naked muſt he be, that enters into this way, and walks therein! Many may ſeek after it, and may think to find it, and walk in it, but few ſhall be able, as our Lord Chriſt ſaid. Here circumciſion outward avails not, here want of that circumciſion hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders not: here bodily exerciſe profits little. The new Creature is <hi>all</hi> here, the croſs of Chriſt is <hi>all</hi> here, the power of God is <hi>all</hi> here; and he that walks according to this rule, Peace is upon him, and the whole <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God. But he that knows not this rule, nor walks according to this rule; Peace is not upon him, nor is he one of the inward <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, who receive power to become Sons, who receive the law of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:101579:23"/>
the Spirit of life in Chriſt Jeſus, which is the inward rule of the inward <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was the way of Peace from the beginning; this is the way of Peace ſtill; and there is not another. To be new Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated in Chriſt Jeſus, to be ingraffed into him, to abide in him, to have the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of the fleſh (the body of the ſins of the fleſh cut off) by the circumciſion of Chriſt (made inwardly in the heart with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hands) and to walk not after the fleſh, but after the Spirit (even in the newneſs of the Spirit) he is life and Peace, reſt and joy for evermore. The Lord of his tender mercy, give men a ſenſe of it, and lead men into it more and more, <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <head>The Concluſion of the Whole.</head>
            <p>THere is a Birth which is born, not of Bloods, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man; but of God, <hi>John</hi> 1.13. And this Birth which is born of the Spirit, is Spirit, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.6. Now this Birth, which is born of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and is Spirit, hath a life and way of knowledge, ſuitable to its nature and being, which is very far above man. <hi>It's</hi> life is in the Spirit, &amp; its walking in the Spirit, and its knowledge is after the way of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, very far above mans way of concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving or comprehending. The Birth it ſelf is a Myſtery to man, and it's way of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is a way altogether hid from man. It is indeed in the evidence and demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Gods Spirit, in the ſhinings of his light in the heart. <hi>In thy light ſhall we ſee light.</hi> The Birth knows what this means. There is a wiſe and prudent part in man, from which God hides the ſight of his Kingdom, and the Heavenly glory thereof: but there is a Babe, to which God reveals the Myſtery thereof. Fleſh and Blood cannot reveal: but the Father can and doth to his Children, who is the Teacher
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:101579:24"/>
of them all, from the leaſt to the greateſt, in the new and living Covenant. There is mans day, and there is Gods day. There is mans day of gathering knowledge, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his fleſhly manner of comprehending: and there is Gods day of giving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, by the ſhinings of the light of his own eternal Spirit. In mans day, how doth wiſe and prudent man beat his brains, and labour in the fire for very vanity! but in Gods day, how doth the knowledge of the Lord cover the Earth, as the waters cover the Sea! When the day-ſpring from on high viſits inwardly, when the Lord lighteth the Candle inwardly; O how clear is the knowledge of the Lord, and how doth it abound then! O what a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence there is between mans apprehenſions and conceivings concerning Chriſt, and Gods revealing him inwardly! and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween mans coming to Chriſt according to his own apprehenſions, and his coming to Chriſt in the Heavenly drawings and teachings of the Father (<hi>Joh.</hi> 6.45.) O that the begettings of Life and Birth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of were felt in mens hearts, that in it men might know the day of God, and the Kingdom of God, and the Treaſures of wiſdom which are hid in Chriſt, and will ever be ſo, but as Chriſt is inwardly reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:101579:24"/>
and formed in the heart! Many may have notions of Chriſts being formed in them: Ah, but to feel it inwardly! ther's the Sweetneſs, ther's the aſſurance, ther's the life, ther's the Peace, ther's the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and ther's the joy of the true Chriſtian for ever. Come, O come, all ſorts of tender Profeſſors out of your ſelves into Gods Spirit, into Gods truth; that ye may know what it is to be in the Spirit, and in the Truth: and what it is to live there, and to know things there, &amp; to worſhip there, &amp; to have fellowſhip with the Father &amp; Son there. The poor receive the Goſpel, the poor receive the Kingdom, the poor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the power, the poor receive the Righteouſneſs and Salvation of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Ye are too rich in your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions and gathered knowledge, from your own litteral conceivings, to learn to wait aright, to receive of him his Gold, his Raiment, and his eye-ſalve. What pleaſure is it to us to teſtifie againſt you? Were it not for obedience to our God, and love to your Souls, we would never do it. We are content and ſatisfied to be of the little deſpiſed Flock, which the Shepherd feeds, giving to every one his proportion of daily nouriſhment, Life, Peace, Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:101579:25"/>
and Joy. It is our love to you, that we would not have you lay out your Money for that which is not Bread, and your labour for that which will not ſatisfie the truly hungry and awakened Soul, but might come to feed on ſubſtance, on the life it ſelf, on the ſweetneſs and fatneſs of Gods houſe, where nothing that any of the children can need or long after is wanting. O that ye had the ſenſe of our love! If ye had the true underſtanding and ſenſe of Gods love, ye could not but have a ſenſe of our love alſo: for it comes from him, and it flows towards you in his will and tender movings. Do ye love God? are your hearts circumciſed to love God? if not, ye do not truly love. And if ye lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him that begets, ye would love them that are begotten by him. Your love is to your own notions and apprehenſions of God; not to his nature; For if ye loved his nature (that holy, Heavenly, ſpiritual nature as it is in him) ye could not but love it in his Children alſo. Well, our God is Love, and our God hath given us Love, and taught us to Love, even our Enemies, and to wreſtle with our God for them; that if it be poſſible, the Lord may remove the Scales from their eyes, and give them Repentance to the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:101579:25"/>
acknowledgment of the Truth, as it is in Jeſus, where it is more living and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, more effectual and operative (inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purifying, ſanctifying, yea and juſtifying alſo) then any, but onely thoſe that are born of God, (and kept alive by him), yet ever knew or can know.</p>

            <head type="sub">Containing <hi>a few Words concerning the doings and ſufferings</hi> of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed People called <hi>QUAKERS,</hi> which are both miſ-underſtood, and miſ-repreſented by many; with an Exhortation to true Chriſtianity.</head>
            <p>FIrſt, their doings are looked upon by many, to be from a natural Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, and according to a Covenant of works, and not from the free grace and gift of Gods Spirit.</p>
            <p>Now concerning this, I can ſpeak ſomewhat faithfully, as having been long exerciſed in the Principle, and as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving had experience of the grace and tender mercy of the Lord from my Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:101579:26"/>
And indeed, thus it hath been with me from my Childhood; what ever hath been done in me or by me, that was good, I have felt to be from Gods grace and mercy to me, and have cryed grace, grace, mercy, mercy to the Lord conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually therefore. And when I was turned to his truth in the inward parts, I found it was Gods grace and tender love to me to turn me to it, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve me being turned; and to cauſe it to ſpring in me day by day, and to give me ability through it. Ah, none knows, but they who have had experience, how we have been weakned in the natural part; how poor we have been made, that we might receive the Goſpel, and how poor in our ſelves we are kept, that we might enjoy the riches and inheritance of the Kingdom. And this we daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that not by the works of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs which we had done, but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his mercy he ſaved us, and doth daily ſave us, by the waſhing of regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and the renewing of the holy Ghoſt! yea, Gods writing his Law in
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:101579:26"/>
our hearts, and placing his fear there, and putting his ſpirit within us, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten and quicken and cauſe us to walk in his wayes, and to keep his ſtatutes and judgments, and do them, and all the mortifying of ſin, and denying of the luſts of the fleſh, and performing that which is holy and acceptable in the eyes of the Lord (as all that proceeds from his own holy ſpirit is) all this is of the new Covenant, and performed by the working thereof, and not by the working of the natural part of it ſelf, but by the working of the ſpirit of life in the new Birth, and through the natural part as his inſtrument. So let none reproach the works that God brings forth in us, who hath created us a new in Chriſt Jeſus unto good works, leſt thereby he reproach the holy Spirit and power of the living God, in which they are wrought, and by which they are brought forth, and could never be brought forth without it.</p>
            <p>Then, for our ſufferings, indeed they are gifts we receive from God: ſo that
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:101579:27"/>
we can truly ſay, it is given us by the Lord our God, not only to believe in his Son, but to ſuffer for his ſake: and that it is only in good Conſcience to God, and by the aſſiſtance of the Lord, that we ſuffer: and that the patience and meekneſs wherewith we ſuffer, is not of our ſelves, but of him. When ever the Lord permits afflictions or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings to come upon us; our eye is to him, and we enter into them in his fear, knowing our own inability to go through them, and looking up to him for strength. And when we are in them, while they continue, we daily look up to him for ſtrength, and have been many times very weak in our ſelves, when im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly, or very ſoon after, we have felt great strength in the Lord. Alſo, after our ſufferings, when the Lord hath been with us all along, and brought us through our ſufferings, in the peace and joy of his Spirit; we do not look back boastingly, as if we had been any thing, or done any thing as of our ſelves; but we bow before the Lord, and bleſs the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:101579:27"/>
Lord, when we conſider how he hath been with us, and how he hath upheld us by the right hand of his Righteouſneſs, and what he hath done for us, when we were very poor, weak, afflicted, and often ſorely diſtreſſed. Therefore let none Reproach, miſ-repreſent or vilifie our ſufferings, which our God hath hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped us through, and for which we (in humility of heart) give him thanks, and cannot but do ſo all our days; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the thankful remembrance and ſenſe of them is written by the finger of his Spirit upon our hearts. O all ſorts of People, whom we love and travel for, and uſe our intereſt in the Lord our God for, that ye might be truly ſenſible of your conditions, know the inward appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and viſits of the Shepherd and Saviour of the Soul, turn to him (look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in true faith unto him) and be ſaved, I ſay unto you, in tenderneſs of Spirit, O, do not requite us ſo ill for our love and truth of heart towards you, as to caſt untrue and unjuſt Reproaches upon us, and to render that truth vile, which
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:101579:28"/>
God has made honourable, in ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and redeeming many thereby. Truly our love is from the God of love. We could not ſo love you, as we do, if our God had not taught us: nor ſo ſeek after you, as we do, in tenderneſs of Bowels, if we were not inſtruments in the hand of the Shepherd of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And the light we teſtifie of, which we feel ſhine in us; it is no leſs then the true, ſure light of the Sun of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which God hath cauſed to ſhine in our hearts, who alſo loveth mankind, and cauſeth it to glance into the darkeſt Corners of the Earth. And the life we are quickned by, out of Sin and Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, and the power we have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to become Sons of God, it is from him who is the fountain of life, and hath all power in Heaven and Earth. O that ye could receive the bleſſed report! O that the Arm of the Lord might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in you! O that ye could feel and witneſs the Saviour working out your Salvation in you, binding the ſtrong man in you, caſting him out of you, with all
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:101579:28"/>
his goods after him, that the place of the wicked one might be found no more in you, nor none of his lusts or vain thoughts lodge in your hearts any more; but ye might witneſs and experience the new heart, the clean heart, the pure heart, in which God dwells; and the eye that ſees him that is inviſible. O glory to the Lord for what he hath done in and for a deſpiſed People (who were no Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, before the Lord made them one) who hath brought them to <hi>Sion,</hi> his holy Mountain, where he dwells and reigns, and where he builds up his own houſe and Temple, which he eſtabliſheth over all, where the Sheep of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſeed, and where the Shepherd of <hi>Iſrael</hi> Reigns and Triumphs in glory, over the enemies of his Kingdom. The little innocent Babes taſt ſomewhat of his holy Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and Power, and of his Kingdom of Peace and Righteouſneſs: but in his ancients his light ſhines very brightly, and before them he reigneth gloriouſly; ſo that he is praiſed in the very heights of <hi>Sion,</hi> and his name renowned there
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:101579:29"/>
over all for ever. Glory, glory to the pure ſpring of life, from whence the living ſtreams come, which refreſh the Souls of the living. Surely his pure praiſes ſhall be ſounded in the hearts of the living for ever and ever, <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <head>AN EXHORTATION To true Chriſtianity.</head>
               <head type="sub">It is eaſie to pretend to Chriſt: but to be a true Chriſtian is very pretious, and many Tribulations and deep Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are to be paſſed thorow before it be attained unto, as thoſe that are made ſo by the Lord, experience.</head>
               <p>NOw everlaſting Happineſs and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion depends upon true Chriſtianity. Not upon having the name of a Chriſtian only, or profeſſing ſuch or ſuch Chriſtian Doctrines: but upon having the Nature of Chriſtianity, upon being renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Spirit of Chriſt, and receiving the Spirit, and walking in the Spirit, and bringing forth the fruits of the Spirit. Oh, here is the Chriſtian indeed; and it ſhould be every ones care, not to fall ſhort of this. Now, becauſe there is ſuch a contention about Chriſtianity, who is the right Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian; it behoves every man to take care,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:101579:30"/>
as to himſelf, that he be really ſuch: that he receive that from God, and be that to God, which none but the right Chriſtian can be, or can receive. This is the uſe I would make of theſe things in my own heart; even to be ſure I be ſuch an one, as God hath made, and will accept and own as a Chriſtian. And having had ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of this thing, and truly underſtand what the Chriſtian-ſtate is, and what doth attend it; I ſhall ſet down ſome few things, which he that inwardly knoweth (witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth and enjoyeth) is without all contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, a true Chriſtian, what ever men may account of him.</p>
               <p>Firſt, He that is a new Creature, is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt a true Chriſtian. He that is Regenerated, he that is renewed in the Spirit of his mind by Chriſt Jeſus, he that is New-Created in the Holy &amp; Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Image; he has felt the power of Gods Spirit begetting him anew, forming him anew, out of the old nature and Image of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> into the nature and Image of the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> who is the quickning Spirit: and that which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten and born of him is Spirit.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He that is in the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, is a true Chriſtian. He that hath thirſted after the living waters, and hath heard the call to the waters of life; hath
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:101579:30"/>
heard the voice of him who gives life, and hath received life from him, who giveth life to all that come to him, and who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the new and everlaſting Covenant with all that hear his voice, take up his Croſs and follow him; he is without doubt one of Chriſts Sheep, whom the Shepherd owneth and taketh care of.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, He that is inwardly circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, with the circumciſion made without hands, he is a Jew inward, a Chriſtian inward (in the ſight of God) who hath felt the Spirit and power of Chriſt Jeſus, and rejoyceth in Chriſt Jeſus, and is one of thoſe Worſhippers, whom God hath ſought out and taught to Worſhip him, in the life and ſpirit of his Son.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, He that is inwardly waſhed with the clean water, with the inward water; he is the inward Jew, the inward Chriſtian. God promiſed to pour out clean water upon his <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and they ſhould be clean. He who hath the clean water poured upon him inwardly, which inwardly waſheth and cleanſeth, he is without controverſie of Gods inward <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, He that feeds on the Bread of life within, and drinks the water of life out of his own Well or Ciſtern, he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:101579:31"/>
doubt is living. He that is invited to the Marriage-Supper of the Lamb, and comes and Sups with the Lamb, he is one of the ſame nature and ſpirit with him. He with whom Chriſt Sups, who hath heard Chriſt knocking at his door, hath opened to him and received him in, to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie his heart and dwell in him, and Sup with him, and to give him to Sup with himſelf; ſo that he eats Bread in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and drinks Wine in the Kingdom, and partakes of the Feaſt of fat things, which God makes to his <hi>Iſrael</hi> in his holy Mountain: he is without doubt one of Chriſts, and partakes of this in and through him.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, He that lives the Chriſtian life, who walks not after the Fleſh, but after the ſpirit, who doth not fulfill the luſts of the Fleſh, but hath the law of God writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in his heart, and his fear put within him, and his holy Spirit given to inſtruct him, and to guide him to anſwer the holy law written in his heart, which the carnal mind is not ſubject, nor can be ſubject to; without doubt he is ſpiritual, without doubt he is a true Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, He that lives by faith, who knows the faith which is the gift of God, hath received it and lives by it, who can
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:101579:31"/>
do nothing of himſelf, but only by faith in that holy power which doth all in him: ſo that he lives, and believes, and obeys from an holy Root of life, which cauſeth life to ſpring up in him, and love to ſpring up in him, and the Lambs meekneſs and patience to ſpring up in him, and all grace to ſpring up in him; I ſay, he that lives thus, without doubt is engraffed into the true Vine, into the true Olive-tree, and the Root bears him, and Miniſters ſap unto him, and he is a true, freſh, green, living branch of the true Vine of the holy Olive-Tree.</p>
               <p>Many more things might be mentioned, as they are experimentally known and felt amongſt us who are true Chriſtians, though the Baptiſts and others have repreſented us to the world, as if we were no Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, but that toucheth us not, their ſaying ſo, is no more to us than the profeſſing Jews of the ſame Spirit, who ſaid Chriſt had a Devil; but theſe are to give a Taſt. And he that knows and feels theſe, may alſo know and feel the reſt: and he that doth not know nor feel theſe, would not know or feel the reſt, if never ſo many more ſhould be mentioned. Now the way to feel theſe, and to become a true Chriſtian (and to grow up in the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:101579:32"/>
life) is to feel the Seed of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which is the beginning of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the beginning of true Chriſtianity: and then to feel the Seed abiding (the Seed which is of the Spirit, and which is Spirit) here's the conſtant Seal of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity in my heart; here are true and certain evidences, day by day, of the Chriſtian nature and Spirit, manifeſting themſelves undeniably inwardly. And now, having the witneſs in my ſelf, the Teſtimony of him that begat life in me, teſtifying to his own work, and to his own Birth: of what value are any Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of men without againſt this? Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity is a myſtery: and he only can tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee, who is a Chriſtian indeed, who hath the inward eye opened, and with that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward eye, is taught of God to peirce into that, wherein Chriſtianity conſiſteth. There have been many Chriſtians of mens making: there are alſo ſome Chriſtians of God and Chriſts making, which Chriſtians God and Chriſt will own; but not the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. O let men have a care, that when God cometh to diſtinguiſh between Cattle and Cattle (between Chriſtian and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian) they be found ſuch as God will make up as his Jewels, and own as the Sheep of his fold, ſuch as ſhall be able to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:101579:32"/>
bear the Tryal of his ſearching judgment, and pure impartial eye; and not ſuch as ſtill, notwithſtanding all their profeſſion of Religion and Chriſtianity, are found workers of iniquity, and ſo not created anew in Chriſt Jeſus unto good works, and therefore not truly of him, nor true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in his eye.</p>
