            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I have endeavor'd to write without Heat and Partiality; nor was there any need of aggravating a Crime that is ſo black in its own nature, and ſo apt to poſſeſs the calmeſt Mind with a Juſt Abhorrence and Indignation. But, above all, I have been ſcrupulouſly careful to mention nothing but what is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon Authentic Teſtimonies.</p>
            <p>To give the Reader a juſt Idea of the Conſpiracy, 'twou'd be neceſſary in the Firſt place to acquaint him with the importance of his Majeſty's Life; if it were not unreaſonable to ſuppoſe that any Perſon can be ſo much a ſtranger to the Tranſactions of the Age he lives in, as to be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the intereſt which the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Europe</hi> have in the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Sacred Life. 'Twas on him that <hi>Spain</hi> founded the firſt hopes ſhe had the courage to entertain, of ſeeing a happy turn of her declining Fortune. 'Tis to him, next to the bleſſing of Heaven, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> owe the ſafety of their State, and the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> their Laws, Religion and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The Former entruſted him with the management of all their concerns,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49849:4"/>
and the Latter made him their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign to ſecure their own Happineſs, and to prevent a return of thoſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries from which he had deliver'd 'em. The Allies, in general, combin'd together to erect a kind of Empire for him in the preſent Confederacy; being ſenſible that they cou'd not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themſelves without his Aſſiſtance, and that they might, without any Jealouſy or Apprehenſion, rely upon his Integrity and Vertue. And, which is yet a brighter and more ſurprizing part of his Character, 'tis certain that none of all theſe Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors which he enjoys, coſt him the trouble of Asking. The great and important Services, which the World had either receiv'd, or might expect to receive from him, were the only Solicitations he us'd to obtain theſe glorious advantages. This is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Circumſtance of his Life, which ſhall be particularly conſider'd in this place, becauſe 'tis This that will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute moſt to give light to the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Hiſtory, and This alone which Malice or Envy durſt ever preſume to con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s arrival in <hi>England</hi> fill'd the World with an impatient expectation of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching Criſis that was to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Fate of <hi>Europe.</hi> Every Man was an attentive Spectator of a Revolution in which All were ſo nearly concern'd; and none but ſuch who are uncapable of regarding the public Intereſt, can be ſuppos'd to be unacquainted with the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of ſo important a Tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And therefore, inſtead of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining the Reader with a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar account of his preſent Majeſty's Proceedings on that occaſion, I ſhall content my ſelf with obſerving in the general; that 'twas his firſt and principal deſire, that a Parliament might be call'd to ſettle the affairs of the Nation; That, to ſecure that great Aſſembly from the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of any diſturbance or conſtraint, he offer'd to retire Threeſcore Miles from the Capital City, provided King <hi>James</hi>'s Army wou'd withdraw

'Tis plain that an Action of this Nature may be either cenſur'd or commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded according to the Principle from which we derive it, and that the Judgment we give in ſuch Caſes depends on the Intention we aſcribe to the Actor; and conſequently there is nothing but Prejudice and Ill na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that can hinder us from acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſcing in the Juſtice of his Majeſty's Proceedings.</p>

How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, 'tis certain that all the ſpite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Reproaches which are levell'd againſt his Majeſty for accepting the Crown, rebound with greater force upon the Nation that preſented it to him; and that thoſe who are poſſeſs'd with ſo Brutiſh a Fury, as to imagine that he may be Aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated without a Crime, becauſe he ſuffer'd our Repreſentatives to place him upon the Throne, do at the ſame time pronounce a bloody Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence againſt the Parliament, and condemn the whole Kingdom to Havock and Deſolation.

'Twill perhaps be expected, that I ſhou'd take this occaſion to attempt that Prince's Character; but I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, I have not courage enough to venture upon ſo nice a Task. For 'tis certain that, in ſuch a caſe, the moſt ſcrupulous Caution can hardly preſerve an Author from tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the narrow Limits that are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd to him, by the reſpect which is due to thoſe, whoſe Honour, as well as their Lives, ought to be Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49849:10"/>
even to their Enemies. Few are capable of managing a Subject of this Nature with a tender and wary Hand; and even the modeſteſt Performances in this kind are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to the unjuſt Cenſures of a byaſs'd Reader. And therefore, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of aſſuming the Liberty to ſpeak of his Perſon, I ſhall content my ſelf with making ſome Reflexions upon the Proceedings of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, which I cou'd not omit without rendering my Work obſcure and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective.</p>
            <p>'Twas the Opinion of every judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Perſon, who obſerv'd their Maxims and Conduct, that, even from the beginning, they gave the World too plain a view of their Deſigns, and proceeded with too haſty an eagerneſs in the Execution of 'em.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">In this account I have neither magnify'd nor multiply'd the Diſorders that were committed by the Government. They were either corrected by the Late King himſelf, upon the News of the Prince's Expedition, or after his Flight, by the Convention. The Laws that were made upon that occaſion by the Parliaments of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> are undoubted Teſtimonies of the ſeveral Attempts that were made to ſubvert our Laws and Religion; nor will any reaſonable Perſon expect any other Arguments to prove the Truth of a matter of Fact of which all the Inhabitants of theſe Nations were either Eye or Ear-Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes.</note> Here, under their wonted pretext of diſpenſing with the Laws, they
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49849:11"/>
eſtabliſh'd an Eccleſiaſtical Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that was equally terrible to the Church and to the State. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporations were diſpoſſeſs'd of their Charters, the Council was fill'd with Roman-Catholics, and the Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were depriv'd of their Privileges. The Temporal Lords were oblig'd either to quit their Places or renounce their Religion, the Biſhops were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon'd, and an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army was brought into the Kingdom in time of Peace.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Scotland,</hi> they were ſo far from obſerving any meaſures, that they look'd upon it as too mean a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion to preſerve the leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard for the Laws. They perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the King to aſſume a Deſpotic Power, and taught him to uſe a Language which till then was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the Free-born People of <hi>Great Britain;</hi> for they had the confidence to make him declare that,<note place="margin">See his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd in that Kingdom.</note> by virtue of his <hi>Soveraign Authority</hi> and <hi>Abſolute Power,</hi> he abrogated the Acts of Parliament that were made againſt the Roman<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Catholics.</p>
            <p>The unſucceſsfulneſs of the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt was a convincing Argument
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49849:11"/>
of the temerity of the Project, but cou'd not oblige its Contrivers to alter their meaſures, as it appears by their Conduct in <hi>Ireland;</hi> for the Promiſes that were made in King <hi>James</hi>'s Name to the Proteſtant In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of that Kingdom, both before and after his arrival among 'em, cou'd not protect 'em from the barefac'd violence of their Tyrannical Oppreſſors.</p>
            <p>Their Effects, Cattle, Wool, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and Merchandizes, were ſeiz'd and employ'd in the maintaining of a War againſt their Friends in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> Their Lands were laid waſte, their Houſes pillag'd, and the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices beſtow'd on their ancient and moſt implacable Enemies the Prieſts. The <hi>Act of Settlement,</hi> which was the only ſecurity they cou'd depend upon, was violated, and the Roman Catholics were authoriz'd by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to take Poſſeſſion of their Eſtates. Both the Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and thoſe who profeſs'd it were in a manner proſcrib'd, and expos'd as a Prey to thoſe who were equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prompted by intereſt and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to deſtroy 'em. The People
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49849:12"/>
were perſecuted and murder'd by their domineering Enemies, who were rather encourag'd than puniſh'd for their Barbarity. They were forc'd to reſign their Churches, and were even deny'd the liberty of meeting together to perform their Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. At laſt all the Proteſtants in <hi>Dublin</hi> were ſecur'd; and when the Priſons were full, the Churches were turn'd to Goals. Theſe diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders are particularly deſcrib'd by<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>King,</hi> the preſent Biſhop of <hi>London-der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> then Dean of <hi>Dublin,</hi> in his Book entitul'd, <hi>The State of the Proteſtants of</hi> Ireland <hi>under the Government of the late King.</hi> The whole Book is full of Inſtances of this Nature, of which I have not mention'd the Twentieth part.</note> a Biſhop of that Country, who had the misfortune to be a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Sharer in the common Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity.</p>
            <p>The King was ſo ſenſibly touch'd with the deplorable Condition of <hi>Ireland,</hi> that he reſolv'd to go thither in Perſon, tho' he plac'd an entire confidence in the<note n="*" place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Schomberg.</hi>
               </note> Perſon whom he had entruſted with the command of his Forces: And that generous Undertaking was ſo viſibly attended with the Bleſſing of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that in the ſpace of Three Months he reduc'd Two Third parts

of the Kingdom, and gave his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies a Fatal blow which broke all their Meaſures, and ruin'd their unjuſt Hopes. 'Twas by the wiſe Direction of that Providence which had ſo often deliver'd him from the Hands of bloody Traitors, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd a Life that was to be expos'd to more honorable Dangers, that the Wound he receiv'd at the <hi>Boyn</hi> gave occaſion to a falſe Report of his Death, which occaſion'd as pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic a joy in <hi>France,</hi> as the true ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his Victories did in This, and all the other Nations of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Parliament thank'd him for expoſing that Life to the greateſt Dangers, on which the Fate of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, and the common Liberty of all <hi>Europe</hi> depended: And the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Change that appear'd every where in the public Affairs on that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, is a more than ſufficient Ground to vindicate that Illuſtrious Body from the Imputation of Flattery. People were ſurpriz'd to find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſafer in the midſt of a bloody War, than they were in time of Peace: The <hi>Switzers</hi> were no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49849:13"/>
apprehenſive of their incroaching Neighbour: The <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion was preſerv'd without any prejudice to the <hi>Roman-Catholics:</hi> The Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces<note place="margin">1690.</note> and States upon the <hi>Rhine</hi> were either ſecur'd from Danger, or in a condition to defend themſelves: An effectual ſtop was put to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions and Conqueſts of the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of <hi>Metz</hi> and <hi>Briſac;</hi> the Electo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates of <hi>Mentz</hi> and <hi>Cologn</hi> were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conquer'd; and a King of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> was choſen according to the Inclination and Intereſt of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Empire. Three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms were deliver'd from Oppreſſion, and rais'd to their wonted Glory of protecting their diſtreſſed Neighbors. The <hi>Netherlands</hi> had the ſatisfaction to obey a Governor whom they had long and ardently deſir'd, but cou'd never obtain till now. The Branches of the Houſes of <hi>Auſtria</hi> were happily re-united to one another, and to thoſe whoſe Intereſt 'twas to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port 'em. <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd at laſt to purſue their mutual Intereſt, and to cheriſh an Union which is abſolutely neceſſary to their I reſervation. <hi>France</hi> had the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49849:13"/>
to ſee her ſelf exhauſted by the prodigious efforts ſhe was oblig'd to make; as the reſt of the World had the ſatisfaction to perceive that ere long ſhe wou'd either be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd within her ancient Limits by our Arms, or ruin'd by her own dear-bought Victories.</p>
            <p>Theſe were the Glorious conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of his Majeſty's Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the Throne of <hi>England:</hi> Every Nation was ſenſible of its par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Obligations, and the Eyes of all the World were fix'd upon their Great Benefactor. Even We, who ow'd all the Happineſs we poſſeſs'd, or cou'd hope to enjoy, to his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Aſſiſtance, and whom he had lately deliver'd from the greateſt danger that ever threaten'd a Nation, cou'd hardly out-do the reſt of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> in expreſſing our Gratitude and Affection. For, after he had receiv'd the Bleſſings and Applauſes of his Subjects, when the managing of the Public Intereſt requir'd his Preſence at the <hi>Hague,</hi> he was attended by a Court of Soveraigns, who ſeem'd to come thither on purpoſe to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49849:14"/>
him with the Compliments and Acknowledgments of <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But while ſo many Illuſtrious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were endeavouring with a kind of Emulation to expreſs their Eſteem for his Perſon, and the confidence they plac'd in his Vertue; and while he was receiving the Teſtimonies of their Reſpect and Affections with a Modeſty that ſecur'd him from Envy in the midſt of his Triumphs; there was a deſign ſet on Foot to rob the World of its Hope and Delight, by ſuch Ways and Means as are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rarely ſuſpected or foreſeen by Perſons of his Courage and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
            <p>'Twas about this time that a <hi>French</hi> Miniſter of State, whoſe Name makes an inglorious Figure in <hi>Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val</hi>'s<note place="margin">1691.</note> Examination, engag'd one <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> to Aſſaſſinate his Majeſty. I dare not charge that Miniſter with the firſt contrivance of ſo deteſtable a Project; ſince we have ſo much reaſon to believe that he acted on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in purſuance of the Inſtructions he had receiv'd from thoſe whom he thought himſelf oblig'd to obey. 'Tis not without Reluctancy that I
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:49849:14"/>
enter upon a Subject, which carries Horror in its Idea, and is ſo incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the common Principles of Humanity, that the matter of Fact wou'd appear incredible if it were not confirm'd by unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Evidence. Murder in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, without the aggravating cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of Aſſaſſinating a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, is equally accompany'd with Guilt and Shame; and even the moſt harden'd Aſſaſſins are oftentimes ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the Infamy that attends their Crime. 'Tis impoſſible to imagine a Provocation ſtrong enough to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe either the Committing or Encouraging of ſo barbarous an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; nor wou'd a Man of Honor be tempted to execute his juſt Revenge by ſo diſhonorable a Way. Such unmanly Reſentments as theſe are peculiar to thoſe mean and degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Souls, whoſe Merit conſiſts in Baſeneſs and Envy, and who are only able to defend themſelves by Villany and Treaſon.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſing that the <hi>French</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters neither were, nor car'd to be reputed, Men of Honor; they ought never to have form'd a Deſign, which

            <p>Beſides, what cou'd be more inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to the boaſted Glory of <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV. than that his own Miniſters ſhou'd contrive a Project which cou'd not be executed without fiixng ſo black a ſcandal either upon his Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue or Dignity; for he cou'd not decline condemning it without ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring himſelf eternally infamous, nor afterwards ſuffer it to be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted without proclaiming to all the World that he was not Maſter
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49849:15"/>
in his own Dominions. At leaſt, it might have been expected that the Project wou'd have expir'd with its Author, and that the ſucceeding Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters wou'd be either afraid or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham'd to purſue a Deſign that left ſuch a Blot upon the Memory of its Contriver. Yet the Reader will find that it was carry'd on after his Death; and, I ſhall have occaſion to give a particular account of its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs and Succeſs, after I have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken a Succinct view of the intended Invaſion.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as the <hi>Roman-Catholics</hi> in this Kingdom perceiv'd that there was a Party form'd in <hi>Ireland</hi> who had openly declar'd for the late King; they began to carry on the ſame deſign here, in ſecret Cabals, tho' with little appearance of Succeſs: For the ſmallneſs of their Numbers ſecur'd us from open violence; and the Senſe of our Duty and Intereſt kept us from being deluded by their Artifices. They cou'd neither have ſo mean an Opinion of our Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage nor Judgment, as to imagine that we wou'd voluntarily ſubmit to an impotent and implacable Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49849:16"/>
or that a few canting Sophiſms wou'd prevail with us to neglect Self-preſervation.</p>
            <p>And therefore, ſince they cou'd never expect to be Maſters, they ought to have contented themſelves with the quality and condition of Subjects. They might have conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd to enjoy whatever they cou'd juſtly call their own, under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of a Mild and eaſy Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that allow'd 'em all the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty they cou'd deſire, except that of ſubverting the Laws, and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Country and Fellow-Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. But their Minds were ſtill poſſeſs'd with the Remembrance of thoſe aſpiring Hopes that were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated by the Revolution; and their Ambition was rather enflam'd than allay'd by ſo unexpected a Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment. Beſides, they thought themſelves oblig'd to ſupport a Prince who had ſacrific'd his Crown to their Advancement; and fancy'd that notwithſtanding their preſent Weakneſs, they might eaſily make good their pretenſions by the aſſiſtance of their <hi>French</hi> Protectors. Theſe were the Motives that engag'd 'em in a
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:49849:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Deſign which cou'd not be carry'd on without diſturbing their own Quiet as well as that of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and made 'em reſolve to ſhut their Eyes againſt the viſible Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to which they expos'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by venturing upon ſo hazardous an Attempt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>'Twas on the 18 of</hi> October <hi>1689. that a Miniſter of State receiv'd a Letter from the Aſſizes, held by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journment at</hi> Mancheſter, <hi>by which he was intreated to advertiſe the Council,</hi> That many of the Roman-Catholic Younger Gentry, ſome of good Quality, were abſconded for ſome Months, that to ſome of the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men now abſconded there had been ſent from <hi>London</hi> ſeveral Boxes with Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let Cloaks, Piſtols and Swords, directed for ſafer conveyance to Proteſtants, who knew nothing of them, and by that means diſcover'd. That ſome had been Modelling Officers and Men pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory to their hope of an Invaſion or Inſurrection, that tho' the Goals were full of <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts, yet many were entertain'd at Popiſh Houſes, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Correſpondence which the late King entertain'd with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49849:17"/>
in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> was manag'd by one <hi>Bromefield</hi> a Quaker, who liv'd at <hi>Redland</hi> near <hi>Cheſter,</hi> in the Houſe of one <hi>Wilſon,</hi> who was acquainted with, and engag'd in the Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. But perceiving that they began to be taken notice of, and not da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to continue longer in a place where they were look'd upon as ſuſpicious Perſons, the Firſt fled to <hi>Ireland</hi> and the Second to <hi>Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After them, the management of the Intrigue was committed to <hi>Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, Lunt,</hi> and <hi>Thrilfall,</hi> who came from <hi>Ireland</hi> with Declarations and Commiſſions from King <hi>James</hi> to the <hi>Roman-Catholics</hi> in ſeveral Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>England.</hi> They landed in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> where they open'd their Commiſſions, by which <hi>Gordon</hi> was appointed to go to <hi>Scotland, Thril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall</hi> to <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> and <hi>Lunt</hi> to <hi>Staf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordſhire, Cheſhire</hi> and <hi>Lancaſhire.</hi> In purſuance of theſe Orders they parted, and went immediately to the reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Places that were allotted 'em, where they executed their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions, tho' with different Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:49849:17"/>
               <hi>Thrilfall</hi> had already finiſh'd his Negotiation in <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> and was returning thro' <hi>Cheſhire</hi> to <hi>Ireland,</hi> when he was purſu'd upon Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, and kill'd as he was endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to defend himſelf. <hi>Lunt</hi> having perform'd his Commiſſion, was ſent to <hi>London,</hi> to levy Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, to be deſtributed among the Conſpirators in the North. In his return from thence, after he had Executed his Orders, he was Seiz'd at <hi>Coventry,</hi> by one of the Kings Meſſengers, brought back to <hi>London,</hi> and Committed to <hi>Newgate.</hi> Five Months after he was ſet at Liberty; having given Bail to appear next Hillary Term, at the <hi>King's Bench,</hi> from whence he was ſent to be Try'd, at the Aſſizes in <hi>Lancaſhire.</hi> He was Committed for High-Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to the Caſtle of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Evidence of the Maſter of the Ship, who brought him over from <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Officers of the Cuſtom-houſe, who found ſome of King <hi>James</hi>'s Commiſſions among the Papers which he left in the Veſſel.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:49849:18"/>
But theſe were not the moſt Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Witneſſes, that were like to appear againſt him: For about that time, the Conſpiracy was diſcover'd, by two ſeveral Perſons. The firſt was <hi>Kelly,</hi> who declar'd what he knew, to the Mayor of <hi>Everſham,</hi> in <hi>Worceſterſhire;</hi> the Earl of <hi>Bella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> and ſome Perſons of Quality, in that Country, who Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Diſcovery to the Council. But tho' his Depoſition remain'd in the Hands of the Government, his Perſon diſappear'd ſo ſuddenly, and in ſo ſtrange a manner, that we cou'd never afterwards hear an account of him. His Fate continues a Myſtery to this day; but, whether he was kill'd or carry'd away, 'tis certain that the Conſpirators from that very time began to reſume their Courage, which was extremely ſunk upon the News of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dodſworth</hi> was the Second who alarm'd the Party, by diſcovering the Conſpiracy to a Member of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, who ſent an account of it to one of the Secretaries of State, by whoſe Order the Informer was
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:49849:18"/>
brought from <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> to <hi>London:</hi> And 'twas found that his Depoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on agreed exactly with that of <hi>Kelly,</hi> tho' they were at a hundred Miles diſtance when they were exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dodſworth</hi> was ſent to the Caſtle of <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> to joyn his Evidence to the Teſtimony of the other Witneſſes that were to appear againſt <hi>Lunt,</hi> who, nevertheleſs, cou'd not be convicted according to the uſual Forms of Law. For, when he was brought to his Tryal, the Maſter of the Ship, who brought him from <hi>Ireland,</hi> either was, or pretended to be ſick: And the Officers of the Cuſtom-houſe cou'd not ſwear that the Papers which were produc'd in the Court were the ſame which they found in the Ship, becauſe they had forgotten to mark 'em. Thus the whole Evidence being reduc'd to the ſingle Teſtimony of <hi>Dodſworth, Lunt,</hi> tho' apparently Guilty, was acquitted; and both the Court and Jury choſe rather to abſolve a Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal, than to violate the leaſt Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of the Law.

               <hi>Lunt,</hi> by his Services and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, had ſo far inſinuated himſelf into the Favor and Confidence of his Party, that, in a Meeting of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobites at <hi>Standiſh-Hall</hi> in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> he was choſen to go to <hi>France,</hi> to acquaint King <hi>James</hi> with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent poſture of his affairs here, and to know what Aſſiſtance might be expected from him.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">December 1691.</note> The Anſwer he brought was, that the late King was preparing to come in Perſon to <hi>England</hi> the next Spring; and that in the mean time, he wou'd ſend 'em his laſt Inſtructions by a ſure<note place="margin">Febr 1691/2.</note> and faithful Hand. Not long after <hi>Walmuly</hi> and <hi>Parker</hi> came to <hi>England</hi> by that Prince's Order, and appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:49849:19"/>
a Meeting of the principal Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of their Faction at <hi>Dungen-Hall,</hi> where they deliver'd the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Preſents they had brought from <hi>France;</hi> and at the ſame time aſſur'd 'em that King <hi>James</hi> wou'd ſpeedily land in <hi>England</hi> with a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Force to ſupport 'em.</p>
            <p>In the mean they were putting all things in readineſs, at <hi>la Hogue,</hi> for the intended Expedition: The Preparations they made were very<note place="margin">April 1692.</note> great, and the Meaſures they had taken ſeem'd to promiſe Succeſs, as it will appear by the following ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of 'em.</p>
            <p>By the Articles that were agreed upon at the ſurrender of <hi>Limerick,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> had cunningly reſerv'd a Liberty to retain a very conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Body of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Forces in their Service, whom they deſign'd, upon the firſt convenient occaſion, to ſend over to <hi>England.</hi> Theſe Troops con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of ſuch as were moſt deeply engag'd in the routed Party, and long'd for a Second War to make up the Loſſes they had ſuſtain'd in the Firſt. They were rather irritated then diſcourag'd by their late Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:49849:20"/>
and ſo unaccuſtom'd to Labor, that the love of Idleneſs joyn'd to the deſire of Booty had made 'em forſake their native Country. Beſides, they look'd upon our Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs with Envy and Rage, and cou'd not endure to be Subject to thoſe whom they once hop'd to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave. Such Men as theſe were the fitteſt to be employ'd in a Deſign of this Nature, and, in all probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity wou'd have prov'd the moſt effectual Inſtruments of our Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, if they cou'd have found an opportunity to join the Diſaffected Party among us.</p>
            <p>There were Three ſorts of Perſons in this Nation, whom we might juſtly look upon as Domeſtic Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Firſt the zealous and bigot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Roman-Catholics,</hi> or rather all <hi>Roman-Catholics</hi> in general; for tho' ſome of 'em appear'd more cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and moderate than the Reſt, 'twas the general opinion of the Party that all the Papiſts in <hi>England</hi> wou'd take up Arms on that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The Second Order of <hi>Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites</hi> conſiſted of the late King's Servants, who ow'd their Fortune
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:49849:20"/>
and Preferment to his Favor: And the Third comprehends thoſe whoſe Intereſt and Safety depended upon the Subverſion of the Laws; Men of turbulent Spirits and deſperate For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, who hop'd to raiſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon the Ruins of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
            <p>Such Perſons as theſe are at once our Plague and our Reproach, but the Breed is not peculiar to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> for every Nation has its ſhare in the common Calamity, and has the misfortune to produce a Set of Men who ſeem to be in Love with Diſorder, and are never more apt to appear in their native and hideous Colours, than when they are prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the Indulgency of the Laws and the Clemency of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and meet with an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to cover their pernicious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns with a falſe pretext of Duty and Allegiance. They are perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally talking of Fidelity and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and ſeem to make Loyalty their Idol; tho' they are uſually the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Promoters of Rebellion, and ſeldom or never well affected to the Government under which they live.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:49849:21"/>
Plotting is their Buſineſs and Recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; they love Confuſion and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to live by it, and are ready to joyn with every Faction upon the cheapeſt Terms that can be propos'd. When there is no preſent Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in view, they work for Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation; Plunder is all the Pay they require, and their Proſperity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the Deſolation of their Country.</p>
            <p>Beſides, the <hi>French</hi> were prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to land a conſiderable Body of Forces in this Kingdom, to ſupport the diſaffected Party: For the Court of St. <hi>Germans</hi> repented that they had formerly plac'd too much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in an Army of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men, who lov'd their Country and their Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>'Twas the general opinion of the Party,</hi> that the placing of too much Confidence in Subjects who were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of it, depriv'd King <hi>James</hi> of the aſſiſtance he might have expected from others. They remember'd the advice of ſome of his Councellors, who,<note place="margin">Hiſtory of the Revolutions in <hi>England,</hi> Book II.</note> looking upon his Army as the Nerves and ſupport of his Undertakings, and the only Way to ſecure him againſt the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:49849:21"/>
obſtinacy of thoſe whom neither the lawfulneſs of his Authority, nor his Moderation in uſing it cou'd retain in Obedience to the Government, wou'd have perſwaded him to entertain a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient number of Catholics in his Army to keep the reſt in awe, and to put it out of their Power to betray him; and were of opinion that both theſe Effects might have been produc'd by joining the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Troops to ſuch of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> and <hi>Scotch</hi> as were Remarkable for their Fidelity to his Intereſt. <hi>Thus</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hiſtory of the Revolutions in <hi>England,</hi> Book II. p. <hi>428.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>we may eaſily perceive, by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions they made on their former Conduct, what Meaſures they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to take for the future.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They concluded that an Army of <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Iriſh,</hi> with ſome preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Proteſtants who regarded nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their Country nor Religion, wou'd never ſhow King <hi>James</hi> a Copy of his <hi>Salisbury</hi> Expedition; and that with ſuch Forces as theſe they might make an entire Conqueſt of <hi>England</hi> as ſoon as they ſhou'd think fit to undertake it.</p>
            <p>In purſuance of that deſign the <hi>French</hi> labor'd with great application to encreaſe their Naval Strength;
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:49849:22"/>
ping that, if they cou'd corrupt the Officers of our Fleet, or be in a readineſs to put to Sea before the <hi>Dutch</hi> Men of War cou'd join Ours, they might eaſily find an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to fight us with advantage, and afterwards Land their Soldiers with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Oppoſition.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, to oblige us to ſend our Land Forces to <hi>Flanders,</hi> and at the ſame time to hinder our Allies from aſſiſting us, the <hi>French</hi> King appear'd at the Head of his nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Armies, as if he had reſolv'd, in one Campaign, to conquer a Country, which for Sixty Years had been both the Seat, and Cauſe of the War. He intended to invade <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> if our Army continu'd in the <hi>Netherlands;</hi> or to make himſelf Maſter of thoſe Provinces, if we ſhou'd be oblig'd to recall our Forces. But the Principal Deſign of all the vaſt Preparations he had made, was to keep this Nation embroil'd in a Civil War, till he had broken the Confederacy, that he might fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us with his united Forces, and by ſubduing <hi>England</hi> put himſelf in a condition to conquer all the reſt of <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:49849:22"/>
But tho the Conſpirators expected a conſiderable Reinforcement from <hi>France,</hi> and a powerful diverſion in <hi>Flanders;</hi> tho they were ſure of the Aſſiſtance of ſo many falſe Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, and (as they imagin'd) of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Officers in our Navy; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all theſe Advantages, they look'd upon His Majeſty's Life as an invincible Obſtacle to the Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of their Deſigns, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair'd of ſucceeding in their Attempt againſt us, while we enjoy'd the Protection of our Great Deliverer.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1692.</note> They dreaded his Power, Forces and Alliances; but were more afraid of his ſingle Perſon, than of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſtrength of the whole Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy. They had oftentimes had the unwelcome experience of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, Reſolution, and unweary'd Application; and knew, to their ſorrow and coſt, that his Courage was never ſhock'd by the moſt terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Dangers; that upon a preſſing Exigency he cou'd brave a thouſand Deaths, and cut his way through the moſt vigorous Oppoſition; that when the poſture of his Affairs requir'd more Prudence than Valor, he cou'd
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:49849:23"/>
proceed with all the Coolneſs and Policy of the warieſt Stateſman; that he was peculiarly happy in baf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling the Deſigns of his Enemies, and in turning even their moſt ſucceſsful Contrivances againſt themſelves; that he was equally unmov'd in Good and Bad Fortune, that he was never ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable either of Vanity or Fear, and cou'd only be overcome by Himſelf. Theſe Conſiderations made his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies reſolve to take away a Life that ſecur'd <hi>Europe,</hi> and <hi>England</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, from the utmoſt Efforts both of their Policy and Force: And in purſuance of this execrable Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution they engag'd ſome deſperate Villains to Murder him. But God ſaw, and blaſted their dark Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, and deliver'd Him whom He had made the Deliverer of ſo many Nations.</p>

               <hi>The Aſſaſſins were taken near</hi> Boſleduc; <hi>and by their Examination it appears,</hi> That <hi>Dumont</hi> and <hi>Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val</hi> were ſolicited to undertake the Aſſaſſination of the King. That the Deſign having miſcarry'd in <hi>1691.</hi> was reſum'd the next year. That one <hi>Leefdael,</hi> formerly Captain Lieutenant
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:49849:23"/>
of a Troop of Dragoons in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the States, coming to <hi>Paris, Grandval</hi> communicated the Deſign to him, and deſir'd him to be concern'd in it, with <hi>Dumont</hi> and himſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he thought <hi>Dumont</hi> wou'd not be able to execute it alone. That <hi>Grandval</hi> went with <hi>Leefdael</hi> and Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Parker</hi> to St. <hi>Germains,</hi> and that King <hi>James</hi> ſaid to him, <hi>Parker has acquainted me with your buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; If you and the other Officers do me this Service, you ſhall never want any thing.</hi> That upon this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, a "Letter was ſent to <hi>Dumont</hi> who was then at <hi>Hanover,</hi> deſiring him to meet <hi>Grandval</hi> and <hi>Leefdael</hi> in the Country of <hi>Raveſtein,</hi> where they were to take their laſt Reſolutions, and entreating him to haſten his departure, leaſt the King, in the mean time, ſhou'd return to <hi>England.</hi> That <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> was to lye in wait, and to kill His Majeſty as he paſs'd the Lines, or went to viſit the Poſts at the decam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the Army. That <hi>Grandval</hi> told <hi>Leefdael,</hi> upon the Road, that if their Deſign ſucceeded, the Confederacy wou'd be broken, that every P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>nce wou'd recall his Forces, that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:49849:24"/>
being left without defence, the <hi>French</hi> King wou'd ſoon make himſelf Maſter of it, and that King <hi>James</hi> wou'd be reſtor'd to his Throne.</p>
            <p>To keep <hi>Leefdael</hi> from being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd by the Difficulties and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards to which the proſecution of their Deſign might expoſe 'em, he told him that they were only to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the King, that <hi>Dumont</hi> was to give the Blow, and that after the buſineſs was done they might eaſily make their eſcape and leave <hi>Dumont</hi> to take his Fortune.</p>
            <p>But both <hi>Dumont</hi> and <hi>Leefdael</hi> repented their Engaging in ſo black a Villany, and diſcover'd what they knew of it almoſt at the ſame time; the one to a Prince in <hi>Germany,</hi> who was his Majeſty's particular Friend, and the other to ſome Magiſtrates in <hi>Holland</hi> who had a ſincere affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the Perſon and Intereſt of that Monarch.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1692.</note> 
               <hi>Grandval</hi> was taken and receiv'd the juſt Reward of his Crimes, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had made a full Confeſſion without being put to the Torture. He ſeem'd to be very penitent, and declar'd with ſome reſentment at
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:49849:24"/>
his Death, that he was ruin'd by the Authors of that deteſtable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
            <p>There was a Detachment made from the Duke of <hi>Luxemburg</hi>'s Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, conſiſting of Three Thouſand Horſe, who were to be Poſted at the Advanc'd Guard to receive the Murderers. This is a Circumſtance that ought not to be forgotten; for 'tis plain they took this way that the Aſſaſſination might be look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as a Stratagem of War: And 'tis probable that either it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd at firſt as an Attempt to carry away the King, or that they reſolv'd, after the Blow was given, to make it paſs under that Notion.</p>
            <p>'Tis evident that this barbarous Deſign was the Favourite Project of the Party, ſince they continu'd to purſue it after ſo Remarkable a Diſappointment. If we examine the whole Courſe of their Proceedings ſince that time, it will appear that the Conſpiracy which was lately diſcover'd in this Kingdom, was the ſame with that in which <hi>Grandval</hi> was engag'd; and this is more than a bare Conjecture, ſince 'tis confirm'd
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:49849:25"/>
by the Depoſition of one of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators. <hi>The Conſpiracy,</hi> ſays he, <hi>hath been carrying on a great while,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Larue, <hi>in</hi> Charnock<hi>'s Tryal.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>for ſome Years. And it originally came from Colonel</hi> Parker, <hi>eſpecially as to my knowledge of it, and that was Five or Six Years ago, at St.</hi> Germains, <hi>when I was there: He propos'd it to me, and ſaid he wou'd propoſe it to my Lord</hi> Melford, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>We have already obſerv'd that the Aſſaſſination of his Majeſty was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd and reſolv'd upon, in order to the Invaſion of his Subjects; and we have reaſon to believe that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of God, in preſerving his Life, was to make him once more our Deliverer: For 'twas He alone who oppos'd our impending Ruine, and and baffl'd the Deſigns of our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
            <p>He prevented the Loſs of the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands,</hi> by wiſe Delays; and took ſuch Meaſures as might one Day put him in a Condition to Recover what he cou'd not then Preſerve.</p>
            <p>He haſten'd the Sailing of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet, and fitted out his own with ſuch diligence and expedition, that, notwithſtanding the utmoſt
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:49849:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Efforts the <hi>French</hi> cou'd make to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent us, they were oblig'd to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with Two Fleets, when they expected only to have met with One.</p>
            <p>When his Enemies had recourſe to their wonted Artifices, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to corrupt the Officers of his Navy, he not only defeated their Treacherous Project, but made their Stratagem Fatal to themſelves: For Admiral <hi>Carter</hi> was order'd to Treat with 'em, and amuſe 'em with a ſeeming Compliance, till they ſell into the Snare which they had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd for us.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1692.</note> He ſent the Earl of <hi>Portland</hi> with ſecret Inſtructions to the Queen, that She might not, even in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, be oblig'd to depend upon the Advice and Opinions of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Council but himſelf. In pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of theſe Orders, Warrants were iſſu'd out to apprehend ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Perſons; the Arms, Horſes and Magazines of the diſaffected Party were ſeiz'd; the Army was put into a poſture of defence; care was taken to prevent Tumults and diſorderly Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:49849:26"/>
and the Officers of the Fleet were engag'd by new obligations to continue Faithful to the Government. Theſe were the Meaſures that were taken to preſerve us, and God was pleas'd to bleſs our Induſtry, and to aſſert the juſtice of our Cauſe by a glorious and important Victory.</p>
            <p>The Fate of <hi>Europe</hi> was decided in one Day at <hi>La Hague,</hi> and every Nation had its ſhare in the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of that memorable Action. We, who were more immediately concern'd in the Danger and Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, and who had been ſo long alarm'd with the Expectation of the approaching Storm, cou'd hardly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear Trembling, even in the midſt of our Joy, when we reflected on the diſmal Alterations which we muſt have beheld if the ſucceſs had anſwer'd the Hope and Deſign of our Enemies. For, after ſuch a Victory, the <hi>French</hi> might have drawn im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe ſums from <hi>England,</hi> either as a Reimburſment for the Charge of the War, or as a Subſidy impos'd upon a ſubdu'd Nation. They might have added above a Hundred Men of War to their Fleet, and encreas'd
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:49849:26"/>
their Land-Forces with the formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Addition of Fifty Thouſand <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Men,</hi> by whoſe Aſſiſtance they might have enlarg'd their Conqueſts, while we ſhou'd have been oblig'd to entertain an Army of Enemies, to compleat the deſtruction of our Country, under pretext of ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Authority of their Allie.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Ireland</hi> the Papiſts wou'd have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted their former Barbarities, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſs'd the Proteſtants a ſecond time of their Goods and Eſtates. In <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> they wou'd have renew'd their Claim to the Church-Lands, and made us feel the ſevereſt Effects of their irritated Fury. In both the Kingdoms thoſe who had refus'd to take the Oaths to the preſent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment wou'd have been rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the Places of thoſe who had taken 'em; and the Non-Swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Clergy preferr'd to the richeſt Benefices. The Offices of State and the beſt Poſts in the Army wou'd have been beſtow'd on thoſe who had expreſt the greateſt Zeal in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaving the Nation; and the Houſe of Peers wou'd have been fill'd with the moſt notorious Betrayers of their

The Nobility, whom they had the Impudence to repreſent as a Company of Traitors and Villains, wou'd have been puniſh'd for their Fidelity to the State, and for aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their juſt Privileges with (at leaſt) the Baniſhment of their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and Confiſcation of their Eſtates; and the Repreſentatives of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Proſcrib'd for Loving and Serv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Country. To conclude, the Laws wou'd have been at the Mercy of thoſe whoſe Interetſt oblig'd 'em to violate and ſubvert Them; and none muſt have expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Preferment but ſuch as had me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited the Favour of our Enemies, by ſtriving to encreaſe our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery.</p>
            <p>Theſe Conſiderations which ſerv'd to confirm all True <hi>Engliſh-Men</hi> in their Affection and Fidelity to the Government, were ſo many powerful Incentives to its Enemies to purſue their former Deſigns. They conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd ſtill to hope that <hi>France</hi> might repair her Loſſes, and be again in a condition to aſſiſt 'em; but the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect was too diſtant to ſatisfie their eager Impatience: And therefore

they began to conſult how they might be able to deſtroy the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without the Aſſiſtance of Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners.</p>
            <p>'Tis thought the Party were not Novices in the Art of ruining their Fellow-Subjects.

Examination of the Proceedings of the Conſpirators, and the Progreſs of the Conſpiracy. I will diſcourſe of 'em in order, becauſe the Subject is both Curious and Important.</p>
            <p>About Seventeen or Eighteen Years ago, <hi>Titus Oates</hi> made a Diſcovery to the Parliament, which was variouſly cenſur'd by Perſons of different Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Inclinations. Some gave credit to it, others rejected it as a meer Fable, and there were ſome who look'd upon it as a Mixture of Truth<note place="margin">Sr. <hi>Edmund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey</hi>'s Murder, which cannot be reckon'd a Fable, is a ſtrong Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of, at leaſt, part of that Diſcovery.</note> and Fiction. I will neither pretend to juſtifie nor condemn all his Depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but content my ſelf with ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, that there are ſome things which were look'd upon as incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, by reaſon of the Enormity of the Crimes, tho later Experience has convinc'd us that they were really true; eſpecially what relates to Trade, Exportation of Species, and the Debaſement of Money.</p>
            <p>Oates <hi>acquaints us, in the Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix to his Information, Sworn before Sr.</hi> Edmundbury Godfrey, <hi>Sept. 27. 1678. That the Conſpirators cou'd not endure King</hi> Charles <hi>II. becauſe he was not of their Religion, and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:49849:28"/>
that they reſolv'd to cut him off with all poſſible Speed.</hi> That they Charg'd him with Tyranny and Deſigns of oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, Governing by the Sword, and without Parliaments, and expoſing his moſt Faithful and Valiant Subjects to be waſted and ſlain in foreign Service. <hi>2.</hi> That they aſpers'd, derided, expos'd and declaim'd againſt his Perſon, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and Actions, in Parliament and elſewhere; and particularly ſcoff'd at his ſecurity and confidence in them, and by this means animated and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd their Party and Aſſaſſins eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, to attempt upon his Life, and haſten his Ruine. <hi>3.</hi> That they diſclos'd the King's Counſels to <hi>France. 4.</hi> That they rais'd falſe News of his Affairs. <hi>5.</hi> That they diſaffected his Majeſty's Allies, <hi>Holland, Spain,</hi> the <hi>German</hi> Emperor and Princes, by falſe Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, &amp;c. <hi>6.</hi> That they diſturb'd Trade. <hi>7.</hi> That they ſet up, ſent out and maintain'd Seditious Preachers and Catechiſts, and directed 'em what to Preach in their own, or other pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Conventicles or Field-Meetings. <hi>8.</hi> That they animated different Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, one againſt another to Arm and put the People in Blood upon the King's

            <p>Thoſe who reflect upon what they ſee or hear, and conſider the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and Actions of theſe who make a noiſe in the World, may eaſily judge whether the Party has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd to purſue the ſame Methods: And therefore, without inſiſting lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger upon this Subject, I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, in the next place, to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of ſuch of their Maxims as have been diſcover'd by themſelves.</p>

               <hi>As for Parliaments, 'tis their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> That a King of <hi>England</hi>'s Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion<note place="margin">Hiſtory of the Revolutions in <hi>England,</hi> Book II. p. 357.</note> to his Parliament ſeldom pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces a good Underſtanding between 'em. <hi>And particularly they tell us, that King</hi> Charles <hi>II.</hi> was advis'd to ſtand firm againſt the Attempts of an Aſſembly that made it their uſual Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom to oppoſe and contradict him; that they wou'd ſtill be ſtarting new Claims and Demands, and wou'd at laſt raiſe 'em to ſuch a Height, that His Majeſty wou'd not be able to grant 'em, without conſenting to his own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and conſequently wou'd find himſelf to be ſtill in the ſame condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that is, after a thouſand Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſions againſt his own Intereſt, he wou'd at laſt be oblig'd to break with his Parliament, and find that his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance had encreas'd their Boldneſs, and made 'em leſs afraid to oppoſe him.</p>
            <p>They have left no means unat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to ſet theſe Stratagems on foot againſt the preſent Government, by employing all their Artifices in a ſucceſsleſs attempt to engage the King to invade the Liberty of his Subjects, or to make the People incroach
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:49849:30"/>
upon the Prerogative of the Crown. They endeavor'd to revive the ancient Jealouſies that diſturb'd the Quiet of the former Reigns; as if it had been poſſible to keep us from perceiving the difference betwixt a Deliverer and an Oppreſſor, whoſe Characters are ſo oppoſite, that they can never agree either in the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner or End of executing their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; for 'tis a neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of their reſpective Maxims, that the Former ſhou'd endeavour to Preſerve, and the Latter to Deſtroy his People. 'Tis both the Intereſt and Duty of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliament to protect the People whom they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from a Prince who treats 'em as Enemies or Slaves; but they cannot, without conſenting to their own Ruin, oppoſe a King who makes the Honor and Proſperity of the Nation the End of all his Deſigns and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings. And we have reaſon to adore the favourable Providence of God, who has freed us from the Apprehenſions of ſo terrible a Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, and eſtabliſh'd His Majeſty's Throne by the moſt perfect Union
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:49849:30"/>
that ever was obſerv'd betwixt a King and his Parliament.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe Ways to deſtroy the Nation, which they have known and practis'd ſo long, the preſent Juncture has furniſh'd 'em with new Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients. In the beginning of the War, our Trade was extremely diſturb'd by <hi>French</hi> Privateers; but ſince their Defeat at <hi>La Hogue</hi> made 'em both afraid and unable to engage our Fleet, they ſeem to make no other uſe of their Men of War than to ſurpriſe our Merchant-Ships.

            <p>In the mean time they were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly fomenting our Diviſions, and animating the different Parties that are among us, againſt us and one another. The <hi>Scotch</hi> Presbyterians were incited to take up Arms, by Sir <hi>John Cochram,</hi> and thoſe of the ſame perſwaſion in <hi>England</hi> were manag'd by Mr. <hi>Ferguſon</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>

               <hi>Ferguſon,</hi> the noted Contriver of thoſe Intrigues which at laſt prov'd Fatal to the unfortunate Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> fam'd for Inconſtancy and Treaſon, that Prodigy of Plotters whoſe whole Life is One black My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, was alſo a buſie Promoter of this execrable Deſign. The Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter that is given of him in the Hiſtory of the Conſpiracy againſt King <hi>Charles</hi> II. and the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> which was Written by their Order, is very remarkable, and ſerves to ſhew us what uſe the Party inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to make of a Perſon, with whoſe Temper they were ſo well acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>The Author of that Book informs us, that <hi>Ferguſon</hi> was not only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd in the Deſign of Aſſaſſinating thoſe two Princes, but applauded it as a Glorious Work, ſaying, <hi>that it wou'd be an Admonition to all Princes to take heed how they oppreſs'd their Subjects;</hi> and adding upon another occaſion, <hi>that it was never thought Injuſtice to Shoot, or ſet Traps for Wolves and Tygers.</hi> And one of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Conſpirators ſpeaking of a Blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbuſs
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:49849:32"/>
which he intended to uſe in the Aſſaſſination of his Majeſty, broke out into this prophane Jeſt, <hi>That</hi> Ferguſon <hi>ſhou'd firſt Conſecrate it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the ſame Book we are told that the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> confeſs'd to the King, <hi>That in all their Debates</hi> Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſon <hi>was always for cutting of Throats,</hi> ſaying, <hi>that was the moſt Compendious Way.</hi> That <hi>Ferguſon</hi> himſelf, when he took his leave of the Conſpirators, declar'd, <hi>That he wou'd never be out of a Plot as long as he liv'd,</hi> and that at one of their Conſults he propos'd, <hi>that Five or Six of the Old Rich Citizens ſhou'd be kill'd at Firſt, and their Eſtates given to the Mobile, to terrifie the reſt.</hi> That 'twas his conſtant Cuſtom to out-do all the reſt of the Conſpirators, by ſome peculiar Circumſtance of Cruelty of his own Invention. That upon all accounts of his reſtleſs Spirit, fluent Tongue, ſubtil Brain, and helliſh Malice, he was perfectly Qualifi'd to be the great Incendiary, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Agitator of the whole Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy; and that after <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s Death, he was the Life and Soul of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:49849:32"/>
all, eſpecially for the carrying on of the Aſſaſſination.</p>
            <p>While ſuch Perſons as theſe were endeavoring to incite the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians to Rebellion, the Epiſcopal Party was cajol'd by ſome of the Depos'd Biſhops, or by certain Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates that were ſent as private Emiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries from King <hi>James.</hi> And the ſame deſign was alſo zealouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted by ſome Clergy-men, who deſpair'd of Preferment under a Prince, who makes Merit and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue the only Objects of his Favor and Bounty. They were enrag'd to find themſelves diſappointed of the great Expectations they had conceiv'd in the preceding Reign, when the Government, deſigning to render the Church of <hi>England</hi> weak and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, made want of Merit one of the principal Recommendations to Advancement. It muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd even by thoſe who envy our preſent Happineſs, that the conſtant Care which is taken to beſtow the Benefices and Dignities of the Church upon the moſt deſerving Perſons, and to prefer the Deſires of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in the choice of their Paſtors, before
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:49849:33"/>
the moſt preſſing Solicitations of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Perſons, is one of the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Beauties of this Reign. The Merit of thoſe who have been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd to the Epiſcopal Function ſince the Revolution, is ſufficient either to ſtop the Mouths, or baffle the Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of their moſt virulent Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: And 'tis known that theſe worthy Prelates are not only encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd, but enjoin'd to make a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious uſe of the Power with which they are entruſted, by virtue of their Office and Character to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of a conſiderable number of the Inferior Benefices. So that 'tis hard to imagine where the moſt impudent Malice can find a pretext to cenſure His Majeſty's Conduct in this Point.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs 'tis certain, that the Conſpirators carry'd on their black Intrigues in all places, and among all ſorts of Perſons; and even were not aſham'd to contradict themſelves by endeavoring at once to perſwade all the ſeveral Parties in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that they had juſt cauſe of Complaint. They ſuggeſted to the Rigid Presbyterians, whoſe ungo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd Zeal made 'em capable of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:49849:33"/>
ſuch Impreſſions, that they ought not to ſupport a Prince who protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Church of <hi>England:</hi> And at the ſame time the Toleration he had granted to Diſſenters, was made uſe of as a pretext to render him odious to the hotteſt Aſſerters of Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy.</p>
            <p>He had already given us a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Intimation of his Sentiments in this Caſe, and of the Maxims he intended to purſue; when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd in the beginning of his Reign, <hi>That He wou'd be King of his People, and not of a Faction.</hi> He lov'd mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Perſons in all Parties, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to maintain all his Subjects Indifferently in the Poſſeſſion of their Privileges and Properties. He wou'd never permit any Order or Set of Men to domineer over the reſt of their Fellow Subjects; but ſuted his Maxims to the Free and Manly Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius of his People, who love to be Govern'd by Law. He is naturally inclin'd to Goodneſs and Clemency; and tho his Temper alone were not ſufficient to ſecure us againſt uneaſie Apprehenſions, the Conſideration of his Intereſt wou'd infallibly reſtrain
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:49849:34"/>
him from abuſing his Authority. The preceding Reign furniſhes him with Inſtructing Examples, and his Virtue is confirm'd by the Faults of his Predeceſſor. He was advanc'd in oppoſition to Arbitrary Power, and can never conſent to the aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe Laws on which his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is founded: Nor can he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor to render himſelf abſolute in one place, without ruining his Intereſt in another; for he is equally oblig'd to maintain the Laws of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that he may preſerve his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in <hi>Holland;</hi> and to preſerve the Liberty of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> that he may maintain his Power among us. Never was the Intereſt and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a Prince ſo inſeparably uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to that of his People; and never had Subjects leſs reaſon to be Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of the Authority of their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign. This is unqueſtion'd Matter of Fact, a Truth that can neither be deny'd nor conceal'd; nor can the Conſpirators themſelves be ſuppos'd to be ignorant of it. And therefore, ſince they cannot diſcover, or ſo much as pretend to diſcover any Faults in His Majeſty, to excuſe their
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:49849:34"/>
Malice againſt him, they endeavor'd, under the Shelter of his Virtues, to carry on their execrable Deſigns.</p>
            <p>The Honeſty and Integrity of his Temper makes him incapable of Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy or Diſtruſt, and even ſeems to invite his Enemies to conſpire againſt him. Beſides, he has ſo great a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Laws, that he will not ſuffer 'em to be violated under any pretext whatſoever; not even for the ſecurity of his Perſon and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. And 'tis this which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd the Conſpirators to proceed with leſs Caution and Fear, as the Reader will eaſily perceive by the Continuation of the Hiſtory of their Proceedings.</p>

And by

his Diligence and Succeſs he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuated himſelf ſo far into the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor and Eſteem of the Party, that he was ſent back to <hi>France,</hi> about a Year after the Action at <hi>La Hogue.</hi> But, before I proceed to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his Voyage and Return, it will not be improper to acquaint the Reader with the State and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Court of St. <hi>Germains,</hi> about the time of his Arrival there.</p>
            <p>'Tis obſervable that the Policy of the Late King's Council has always conſiſted in altering their Meaſures according to the Circumſtances of their Affairs. That this has been their conſtant practice, is plain from their Conduct at the beginning of the Revolution.

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:49849:35"/>
new Promiſes, which were induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly diſpers'd among the People, both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland:</hi> Particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to oblige the <hi>Scotch</hi> to ſupport his falling Intereſt, he aſſur'd 'em, <hi>That they and their Poſterity ſhou'd ſee</hi>

The Defeat of his Army made him afterwards change his note, and reſume a Language of Sweetneſs and Moderation: But after the Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions at <hi>La Hogue</hi> had reviv'd his ſinking Hopes, he ventur'd once more to put off the Mask, and talk'd of nothing but Conqueſt and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge. At laſt their were two Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties form'd in his Court; and while one of 'em wou'd have engag'd him to oblige himſelf to preſerve the Antient Laws of <hi>England,</hi> the other were ſtill ſuggeſting to him that 'twou'd be too mean a Condeſcenſien to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:49849:36"/>
enter into a Treaty with his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. The two Cabals were headed by <hi>Middleton</hi> and <hi>Melford,</hi> who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd their Maſter's Favor by turns, and were ſucceſſively entruſted with the Management of Affairs, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the variety of his Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
            <p>When he fancy'd himſelf in a Condition to ſubdue the Nation by Force, <hi>Melford</hi> was his Favorite; but when the poſture of his Affairs oblig'd him to have recourſe to Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery and Complaiſance, <hi>Middleton</hi> was the principal Director of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels.

from the juſt Puniſhment of their Crimes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They had Money to offer, and conſequently cou'd neither want Friends nor Protection. The Firſt whom they gain'd was <hi>Taff:</hi> He had been well rewarded for his late Service, and expected a new Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for this Diſcovery, tho he had contributed nothing towards it, but the Aſſiſtance and Teſtimony which he gave to the Diſcover. The diſappointment of his Hopes made him liſten to the advantageous Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers of the Faction, and reſolve to ſave his new Maſters at the expence of his own Reputation; for he was not aſham'd to declare that the <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſhire</hi> Plot was a Fiction concerted betwixt <hi>Lunt</hi> and himſelf, to Ruine ſome Gentlemen in that County. This Declaration was follow'd by Objections that were made againſt the Witneſſes. They were accus'd of Corruption and Misdemeanors; ſome of the Judges were preingag'd and poſſeſs'd with groundleſs preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices againſt 'em, and care was taken to diſguiſe the whole Affair to the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:49849:38"/>
               <note place="margin">Sir <hi>William Williams</hi> took Poſt for <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after <hi>Taff</hi>'s Declaration, and gave a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Character of the Witneſſes; having obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately reſus'd to hear any thing that was offer'd to be alledg'd in their Favor, or to comply with ſome of the Judges who wou'd have proceeded to the Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of other Witneſſes.</note> Council. The Witneſſes were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented in the blackeſt Colors that Artful Malice cou'd invent, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to <hi>Newgate</hi> upon ſuſpicion of having Conſpir'd againſt the Lives and Honor of the <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen.</p>
            <p>The Affair was afterwards brought before both Houſes of Parliament, who heard the Witneſſes, and others who gave in new Informations. Some of 'em diſcover'd the ſecret Treaty betwixt <hi>Taff</hi> and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators; and all of 'em juſtify'd <hi>I unt</hi> and his Accuſation. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a full Hearing and Examination, that laſted about ſix Weeks or two<note place="margin">See the Votes of the Houſe of Commons on that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> Months, 'twas declar'd by both Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, <hi>That there had been a horrible Conſpiracy againſt their Majeſties Life and Government,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This Vote was an Illuſtrious Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony that the Witneſſes were not only Innocent, but merited the Thanks of the Nation; yet the Prejudice of thoſe who ought to have protected
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:49849:38"/>
'em, and the Intereſt of the Faction they had offended, were ſo great, that the Reſolutions of a whole Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament cou'd neither put a ſtop to their Proſecution, nor procure 'em a fair Trial. They were indicted at the <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> Aſſizes, and, by the prevailing Force of the ſecret Springs that were employ'd againſt 'em, were found Guilty of Perjury.</p>
            <p>Thus, by an unhappy and prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous Turn, the Criminals were become Witneſſes; and the horrible Conſpiracy againſt Their Majeſties was reduc'd to a Conſpiracy againſt Traitors.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1695<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> But their Artifices were at laſt defeated, and Truth prevail'd over the Power and Treachery of its Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. The Diſcoverers aſſerted their Innocency by the Teſtimony of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty new Witneſſes: The <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> Gentlemen cou'd not prove their Allegations, and thoſe who were Guilty of no other Crime than en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoring to ſerve the Government, were ſent away with aſſurances of a ſutable Recompence.</p>
            <p>In the mean time tho the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators cou'd not ſucceed in their
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:49849:39"/>
main deſign of diſcrediting the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes; they had ſpread ſuch a Miſt upon the whole Affair that they hop'd they might eaſily conceal their Intrigues for the future from the leſs penetrating part of Mankind. The Diſcoveries that had been made were imperfect and controverted, and ſerv'd only to give us a new inſtance of the difference betwixt the King and his Enemies. He was ſo far from imitating either the Arbitrary Violence, or Ungenerous Politics of ſome Princes in <hi>Europe,</hi> that he open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly protected thoſe who had Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpir'd againſt his Life, ſo long as there was the leaſt appearance of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to doubt of their Guilt. So dear is the Life or Honor of a Subject to a King, that is (what every So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign ought to be) the Father of his Country.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, the Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators endeavor'd to prevent a new alarm, by the Death of thoſe whom they ſuſpected. For, not to repeat what has been ſaid concerning <hi>Kelly, Dodſworth</hi> was kill'd by two <hi>Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite</hi> Brothers after he had diſcover'd what he knew of the Conſpiracy:
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:49849:39"/>
And <hi>Redman</hi> was Murder'd two days after he had communicated his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to one who betray'd him.</p>
            <p>While the <hi>Jacobites</hi> in <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> were purſuing their beloved Project, of deſtroying the Nation, with ſo much Heat and Diligence; their Friends in <hi>London</hi> were continually forming new Deſigns againſt His Majeſty's Life.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Parker</hi> came to <hi>England,</hi> to execute the Orders he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd from his Maſter, he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd an intimate Correſpondence with <hi>Porter</hi> and <hi>Goodman,</hi> Two of the moſt zealous Inſtruments and Promoters of the Treaſonable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of the Party. The Firſt was born a Gentleman, and a Proteſtant; but had ſpent his Eſtate, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd his Religion. The other was a Comedian by Profeſſion, and had been formerly Try'd for endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to Poyſon the Dukes of <hi>Northumberland</hi> and St. <hi>Albans;</hi> but either his Intereſt, Innocency, or Subtilty had ſav'd him from the Puniſhment that is due to ſuch a Crime. <hi>Parker</hi> gave 'em the Two<note place="margin">Goodman<hi>'s Depoſition,</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril 24. 1696.</note> Firſt Companies in his Regiment, with
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:49849:40"/>
a large ſhare in his Confidence, and in the ſecrets of the Faction; but wou'd never acquaint 'em with ſome of the moſt Myſterious Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Deſign. He order'd 'em to take a Houſe in, or near <hi>London,</hi> with large Stables, fit to lodge and accommodate Fifty or Sixty Horſes; that they might be in a condition to receive the Troops of Horſe, that, from time to time, were to paſs thro' <hi>London,</hi> in their March to the Place of Rendezvous. This is the account he thought fit to give them; but if we conſider what happen'd both before and afterwards, 'twill perhaps appear to be more than a bare conjecture, that, ſince the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to Aſſaſſinate His Majeſty was then on Foot, theſe meaſures were taken to Facilitate the Execution of it.</p>
            <p>His Impriſonment diverted his Thoughts to other Objects, and found new Employment for his Friends; among whom, <hi>Charnock</hi> and <hi>Harriſon,</hi> deſerve a particular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance. The Firſt, who went alſo by the Name of <hi>Robinſon,</hi> was Born and Educated a Proteſtant,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:49849:40"/>
but chang'd his Religion, to Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit the Late King's Favour; which was the ſure Reward of thoſe that were willing to deliver up their Conſcience, as a Pledge of their Loyalty. He and another, were the only Perſons who comply'd with King <hi>James</hi>'s Order to <hi>Magdalen</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; and his Complaiſance, on that Occaſion, procur'd him the Dignity of Vice-Preſident. But when Honeſt Men began to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver what they had loſt; 'twas fit that Perſons of another Character ſhou'd looſe what they had gotten: The Laws that were Re-eſtabliſh'd by the Revolution, render'd him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of enjoying his Place, and by depriving him of his new Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment, made him an Enemy to the Government, both by Intereſt, and Reſentment. He had an equal Averſion to the Laws, to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and to their Deliverer; for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had incurr'd the Hatred of his Countrey-Men, he thought he cou'd neither recover his Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor Fortune, but by deſtroying their Liberty.</p>

               <hi>Charnock</hi> and <hi>Harriſon,</hi> were look'd upon by the Court at St. <hi>Germains,</hi> as Perſons in whom they might place an Entire Confidence.

Every new Crime ſtretches their Conſcience, to make room for a Sin of a larger Size, and Emboldens 'em both to Contrive and Commit the moſt Horrible Villanies. Nor is it proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that he conceal'd the Deſign from <hi>Porter</hi> and <hi>Goodman,</hi> with whom, both before, and after his Impriſonment, he entertain'd an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate Correſpondence. However, 'tis certain, that theſe Four Men, were either the firſt Contrivers of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, or at leaſt conſulted about the moſt proper Ways, to put it in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:49849:42"/>
after it was Communicated to 'em.</p>
            <p>At firſt, they only mention'd, the Seizing of the King, and the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying of him to <hi>France;</hi> either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had no other Intention at that time; or becauſe they fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy'd that even the Fainteſt Senſe of Honor and Vertue, might make the Conſpirators, reject the ſtartling Propoſal of an Aſſaſſination.</p>
            <p>'Tis plain from their Proceedings afterwards, that their ſeeming Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, on this Occaſion, was not the effect of any Inclination they had to ſpare His Majeſty's Life. That Barbarous Deſign was propos'd, under ſeveral, and very different No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, according to the Characters of thoſe to whom it was Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated: They uſually contented themſelves, with mentioning the carrying away of the King, when they imparted the Project, to thoſe in whom they found ſome unextin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd Sparks of Honor; but they ſcrupl'd not to own the Aſſaſſina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the broadeſt Terms to thoſe who, they perceiv'd, were tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a brutiſh and ungovern'd Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:49849:42"/>
Yet even thoſe who had made the greateſt progreſs in putting off all Humanity cou'd not forbear diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the inward Horror that rack'd their guilty Conſciences. Their Minds were ſo agitated by a Senſe of the Enormity of their Crime, that they cou'd not fix upon the Way of executing it. Sometimes they concluded <hi>that the quickeſt way to bring in King</hi> James, <hi>and reſtore him to his Crown was, by knocking King</hi> William <hi>on the Head:</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they reſolv'd <hi>to hurry the King away to</hi> Rumney-Marſh, <hi>and from thence to carry him over to</hi> France; And in ſome of their Conſults 'twas determin'd <hi>to carry him-alive into</hi> France <hi>if they cou'd, if they cou'd not take him alive then to Aſſaſſinate him, and pretend it was done by a Random Shot.</hi>

In the mean time the Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors were ſo afraid of looſing the preſent Opportunity, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to purſue the Deſign, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out expecting a Commiſſion.

            <p>When they ſaw they had loſt the Opportunity of executing their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign upon His Majeſties Perſon; they reſum'd the Project of the Invaſion.</p>
            <p>They entertain'd private Emiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in all the Parts of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, who made it their buſineſs to ſtudie the Inclinations, and pry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Affairs of the People; that
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:49849:45"/>
they might afterwards attack 'em on the Weak Side, and ſtrengthen the Faction by the Addition of a Promiſcuous Multitude of all ſorts of Perſons.</p>
            <p>By this means they engag'd a confus'd Medley of Diſaffected Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: And beſides, they depended upon the Aſſiſtance of all the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotted Papiſts, and a conſiderable number of pretended Proteſtants; all the Creatures of the Late Reign, thoſe who had loſt either their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments or Expectations by the Revolution, all the Promoters of Arbitrary Power, ſeveral Officers of the Army that was diſpers'd at <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisbury,</hi> and ſome Souldiers, who preferr'd a Seditious Idleneſs, and the Ignoble Dangers of Plotting, before the Honourable Occaſions of acquiring Glory in the Field.</p>
            <p>The whole Deſign was carried on by a Set of Men, who had either loſt, or never had, a Senſe of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Vertue; who look'd upon the Laws and Religion, as Vain and Empty Names, and acted as if their Private Intereſt, and the Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences they expected had been a
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:49849:46"/>
ſufficient ſecurity for the Public Safety: Men who had neither Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation to looſe, nor Eſtates to live upon; who were equally Indigent and Idle, and were neither able to endure the uſual Hardſhips of Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nor willing to prevent 'em by an honeſt Induſtry: Turbulent and Reſtleſs Spirits, who delight in Tumults and Confuſion, and repine at the Quiet of their Neighbors; and, as a worthy Reinforcement to the Cabal, thoſe who were not fit to appear in better Company, I mean, ſuch as were ſuſpected of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardice. For as no Man has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed more than his Majeſty to bring Valor into Credit and Faſhion, 'tis his Fate to be extremely hated by Cowards, as he is generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected, and in a manner ador'd by the Brave. Thoſe who have the Courage to aſpire to Glory, Admire an Example which they can never imitate; and never was any Prince ſo Pelov'd by his own Army, or ſo Eſteem'd by that of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
            <p>There were two ſorts of Perſons in whom the Conſpirators plac'd a
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:49849:46"/>
particular Confidence; the New Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts and the Libertines whom they had drawn into the Party; thoſe who had either no Religion, or had embrac'd that of the Faction. For they concluded that ſuch Perſons as theſe wou'd always be ready to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in a Deſign, that tended to the Deſtruction of all Honeſt and Good Men.</p>
            <p>'Twas one of their principal Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems to cry down Religion in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral; becauſe they were ſenſible that the love of our Religion kept us inſeparably united to a Prince that had preſerv'd it. And at the ſame time they left no means un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attempted to weaken and divide our Church: For on the one hand, they endeavor'd to introduce a Remiſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Indifferency in Matters of Religion; and on the other, they made it their buſineſs to foment our Differences about certain new Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, exaſperating the Zeal of our Orthodox Divines by Artifices that need not be mention'd in this place.</p>
            <p>They endeavor'd to inſinuate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into the confidence of thoſe
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:49849:47"/>
who ſeem'd to be diſſatisfy'd with the Court; and oftentimes made uſe of 'em as Tools for the carrying on of a Deſign of which they were wholly ignorant.</p>
            <p>They admitted all that were willing to be engag'd, but were more than ordinarily careful to draw in thoſe who might be uſeful to the Faction; flattering the Intereſt of ſome, and the Ambition of others, and enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing both with ſmall Preſents and large Promiſes.</p>
            <p>They endeavor'd to corrupt the Officers of the Fleet, Army and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia;<note place="margin">This appears by Capt. <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s Depoſition, <hi>April 15th. 1696.</hi>
               </note> and tamper'd with the Clerks and Secretaries of thoſe who either were, or had been employ'd in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent Poſts under the Government, that by their means they might get Intelligence of ſuch things as they were deſirous to know. Thus they obtain'd an Account of the Naval Forces of one, and a Liſt of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of another.</p>
            <p>'Twou'd be an endleſs Labor to relate all their Contrivances and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinations; and therefore I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent my ſelf with taking notice of their General Maxims.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:49849:47"/>
They were ſenſible that the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> are generally poſſeſs'd with a natural Antipathy againſt the <hi>French;</hi> that we had been for a long time under perpetual Apprehenſions of the growing Power of thoſe incroaching Neighbors, and that our Jealouſy and Averſion were extremely heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten'd ſince the beginning of the War. And therefore to divert our Hatred and Suſpicion to another Object, they endeavor'd to poſſeſs us with an ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded Jealouſy of the <hi>Dutch.</hi> To this end, they were ſtill putting us in mind of the dangers to which we expos'd our ſelves, by depending upon the Friendſhip of a Nation, that was wholly compos'd of Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and Republicans; without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that their being ſo makes it their Intereſt that we ſhou'd never imitate their Example; ſince their Provinces wou'd be quickly aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd, if their People cou'd find in this Kingdom the Religion, Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and Government to which they are inclin'd by Birth and Education. For 'tis very natural to ſuppoſe, that if theſe Impediments were remov'd, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

as <hi>Holland,</hi> wou'd embrace with Joy the inviting Opportunity of living in a Fertile and Pleaſant Land, where they might ſecurely enjoy all the Comforts and Conveniencies of Life, with infinitely leſs trouble and pains, and without the Diſadvantage of paying Taxes in time of Peace; and to which they might eaſily tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſport both their Trade and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates.</p>
            <p>Another of their deteſtable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances was to make us forget, or, at leaſt, to leſſen our Eſteem for our Deliverer. 'Twas for this Reaſon they uſually call'd him the <hi>Dutch Prince,</hi> and ſometimes had the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence to ſpeak of him in baſe and ſcurrilous Terms; as when, at one of their Traiterous Meetings, they ſqueez'd an Orange, and drank a health <hi>to the Deſtruction of the ſqueez'd and rotten Orange.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Twas thus they were not aſnam'd to treat a Prince who ſav'd <hi>Europe</hi> by his Courage and Reſolution, who inſpires his Armies with Valor by his own inimitable Example, and has made his Subjects Maſters of the Sea, and Arbiters of the Chriſtian World.
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:49849:48"/>
A Prince to whom we owe all the hopes we can reaſonably entertain, of an honorable and advantageous Peace; and who has rais'd the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Nation to its Ancient Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation and Splendor.</p>
            <p>Sometimes they affected a ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Zeal for the Public Good, that they might have an opportunity to exclaim againſt the neceſſary Charge of the War. Thoſe who were beſt acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Intereſt of the Nation, and moſt concern'd to promote it, had often demonſtrated, what common Senſe ſuggeſts to every conſidering Perſon, That the Expending of our Money, on this occaſion, is the beſt Inſtance we can give of our Fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality; That 'tis both our Duty and Intereſt to give away part, that the whole may be preſerv'd; That His Majeſty's Predeceſſors might, eaſily, and with little charge, have ſtopp'd the progreſs of their ambitious Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor; That 'tis their Fault we are now oblig'd to pay ſo dear for our Preſervation; That if the <hi>French</hi> were Maſters of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> the preſent Taxes wou'd not be ſufficient for our neceſſary Defence; That if
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:49849:49"/>
               <hi>Holland</hi> were alſo added to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, the unavoidable Charge of the War wou'd be ſtill greater; And that, at laſt, when we ſhou'd have no Allies to ſupport us, we muſt infallibly become a Prey to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent Cruelty of our Enemies, and for ever groan under the inſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Yoke of Popery and Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</p>
            <p>Such Reflections as theſe were made by ſeveral wiſe and judicious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and inculcated with all the force of Reaſon and Eloquence; but 'twas in vain to hope that Reaſon wou'd have any Influence upon thoſe who were reſolv'd to ſtop their Ears a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, and made it their buſineſs to hinder others from hearing it. The Conſpirators, with their uſual Impudence, continu'd ſtill to inſiſt upon an Objection that had been ſo often and ſo unanſwerably confuted; amuſing the People with perpetual Murmurings and Complaints, and imagining that the groundleſs Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, which they endeavor'd to raiſe in the Minds of the unwary Croud, wou'd, by degrees, make 'em loſe the Remembrance of the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:49849:49"/>
Real and Terrible Dangers that threaten'd 'em in the preceding Reign.</p>
            <p>But the ſubtleſt and moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of all their Artifices, was that by which they cunningly impos'd upon the heedleſs Credulity of ſome Perſons; who neither approv'd their Principles nor Practices. For 'tis certain that the Party of thoſe who really long for the Eſtabliſhment of Arbitrary Power and the Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Proteſtant Religion, is in it ſelf very ſmall and inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and wou'd be eternally the Weakeſt, if it were not augmented and ſupported by an unthinking Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude who ſuffer themſelves to be led they know not whither. This may be properly call'd, <hi>The Liſting of Tools for the Service of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At firſt, to cajole the Church-Party, they employ'd the Intereſt they had at Court, in ſome of the preceding Reigns, to raiſe a Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt the Diſſenters; but their ſeeming Zeal for the Preſervation of the Church that is eſtabliſh'd by Law was ſo little to be depended on, that,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:49849:50"/>
even then, they had titular Prelates, who were actually engag'd in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy againſt the Nation, and only waited for a favorable opportunity, to diſpoſſeſs the Proteſtant Biſhops<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In the late Reign they ſeem'd to alter their Meaſures, and began to court the <hi>Non-Conformiſts,</hi> that all the Sects in the Kingdom might think themſelves oblig'd, both by Gratitude and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, to ſupport a Government that protected 'em. By this unexpected appearance of Tenderneſs they inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated themſelves into the good O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of a conſiderable Number of the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> who deſir'd no more than a Toleration to Worſhip God after their own Faſhion: But while theſe deluded People were expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their Thankfulneſs to the Court in fulſom and extravagant Addreſſes; thoſe very Perſons who appear'd to be the moſt zealous Promoters of a Liberty of Conſcience here, employ'd all their Intereſt to enflame the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution in <hi>France,</hi> and were perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually ſoliciting that Monarch to compleat the Ruine of his Proteſtant Subjects.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:49849:50"/>
Since the Revolution, it has been the conſtant Endeavor of the Faction to engage thoſe who are always un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie in time of War, by reaſon of the Charge and Inconveniencies that attend it: But in this, as in all other Projects and Contrivances, they were ſo far from making good their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions to a hearty Zeal for the Good of their Country, that they made two deſperate Attempts to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver it up to the Revenge of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens'd Enemy.</p>
            <p>At preſent they take advantage of the dangerous Folly of thoſe who are ſtill wiſhing for a Peace, without conſidering either the Terms or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of it. They believe, or at leaſt wou'd make us believe, that every Man is a declar'd Enemy to a Peace, who deſires that it may be ſolid and advantageous. They wou'd fain perſwade us that 'tis the King who oppoſes it; tho they are ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble we cannot be ignorant, that 'tis his principal Care, as well as his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and Glory, to procure the Quiet and Happineſs of <hi>Europe.</hi> The main Drift of theſe pernicious Inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuations is either to render His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:49849:51"/>
odious to thoſe who are unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with their Devices; or, by a treacherous and ill-ſecur'd Peace, to make way for a Fatal and Bloody War, againſt thoſe very Perſons whom they now amuſe with a pretended Zeal for the Intereſt of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. For ſuch wou'd be the diſmal and inevitable Conſequences of their falſe Politics, if the King and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament wou'd renounce their won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Prudence in complaiſance eicher to Fools or Knaves.</p>
            <p>It muſt be acknowledg'd that we cannot, without Injuſtice, pronounce an equally ſevere Sentence upon all who promote the deſigns of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. For 'tis certain there are a conſiderable number of deluded and unthinking Perſons, who ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be led by thoſe who are Superior to 'em both in Wit and Malice. But tho the ſimplicity of ſuch undeſigning Tools may in ſome meaſure extenuate their Guilt; their obſtinacy makes 'em as Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous as the fierceſt and moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate Traitors. For when one does what he can to deſtroy the Laws, Religion, and Liberty of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:49849:51"/>
the Honeſty of his Intention can never atone for the fatal Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of his Error.</p>
            <p>This Reflexion wou'd perhaps carry me beyond the Limits of my intended Moderation, if I were not reſolv'd to give the moſt favorable Treatment that can be allow'd to to thoſe for whom His Majeſty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a Paternal Affection, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their repeated Provocations.

Troop in <hi>Parker</hi>'s Regiment; but ſince they knew he had an Eſtate, they quickly put him in a way to ſpend it, by ſending him a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to Levy a Regiment of Horſe.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>John Friend</hi> was a Citizen and Brewer of <hi>London,</hi> oblig'd to the late King for an advantageous Place in the Exciſe. However, tho he was diſſatisfy'd with the Revolution, and refus'd to comply with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Government, he ſeem'd at firſt unwilling to engage in any Plot or Conſpiracy againſt it. The little Senſe he had was ſufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince him, that 'twas not his Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to reform the Works of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and much leſs to declare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf an Enemy to his Religion and Country. But neither his Judgment nor Conſcience was able to reſiſt his Vanity, which was ſtrong enough to make him ſacrifice both, for an<note place="margin">

He wrote a Letter to King <hi>James,</hi> and receiv'd ſo obliging an Anſwer, that, to expreſs his Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, he reſolv'd to ſpend a good part of his Eſtate in his Service.

            <p>
               <hi>Charnock</hi> accepted the Commiſſion, but deſir'd to know what number of Forces he might offer in their

Names; upon which they promis'd to meet King <hi>James</hi> at the Head of Two Thouſand Horſe, as ſoon as they ſhou'd receive the News of his Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
            <p>This was but a ſmall Force for ſo great an Undertaking; tho it will appear to be much above the Strength of the Faction, if we conſider the Ways they took to Levy and Subſiſt their ſecret Militia.

They gave Money to the poorer Sort for their preſent Subſiſtence, but kept 'em ſtill in a neceſſitous Condition, that they might be oblig'd to depend upon the Party.</p>
            <p>They endeavor'd to engage the Officers, by Flattering 'em with Hopes of Preferment; making the Enſigns Captains, and promiſing Regiments to thoſe who were Captains before. For 'tis neither Reaſon nor Juſtice, but Licentiouſneſs and Diſorder, that advance the Deſigns of a Faction.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:49849:55"/>
Of their Troopers, ſome had Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to buy Horſes, but there were few of this Number; ſome reckon'd to borrow 'em upon occaſion, and others reſolv'd to take 'em where they cou'd find 'em.</p>

            <p>Nor was this meerly the Effect of Sir <hi>John Fenwick</hi>'s Prudence; for he had already been ſo Liberal a Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor to the Faction, that he found himſelf oblig'd to moderate his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences for the Future. His Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, to whom he had reſign'd his Eſtate, allow'd him an Annuity, which was ſufficient for his Subſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence, but not for carrying on his Deſigns. <note place="margin">Brice Blair's <hi>Depoſition,</hi> March 16. 1695/6.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Sir <hi>John Friend</hi> was almoſt in the ſame condition; for he had advanc'd

ſuch conſiderable Summs for the ſubſiſtence of his Men, that he was afraid, if the Deſign of the Invaſion ſhou'd miſcarry, he ſhou'd not have enough left to carry on his Trade.</p>

            <p>To conclude, they cou'd not but fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee that thoſe whom they had drawn in by ſupplying their preſent Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, wou'd not be ſo ready to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter the apparent Dangers of the Attempt, as they were to offer their Service.</p>
            <p>'Tis plain from theſe Remarks that 'twou'd have been a hard Task for the Conſpirators to make good their Promiſe, to meet the Late King at the Head of Two Thouſand Horſe. Beſides, the Charge of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on the Deſign was too heavy
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:49849:56"/>
for thoſe that were engag'd in it; their Money was ſpent in uſeleſs Preparations, and a longer Delay wou'd have been as dangerous as a raſh and prepoſterous Haſte.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charnock</hi> was a Man of too much Senſe, and to well acquainted with the Strength of the Faction, to rely upon the Promiſes they had made him: And therefore he deſir'd another Meeting, which was held at a Tavern near Sir <hi>John Fenwick</hi>'s Lodgings, and conſiſted of the ſame Perſons that were preſent at the former, except the Lord <hi>Montgomery.</hi> There <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nock</hi> deſir'd to know whether they were reſolv'd to make good their propoſals, and upon the new Aſſuran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces they gave him, he undertook the Commiſſion, and ſome days after, embark'd for <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the late King's Council did not think fit to Anſwer their Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations: For the Deſign was not yet ripe for Execution, nor their Affairs, either in <hi>England</hi> or <hi>France,</hi> in ſuch a Poſture as they deſir'd.</p>
            <p>They had ſounded the Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Parliament, People and Army; and by ſeveral vain Attempts
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:49849:57"/>
had endeavor'd to debauch their Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity. 'Twas their Intereſt and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that either the whole Army, or a conſiderable part of it, ſhou'd be disbanded by the Parliament, that there might not be a ſufficient num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſtanding Forces left, to oppoſe the Conſpirators.</p>
            <p>To this end, their Emiſſaries were inſtructed to exaggerate the unavoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable Inconveniencies of the War, and to perſwade the People, and eſpecially their Repreſentatives, that 'twou'd be neceſſary to encreaſe our Naval Force, for the ſecurity of our Trade, and at the ſame time to leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen an Army that was uſeful to Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners, but only chargeable to our Selves. How is the Nation cheated, was their uſual Cant, and what oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion is there for ſo vaſt an Expence, as if ſo brave a Fleet were not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to defend us? How are we degenerated from the Valor of our Anceſtors, how baſely do we injure their glorious Memory, by dreading an Enemy whom they have ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten defeated, and how poorly it ſounds in the Mouth of an <hi>Engliſh</hi>-Man to talk of an Invaſion from
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:49849:57"/>
               <hi>France?</hi> By theſe and ſuch like cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Inſinuations they wou'd have perſwaded us that we were oblig'd in Honor to give our Enemies all the advantages they cou'd deſire; and that 'twas a mark of Cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to put our ſelves in a poſture of Defence. But theſe Artifices did not take effect, tho there were even ſome well-meaning Perſons who had learn'd the Language, and promoted the Deſigns of thoſe who at the ſame time were plotting their Ruine.</p>
            <p>They had endeavor'd to ſtir up the People to Rebellion, or at leaſt to try what might be expected from 'em if an Inſurrection ſhou'd be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun.</p>
            <p>In purſuance of this Deſign, ſome <hi>Facobites,</hi> taking advantage of the Mildneſs of the Laws, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgency of the Government, met at a noted Tavern, where under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of a Drunken Frolic, which they hop'd wou'd be either ſlighted or excus'd, they aſſum'd the boldneſs to ſtop thoſe who happen'd to paſs that way, and to make 'em drink a Health to King <hi>James</hi> and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Prince of <hi>Wales.</hi> But at laſt
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:49849:58"/>
the People were ſo incens'd, and broke into the Houſe with ſo much Fury, that the Impudent Rioteers, fearing to be torn in pieces by the Rabble, were glad, for their own ſecurity, to be ſeiz'd and carry'd to <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They had alſo form'd a Project to ſurprize the Tower, to favor the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Inſurrection; but all the Friends they had in it were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to make 'em Maſters of that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Place, nor cou'd they hope to keep it, if they ſhou'd have ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in the Attempt.</p>
            <p>They had, in the laſt place, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor'd to corrupt the Forces that were left in the Kingdom, but had no great reaſon to boaſt of their<note place="margin">Goodman<hi>'s Depoſition,</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril 24. 1696.</note> Succeſs: For, except ſome Troopers in the Earl of <hi>Oxford</hi>'s Regiment, and here and there an Officer or a Soldier in the Militia, there were none who wou'd be engag'd in ſo black an Enterprize.</p>

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:49849:58"/>
not hinder from making conſiderable Conqueſts. We were Maſters of the Sea, and were either preparing, or had actually begun, to Bombard his Sea-port Towns. His Fleet was coop'd up in the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> and durſt not venture to repaſs the Streights: So that how welcome ſoever the Propoſals might be to the Courts of <hi>Verſailles</hi> and St. <hi>Germains,</hi> they cou'd not in ſuch a Juncture ſpare ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Men as their Friends in <hi>England</hi> deſir'd. And therefore <hi>Charnock</hi> was ſent back with a Compliment to the <hi>Jacobites,</hi> and a promiſe of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance upon the firſt convenient Occaſion.</p>
            <p>The laſt Winter was the Time they pitch'd upon to make good their Promiſe. Thirty Batalions were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd to March towards <hi>Calais,</hi> and the late King left St <hi>Germains</hi> to put himſelf at the Head of 'em. Three or Four Hundred Tranſport Ships were prepar'd with all poſſible ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy and diligence to bring over their Land-Forces, under the Convoy of a Squadron of Men of War, ſome of the Men were already embark'd, and the reſt were embarking, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:49849:59"/>
to make a Deſcent upon this Kingdom, before Providence thought fit to diſcover the myſterious Deſign of this Expedition.</p>
            <p>Any conſidering Perſon that was not acquainted with the Myſtery of Iniquity, wou'd have concluded the Invaſion of <hi>England</hi> to be as Impra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticable then, as it was the Summer before. The <hi>French</hi> Fleet was ſtill at <hi>Thoulon,</hi> and notwithſtanding the<note place="margin">Brice Blair<hi>'s Depoſition,</hi> March 16. 1695/6.</note> advice we had of their Deſign to Re-paſs the Streights, we had no reaſon to be afraid of any Attempt they cou'd make againſt us. For, in all humane probability, we ſeem'd to be equally ſecure, whether the Squadron that was deſign'd to rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force our Fleet in the Streights ſhou'd purſue their intended Voyage or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in our Ports; ſince their arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val there wou'd have prevented the Return of the <hi>Thoulon</hi> Fleet into the Ocean, and their ſtaying here wou'd have enabl'd us to encounter with both the Fleets of our Enemies. And our Apprehenſions were extremely leſſen'd by the daily Expectation of our Squadron from <hi>Cadiz,</hi> which, we had all the reaſon in the World
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:49849:59"/>
to believe, wou'd ſail immediately after the <hi>French,</hi> ſince they had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do in the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their departure.</p>
            <p>Beſides, we know that the <hi>Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> Fleet cou'd not paſs the Streights without a favorable Wind, and that even the quickeſt aud moſt proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Voyage they cou'd expect, wou'd extremely retard the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Deſigns.</p>
            <p>Our Enemies knew before this time, that our Squadron wou'd not ſail to the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> for that was ſo far from being kept ſecret, that 'twas openly declar'd. Nor cou'd they be ignorant that we had a very conſiderable Number of Men of War in our Ports, and that the outward bound Fleets of Merchant Ships with thoſe that were daily expected, wou'd furniſh us with a more than ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Number of Seamen to Man them.</p>
            <p>Before they cou'd execute their Deſign againſt us, 'twas neceſſary they ſhou'd Embark their Troops, paſs the Sea and make a Deſcent in this Kingdom: And after their Landing, ſome time muſt have been
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:49849:60"/>
ſpent in Receiving the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, forming a Body of Horſe, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenching their Forces, and furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves with Proviſions and Ammunition. Now, ſuppoſing that all theſe Preparations wou'd have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd no more than Four or Five Days; 'tis plain from the Event, that, even upon ſo ſhort a Warning, we cou'd have put our ſelves in a poſture of Defence. For not long after, they found to their coſt, that we were able, in as little time, to bring Fourſcore Men of War toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and conſequently wou'd have been equally in a Condition to bring over a ſufficient Number of Forces from <hi>Flanders,</hi> and to hinder our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies from ſending a Reinforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to make good their Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.</p>
            <p>Nor cou'd it be ſuppos'd that any <hi>Jacobites,</hi> who had not entirely loſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:49849:60"/>
a numerous and formidable Army; for the City of <hi>London</hi> alone offer'd to furniſh the King with Twenty Thouſand Men, on that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>Thus 'tis plain that the Deſign of invading <hi>England,</hi> in ſuch a Jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, was either abſolutely impra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticable, or at leaſt attended with unavoidable, and almoſt invincible Difficulties, and conſequently might have been juſtly look'd upon as the Wild Project of a Diſtemper'd Brain; if the Conſpirators had not depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the ſucceſs of an Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent which they had contriv'd to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the Parliament, and put the whole Kingdom into a Conſternation that wou'd have made us incapable of defending our ſelves. They knew that His Majeſty was the Life and Soul of his Subjects, that his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſecur'd 'em from the Devices, as his Valor protected 'em from the Attempts of their Enemies; and therefore reſolv'd upon the compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Way of Deſtroying <hi>England</hi> in the Perſon of its Great Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:49849:61"/>
But before I proceed to give an account of that Helliſh Enterprize, 'twill be highly convenient to take a view of the preceding Intrigues and Contrivances of the Faction.</p>
            <p>In <hi>France,</hi> they induſtriouſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aggerated the Number and Power of the <hi>Engliſh Jacobites.</hi> To perſwade the People of that unhappy Nation to endure, with a ſervile patience, the Tyranny of their inſolent Oppreſſors, they gave out that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were quite Exhauſted by the multiply'd Taxes that were impos'd upon 'em, that they were not able to ſupport the Charge of the War any longer, and wou'd be quickly forc'd to ſubmit to the Mercy of <hi>Lewis</hi> the Great. And the ſame Artifice was made uſe of, to encourage the <hi>French</hi> Council to protect and aſſiſt the Late King.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It appears that the</hi> French <hi>King gave Credit to thoſe Surmiſes; for in a Letter which he wrote to his Ambaſſador at the Court of</hi> Sweden, <hi>he ſays expreſly,</hi> That his Troops were Marching to the Coaſts, and ready to Embark, as ſoon as the News of an Inſurrection in that Kingdom ſhou'd confirm the Advices he had ſo often
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:49849:61"/>
receiv'd, &amp;c. that the Nation was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally Diſſatisfy'd with the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Government.</p>
            <p>But he was quickly made ſenſible of his Miſtake, and that too in a manner, which was equally glorious to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, and mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to its moſt terrible Enemy, for 'tis certain, and muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd, even by thoſe who ſaw it with Grief and Vexation, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any Subjects diſcover'd a more tender Affection, and a more hearty and vigorous Loyalty to their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, than the Parliament and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>England</hi> did, on this occaſion, to His Majeſty.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Emiſſaries of the Faction, who are diſpers'd thro all <hi>Europe,</hi> were induſtriouſly labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to defame the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation,<note place="margin">They repreſent us as an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The <hi>Engliſh Jacobites,</hi> as well as the Court of St. <hi>Germains,</hi> were ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally divided into <hi>Melfordians</hi> and <hi>Middletonians;</hi> and while one of the Parties declar'd openly for Arbitrary Power, the other inſiſted upon the Neceſſity of entering into a kind of Treaty with the Nation.</p>
            <p>The former were entruſted with the Secrets of the Faction, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Troops that were to be employ'd in the Deſtruction of their Country.

me that there might be ſomething done in a little time, which might be an Introduction to King <hi>James</hi>'s Reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

It requires time to finiſh a Villain, as well as to form a Hero; the one muſt ſink by degrees beneath, as the other muſt by ſucceſſive ſteps aſcend above, the common Level of Humane Nature. The Conſpitators were ſenſible of this Truth, and ſince they cou d not expect to find Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ready made that were fit for ſuch a Work, they were forc d to undergo the trouble of faſhioning their own Tools. To this end, they conceal'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the blackeſt part of the<note place="margin">Knightly, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril 2. 1696.</note> Deſign from thoſe with whom they began to treat, and contented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with a general exhortation to contribute their aſſiſtance to reſtore their abdicated Monarch, or, in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what plainer Terms, to meet him at his Expected Landing: But after they had, by ſuch Inſinuations as theſe, prepar d the Diſpoſitions of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes for any violent Attempt, they proceeded to Diſcloſe the bottom of the Myſterious Villany, and told
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:49849:70"/>
'em frankly, that <hi>the quickeſt way to bring in the late King was by knocking King William on the Head,</hi> or, to give a ſofter turn to ſuch a ſtartling Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal, <hi>by making War upon him in his Winter Quarters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They pretended that ſuch an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt cou'd no more be reckon'd an Aſſaſſination, than if they had kill d him in <hi>Flanders,</hi> as he chang'd his Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and remove from one Town to another: And <hi>Barclay,</hi> to hide the Infamy of the Parricide, was wont to ſay, <hi>Gentlemen, we are Men of Honor: We ll attack the Prince of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range</hi> at the Head of his Guards.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſince there are degrees in all ſorts of Crimes, and every Traitor is not willing to become an Aſſaſſin; the Conſpirators had the Mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to find their propoſals rejected by ſome, even of their own Party.<note place="margin">Francis de La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rue<hi>'s Depoſition,</hi> February 26. 1695/6.</note> The two Brothers, <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Bevil Higgins,</hi> tho violent <hi>Jacobites,</hi> refus'd to have any hand in the Deſign againſt his Majeſty s Perſon.</p>

            <p>Several ways were propos'd in their private Meetings, to Aſſaſſinate his Majeſty. <hi>Brice Blair</hi> in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition <hi>March</hi> 17th 1696, takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of an Attempt that was to have been executed by Men that were to lie in wait for him on the Road as he was going to Embark for <hi>Holland.</hi> He affirms that <hi>Bertram</hi> told him, the laſt year, that <hi>Charnock</hi> had engag'd him and others to Aſſaſſinate the King on his way to <hi>Flanders;</hi> and

that the Deſign wou'd have been put in Execution, if they had not receiv'd Counter-orders from <hi>St. Germains,</hi> the day before the King ſet out.</p>
            <p>Tho the Credit of this Paſſage de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends entirely on the diſcourſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Bertram</hi> and <hi>Blair,</hi> ſince there are no other Witneſſes that atteſt it, nor any circumſtances or preſumptive Evidence brought to Confirm it; I thought my ſelf oblig'd to mention it, as a thing that is neither impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, nor impertinent to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of this Hiſtory. But ſince I have ſuch a variety of Matter before me, and every Circumſtance confirm d by unqueſtion'd Evidence, I will not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon any thing that comes ſhort of an undoubted Truth.</p>
            <p>'Tis certain that there were ſeveral Projects ſet on foot, or at leaſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd by the Conſpirators to execute their deſign'd Attempt againſt his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Perſon. In the beginning 'twas thought fit by ſome, either to Seize, or Kill Him at <hi>Kenſington,</hi> by attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Guards, and forcing his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace in the Night.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Richard Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers<hi>'s Depoſition,</hi> February 25. 1695/6.</note> Another Propoſal was to murder him when he ſhou'd come on <hi>Sunday</hi>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:49849:72"/>
to perform his Devotions at St. <hi>James</hi>'s Chapel. Two or Three and Thirty of the Conſpirators were to attack his Guards, which uſually do not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed Twenty or Five and Twenty; while Six Men on Foot, who were to have been conceal'd for that purpoſe in ſome of the Neighbouring Houſes ſhou'd ſhut <hi>Hide-Park</hi> Gate, and the reſt Aſſaſſinate his Majeſty. 'Twas agreed alſo to Kill the Coach-Horſes juſt as they were entering into the <hi>Park,</hi> that, the Paſſage being ſtopt, the Guards might not be able to come up, till they had given the fatal Blow.</p>
            <p>It appears that, after the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the execrable Deed, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to retire immediately to the <hi>Tower,</hi> which, for that end, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to ſurprize. And 'tis probable that the apparent Difficulty or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther impoſſibillty of making them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Maſters of that Place, and the want of a ſecure Retreat any where elſe, were the main Reaſons that made 'em lay aſide the Thoughts of performing the Aſſaſſination this way.</p>
            <p>Both theſe Propoſals were ſoon rejected by the Conſpirators; but there were two other Projects that
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:49849:72"/>
were the ſubject of a longer Delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, being look'd upon as more feaſible, and obnoxious to fewer and leſs diſcouraging Hazards. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it will not be improper to give the Reader a more particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of 'em.</p>
            <p>The King has a Houſe at <hi>Richmond,</hi> whither he uſually went to hunt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very <hi>Saturday,</hi> when free from the hurry of Buſineſs, and the perpetual cares in which he had ſpent the Week, he had leaſure to divert himſelf with that Innocent and Manly Recreation. Near that place there is a little Park that reaches to the River ſide; the<note place="margin">

               <hi>Thames</hi> on one ſide, and the <hi>Park</hi>-pales one the other, forming a kind of Defilé or narrow Lane, about 150 paces long, in the middle of which there is a Gate that hinders Coaches or Horſes from paſſing that way, when 'tis ſhut. Thro this Lane the King uſually return'd from hunting, and 'twas here that the Conſpirators re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to execute their barbarous Deſign.</p>
            <p>The Park, the River, the Gate, and the Pales, were all to be made ſubſervient for facilitating the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:49849:73"/>
Several Perſons on foot, well arm'd, were to be plac'd in Ambuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cade behind the Hedges and Pales. When the King's Coach had paſs'd the Gate, it was to be ſhut upon the Guards that follow'd him; the Coach was to be ſtopt by killing ſome of the Horſes, and the Pales were to be ſaw d ſo far, that they might be broken down aſſoon as they enter'd upon action. In the mean time ſome Horſemen were to attack Six or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of the Guards, that go before the Coach, and the Party that lay in Ambuſcade were to fire on the Body of the Guards that were ſtopt by the Gate, that the Aſſaſſins might have time to murder the King and thoſe who were with him.</p>
            <p>'Twas alſo agreed that, after the Aſſaſſination, ſuch of the Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors as were on Horſeback ſhou'd im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately diſperſe, and thoſe of the Ambuſcade who were to act on foot, dreſs'd in Countrymens habits, ſhou'd make their eſcape to the River-ſide, where there was to be a Boat lying ready to receive 'em. This propoſal was under deliberation for ſome time, during which ſome of the Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:49849:73"/>
were ſent to the place, in order to view the Ground, and upon the Account they gave of it the above mention dScheme wasfram'd. But after all their Conſultations, ſince Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi> was not ſure of a ſufficient Number of Horſe to carry off thoſe that were to lye in Ambuſcade, who, conſequently, wou'd have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to very great dangers, before they cou'd have reach'd <hi>London,</hi> this Project was alſo rejected by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</p>
            <p>The laſt way that was propos'd to murder the King, was to aſſault him, as he return'd from <hi>Richmond,</hi> in a place betwixt <hi>Brentford</hi> and <hi>Turnham Green.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a Bottom, where the Ground is mooriſh and uneven, there is a Bridge<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Capt.</hi> Porter, March 3. 1695/6.</note> where divers Roads meet and croſs one another; on the North-ſide there is a Road that goes round <hi>Brentford,</hi> and on the South a Lane that leads to the River; ſo that one may come thither from four ſeveral Places. After you paſs the Bridge the Road grows narrow, having on one ſide a Foot-path, and on the other a tall and thick Hedge.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:49849:74"/>
This was to have been the ſcene of the moſt diſmal Tragedy that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was acted in <hi>England;</hi> nor cou d they have choſen a more convenient Time or Place for executing their bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous deſign. For the King us d to return late from Hunting, and to croſs the River at <hi>Queensferry,</hi> by <hi>Brentford,</hi> with Five or Six of his Guards. 'Twas alſo his cuſtom to go into the Boat without coming out of his Coach, and aſſoon as he landed on the other ſide, the Coach drove on without expecting the reſt of the Guards, who cou'd not croſs the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver till the Boat return'd to bring <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>em over. In the mean time, the King, with his ſmall Attendance, wou'd have quickly arriv d at the Bridge, which is at the other end of <hi>Brent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> next to <hi>London,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently wou'd have faln into the hands of the Conſpirators, who were to attack him on all ſides.</p>
            <p>They were to be divided into Three Parties, one of which was to come from <hi>Turnham Green,</hi> another from the Lane that leads to the River, and the Third from the Road that goes round <hi>Brentford.</hi> One of theſe
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:49849:74"/>
Troops were to attack the Guards on the Front, and the other in the Rear, while Eight or Ten detach'd Men aſſaulted the Coach, where his Majeſty wou'd have been aſſaſſinated before the Guards whom he left on the other ſide of the River cou'd have come up to his Aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>After the Aſſaſſination the Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators were to have kept together till they came to <hi>Hamerſmith,</hi> a little Town betwixt <hi>Turnham Green</hi> and <hi>London.</hi> There they intended to ſeparate, and afterwards by ſeveral Roads to enter the City, where they hop'd they might lurk ſecurely, during the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Conſternation, till they ſhou'd<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>This Propoſal pleaſed the Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators better than any of the former, <hi>Porter, King,</hi> and <hi>Knightly</hi> were ſent to view the Ground, and upon the Report they made at their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, the Buſineſs was finally agreed upon.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi> had brought Eight hundred Pounds from <hi>France</hi> for the Charge of the Attempt, but finding that he cou'd not carry on
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:49849:75"/>
the Deſign with ſo ſmall a Sum, he complain'd to his Friends, who ſoon found a way to ſupply that Defect. For <hi>Charnock</hi> undertook to provide Eight men ready mounted and arm'd, <hi>Porter</hi> Seven, and Sir <hi>William Parkins</hi> Five: So that <hi>Barclay</hi> was only oblig'd to buy or hire Twenty Horſes for the Officers and Soldiers he had brought from <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Porter</hi> and <hi>Rookwood</hi> commanded the Two Parties that were to attack the Guards; and Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi> reſerv'd the honor of the Aſſaſſinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for himſelf.</p>
            <p>One of the Conſpirators was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd to wait at <hi>Queensferry</hi> till the Guards appear'd, and then immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to give notice to the reſt, that they might have time to prepare themſelves and take their reſpective Poſts, while the King was paſſing the River.' They reſolv'd to form them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into ſeveral Bodies, which were to advance with all poſſible Diligence to the Place appointed for the fatal Rendezvous.</p>
            <p>They had omitted nothing that might ſerve to ſecure and facilitate the Execution of their Attempt.
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:49849:75"/>
They had viſited all the Inns about <hi>Brentford</hi> and <hi>Turnham-green,</hi> and the places where they might ſet up their Horſes till the King ſhou'd return from Hunting.</p>

'Tis the Opinion of ſeveral Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Perſons, that the moſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Diſcovery was made by thoſe who endeavour'd to put the faireſt Conſtruction on this execrable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. For to Levy War againſt the King and his Adherents, after ſuch a manner, and in ſuch Circumſtances, cou'd ſignifie nothing elſe than the Murdering of the King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and of all that lov'd, and were reſolv'd to maintain the Laws, Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and Liberty of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Fifteenth of <hi>February</hi> was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen for the Execution of the dire At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt: 'Twas on that fatal Day that <hi>England,</hi> or rather <hi>Europe,</hi> was to loſe its Deliverer, and with him, all its hopes of accompliſhing the Great Work which he had ſo happily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun; and 'twas then that Heaven was reſolv'd to work a new Miracle for our Preſervation. If we had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen the Danger that threaten'd him, the remembrance of paſt Hazards wou'd have only ſerv'd to heighten our Apprehenſions for the future; His Subjects cou'd hardly have wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com'd him, at his return from ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious a Campaign; and inſtead of ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrating
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:49849:76"/>
his Victories, wou'd have trembl'd at his Approaching Fate. But we found, to our Comfort, that the ſame Providence which had ſo often cover<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d his Head in the Day of Battle, and guarded him from the fierceſt Aſſaults of his Enemies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was alſo able to preſerve him from the treacherous Fury of Aſſaſſins.</p>
            <p>To prevent Suſpicion, they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd their Men in different places of the Town, and even in the remoteſt Parts of it: <hi>Barclay</hi> and <hi>Rookwood</hi> expected the Signal in <hi>Holborn;</hi> and <hi>Porter,</hi> with ſome others, waited, upon the ſame account, at the <hi>Blue Poſts</hi> in <hi>Spring garden.

Thus they lay expecting the News of the King's Departure for <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> but his Majeſty did not go out that day; and ſome of the Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators were ſo alarm'd at this Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, that they began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect either upon the Danger or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy to which ſuch an Attempt wou'd expoſe 'em. <hi>Plowden,</hi> who came pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely to Town to act under <hi>Porter,</hi> went back to the Country, and did not think fit to return, according to his Promiſe. <hi>Kenrick</hi> pretended that he was diſabl'd by a Fall, and appear'd for ſome days with his Arm in a String: <hi>Sherbourn</hi> ſtarted ſo many Scruples, when the Deſign was propos'd to him, that they did not think fit to preſs him further; And even the fierceſt and moſt harden d Aſſaſſins began to be apprehenſive of the Succeſs of their Project.</p>
            <p>But, at laſt, concluding that their Deſign was not diſcover'd, becauſe they were not ſecur'd, Sir <hi>George Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clay,</hi> Sir <hi>William Parkins,</hi> Captain <hi>Porter</hi> and <hi>Goodman,</hi> met on the 21ſt of <hi>February,</hi> and reſolv'd to make a new attempt to execute their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, without altering the Method of

it. In purſuance of this Reſolution, the Aſſaſſins were to be prepar'd for the bloody Action, on <hi>Saturday</hi> the 22d of <hi>February,</hi> which was to have been the laſt Day of our Liberty, and the Fatal <hi>Aera</hi> of the irrecoverable Ruine of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Morning was ſpent in an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient Expectation of Advice from thoſe whom they had appointed to give 'em notice when the King went out. <hi>Charnock,</hi> who for ſome days had been very uneaſy and full of Jealouſy and Suſpicion, ſent a Man to <hi>Porter,</hi> for a Liſt of thoſe who were to act in the Aſſaſſination. He ſeem'd par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to doubt <hi>Larue,</hi> and perhaps was deſirous to have ſome Satisfaction concerning him. The Liſt was ſent to<note place="margin">Francis de La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rue<hi>'s Depoſition,</hi> February 26. 1695/6.</note> him, with <hi>Larue</hi>'s Name at the head of the reſt; and he ſent it back again, after he had inſerted the Names of thoſe whom he was to furniſh.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pendergraſs</hi> was one of thoſe who were with <hi>Porter:</hi> They had ſent for him out of the Country, and wou'd have aſſign'd him a remarkable part in the Aſſaſſination. <hi>Porter</hi> had a Musketoon that carry'd 6 or 8 Bullets, with which <hi>Pendergraſs</hi> was to ſhoot
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:49849:78"/>
at the King; and they deſir'd him not to be afraid of breaking the Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſſes.</p>
            <p>The Conſpirators were diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Second time; and the boldeſt of 'em cou'd not forbear diſcovering their Fears, when <hi>Keys</hi> acquainted 'em that the Guards were come back all in a foam, and that there was an unuſual muttering among the People. This unexpected piece of News put 'em all into a Conſternation; the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Capt.</hi> Porter<hi>'s Depoſition,</hi> March 3. 1695/6.</note> was entirely diſpers'd, and moſt of 'em endeavour'd to ſecure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by a ſpeedy flight.</p>
            <p>Nor was this meerly the effect of a Panic Dread or groundleſs Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion; for the Conſpiracy was actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally detected. <hi>Fiſher, Pendergraſs, Larue,</hi> and another had ſeparately given Information to Different Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons concerning it, tho they had not yet diſcover'd the Particulars.</p>
            <p>Captain <hi>Fiſher</hi> was the Man whom God inclin'd to make the firſt Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of this inhumane Deſign. He went to the Earl of <hi>Portland,</hi> on the Tenth of <hi>February,</hi> Five Days before the Time that was appointed for the Execution of it, and inform'd him of
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:49849:78"/>
the intended Enterprize, without ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting him either with the Time, Manner, or Circumſtances, which were not yet agreed upon: but he promis'd to give him further notice as ſoon as they ſhou'd come to a poſitive Reſolution.</p>
            <p>And now we may juſtly reflect, with an equal amazement, upon the Sedateneſs and Generoſity of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Temper, who cou'd hardly be perſwaded to ſuſpect thoſe who only waited for a convenient opportunity to Murder him; and the barbarous Fury of his Enemies, who ſcrupl d not to conſpire the Death of ſo Good and ſo Brave a Prince. Any other Perſon wou'd have been ſtartl'd at an Advice of this nature, or at leaſt wou'd have look'd upon it as too important to be neglected; but the King, ſecure in his own Vertue, conſcious of no Guilt, and conſequently incapable of Fear, was ſo far from being alarm'd at the Diſcovery, that he wou'd not give credit to it, becauſe the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances were not particularly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Febr. 13.</note> Three Days after, <hi>Fiſher</hi> return'd to <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and gave the Earl of
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:49849:79"/>
               <hi>Portland</hi> an account not only of the Deſign itſelf, but alſo of the Method and order of its Execution. Yet tho he made a full Diſcovery of the Time, Place, and other Circumſtances of the Enterprize, he peremptorily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd to mèntion the names of the Actors; which confirm'd the King in his former opinion, and made him conclude that 'twas a ſtory contriv'd on purpoſe to fright him with a falſe<note place="margin">Febr. 14.</note> Alarm. But, the very day before the Fatal Blow was to be given, God, by a ſeaſonable Providence prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our impending Ruine, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd our King from his own Generous Incredulity.</p>
            <p>It happen'd that, on that very day, the Earl of <hi>Portland</hi> went to ſee the Counteſs of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and, contrary to his cuſtom, made his viſit longer than he deſign'd. By good fortune he call'd to mind that he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd to meet a certain perſon about a private Affair; and tho 'twas al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready time for him to go to <hi>Kenſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> he reſolv'd, according to his uſual exactneſs in keeping his Word, to go firſt to his Lodgings at <hi>Whitehall.</hi> As ſoon as he went in, he found an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:49849:79"/>
perſon in his Antichamber, who deſir'd to ſpeak with him about a matter of the higheſt importance, that cou'd not be deferr'd to another time. This was a ſufficient Argument to obtain what he ask'd, eſpecially in ſuch a juncture The Earl made haſte to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch the perſon whom he had order'd to wait upon him, and immediately ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Stranger, who accoſted him with this ſurprizing Requeſt, <hi>My Lord, perſwade the King to ſtay at home to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>morrow; for if he go abroad to Hunt, he will be Aſſaſſinated.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Afterwards he gave him a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar account of the Conſpiracy, with almoſt theſame Circumſtances that had already been diſcover'd by <hi>Fiſher.</hi> He added, that his Name was <hi>Pendergraſs,</hi> that he was an <hi>Iriſhman,</hi> and a <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic;</hi> that they ſent for him out of the Country, without acquainting him with the reaſon that made 'em deſirous to ſee him; that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they endeavour'd to engage him in the Deſign, that he was ſtruck with horror at the firſt propoſal, and immediately reſolv'd to diſcover it; that his Religion was accus'd for authorizing and encouraging ſuch
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:49849:80"/>
Actions; but that, for his part, he abhorr'd ſuch Principles, tho in all other reſpects he was a true Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.</p>
            <p>Thus his Majeſty began to receive the juſt Reward of his Clemency and Moderation: for he is, and has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been, equally remarkable for his ſtedfaſt adhering to his own Religion, and his Indulgency to thoſe of another Perſwaſion. When he accepted the Crown of <hi>Scotland,</hi> he declar'd <hi>that he wou'd not be a Perſecntor;</hi> and all his Actions are ſo many Illuſtrious Teſtimonies of the Sincerity of that Reſolution. Never any Papiſt, that was willing to live in Peace, ſtood in need of an Inteceſſor with him. He protected 'em in <hi>Ireland</hi> againſt the angry Counſels of ſome over-zealous Proteſtants: He favour'd 'em as much as he cou'd without injuring the reſt of his Subjects, and treated <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>em upon all occaſions, with an Indulgency that ſurpriz'd thoſe who are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Native Goodneſs of his Temper. 'Tis true, this may perhaps be reckon'd, in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and Effect of his Complaiſance to the Family of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> with whom he
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:49849:80"/>
has entertain'd a long and intimate Friendſhip, which has been endear'd by reciprocal Good Offices, and is confirm d and made neceſſary to 'em both, by the Intereſt of their mutual Preſervation. But tho the Papiſts were deprov'd of ſuch powerful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſors; his Virt e alone wou d ſupply that Defect, and ſufficiently recommend 'em to his Favor and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. And we have reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that God is pleas'd with his Mildneſs and Clemency to the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholics in general, and to the <hi>Iriſh</hi> in particular; ſince by a wonderful Providence, he made an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſt the Inſtrument of Saving his Life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pendergraſs</hi> added, that he wou'd have gone ſtraight to <hi>Kenſington,</hi> to make the Diſcovery to the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, if he had not been afraid of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeen and taken notice of by the Two Orderly Men whom the Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators kept in that place; and that ſince the Nature of the Buſineſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd all poſſible Diſpatch, he thought he cou'd not make his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to a Perſon that wou'd be more zealous and careful than his Lordſhip. But tho no means were left unat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:49849:81"/>
to perſwade him to name the Conſpirators, he reſiſted with an invincible Conſtancy all the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that were made uſe of to that effect; declaring that he wou'd ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be prevail'd with to injure his Friends, or betr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y thoſe to whom he had been formerly oblig'd.</p>
            <p>It has been frequently obſerv'd that the moſt trivial Accidents have given birth to the moſt Memorable and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Events: And, upon this Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, it ſeem'd good to that Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme and over ruling Providence which guides the World, that the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of a Prince, in whoſe Life the Fate of <hi>Europe</hi> is bound up, ſhou'd depend upon a Viſit that was made to the Earl of <hi>Portland</hi> at Ten a clock at night.</p>
            <p>At his Arrival at <hi>Kenſington,</hi> which, notwithſtanding all the haſte he cou'd make, was very late, he found that the King was already retir'd, and that he had given the neceſſary Orders for his uſual Recreation the next morning. That Vertuous and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous Prince was preparing to go to <hi>Richmond,</hi> with as ſedate and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concern'd a Mind as if he had not
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:49849:81"/>
receiv'd Intelligence of the bloody Deſign that was to be executed near that place. And even the new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation he receiv'd of it cou'd ſcarce prevail with him to alter his Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, till he was at laſt overcome by my Lord <hi>Portland</hi>'s repeated Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the number of the Diſcoverers encreas<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d, and the Informations they had given were confirm'd by the concurring Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of another of the Conſpirators, who apply'd himſelf to Sir <hi>William Trumbal,</hi> one of His Majeſty's Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Secretaries of State, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd him of the Reality of the Plot, tho he cou'd not acquaint him with the Circumſtances of it. For that Miniſter had already receiv'd advice that the <hi>French</hi> were bringing toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a great number of Tranſport-Ships, and making all the neceſſary Preparations for an extraordinary Deſign, which was kept very Secret, tho, in all probability, the Storm was like to fall upon <hi>England</hi> So that comparing theſe Advices concerning a Foreign Invaſion, with the Account he had receiv'd of the Deſign againſt
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:49849:82"/>
His Majeſtys Perſon, he found that they confirm'd each other, tho he cou'd hardly look upon either of 'em as probable, when he conſider'd 'em Singly. And therefore he made all poſſible haſte to communicate theſe Diſcoveries to His Majeſty, with his uſual Zeal and Fidelity.</p>
            <p>About the ſame time Brigadier <hi>Lewſon</hi> acquainted the King, that one <hi>Larue</hi> had inform'd him of a Deſign that was on foot to Aſſaſſinate His Majeſty. This laſt Diſcoverer gave a very particular and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Account of the whole In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue; but He, as well as the reſt, ſeem'd obſtinately reſolv'd to conceal the Names of the Conſpirators.</p>
            <p>The King, convinc'd by ſo many Concurring Informations, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that all the Accounts he had receiv d agreed exactly with one another, began to believe the Truth of the Diſcovery. He order'd the Earl of <hi>Portland</hi> and Sir <hi>William Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi> to make a more particular En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry into the Progreſs and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the Deſign; the Former as having receiv d the firſt Advice of the Conſpiracy againſt His Perſon,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:49849:82"/>
and the Latter as having been firſt acquainted with the Plot againſt the Nation.</p>
            <p>'Twas a very Difficult Task to manage ſo nice an Enquiry; for tho they had Four Witneſſes, they cou d not produce one Legal Evidence. They cou'd not ſtifle the Informations they had receiv'd without expoſing his Majeſty's Life to the brutiſh Fury of Aſſaſſins, who wou d ſoon find another Way to execute their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable Project: Nor could they publiſh a Diſcovery which they cou'd not prove, without running the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of being charg'd with the firſt Invention of it And beſides, the Divulging of theſe Advices wou'd have encourag'd the Conſpirators to carry on their Deſign, and perhaps made 'em haſten the Execution of it, leaſt they ſhou<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d at laſt be entirely diſcover'd, and receive the juſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of their Crimes</p>
            <p>In the mean time the King reſolv'd to expoſe his Life to all the Dangers that threaten'd it, if it cou'd not be ſecur'd without violating the uſual Forms of Juſtice. So that we were like to periſh by thoſe very Laws that
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:49849:83"/>
were contriv'd and eſtabliſh'd for our Preſervation, if the Earl of <hi>Portland</hi> had not found out an Expedient to ward off the Blow without having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to any indirect of unwarrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Stratagem. He conſider'd, that <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergraſs</hi> and <hi>Larue</hi> might be perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to diſcover the whole Myſtery, if the King himſelf ſhou'd ſpeak to em, and that even tho they ſhou'd refuſe to yield to His Majeſty s Solicitations, the Information they were willing to give might ſerve to Convict the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators, if it were deliver'd in the preſence of unexceptionable Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, who might Depoſe it at their Trials.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The King himſelf cou'd not be an Evidence; and therefore 'twas neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that there ſhou'd be at leaſt Two Witneſſes preſent, when he diſcours'd with 'em He ſpoke to</hi> Pendergraſs <hi>and</hi> Larue <hi>ſeparately; to the Firſt before the Earl of</hi> Portland <hi>and the Lord</hi> Cutts, <hi>and to the Second, in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the ſame Earl and Brigadeer</hi> Lewſon. <hi>After he had aſſur'd 'em that he eſteem'd their Perſons, and was extremely pleas'd with their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings; he told 'em,</hi> That he own'd
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:49849:83"/>
himſelf oblig d to 'em for the Care they took to preſerve his Life; <hi>but deſir d 'em to conſider,</hi> that the Service they had done him by diſcovering the Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy cou d be of no uſe to him, ſo long as they conceal'd the Names of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators; that he cou d neither Puniſh nor ſo much as Convict the Criminals; that the People wou d never be perſwaded to believe that ſeveral Perſons had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd a Conſpiracy which they either cou'd not, or wou d not juſtify; that, on the contrary, they wou'd imagine that he had invented a Sham-plot to deſtroy his Enemies, which wou'd render him odious to all the World; that ſo general and Imperfect a Diſcovery wou'd expoſe his Honor without Securing his Life, &amp;c. <hi>Theſe Arguments produc d the deſir d Effect, and conquer'd the obſtinacy of the Diſcoverers: They cou'd not reſiſt the awful Eloquence of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur d Monarch, and were at laſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd with to make an Atonement for their Guilt by diſcovering their Fellow-Criminals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After his Majeſty was acquainted with the Names and Deſigns of the Conſpirators, he told the Cabinet Council, that he had for ſome time
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:49849:84"/>
neglected the Advices he had receiv'd of a Conſpiracy againſt his Perſon; but ſince by the favourable Providence of God, he was fully convinc d of the Truth of it, he wou'd not tamely Suffer himſelf to be aſſaſſinated. He added that he was inform'd the <hi>French</hi> were peparing to Invade the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but that he hop'd God wou'd enable him to fruſtrate their Deſigns.</p>
            <p>Not long after, he call'd the Great Council, and communicated the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery to them. He receiv'd, from both, particular Aſſurances of Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Affection, and immediately iſſued out a Proclamation requiring all his loving Subjects to apprehend the Conſpirators, and promiſing a Reward of a Thouſand Pounds for every one that ſhou d be ſeiz'd</p>
            <p>The Parliament was not yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Danger that threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en'd the Nation; but aſſoon as His Majeſty was convinc'd of the Reality of the Conſpiracy, and cou'd pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Witneſſes to prove it, he went to <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> on the 24th of <hi>Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,</hi> and made the following Speech to both Houſes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:49849:84"/>
My Lords and Gentlemen,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Am come hither this Day upon an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Occaſion which might have prov'd Fatal, if it had not been Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the Singular Mercy and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God; And may now, by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of the ſame Providence, and our own Prudent Endeavonrs be ſo Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd, as to become a ſufficient Warning to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s to provide for Our Security againſt the Pernicious Practices and Attempts of Our Enemies.</p>
            <p>I have receiv'd ſeveral Concurring In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of a Deſign to Aſſoſſinate Me, and that Our Enemies, at the ſame time, are very forward in their Preparations for a ſudden Invaſion of this Kingdom, And have therefore Thought it neceſſary to loſe no Time in Acquainting My Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with theſe Things, in which the ſafety of the Kingdom and the Public Welfare are ſo nearly Concern'd, That I Aſſure My Self, nothing will be Omitted on your Part, which may be Thought pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for Our Preſent or Future Security.</p>
            <p>I have not been Wanting to give the Neceſſary Orders for the Fleet; And I Hope, We have ſuch a Strength of Ships, and in ſuch a Readineſs, as will be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:49849:85"/>
to Diſappoint the Intentions of our Enemies.</p>
            <p>I have alſo Diſpatch'd Orders for bringing Home ſuch a Number of Our Troops, as may Secure <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s from any At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</p>
            <p>Some of the Conſpirators againſt My Perſon are already in Cuſtody, and Care is taken to Apprehend ſo many of the reſt as are Diſcover'd: And ſuch other Orders are given, as the preſent Exigency of Affairs does abſolutely Require, at this Time, for the Public Safety.</p>
            <p>My Lords and Gentlemen,</p>
            <p>Having now Acquainted you with the Danger, which hath threaten'd <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, I cannot Donbt of your Readineſs and Zeal, to do every Thing which you ſhall judge Proper for Our Common Safety: And I perſwade My Self, We muſt be all Senſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, how neceſſary it is in Our preſent Circumſtances, That all poſſible Diſpatch ſhould be given to the Buſineſs before you.</p>
            <p>The Proclamation and His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Speech publiſh'd the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy, and made us Senſible of the dreadful Ruine which we had ſo
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:49849:85"/>
narrowly eſcap'd. All <hi>England</hi> was alarm d at the Surprizing News: an univerſal Horror was diffus'd thro the whole Nation; we trembl'd to think of the amazing Danger which humane Wiſdom cou'd neither have foreſeen nor prevented, and were ſcarcely capable of reflecting upon our preſent Deliverance. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy was the only Subject both of our Thoughts and Diſcourſe: We look d upon the execrable Deſign and the treacherous Contrivers of it, with a juſt Abhorrence and Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and every one ador'd a Miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Providence in which All were ſo nearly concern d<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>Some reflected upon the Maſſacres, Burnings and Perſecutions, and all the other diſmal Inſtances of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable Rage of the Faction in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times; and concluded that the Conſpirators were afraid we had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten the Sufferings of our Anceſtors, and intended to refreſh our Memory by re-acting the ſame Barbarities.</p>
            <p>Others entertain d themſelves with the melancholy Proſpect of our future Condition, if Heaven, to puniſh our Crimes, had ſuffer'd our Enemies to
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:49849:86"/>
deprive us of our Glorious Deliverer. And even the calmeſt Minds cou'd not preſerve their wonted Tranquillity, when they conſider'd that after we had ſuſtain'd ſo vaſt an Expence of Blood and Treaſure to maintain our Religion and Liberty; after we had been deliver'd from Arbitrary Power by the miraculous Aſſiſtance of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and <hi>Ireland</hi> reduc'd by glorious Victories; after we had made our ſelves Maſters of the Sea, and began to be Conquerors on Land; that after theſe and ſo many other Bleſſings of Providence, we ſhou'd have been forc'd to reſume our broken Fetters, and ſubmit to the Inſolent Revenge of a baffl'd Enemy.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who conſider'd the Poſture of Affairs abroad, were ſoon convinc'd that the exeution of this deteſtable Project wou'd have been no leſs Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to <hi>Europe</hi> in general, than to <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> in particular. They were ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that Our Diſaſter wou'd have broken the Confederacy; and that twou'd have been equally dangerous to the Allies, to conclude a Peace, or continue the War.</p>
            <p>Theſe were ſome of the Reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:49849:86"/>
that were made upon this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by particular Perſons, while all, in general, were employ'd in bleſſing God for their wonderful Preſervation, and admiring the adorable Wiſdom of Providence, which had not only diſappointed the Deſigns of our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, but ſo over-rul'd their Malice, that their Projects ſerv'd only to confirm and ſtrengthen the Union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the King and his People, by the Intereſt of their mutual Preſervation.</p>

Since the Faction endeavor'd to deſtroy King <hi>James</hi> the I. and his Parliament by the famous Gun-pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Conſpiracy, they have been ſtill intent upon the Helliſh Deſign, and forming new Projects to deſtroy us. 'Tis thought they were active Promoters of the Civil War, which diſturb'd the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, and was attended with conſequences that will for ever be lamented by the Nation. And none but thoſe who are ſorry for the bad Succeſs of their Contrivances, will deny, that the Son and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Succeſſor of that unfortunate Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, was influenc'd by their perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Councils; that they made him jealous of his moſt faithful Subjects, and at laſt perſwaded him to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the very Foundations of our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, by deſtroying the Freedom of Elections, and Governing his People without the Advice of his Parliament. During the late Reign they attack'd us with Authority, and have been ever ſince endeavoring to regain the Ground they loſt by the Revolution. The ſame Deſign is ſtill carry'd on, but with this happy difference, that
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:49849:87"/>
Loyalty is become at laſt the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Mark of Honeſt Men, and Traitors to their Country are look'd upon as Traitors to the Government. For, tho Treachery is uſually ſaid to be more dangerous than open Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; yet after all a Wiſe man wou'd rather chuſe, that the Enemies of his Country ſhou'd be Plotters than Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors.</p>
            <p>The Faction (which, thanks to Heaven, we can now call, <hi>The Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected Party)</hi> cannot endure a Prince, who not only will not help 'em to deſtroy the Nation, but was the Inſtrument whom God choſe to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it; and who, inſtead of relying upon the Councils and Aſſiſtance of the Cabal, makes it his principal care to preſerve an entire Confidence and inſeparable Union betwixt Him and His Parliament. Leſs than this wou d have been ſufficient to make the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction Diſpute his Title; tho the very Hatred of thoſe who Diſpute it, may be juſtly look'd upon as an evident and unexceptionable Confirmation of it.</p>
            <p>'Tis to be preſum'd that there are a conſiderable number of Perſons en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd.

in the Party who have Senſe enough to perceive, that 'tis impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to controvert His Majeſty s Right to the Crown, without denying us the common and moſt eſſential Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges of a Nation. For unleſs they pretend, with the moſt furiouſly bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotted Papiſts, that the Conſent of the Head of their Church is neceſſary for the Eſtabliſhment of the Secular Power, or, ſuffer themſelves to be ſo miſerably deluded by a new ſort of Fanaticiſm as to imagine, that every Race of Kings is eſtabliſh'd by an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Oracle or ſupernatural Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; they cannot refuſe to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that the Safety and Conſent of the People were the primitive and moſt ſacred Foundations of Soveraign Authority; and that the unanimous Suffrages of thoſe who thought fit to enter into Societies for their own Preſervation, was the Voice of God himſelf, in the firſt Eſtabliſhment of Monarchy.</p>

<pb n="175" facs="tcp:49849:89"/>
Liberty. And ſuppoſing that this was formerly a Conquer'd Kingdom, tis plain that the Conqueror cou'd not become a Lawful Monarch, but by Treating with the Nation, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving its ancient Privileges; ſince a True King muſt be the Governor of Subjects, and not of Slaves. 'Twou'd be a direct overturning of the Order of Nature to pretend, with our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, that the Soveraign Authority in <hi>England</hi> is originally Arbitrary, and that the People are only Free by Uſurpation; ſince, by the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Conſtitution of our Government, the People are originally free, and the Royal Authority Limited.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Roman</hi> Catholics were natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally diſpos'd to embrace theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Notions: for 'tis one of the Principles of their Religion, that the Pope's Juriſdiction extends over the Temporal Authority of Kings, and the Property of the People; and that thoſe whom he Depoſes or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicates, are, <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> depriv'd of all their Rights and Privileges. 'Tis true this Opinion has been look d upon as dangerous, even by the Princes of that Perſuaſion, who are
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:49849:90"/>
not willing that their Authority ſhou'd depend on the Arbitrary Will of One Man. And from thence ſome have taken occaſion to call thoſe <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholics</hi> who moderate the Power of the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> and only to give the Name of <hi>Papiſts</hi> to thoſe who require an unlimited Submiſſion to the Pope. But this Diſtinction was never ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally known or teceiv'd in this Kingdom as in other places. For in Popiſh Countries, 'tis the Intereſt of the Prince to inſpire his People with a leſs extravagant reſpect to the Head of their Church: whereas in <hi>England,</hi> where the <hi>Roman Catholics</hi> have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Prince nor Magiſtrate of their Perſwaſion, they are wholly govern'd by their Directors, and follow all their Maxims, unleſs they have Senſe enough to perceive the dangerous Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of theſe Opinions, or by the Mildneſs and Integrity of their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, are naturally inclin'd to deteſt ſuch a barbarous and inhumane Doctrin. But, in the general, they are eaſily perſwaded to look upon Proteſtants as Men that have forfeited all their Privileges, and are already doom'd to Death, for the Crimes of
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:49849:90"/>
Hereſy and Schiſm, by the repeated Sentences of ſeveral Councils. And 'tis plain that thoſe who are poſſeſt with ſuch a Prejudice will never heartily acknowledge the Title of a Proteſtant Prince; ſince they reckon our Religion a ſufficient ground to deprive a People of the natural Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges of a Civil Society.</p>
            <p>It has been, upon all cccaſions, the conſtant Practice of the Faction, to accommodate their Notions to the various Humours and Inclinations of thoſe whom they endeavor to draw into their Party.

            <p>They labour'd to perſwade the World that the late King might juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſume an Arbitrary Power, that he might reign without a Parliament, and abſolutely renounce all Contracts with his People.

            <p>Bleſſed be that Almighty Goodneſs which defeated the Contrivances of our Enemies, and gave us a King, upon whom they cou'd never faſten the leaſt Aſperſion, who manages the Reins of Government with an equal and Steddy Hand; who never was, and we have reaſon to believe, never will be Guilty either of Tyranny or Remiſsneſs; who will neither oppreſs us himſelf, nor Suffer us to oppreſs one another; and has always purſu'd

His Majeſty's Speech to both Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes was ſeconded by Sir <hi>William Trumbal,</hi> who, in a Pathetic Harangue before the Houſe of Commons, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted that Illuſtrious Body with the particular Characters of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, the uniformity of their Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and the improbability of their Conſpiring together to deceive us; and from all theſe Conſiderations concluded that there was never leſs reaſon to doubt the Truth of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy than of This. Such a diſcourſe as this was very Seaſonable, and even neceſſary at a time, when ſeveral Perſons were endeavoring to make the whole Diſcovery paſs for a Ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, either becauſe they imagin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d that the King and Council had been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd upon, or perhaps becauſe they wiſh'd that we had been convinc'd of the reality of the Deſign by the Execution of it.

            <p>WHereas there has been a Horrid and Deteſtable Conſpiracy, Formed and Carried on by Papiſts, and other Wicked and Traiterous Perſons, for Aſſaſſinating his Majeſty's Royal Perſon, in Order to Incourage an Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from <hi>France,</hi> to Subvert our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, Laws, and Liberty: We whoſe Names are hereunto Subſcribed, do Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily, Sincerely, and Solemnly Profeſs, Teſtifie and Declare, That his Preſent Majeſty, King <hi>William,</hi> is Rightful and Lawful King of theſe Realms. And
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:49849:95"/>
we do Mutually Promiſe and Engage to Stand by and Aſſiſt each other, to the utmoſt of our Power, in the Support and Defence of His Majeſty's moſt Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Perſon and Government, againſt the late King <hi>James,</hi> and all his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents. And in caſe his Majeſty come to any Violent or Untimely Death (which God forbid) We do hereby further Freely and Unanimouſly Oblige our Selves, to Unite, Aſſociate, and Stand by each other, in Revenging the ſame upon his Enemies, and their Adherents; and in Supporting and Defending the Succeſſion of the Crown, according to an Act made in the Firſt Year of the Reign of King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> Intituled, <hi>An Act Declaring the Rights and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of the Subject, and Settling the Succeſſion of the Crown.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Majeſty receiv'd the Aſſociation very graciouſly, and expreſs d the Senſe he had of the Zeal and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Subjects in theſe obliging Terms.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:49849:96"/>
Gentlemen,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Take this as a moſt Convincing and moſt Acceptable Evidence of your Affection: And as you have freely Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated your Selves for Our Common Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I do Heartily enter into the ſame Aſſociation; and will be always ready with you and the reſt of My Good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, to Venture My Life againſt all who ſhall endeavour to ſubvert the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, Laws, and Liberties of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And afterwards His Majeſty was pleas'd to ſay,</hi> That he would take care, that this, and all other Aſſociations pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to Him, ſhou'd be Lodg'd among the Records in the <hi>Tower.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While the Parliament was taking ſuch effectual meaſures for the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his Majeſty and the Nation; 'twas thought fit, in the moſt legal and regular manner, to ſatisfy of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended Juſtice, by the Conviction and Puniſhment of ſome of the moſt notorious Conſpirators. 'Twou'd be needleſs to give the Reader a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar account, either of the Proceedings at the Trials, or of the Behaviour of
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:49849:96"/>
the Dying Criminals; ſince there can be nothing added to the public Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of the former, and there is nothing remarkable in the latter but Hypocriſy and Paſſion. This is the genuine Character of the Declarations they left us of their laſt Thoughts. One of 'em owns the Crime for which<note place="margin">Charnock.</note> he was condemn'd with a kind of impious Oſtentation; and yet, in another place of the ſame Paper, he ſeems to acknowledge the Infamy of it, by endeavouring to vindicate his Party from having any hand in it. Another, in ſpite of Nature, wou'd<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sir</hi> John Freind.</note> act the Part of a Hero, and was not aſham d to pretend that he dy'd a Martyr, tho 'tis plain both by his Conviction and Confeſſion, that his Puniſhment was the juſt Reward of his Treaſonable Practices to betray the Nation to Papiſts and Foreigners. One of 'em is angry with the King,<note place="margin">Rookwood.</note> becauſe he wou d not pardon a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Aſſaſſin, and was the firſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that ever had the Confidence to charge His Majeſty with Cruelty: And another leaves us a terrible In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance<note place="margin">Cranbourn.</note> of the Divine Juſtice in har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dening impenitent Offenders, by
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:49849:97"/>
ending his Life in a Tranſport of Fury.</p>
            <p>But ſince nothing can excuſe us from doing Juſtice even to our moſt barbarous and implacable Enemies, I think my ſelf oblig'd to make a more honorable mention of Sir <hi>William Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins.</hi> He acknowledges the Aſſaſſina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be a Crime, and repents that he was concern'd in it. He ſeems to have been acted by a miſtaken No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Honor, and to have aim'd at an Appearance of Magnanimity, which he did not well underſtand. For he wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d not be perſwaded to name the Complices of his Crime, tho he had ſome reaſon to believe, that an inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous Confeſſion might have procur'd him a Pardon. A generous Principle, if it had been better plac'd, and if, by preſerving his Friends, he had not ſav'd the Enemies of his Country.</p>
            <p>The Convicted Criminals receiv'd the Sentence and Puniſhment which the Law appoints for Traitors; and their Quarters were expos'd in the moſt oublic places, as a terrible Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the juſt Severity of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd Nation, and an Admonition to their Traiterous Friends, that thoſe
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:49849:97"/>
who are not capable of nobler Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments might at leaſt be reſtrain'd by Fear.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Faction per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that all their pernicious Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices were either diſcover'd or defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, reſolv'd at leaſt, to pay the laſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors to their expiring Cauſe. Three <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobite</hi> Clergy-men, pretending to be Miniſters of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> under pretext of aſſiſting Sir <hi>John Friend</hi> and Sir <hi>William Parkins</hi> a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> their Death, gave 'em a general Abſolution for all their Sins, without obliging 'em either to confeſs or declare their Abhorrence of the particular Crime for which they ſuffer'd; and by ſuch an impudent and irregular Action put a public Affront upon the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and the Nation.</p>
            <p>Two of 'em were apprehended in order to be proſecuted for ſo hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous a Miſdeameanor; and, in the mean time, the Church, of which they pretended to be Members con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd their Proceedings in a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Declaration of its Judgment on that occaſion, which was ſign'd by Fourteen Biſhops who were then in Town, and approv'd by thoſe who
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:49849:98"/>
               <note place="margin">A Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſenſe of Archbiſhops, Biſhops, &amp;c.</note> were abſent. In that Paper, they declare that they diſclaim and deteſt the Principles and Practices both of the Criminals, and the Three Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters who aſſiſted 'em; that they diſown and abhor 'em, as highly Schiſmatical and Seditious, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous both to the Church and State, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thus while our Enemies both at home and abroad, were mourning the Fate of their blaſted Project, while they ſuffer'd all the Horrors and Torments of Rage and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, the conſtant Attendants of Diſappointed Revenge; we had the pleaſure to behold the happy Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of the diſmal Tragedy, and the bleſt Event of the blackeſt and moſt barbarous Deſign that ever was ſet on foot. We obſerv'd, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible ſatisfaction, that our Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Protector had convinc'd our Enemies, by a very unwelcome Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, of two important Truths, which they cou'd never endure to believe, That His Majeſty's Life is neceſſary for the Preſervation of his People; and that his Subjects are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparably
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:49849:98"/>
united to him, both by Duty, Intereſt, and Inclination. This is a glorious Confirmation of the Title which they preſume to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trovert, and a convincing Proof of the Juſtice of his Cauſe, which God himſelf has vouchſaf'd to eſtabliſh and confirm, by the execrable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects that were form'd againſt him.</p>
            <p>The World has been ſo long ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtom'd to ſee his Majeſty expoſe his Life for the Preſervation of his Subjects; he has brav'd Death ſo often, and run thro ſo many Dangers in our Defence, that it cannot be ſuppos'd we ſhou'd be ſurpriz'd at every new Inſtance of his Genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity. But that the Preſervation of his ſingle Life ſhou'd ſecure a whole Nation from impending Ruine; that the Rebels at home durſt not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to diſturb our Quiet, becauſe they knew that he was alive; that our Foreign Enemies ſhou'd immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately retire upon the News of his Deliverance; that the whole Nation ſhou'd place their only Confidence in the Perſon of their Soveraign, and enter into a ſolemn and unanimous Confederacy to Defend his Life, and
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:49849:99"/>
Revenge his Death, there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo ſurprizingly Great in ſuch a Combination of Wonders, and ſo conſpicuous Marks of the <hi>Finger of God</hi> in the ſeveral Inſtances of our Happineſs, that 'twou'd be equally impious and abſurd, to aſcribe our Deliverance to a lucky concourſe of fortuitous Accidents.</p>
            <p>As His Majeſty's Life is our only Security, and the Foundation of all our Hopes; the happy Union that is now ſo firmly eſtabliſh'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt us and our Soveraign, is of no leſs importance to the reſt of <hi>Europe.</hi> To this we owe the advantageous Change in the Poſture of Affairs, abroad; 'tis this that has reduc'd our Enemies to more reaſonable Terms, and makes way for the Concluſion of a general and ſolid Peace.</p>
            <p>When the long expected Time ſhall come, that the Juſt Deſires of thoſe who long to ſee Peace and Tranquility once more eſtabliſh'd in <hi>Europe</hi> ſhall be accompliſh'd; it will appear, and be acknowledg'd by the grateful World, that as <hi>England</hi> was deliver'd from Slavery and Oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:49849:99"/>
by the Bleſſing of God upon His Majeſtys generous Undertaking, ſo 'twas <hi>England</hi> that had the greateſt ſhare in the general Deliverance of the Chriſtian World.</p>
            <p>Time and Experience will ere long convince us of this great and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Truth, and Poſterity will for ever acknowledge the Immortal Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation. And even tho it were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that future Ages ſhou'd forget their Great Benefactor, the Benefit will remain, notwithſtanding their Ingratitude, as long as there ſhall be Laws in <hi>England,</hi> or a Free People in <hi>Europe.</hi>
