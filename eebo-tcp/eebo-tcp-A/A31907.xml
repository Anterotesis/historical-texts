            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE To the MEMBERS of the Romiſh Church.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Otwithſtanding the Dedication of this Pamphlet be direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to you, I have, contrary to Cuſtom, addreſs'd it to thoſe of our own Church; the great zeal I ever had for her Proſperity cauſing me to obſerve a conſiderable Party under her ſhelter that expreſſed but a cool reſentment of a Plot, though they cannot deny one; and my deſign being as well to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the wavering, as to ſoften the obſtinate, I inferr'd, they could not be without a juſt claim to the meaning of theſe Papers: And thinking it not proper to link you together, I have choſe rather to make of you Standers-by, and Hearers, in order to a converſion, whilſt I freely exert and lay my ſelf out upon them. I hope to obtain my end here, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ill ſucceſs I meet with from you; it being the only way I can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to ſecure us from the effect of a Plot; for 'tis well known, after your Conſpiracies are diſcovered, your firſt Artifice is to inſinuate an opinion of your Innocence, and then to induce Men to argue againſt, and queſtion Circumſtances, by your Arts adulterated and made contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and laſtly, to drill them on to a disbelief of all; than which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can he more menacing the ſafety of the Government; your Intereſt hereby being unſhaken, and a Liberty given of entring into new Cabals, and of acting as with more ſecurity, ſo with more power and ſtrength. I wiſh you could part with a little of that ſtiffneſs and obſtinacy which is ſeen amongſt you all, Reaſon then might probably hope to be careſs'd, and Matters without bitterneſs impartially diſcuſs'd; but I confeſs I always had ſlender hopes of your acknowledging a Conviction in Caſes of this nature; and therefore am prone to think my labour will turn to no account upon ſo hard and ſtony a Ground. However, I could not but give you this opportunity of being diſabus'd, in imitation of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who thought it the Duty of his Apoſtolical Function to preach the Goſpel in many Places where he was aſſur'd before-hand it would never be received. I know there are great difficulties to be encountered
<pb facs="tcp:95476:3"/>
before you dare think of owning a Plot; for the most of you are ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlav'd, noſe-ring'd, and drag'd by your ambitious Prieſts, that a Man under their Tuition has no more to do with his own Soul, than a Bear with his Snout, that veers and anſwers to every check of his teſty Kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. A Popiſh-Prieſt accounts himſelf God's Church-warden of Souls, ſeizes them, and manages their Eternal Concerns as he pleaſes; the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of his ſeduced Flock exactly reſembling the Poors Boxes that are made to receive any thing he ſhall think fit to put in, Braſs, Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, or any other baſe Metal; How ſhould we expect then a Confeſſion from you, when your Prieſts keep the Keys, and you cannot unlock with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them? or if you could, conſcious of the great diſparagement and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace that would accrue to your Religion thereby, you would think it your beſt Intereſt to deny and for ſwear any criminous Informations againſt you. Again, there is a ſort to moſt of you comparatively harmleſs, I mean the modiſh Sparks of your Church, who will not acknowledge a Plot in point of Honour, leſt it ſhould condemn that Religion which they believe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail'd upon them with their Anceſtors Eſtates; and therefore judge it as great a ſcandal to change hereditary Errors, as to aſsume new Coats of Arms, and deface the old, both of them being eſteemed as the Ancient Bearings of their Families. But in ſhort, whatever gueſſes me may make at the Reaſons of your averſion to reveal and diſcover, this is unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niably plain and palpable, That you are ſo muzled by Infallibility, that you muſt believe upon pain of damnation every thing your Church ſays, both in relation to this Plot, and all other Affairs in the World touching his Holineſs. But I look upon this as a Curſe the Almighty uſually annexes to a falſe Religion, to give the Members of it over to be deluded and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatuated, to have their Judgments corrupted and depraved, and to create in them a diſpoſition to believe all manner of Lies, Falſhoods and Diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulations: And then the Conſequence of this deluſion is their having a perverſe Notion of Good and Evil, an inverted ſenſe of Sin and Villany, which is the ſole Cauſe of that violent ferment and fever we ſo often find in diſtemper'd Governments. 'Tis from hence the Sacred Heroes of your Church endeavour to deſtroy the Morals and Religion of Nature it ſelf, to raſe out and annihilate the firſt and greateſt Principles of Humanity; as to account it no breach of the <hi>6th</hi> Commandment to kill any that ſhall not favour their Deſigns, or cheriſh their Opinions; to ſtate it as a Meritorious Act to murder the Lord's Annointed, when they have branded him with the mark of Heretick; as aſſuring the impious Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor he will be hurried to Heaven, though the Almighty has declar'd he ſhall be damn'd. Theſe outrages of Barbarity they practiſe, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Requiſites to promote the Intereſt and Pomp of your Church; the Commiſſion of all kinds of Sins, they account but a ſlight cracking
<pb facs="tcp:95476:3"/>
the Tables of Stone, which becauſe it is done upon the ſcore of God and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, any of their wicked Caſuiſts can cement, and make more firm than ever. Religion heretofore recommended it ſelf to the World by the Piety and Vertue of its Votaries; they that led the beſt and moſt innocent Lives, were concluded to be of the ſoundeſt Opinions, and worthy the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation of Good Men; but now the Scene is changed, a modern faſhion has invaded us that's better received, and more zealouſly practiſed: Men in theſe times chooſe their Religion by the viciouſneſs of her Profeſſors; he that can ſhew the largeſt Catalogue of Crimes, is ſuppoſed to have acted beſt for the Honour and Reputation of his Church; the most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Sinner is adjudg'd the greatest Saint; and as we reckon him a ſneaking Butcher that never ſtole a Hide, or kill'd a Sheep, ſo he, by the Pope, is reputed a raſcally Jeſuite, of a ſpurious Litter, that has not fir'd a Houſe, or stab'd a Justice. The first Order and Diſcipline in your Seminaries, for the training up Youth, is long ſince taken to pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and a new one Instituted; your Novices are instructed not in talka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Argument for Religion, but a real athletick Contest for it; your Schools of Diſputation are turned into thoſe of Fencing; and he that can boast himſelf the greatest Proficient in the Art of Poiſoning, ſlight of Stabbing, and skill in making Fire-balls, is esteemed better qualified for the Service of Holy Church, the Defence of her Uſurpations, than either of her Impertinent Champions <hi>Baronius</hi> or <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> And I must confeſs, you have hit upon right Meaſures, this is infallibly the most expedite and ſucceſsful manner of promoting Religion that can be; that of Reaſon and Argument is very teadious, and People are won but ſlowly by it; in this Caſe, if you meet with a Man tough and tenacious of his own Senſe, 'tis but cutting his Throat, and the Work is done; for 'tis in effect gaining a Proſelyte by destroying a Heretick. Gentlemen, in ſhort, I am of opinion, 'tis as impoſſible to find a violent Papist with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Head full of crafty Deſigns and Tricks to advance the credit of his Religion, as it is to conceive any Man to be careleſs and negligent of the thing he most esteems and values; but that which most impetuouſly drives you on in the purſuit of your aims, is a perſwaſion that your Works justifie, and are merit of themſelves to ſave you, without the neceſſary condition of a good Life; and within this Magick Circle the Devil him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf wants skill to fright you; no hazards, no wickedneſs can daunt you. Hanging and Quartering you embrace as the Illustrious Badges of Martyrdom, and what we term the ignominy and deſert of Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, you call the Glory and Reward of Saints; ſo that Justice which ſhould lop off and deaden your Villanies, by this means ſeems preposte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly to aſſist and ſuccour them, and to give life to new Plots by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting the old. And, Gentlemen, will you not confeſs there is a Plot?
<pb facs="tcp:95476:4"/>
Will you deny that your Prieſts are of ſuch reſtleſs and furious Tempers? Will you ſtill ſtile it the ſlander of Innocency, the misfortune of Good Men, and the affliction of Saints? with the ſame Impudence we expect you will deny the noted Powder-Plot, the ſavage Maſſacre in <hi>Ireland,</hi> the ſeveral Barbarous Aſſaſinations in <hi>France,</hi> others in <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Lituania.</hi> You will deny too, that ſome of your harmleſs Jeſuites were hang'd in, and the reſt drove out of <hi>China</hi> by the Emperour for their Plots and Underminings there. 'Tis not long ſince they grew ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous in the Court of <hi>France,</hi> that they were ſentenc'd to perpetual ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment by that Monarch; and though by their ſubtilties and arts they have wound themſelves in again, yet he employs them with the ſame fear and circumſpection the Common People do Fire, which though it be neceſsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to warm them, and boil or roaſt their Meat, yet are they loath to truſt it out of ſight, without a faithful Watch-man. Therefore, Gentlemen, be better natur'd, acknowledge you have your ſhare of evil and turbulent Men; they are in all Societies more or fewer, 'tis no ſhame to own it. This is all I deſire and beg of you, 'twill be a great Point gain'd, and the moſt reaſonable requeſt in the World, for then you cannot ſay 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible there ſhould be a Plot; there may be one, and there may not, ſhall be your Card, which is the fitteſt Preparative I can hope or wiſh for in order to your candid reading the following Pages.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE prevailing Motive (as I hinted before) to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards this Eſſay, is my great Concern at the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief of ſome, and the doubts of others about the late Popiſh Plot; having heard Men of all ſorts and Qualities in Coffee-houſes, and at other publick Meetings, conſtantly ſingling out this for the Topick of their Diſcourſe. Amongſt this Mixture of Men, as their Senſe is differing, ſo their Opinions are various; ſome doubting and queſtioning many Circumſtances of the Evidence; others obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting againſt the Reputation and Honeſty of the Witneſſes; one condemning the Plot in groſs, looking upon it as a Forgery, and meer Fiction of Intereſt to depreſs the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Faction; another concluding it a ſly Trick of demeur <hi>Jack Presbyter</hi> to ſet the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt and the Loyal Proteſtant to worry one another; to weaken and enfeeble the Party of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and then, like a Rebellious Cheat, to vault himſelf into the great Saddle of Government. 'Tis not my purpoſe to determine which of theſe Deſigns the Plot was form'd for; a Plot there was, and for ought I know ſtill is, againſt the beſt of Kings, the Pureſt of Religions, and the freeſt of Governments: And of how dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95476:5"/>
a Conſequence it is not to have a firm and earneſt belief of this Plot, is the whole deſign of this Pamphlet to inſinuate. As I always thought, uſurping the Sovereignty of Cenſure, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming the Monopoly of Judging, was not to be tolerated; ſo on the other ſide I ever look'd upon a looſneſs of talking, and liberty of thinking any thing, no leſs inſupportable, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore concluded extravagancies in belief were as puniſhable by the Magiſtrate, as Corruptions in Manners; Errors in Opinion upon any ſmall diſguſt of the diſaffected Party being ſoon hatch'd into diſorders and breaches of the publick Peace and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Thus it is in relation to the Plot; if every Man muſt be his own Carver, and permitted to believe what he pleaſes of it, it will ſoon dwindle into a Chymera, and vaniſh into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of a Romance; for whilſt one denys what the other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves, and a third rejects what both of them believe, and ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, till there are as many Opinions as Men, and theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from perverſe Apprehenſions, Paſſions or Intereſt, muſt neceſſarily enervate the force and reality of a Plot; for though all the matter of Fact and Subſtance of it be not diſown'd by any one ſingly, yet if you take them all together, and allow eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man the refuſal of his Particular, you'l find by calculation the whole Fabrick no more than a ſtrong Phantaſm, or Enthuſiaſtick Viſion; and this great Machine but a ſtately Paper-Building contriv'd to amuſe and afright an eaſie and credulous People. 'Tis neceſſary therefore in this diſtraction to eſtabliſh an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis, on which to rear a certain and unerring Belief; humane Reaſon, I know, wants Sinews to effect it, every one being conceited of his Talent, and thinking it as much againſt the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge and freedom of Nature to have Senſe impos'd upon him, as Chains: We muſt have recourſe to a more awful Standard, to a Supreme Being, that has an abſolute Authority over our Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, a deſpotick Power to controul our Thoughts, and to ſet up an univerſal unanimity in Belief ſifted from the ſpurious Whimſies of Ignorance and Conceit. To ſettle in all Men ſuch an entire confidence and aſſurance of this damnable Conſpiracy, I do my buſineſs, if I prove, that the Evidence of Dr. <hi>Titus Oats</hi> and Mr. <hi>William Bedloe</hi> is <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> of Divine Authority, and that whatever they ſay in reference to the Plot, can be no Contrivance or Figment of their own, but the Dictate of a Spirit long ſince promis'd out of the <hi>Revelations</hi> by <hi>John</hi> the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine. My intended Explanation of the Text I hope will put the Plot out of all Controverſie, and force us all to confeſs, that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95476:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> diſcover by Illumination, or a Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Light, and thereby render their Evidence unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly true <hi>Jure Divino.</hi> To be ſhort, the Holy Record in <hi>John</hi> is this, <hi>And I will give power unto my two Witneſſes, and they ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie one thouſand two hundred and threeſcore days cloathed in Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth.</hi> Revelat. Chap. 11. v. 3.</p>
            <p>Ruminating with my ſelf upon the aptneſs of theſe words to the preſent times, I was invited by my curioſity to reflect and dive into their ſenſe, whereupon I found they related to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chapters, as well as the matter in this; their Latitude com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending all the remarkable Revolutions foretold by <hi>John.</hi> But above all this Verſe has ſuch a direct, immediate aſpect and intuition upon the Fall of <hi>Babylon,</hi> threatned in a following Chapter, which our Proteſtant Divines conclude to be the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> that it ſeems to ſquint only, and look awry at other Paſſages, but to appear with a full and gazing face upon this Prediction. The Prophecy of the Down-fall of the See of <hi>Rome</hi> we all know to be yet uncompleated; the foreboding Signs and Tokens of this Calamity are two preliminary Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes that ſhall prophecy; and as it is Gods uſual Method when He intends to ſtrike, to give warning of the Blow; ſo here it was reveal'd to <hi>John</hi> to declare, That the Almighty would ſend two Witneſſes to prophecy, and give Evidence of the Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and Villanies of this Spiritual Strumpet, to diſcover the dark Intrigues of this Helliſh Plot, to bring the Conſpirators to a juſt Puniſhment, to free us all from the Tyranny and Yoke of Popery, and finally to batter down that Monſter of Religion, and Bawd of Sin and Iniquity, the Pope himſelf. It may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be ask'd, why Holy <hi>John</hi> mentions two Witneſſes indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely without offering at ſome deſcription of the Inſtruments in this Great Work? I anſwer, 'twas policy in him to mention them by the general character of Witneſſes; he would not give plain and ſignal Marks of the Perſons that were by an Eternal Providence pitch'd upon to over-turn this damnable Deſign, an <hi>Ignatian</hi> ſort of People, whom he well knew to be ready charg'd with revenge and malice, by ſuch a light given of the Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, might have murdered or ſtrangled them as Inſtruments in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to miſchief their Cauſe, and quench the red-hot Iron upon the Anvel. Without doubt he could have ſupplied us with their Names, at leaſt their two firſt Letters, for this any ordinary Jugler can do by erecting a Scheme, or caſting a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure; but then this would have expos'd the Divine Myſteries
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95476:6"/>
to the buſie curioſities of prying Men, who too often impiouſly attempt to rifle the Cabinet of Heavens Decrees, and proſtitute them to humane Knowledge: I cannot believe that <hi>John</hi> talk'd at random as Men do in their Dreams, many of his Prophecies have been fulfilled; and to ſay he was not privy to the myſtick Senſe he uttered, were to make no more of a Prophet than a Puppet, that ſqueaks by the Voice, and moves by the Hand of the Manager.</p>
            <p>The next thing to be explained is the latter part of the Verſe, which ſays, <hi>They ſhall prophecy one thouſand two hundred and threeſcore days cloathed in Sack-cloth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this is ſuggeſted Dr. <hi>Oates</hi>'s firſt diſcloſing the Intrigue, and heard with prejudice and averſion, to his great diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; telling a wonderful and ſtrange Story, a hideous and diſmal Conſpiracy, and not believ'd; at length they ſhall both be received as Oracles of Truth by the Parliament; but by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſome Occurrences and Conjunctures of State, that Great Council ſhall be Prorogued, and afterwards Diſſolved; then ſhall theſe two Witneſſes Prophecy in Sack-cloth, <hi>i. e.</hi> they ſhall be for ſome time under a Cloud, expos'd to the publick Cenſure and Infamy of Cheats, being deprived of that which chiefly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigorated their Evidence: However, they ſhall ſtill prophecy, and ſtoutly adhere to their firſt Affirmations, though ſorrowful and dejected, and with heavy Hearts, and ſad Countenances, for the ſafety of the Kingdom, preach up the imminent danger of a Plot; and ſo from Parliament to Parliament, till one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand two hundred and threeſcore days are expired, they ſhall with great conſtancy and hopes of Juſtice expect to have a final Period put to it. And this I dare avouch is no diſtorted or wreſted Senſe of this branch of the Verſe, but a free and natural under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the Metaphor. And <hi>Ver.</hi> 7. of the ſame <hi>Chapter. When they have finiſhed their Teſtimony, the Beaſt that aſcendeth out of the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Pit, ſhall make War againſt them,</hi> &amp;c. which interpreted, is, the Jeſuites, with the Remains of an inveterate and cruel malice, ſhall perſecute, and be ever attempting to revenge the ruine of their Cauſe upon the Perſons of theſe two Witneſſes. But I foreſee it will be ask'd by the Curious and Inquiſitive, why are only two Witneſſes nam'd by the Diviner, when there is ſo great a Herd of guilty Reformades come in to give their Teſtimony of, and aſſert the ſame numerical Plot? why ſhould theſe be omitted, who are certainly aſſiſting to win our perſwaſion of it, and but two mention'd? why, I'le tell you: Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> were
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95476:6"/>
the Principal Men commiſſion'd by Providence to unravel this Bottom of Iniquity; the reſt were only followers appointed by ſecret Purpoſes of the Divine Will to Corroborate and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the Evidence of the former; it being rather an attendance of State and Triumph annex'd to their Teſtimony, for the greater ſplendor of the Proteſtant Cauſe; for 'twas not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to intimate any but the Capital Witneſſes; the Evidence of Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> being in Law ſufficient to hang all the Subjects in <hi>England,</hi> if they were guilty. Two Oaths in Court for the King and Country are like a brace of Dragons that depopulate whole Cities, and devour all they approach; the zealous breath of honeſt Witneſſes in point of Treaſon, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying the ſame force with a ſtrong Weſt-wind of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> that in a trice ſcours and cleanſes the Land from Locuſts, Malefactors, and Traitors.</p>
            <p>Thus I hope I have made out the ſenſe of <hi>John</hi>'s Prophecy, and I appeal to all the Orthodox Divines in <hi>Europe,</hi> if this be not the moſt proper and genuine Expoſition of the Text.</p>
            <p>And now what ſtrange Impiety will it be for any body to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny or queſtion the Truth of this Plot? We muſt not cenſure where Heaven has ſet his Stamp; when the Teſtimony comes from the Eternal ſource of Truth and Wiſdom, 'tis our duty to believe, though we deſpair to apprehend; for where we cannot rely upon our Reaſon, we muſt exerciſe our Faith. Every good Chriſtian and Loyal Subject ought to believe as much of the Plot as is poſitively ſworn, nor does it become us to queſtion or ſtagger at any thing that they with ſo much cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and aſſurance have aſſerted. 'Tis impoſſible in this caſe to be impos'd upon, or allured into the ſnare of Falſhood; for if <hi>John</hi> were inſpir'd, which we believe as certainly as the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle of Cloven Tongues, we are ſure to be grounded upon a firm Faith: His Prophecy being a ſecret of Divinity impart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Illuſtrate the Attribute of Gods Goodneſs, we have no more reaſon to boggle at the Truth of the two Witneſſes, than the Doctrine of an Apoſtle: 'Tis impoſſible for them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Baſis to ſpeak a Falſhood; they are Engines, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viner ſays, actuated by Him, Witneſſes He has choſen to lay open the Deſtruction our Enemies deſign'd us. And as it is from hence both irrational and highly irreligious to deny the Being of a Plot in general; ſo to clip and pare part of it off, and believing it by halves, is no leſs impious; for owning the Diſcovery of the whole to Inſpiration, 'twere to imply
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95476:7"/>
a Contradiction in Divinity to condemn part, and approve of the reſt. We muſt therefore acknowledge every tittle of it, or it will be to no purpoſe to believe it mincingly. 'Tis not my deſign here to diſcourſe of the Probabilities of Mens Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, or Guilt, by weighing Circumſtances and Matters in a Humane Method, and in the Scale of Partial Reaſon; mine is a ſhorter and more compendious way, and not liable to fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Errors; Heaven has revealed the Plot, and 'tis need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs for me to make wrangling ſcrutiny into it; for after I have done my beſt in ſuch a ſearch, I muſt, whether I will or no, acquieſce in a Supine Judgment of its truth, becauſe Holy <hi>John</hi> hath ſaid it, and I told you before whence he had it. But if we ſhould ſtoop a little to the Cavils of the Contentious, what would this avail or ſignifie? What if you alledge you have good reaſons to doubt of the Truth of ſome Particulars laid to the charge of the late Malefactors? Why, ſuppoſe you have, the main of the Accuſations, and that which hang'd them, was High Treaſon; the throng of ſuch important bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs in a Witneſſes Head may eaſily be conceived to juſtle out trivial Circumſtances of Time and Place, and trapan him unawares into a falſe Computation: The Witneſs believes it was ſo and ſo, there done, and in ſuch an order of time, and then punctually ſwears to it; this is no Crime in Conſcience; if he errs, 'tis only a fault in memory; and ſo not a Lie, but a miſtake, which a Court of Juſtice readily paſſes by and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons: This Maxime being in vogue with us, as well as the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Caſuiſts; <hi>Nemo peccat niſi actu voluntario.</hi> So this bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of an Objection vaniſhes. But to humour the Captious a little further. Granting theſe are Lies couch'd under, and mix'd with the Truth of the Evidence, and ſuppoſing the Witneſſes Knaves, which is the utmoſt Malice can do; yet cannot I think there is any reaſon to ſeparate our ſelves from a total Belief of every thing they ſay, ſince the main of the Plot, in ſpight of the moſt ſear'd obſtinacy in Nature, will compel us to acknowledge a great part of it: And though we wholly depend upon them for our information, and pin our Faith upon their ſleeves, yet ought we not to be ſo uncharitable, as to bring a ſuſpicion of Impoſture upon the whole: 'Tis true, in this caſe we are liable to abuſe, and if they will deceive us in ſome things, they may; but for as much as we want a certain Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terion to judge of, and winnow Truth from Falſhood, and that, if I chooſe to be my own Conductor, 'tis an even Wager
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95476:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but I embrace a Lie, and reject a ſaving Truth; therefore if there were a hundred times more of the Plot ſworn than there now is, I think it prudence to ſwallow all, and diſgorge none; nay, I affirm, if there were ten Millions of Lies, I am obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the Law of Nature ſlightly to believe them all, rather than earneſtly diſſent from one precious Truth, which, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſpous'd, would prove my utter ruine; for otherwiſe the bloody Machinators have as fair play at our Throats as ever, and the Diſcovery will be as ineffectual to fruſtrate their Deſigns, as looking upon a Train of Powder with a lighted Match laid to it, will hinder it from taking fire: The Sum is then, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we cannot diſtinguiſh between Truth and Falſhood, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoves us paſſionately to embrace both together for our own ſafety and preſervation. And pray let this be a Bug-bear to no body; for what is there in all this? Shall I keep a clutter and ado about Aſſent and Diſſent, and in the interim have my Throat cut for my Curioſity? Shall I grin, and have an ill o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of the Evidence, becauſe the Plot is not contriv'd as I would have form'd it, had I been a Conſpirator? This is ſuch Nonſenſe, as nothing but a pragmatical conceited Aſſe would be guilty of: We thank them very heartily for their Critical Wiſdom and Skill in Plots; I am rather perſwaded they are angry and peeviſh, becauſe it was not rightly projected, and would be though to ſtorm at the folly of the Deſign, when they ſecretly blame the ill fortune and ſucceſs of the Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers. But it may very materially be urg'd, That in this miſt of Evidence innocent Men may be condemned wrongfully, their Eſtates forfeited, and their Lives taken away, to the great ſcandal of Government, and the impious abuſe of the Sword of Juſtice. To this 'tis anſwer'd, That in Caſes of this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and weight relating to the Body-Politick, 'tis better that now and then an Innocent ſuffer, than that all Malefactors eſcape; for as in the Body-natural, labouring under a Fever, the Chyrurgeon, to preſerve the whole Maſs from diſſolution, draws from it both good and bad Blood together; there being ſo ſubtil and cloſe a union between the corrupted and ſound part of it, that no Art or Skill of his can free the Body of one, without taking a Portion of the other: So in matters of Juſtice, 'tis impoſſible for any Magiſtrate to make ſuch nice diſcriminations between Innocence and Guilt, as he ſhall be ſure always to puniſh one, and acquit the other; bare Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence being no vindication of it ſelf, muſt bring proofs and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95476:8"/>
violent preſumptions to plead for it; when theſe are wanting, the Law deveſts her of that Title, and ſets her in the rank of Criminals. But above all, the Witneſſes that are upon their Oaths are to be heard and believ'd, notwithſtanding any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary conjectures and ſurmiſes, an Oath being to be eſteemed and valued with all reverence as the moſt Sacred Engagement in the World: And for as much as a Witneſs is oblig'd to ſtake his Soul (a thing of ineſtimable price) to the Body of every Man to be Arraigned and Tryed, I think a Judge and Jury are bound in Conſcience to belive one, before the defence of the other; the damnation of a Witneſſes Soul being a far greater loſs, and infinitely above any advantage he can propoſe to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from the deſtruction of his Body whom he Impeaches. There being therefore this vaſt diſparity between the Condition of the Accuſed and the Evidence, we ought to liſten to no Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, or imaginary Allegations of honeſty in the reputed Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, but to lay them aſide, and proceed to ſentence them as Criminals; and Juſtice all this while remains unblemiſh'd; the Witneſſes being her Compurgators, though, if they be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized in a Falſhood, they can be none of their own. Thus the Reputation of well Govern'd Societies skreens it ſelf from all Imputations of Cruelty; and the Perſon condemn'd is not hereby ſo much injured in his Temporal Eſtate, as bettered in his Spiritual, the moſt Important Concern of his Being; for if a Witneſs is pleas'd to forfeit Heaven by Perjury, the dying Man has a clear Conſcience to ſupport him under his misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and 'tis probable may be a greater Gainer by a Sentence of Death, than a Conceſſion of Life, having a bleſs'd opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity tendered of claiming Salvation by a ſignal Inſtance of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence to that God, who never fails to conſider it in the other World. But to drive the matter to a higher Point: I am of opinion, That a Jeſuite, Prieſt, or any other fiery Papiſt, ought to be hook'd within the Penal Cognizance of the Law, as effectually as if he ſtood convicted of being a Party to the Conſpiracy; but this, they ſay, would be barbarous and moſt unparallel'd Injuſtice, becauſe there are no overt Acts tending to the prejudice of the Government. But I look upon every the leaſt of Perſons before-mentioned to be as ſo many Plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpies, and as deſerving puniſhment as a Scout from the Enemies Camp by Martial Law: Though they cannot all perhaps be proved to engage in the beginning of the Plot, they will be ſure to be ſeen in the end of it: And State-Doctors ſay, Phyſick
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95476:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by way of prevention or anticipation, is ſafer than Remedies applied to encounter a Diſeaſe upon the ſpot; it being very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult when the Savage Beaſt has faſtened upon the Throat of Government to ſhake him off before he has ſtrangled it. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, ſuppoſe Jeſuites, Prieſts, and other the zealous Bigots of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion have not yet actually committed any miſchief, or been corporeally active in any diſtractions amongſt us; yet ought we not to be ſo ſimply good-natur'd to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them as harmleſs, inoffenſive Perſons, Intenders of the publick Peace and Tranquillity: Are we not acquainted with their Tenets, their Principles, the abſolute Dominion the Pope has over them, their obligation to blind Obedience, without the liberty of diſputing the moſt impious of his Commands; the conſtant charge given them to promote their Religion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any Terms, the vileſt courſes and means imaginable; their accounting it no murder to Aſſaſinate a Heretick Prince, and all His Subjects, when the Holy Vizier has excommunicated them; but on the contrary, the higheſt merit and claim that they can prefer to the moſt glittering Crown of Saints; and all theſe horrible <hi>Credenda</hi> own'd and defended in the Volumes of the moſt Learned, and beſt Caſuiſts of their Church; ſince, I ſay, we are as certain that this is the Subſtance of their Religion, as that Goodneſs, Patience and Loyalty is the Sum of ours; and that theſe Principles are not by them to be maintained in notion only and ſpeculation, but as the depoſited Bullion of the Soul, upon advantageous occaſions to be brought forth, and minted into action; we have more reaſon to fear them, than thoſe that have already made their attempts; for as much as we cannot gueſs when they will pour upon us, their malice being quick and ſudden, and like a Granada, burſting on all ſides into Death and Ruine. We all know that Treaſon but intentionally prov'd, comes within the Verge of the Law, and Condemnation is awarded accordingly; and why perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, deſtructive, rebellious Opinions publickly own'd and abetted, ſhould not have the ſame force to condemn, I ſee not the leaſt jot of reaſon: He that harbours an ill and dangerous Principle in his boſom, lodges an Enemy and Traytor in the Country of his Prince, that lies couchant under that Covert, till he has a fit opportunity to rouze, and fly in the face of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty. Every violently evil Man ought to be capitally ſecured from a power of doing miſchief; for ſeeing we cannot execute his bad Principles without himſelf, and whilſt there is life, thene
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95476:9"/>
will be Villany, 'tis but juſtice they both ſhould ſuffer toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and in this Caſe, though the Man perhaps, in purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his Judgment, for want of a due time to humour his ſecular Intereſt, never was a notorious Rogue in practice, yet this preponderates nothing; for whether he acts or no, the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, Traiterous Will ought to paſs for the Deed; 'tis High Treaſon <hi>in intellectu,</hi> and that's enough.</p>
            <p>But I find my too great Paſſion and Love for Honeſty, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, and Allegiance has unawares made me deviate from my purpoſe, it being far from my deſign to think to convince any one of the reality of all and every part of this Plot by dint of ratiocination; and therefore I did at firſt inſtitute another Method, which I intend to end with, and which is the only Expedient to allay our heats and animoſities; 'tis this muſt hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us from contradicting one another; 'tis this muſt make us come to a combination in Judgment concerning the Plot, to believe it, and make no more hums nor ha's about the matter of it; for we are told by Divine Authority, 'tis a damnable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign againſt our Throats; we may believe too little, but not too much of it; and I do not think in ſo doing I enlarge and ſtretch my Conſcience; that is not to meddle here, being a Judge only of Reaſon, and her Juriſdiction confin'd to Equity: In this Caſe I do but load my Faith, which Heaven has made with a flat bottom, not to be ſunk by a moderate burden. And as I am in obedience oblig'd to receive, ſo in duty am I forbid cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly to examine and flaw-find the Plot, which Prohibition is only intended as a means to prevent differences and diſputes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us. Do we ſeriouſly conſider the Senſe of the wiſeſt Heads in the Nation, the Judgment of many cunning <hi>Daniels</hi> that have been moſt laboriouſly ſollicitous in our Intereſt, the unanimous Declaration and Vote of the Houſe of Commons, the faithful and ingenuous Reports of the Privy-Council, the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacious Opinions of all the Judges, we are no more able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the Evidence of this Plot, than we can with Chriſtianity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject Articles of Faith agreed and concluded on in a general and lawful Council: Therefore in framing doubts about it, we implicitly Tax the Government with ſillineſs and credulity, and do in effect call our Rulers Fools, and Magiſtrates Aſſes. 'Tis an approved Opinion, That in all Great Aſſemblies and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults for the well-fare of a Good King, a true Religion and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, there is a preſiding Spirit to direct and ſteer their Reſolutions: God Almighty, ever when he is pleaſed himſelf
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95476:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to be the Diſcoverer of the Enemies of his Church, enlightning the Miniſters of Juſtice, enlarging and amplifying the Powers of their Underſtandings, that they may be able to grapple with Stratagems and Intricacies, and to pierce through the darkeſt Shades and receſſes of Night: So that the aſſiduous care of the King and His Council, the inceſſant Proſecutions of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Vigilance and Activity of Juſtices of the Peace, do as fully evince the reality of a Plot, as all the oral Depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Witneſſes; theſe extraordinary Motions being ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver raiſed in publick Magiſtrates but by Divine Inſtigation to confront malicious againſt a People whom Heaven has a mind to protect. What a folly is it then for Men to ſhufle and cut, to carp at one Paſſage, and laugh at another of the Plot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and when they have done all they can to expoſe the matter of it, to take Sanctuary at Slander, aſperſe and vilifie the Witneſſes, derogate from their Integrity, beſpatter their Lives, and rail againſt Irregularities of their Converſation? this can be nothing certainly but the virulent ſpleen and malice of ſuch who are not to be anſwer'd, but phyſick'd for ſatisfaction, purg'd from thoſe groſs humours that thus fly up into, and annoy the Head. But if there be really any adult, perſonal vices, or extravagancies of the Witneſſes, theſe are ſo far from proving a Ground to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the credit of what they ſay, that it beſpeaks rather an itch of objecting, than a rational ſcruple in the Calumniators; for St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſays, <hi>Veritas a quocun<expan>

In fine, there is a Plot, a Plot of many years ſtanding, aſſiſted and encouraged by a Conjunction of Popiſh Intereſt throughout all Chriſtendom; the total extirpation, ruine and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der both of Man, Woman and Child threatn'd, intended, and reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved on; and ſhall we not believe there's a Plot? for my part, I think it a neceſſary Article to be inſerted in my Creed; it being certain, that nothing but a miſtruſt of it can prevent the due effect which the Diſcovery ſhould have upon the Publick: I am ſo ſatisfied and convinced from all outward Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the real exiſtence of a Plot, that I'le ſuffer my ſelf to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve all Impoſſibilities, rather than be perſwaded there is none.
