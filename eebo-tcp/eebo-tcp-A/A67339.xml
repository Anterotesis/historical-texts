            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>And now you heale us with the arts of Peace,</l>
               <l>Our minds with bounty, and with awe engage,</l>
               <l>Invite affection, and restrain our rage:</l>
               <l>Less pleasure take, brave minds in battails won,</l>
               <l>Then in restoring such as are undon,</l>
               <l>Tygers have courage, and the rugged Bear,</l>
               <l>But man alone can, whom he conquers, spare.</l>
               <l>To pardon willing, and to punish loath,</l>
               <l>You strike with one hand, but you heal with both,</l>
               <l>Lifting up all that prostrate lie, you grieve</l>
               <l>You cannot make the dead again to live:</l>
               <l>When Fate, or Error had our Age mis-led,</l>
               <l>And o'r these Nations such confusion spred,</l>
               <l>The onely cure which could from Heav'n come down,</l>
               <l>Was so much Power and Clemency in one.</l>

            <lg>
               <l>One, whose Extraction from an ancient Line,</l>
               <l>Gives hope again that well-born Men may shine,</l>
               <l>The meanest in your Nature milde and good,</l>
               <l>The noble rest secured in your Blood.</l>
               <l>Oft have we wonder'd how you hid in Peace</l>
               <l>A minde proportion'd to such things as these?</l>
               <l>How such a Ruling-spirit you could restrain?</l>
               <l>And practice first over your self to raign?</l>
               <l>Your private Life did a just pattern give</l>
               <l>How Fathers, Husbands, pious Sons, should live,</l>

Born to command, your Princely vertues slept</l>
               <l>Like humble <hi>David</hi>'s, while the Flock he kept;</l>

               <l>Your flaming Courage, and your Matchless worth</l>
               <l>Dazeling the eyes of all that did pretend</l>
               <l>To fierce Contention, gave a prosp'rous end:</l>
               <l>Still as you rise, the State exalted too,</l>
               <l>Finds no distemper, while 'tis chang'd by you.</l>
               <l>Chang'd like the Worlds great Scene, when without noise,</l>

               <l>Mistaken <hi>Brutus</hi> thought to break their yoke,</l>
               <l>But cut the Bond of Union with that stroke.</l>
               <l>That Sun once set, a thousand meaner Stars,</l>
               <l>Gave a dim light to Violence and Wars,</l>
               <l>To such a Tempest, as now threatens all,</l>
               <l>Did not your mighty Arm prevent the fall.</l>

               <l>You that had taught them to subdue their Foes,</l>
               <l>Could Order teach, and their high Spirits compose,</l>
               <l>To every Duty could their Minds engage,</l>
               <l>Provoke their Courage, and command their Rage.</l>
               <l>So when a Lyon shakes his dreadfull Mayn,</l>
               <l>And angry growes, if he that first took pain</l>

               <l>He bends to him, but frights away the rest.</l>
               <l>As the vex'd World to finde repose at last</l>
               <l>It self into <hi>Augustus</hi> arms did cast;</l>
