         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

paine of impriſonment, publike diſarming and baniſhment from the Armie, as men for euer diſabled to carrie Armes, And as I forbid all men vnder
my rule, to renew any old quarrels, or to begin any new, So I doe acquitte and diſcharge all men that ſhall haue quarrels offered to them, or challenge
made to them of any diſgrace or opinion of any diſaduantage, ſince they doe but the duties of Souldiers, which ought to ſubiect themſelues to marſhall
diſcipline, and they that prouoke them ſhall be proceeded withall as breakers of all good diſcipline, and enemies to the good ſucceſſe of the ſeruice.</p>
            <p>39 And becauſe drunkeneſſe is the mother of many other vices and diſorders in Armies, euery Souldier or Officer that ſhall be found drunke ſhall be
committed to priſon for the firſt offence, and if he fall into it the ſecond time, being a priuate Souldier, he ſhall beſides his impriſonment forfeyte Two
Moneths pay, If he be an Officer, he ſhall looſe his place, The third time ſhall haue ſuch farre greater puniſhment, as the Marſhall Court ſhall ſet
downe.</p>
            <p>40 Euerie priuate man and Souldier, vpon paine of impriſonment ſhall keepe ſilence when the Armie is to take lodging, or when it is marching or
embatling, So as the Officers may be heard, and their Commadements executed.</p>
            <p>41 No Souldier ſeruing on foote, ſhall carrie any Boy, nor any Woman ſhall be ſuffered to follow the Armie, vpon paine of ſuch puniſhment, as ſhall
be inflicted by the Lord Deputie, or other Officer.</p>
            <p>42 All Captaines, Officers and Souldiers, ſhall doe their endeuours, to detect, apprehend, and bring to puniſhment all offendors, and ſhall aſſiſt the
Officers of the Armie for that purpoſe, as they will anſwere their ſlackeneſſe, and be cenſured at the Marſhall-Court.</p>
            <p>43 All other faults, diſorders, and offences that are not mentioned in theſe Articles, ſhall be puniſhed according to the generall Cuſtomes, and Lawes
of Warres: And therefore I command all Men, to looke to their charge, and him that hath no charge, to looke to his owne carriage, and to keepe
himſelfe within bounds of dutie, for the diſcipline of Warre ſhall be ſtrictly kept, and the lawes thereof, ſeuerely executed.</p>
            <p>44 No Victualler ſhall preſume to iſſue or ſell vnto the Souldiers, or to the Companies, vnſound, vnſauorie, or vnholſome victuals, vpon paine of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment,
and ſuch other puniſhment, as by a Marſhall-Court ſhall be thought fit to be impoſed, vpon him or them that ſhall ſo offend.</p>
            <p>45 No Captaine, Lieutenant, or other Officer of the Armie, ſhall in the tender and preſentment of their Muſters, vſe any fraude, practiſe, or deceite
whereby the Muſter-Maſter his Commiſſaries, or Deputies may be miſled, miſtaken, or preuented, of the due vnderſtanding of the true eſtate of of that
Companie, vpon paine of the loſſe of his place, and ſuch other ignominious puniſhments, as by a Marſhall-Court, ſhall be thought meete.</p>
            <p>46 No Muſter-Maſter, ſhall eyther for fauour, friendſhip, loue, or hatred, or any other by reſpect whatſoeuer, impoſe a leſſe or greater checke vpon
any Captaine or Officer, then his default ſhall iuſtly merit, nor get any checke at all, where no defect or fault ſhall appeare, vpon a due view taken of
the Companie. And that no checke ſhall be impoſed by diſcretion without view, vpon paine that euerie o<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fendor that ſhall be found to tranſgreſſe in all,
or any part of this Article, ſhall forfeite the place which he holdeth, and be further ſubiect to ſuch corporall, or pecuniary puniſhment, as by the diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a Marſhall-Court ſhall be thought conuenient.</p>

               <hi>We require the Marſhall of the Armie, the Iudge-marſhall, the Captaines of Horſe and foote in his Maieſties pay, and
