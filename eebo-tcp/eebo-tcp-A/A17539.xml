         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

vp so apparantly, their manners he openeth so manifestly, their qualities he declareth so skilfully, their proportions he painteth out so perfectly, their colours he describeth so artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, and knytteth all these in such shortnesse and breuity, that the mouth of th'aduersary must néedes confesse &amp; giue sentence that commendation ought to bée his rewarde, and praise his deserued pension. An ignoraunt man woulde neuer haue bene drawne into this opinion, to thincke that there had bene in England such variety &amp; choise of dogges, in all respectes (not onely for name but also for qualitie) so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse and vnlike: But what cannot learning attaine? what cannot the kay of knowledge open? what cannot the lampe of vnderstanding lighten? what secretes cannot discretion detect? finally what cannot experience comprehend? what buge heapes of histories hath <hi>Gesnerus</hi> hourded vp in vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes of a large syze? Fishes in floudes, Cattell on lande, Byrdes in the ayre, how hath he sifted them by ther naturall differences? how closely and in how narrow a compasse hath he couched mighty and monstruous beasts, in bygnesse lyke mountaines, the bookes themselues being lesser then Mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilles. The lyfe of this man was not so great a restority of comfort, as his death was an vlcer or wound of sorrow: the losse of whom <hi>Caius</hi> lamented, not so much as he was his faithfull friende, as for that he was a famous Philosopher, and yet the former reason (being, in very déede, vehement &amp; forceable) did stinge him with more griefe, then he peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was willing to disclose. And though death be counted terrible for the time, and consequently vnhappy, yet <hi>Caius</hi> aduoucheth the death of <hi>Gesner</hi> most blessed, luckie, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, as in his Booke intituled, <hi>De libris proprijs,</hi> appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth. But of these two Eagles sufficient is spoken as I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and yet litle enough in consideration of their dignitie and worthines. Neuerthelesse litle or mickle, something or nothing, substaunce or shadow take all in good part, my mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is by a fewe wordes to wynne credit to this worke,

not so much for mine owne Englishe Translation as for the singuler commendation of them, challenged of dutie and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sart. Wherfore gentle Reader I commit them to thy memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and their bookes to thy courteous censure. They were both learned men, and painefull practitioners in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions, so much the more therfore are their workes worthy estimation, I would it were in me to aduaunce them as I wishe, the worst (and yet both, no doubt, excellent) hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued a monument of immortality. Well there is no more to be added but this, that as the translatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this booke was attempted, finished, and published of goodwill (not onely to minister pleasure, as to affoord profit) so it is my desire and request that my labour therin employed may be acceptable, as I hope it shalbe to men of indifferent iudgement. As for such as shall snarr and snatch at the Englishe abridgement, and teare the Translatour, being absent, with the teeth of spightfull enuye, I conclude in breuity there eloquence is but currishe, if I serue in their meate with wrong sawce, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe it not to vnskilfulnesse in coquery, but to ignoraunce in their diet, for as the Poet sayeth.

This kinde of dogge is properly called, <hi>Aquaticus,</hi> a water spaniel because he frequenteth and hath vsuall recourse to the water where all his game &amp; exercise lyeth, namely waterfowles, which are taken by the helpe &amp; seruice of them, in their kind. And principally duckes and drakes, whervpon he is lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise named a dogge for the ducke, because in that quallitie he is excellent. With those dogges also we fetche out of the water such fowle as he stounge to death by any venemous worme, we vse them also to bring vs our boultes &amp; arrowes out of the water, (missing our marcke) wherat we directed our leuell, which otherwise we should hardly recouer, and oftentimes they restore to vs our shaftes which we thought neuer to sée, touche or handle againe, after they were lost, for which circumstaunces they are called <hi>Inquisitores,</hi> searchers, and finders. Although the ducke other whiles notably decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth both the dogge and the master, by dyuing vnder the water, and also by naturall subtilty, for if any man shall approche to the place where they builde, bréede, and syt, the hennes go out of their neastes, offering themselues volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, as it were, of such as draw nie their neasts. And a certaine weaknesse of their winges pretended, and infirmitie of their féete dissembled, they go so slowely and so leasurely, that to a mans thinking it were no masteryes to take them. By which deceiptfull tricke they doe as it were

entyse and allure men to follow them, till they be drawne a long distaunce from theyr neastes, which being compassed by their prouident conning, or conning prouidence, they cut of all inconueniences which might growe of their returne, by vsing many carefull and curious caueates, least theyr often haunting bewray y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place where the young ducklings be hatched. Great therfore is theyr desire, &amp; earnest is theyr study to take héede, not only to theyr broode but also to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. For when they haue an ynckling that they are espied they hide themselues vnder turfes or sedges, wherwith they couer and shrowde themselues so closely and so craftely, that (notwithstanding the place where they lurcke be found and perfectly perceaued) there they will harbour without harme, except the water spaniell by quicke smelling discouer theyr deceiptes.</p>

There was no faynting faith in that Dogge, which when his Master by a mischaunce in hunting stumbled and fell toppling downe a déepe dytche beyng vnable to recouer of himselfe, the Dogge signifying his masters mishappe, reskue came, and he was hayled vp by a rope, whom the Dogge seeyng almost drawne vp to the edge of the dytche, chérefully saluted, leaping and skipping vpon his master as though he woulde haue imbraced hym, beyng glad of his presence, whose longer absence he was lothe to lacke. Some Dogges there be, which will not suffer fyery coales to lye skattered about the hearthe, but with their pawes wil rake vp the burnyng coales, musyng and studying fyrst with themselues howe it myght conueniently be done. And if so bée that the coales cast to great a heate then will they buyry them in ashes and so remoue them forwarde to a fyt place wyth theyr noses.

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:13580:21"/>
whether it be man, woman, or beast, he driueth them out of the ground, not medling with any thing which doth belong to the possession and vse of his master. But how much fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes, so much diuersitie there is in their natures,
<list>
                     <head>For there be some,</head>

                     <item>Which doe both barcke and byte,</item>

               </p>
               <p>The first are not greatly to be feared, because they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues are fearefull, and fearefull dogges (as the prouerbe importeth) barcke most vehemently.</p>
               <p>The second are daungerous, it is wisedome to take héede of them because they sounde, as it were, an <hi>Alarum</hi> of an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terclappe, and these dogges must not be ouer much moued or prouoked, for then they take on outragiously as if they were madde, watching to set the print of their teeth in the fleshe. And these kinde of dogges are fearce and eager by nature.</p>
               <p>The thirde are deadly, for they flye vpon a man, without vtteraunce of voyce, snatch at him, and catche him by the throate, and most cruelly byte out colloppes of fleashe. Feare these kind of Curres, (if thou be wise and circumspect about thine owne safetie) for they bee stoute and stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berne dogges, and set vpon a man at a sodden vnwares. By these signes and tokens, by these notes and argumentes our men discerne the cowardly curre from the couragious dogge the bolde from the fearefull, the butcherly from the gentle and tractable. Moreouer they coniecture that a whelpe of an yll kinde is not worthe the kéeping and that no dogge can serue the sundry vses of men so aptly and so conueniently as this sort of whom we haue so largely written already. For if any be disposed to drawe the aboue named seruices into a table, what ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more clearely, and with more vehemency of voyce giueth warning eyther of a wastefull beast, or of a spoiling théefe then this? who by his barcking (as good as a

Finally what packhorse more patient? And thus much concerning English Dogges, first of the gentle kinde, secondly of the courser kinde. Nowe it remaineth that we deliuer vnto you the Dogges of a mungrell or currishe kinde, and then will wee perfourme our taske.</p>
