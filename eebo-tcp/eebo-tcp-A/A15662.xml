            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O recreate my selfe, after some more serious Studies, I tooke oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to exercise my Inuention in the illustration of my <hi>Motto;</hi> which being thus finished, my friends made me beleeue it was worth the preseruing; and grew so importunat for <hi>Coppies</hi> thereof, that I could not deny them. But doubting, lest by often transcribing, it might be much lamed through the <hi>Scribes</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficiency (as many things of this nature are) I thought fitting, rather to exemplyfie the same, by the <hi>Presse,</hi> then by the <hi>Penne.</hi> And to that end, deliuered it ouer to some <hi>Stationers,</hi> to haue onely so many <hi>Copies,</hi> as I intended to bestow.</p>
            <p>Yet considering that other men (to whom I meant them not) might peraduenture, come
<pb facs="tcp:28447:4"/>
to the view of those Lines. I thought it not amisse, by way of Preuention, to remooue such Cauills as may be made against mee, by those vnto whom I am vnknowne. Not, that I care to giue euery idle <hi>Reader,</hi> an account of my Intentions: But to shew the <hi>Ingenuous,</hi> that the <hi>Carelesnes</hi> expressed in this <hi>Motto,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeds from an vndistempered <hi>Care,</hi> to make all my Actions, (as neere as I can) such, as may be decent, warrantable, and becomming an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Man: And that those, who shall foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly seeke (from thence) to picke aduantages a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me: may know, I am too well aduised to write any thing, which they shall bee iustly able to interpret, either to my hinderance, or disparagement.</p>
            <p>Let me want esteeme among all good men, if I purposed (or haue any secret desire in me) that any part of this, should be applied to any particular man; but so as euery one ought to apply things vnto his own Conscience; and he that beleeues me not, I feare is guilty. My in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent was, to draw the true Picture of mine own heart; that my friends, who knew mee out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, might haue some representation of my inside also. And that, if they liked the forme
<pb facs="tcp:28447:4"/>
of it, they might (wherein they were defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue) fashion their owne mindes thereunto. But, my principall Intention, was by recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding those thoughts to confirme mine owne Resolution; and to preuent such alterations, as Time and infirmites, may worke vpon mee. And if there bee no more reason inferr ed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me, to remoue my opinion, then I am yet apprehensiue of: I am confidently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded, that neither Feare, nor Force shall compell me, to deny any thing which I haue affirmed in this Poem. For, I had rather bee degraded from the greatest <hi>Title</hi> of <hi>Honour</hi> that could be giuen me; then constrained to deny this <hi>Motto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Proud Arrogance (I know) and enough too; will be layd to my charge. But those who both know me, and the necessitie of this reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, will excuse me of it. The rest (if they mis-censure me) are part of those things, <hi>I care not for.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Language is but indifferent; for, I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected <hi>Matter</hi> more then <hi>Words.</hi> The <hi>Method</hi> is none at all: for, I was loath to make a busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, of a recreation. And we know, he that rides abroad for his pleasure, is not tyed so
<pb facs="tcp:28447:5"/>
strictly to keepe <hi>High-waies,</hi> as hee that takes a Iourney.</p>
            <p>If the intermixing of sleight and weighty things together, be offensiue to any. Let them vnderstand, that if they well obserue it, they shall finde a seriousnesse, euen in that which they imagine least momentary. And if they had aswell obserued the conditions of men, as I haue done: they would perceiue that the greatest number (like Children which are allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Schoole with points and Aples) must be drawne on with some friuolous expressions, or else will neuer listen to the graue precepts of Virtue; which, when they once heare, doe many times beget a delight in them, before they be aware.</p>
            <p>Many Dishes of meate which we affect not may be so Cookt, that we shall haue a good ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petit vnto them: So, many men who take no pleasure to seeke <hi>Vertue</hi> in graue Treatises of Morallitie, may (perhaps) finding her vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lookt for, masked vnder the habit of a light <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>em,</hi> growenamord on her beauty.</p>
            <p>The foolish <hi>Canterbury</hi> Tale in my <hi>scourge</hi> of <hi>Vanity,</hi> (which I am now almost ashamed to read ouer) euen that, hath bin by some praysed
<pb facs="tcp:28447:5"/>
for a witty passage: And I haue heard diuers, seriously protest, that they haue much more feelingly bin informed, &amp; moued to detest the Vanity of the humor there skoffed at, by that rude <hi>Tale,</hi> then they were by the most graue precepts of Phylosophy. And that makes me oftentimes affect some things, in regard of their vsefulnesse: which being considered according to the Method of Art, and rules of Scholler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, would seeme ridiculous.</p>
            <p>But I vse more words for my Apology then needes: If this will not giue you satisfaction, I am sorry I haue said so much; and, if you know which way, satisfie your selues. For, how I am resolued (if you thinke it worth the taking notise of) the booke will tell you. <hi>Farewell.</hi>
