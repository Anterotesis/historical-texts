            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

We ſhall not need to ſay much in a matter, ſo much ſpeaking it ſelf, and the experience we have of the true ſence they have of this diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed State, gives us great aſſurance, that they will take to heart this our miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Church, and Gods ſervants therein, reduced unto unexpreſſable extremities, both Church and State being now involved in one common calamity.</p>

Theſe conſiderations for the defence of the Religion, the Queens perſon, and by the Kings licenſe, moved them to take Arms, having the <hi>Scots</hi> for a preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; they have alſo vowed not to leave an Engliſh-man in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> The Kingdome they will have in their own hands, Lawes of their own, and a Deputy of their own, without moleſtation or interruption of any other Nation.</p>
               <p>This night, at the Widdowes houſe of one <hi>Lawrence Purcell,</hi> I met with one <hi>George Staples,</hi> who for late years had taught the Children of the chiefe of the Gentry in our parts. Having beene formerly acquainted with him, he began to examine me what courſe I intended to take, I told him I could not tell, untill I came to <hi>Dublin,</hi> and therefore I deſired to have his counſell and adviſe.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:115024:13"/>
He began after this manner. You intend to go to <hi>ublin</hi> ſaith he, if you do, you muſt go ſpeedily; for within two dayes the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army will be before <hi>Dublin,</hi> ſo that you cannot paſſe; if you ſhould get ſo much favour as to paſſe, yet when you come to <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> you will not be admitted to come within the Gates; and in the Suburbs there are ſixe or ſeven ſcore dying daily for want of food, ſo that there will be no abiding place for you, If you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to go for <hi>England,</hi> the leaſt childe you have will not be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried under twenty ſhillings, and you (ſaith he) have not one pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; if you ſhould finde ſo much friendſhip as to paſſe <hi>gratis,</hi> there are ſuch a multitude of people that are gone out of this Kingdom, that <hi>England</hi> being but a ſmall Iſland, and Populous of it ſelfe, is not able to receive you; if you ſhould be received, there can be no long continuing place for you, for the Papiſts are ſtriving in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> as well as here; the Queene being fled into <hi>France</hi> for ſome abuſes offered her own Perſon, her Servants and Chaplains, which indignities the King of <hi>France</hi> intending to revenge, hath leavied an Army of 40000 men to invade <hi>England,</hi> and the Cardinall in <hi>Flanders</hi> hath leavied the like number, to the like end and purpoſe, therefore it will be no purpoſe to go thither. Lord, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Staples</hi> (ſaid I) what ſhall I do then? If you ſtay here, you muſt do as they do, and turn to Maſſe; yet they will not truſt you (ſayd he) fearing leaſt if the King of <hi>England</hi> ſhould ever be able to bring an Army into this Country, the turn-coat Engliſh ſhould joyne with them, and cut the Iriſh throats in a night, as the Engliſh once did the <hi>Danes</hi> in <hi>England.</hi> Therefore whoſoever of the Engliſh ſhould turn to the Romiſh Church, they would alſo compell to take Armes and place them in the Front, and eminent place of danger, that ſo they might fall. And for hereafter, when they had gotten the Kingdome into their own hands, which they make no queſtion but to have in a ſhort time (having all the Forts, Caſtles, and ſtrong-holds in <hi>Ireland</hi> in their own hands already, but the Caſtle of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and <hi>Drogheda;</hi> and theſe two places they would not for many thouſand pounds have gotten, for reaſons known un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to themſelves) but when they have once obtained them, and the Kingdome; thoſe Engliſh that have not fallen by the ſword, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Church hath ſo ordered it, that they ſhall be cut off by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition, ſo that they will not leave an Engliſh-man alive, whoſe

               </p>
               <p>And further ſaith, that the Rebells aforeſaid, or ſome of them confeſſed unto him, and ſo he was told alſo by divers Scottiſh-men, that they the ſame Rebells when they came to <hi>Armagh, Monaghan,</hi> and <hi>Dungannon,</hi> ſet all the priſoners at liberty, and that they broke open and defaced the Church of <hi>Armagh,</hi> and burned the pewes, pulpit, and the beſt things in the ſaid Church.</p>
               <p>And this Deponent whileſt he was with the ſame Rebells, ſaw them to pull in peeces, kick up and down, deface and ſpoyl all the Proteſtant Bibles, and other proteſtant books that they found in any place where they came; neither this Deponent, nor any other proteſtant priſoner nor other, durſt ſo much do as to ſave, or looke upon any of them in their ſight; nor would they willingly ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any one to ſpeak the Engliſh tongue.</p>
               <p>And further, it was pretended that it was agreed in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Houſe of <hi>England,</hi> thet the Nobility and Gentry of <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſhould be ſent for to <hi>Dublin,</hi> unde, colour of paſſing Patents of their Lands; and there ſhould be impriſoned, untill ſuch time as they ſhould either go to the Proteſtant Church, or ſhould be put

               <p>And further ſaith, That when the Rebells of the County of <hi>Monaghan</hi> had ſurprized, or had command of all that County, ſome of them ſaid that they would be governed by the <hi>Roman</hi> Law, and ſome by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Law, which they knew better. And ſaid fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, That when they had taken <hi>Dublin</hi> and <hi>Drogheda, Derry</hi> and <hi>Knockfergus,</hi> which they did not doubt but to conquer before <hi>Candlemas</hi> then next, they would have a Parliament, and would ſettle a Government, but would have no Proteſtants amongſt them; but that they would ſuffer Engliſh or Scottiſh to be Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Lords Juſtices, or Judges, ſo that one of the Iriſh Nation might be joyned with them, and ſo that all ſhould go to Maſſe.</p>
               <p>And the ſame Rebells publikely and generally alſo ſaid, That they made no account but to keep <hi>Ireland</hi> for ever, in regard they had of their own Souldiers two hundred thouſand fighting men, beſides labourers; and they expected from the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his promiſe fifteen thouſand ſouldiers, and Arms and money fit for them: and from the King of <hi>France,</hi> ſome Ayd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> his ſiſter, was ſo deprived of liberty of religion.</p>
               <p>And the ſame Rebells alſo further ſaid, in this Deponents hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That in all forraigne parts it was agreed and reſolved that all Proteſtants or others that would not go to Maſſe, ſhould be put to the Sword.</p>

As for the preſent Rebellion, howſoever the firſt breaking out of this fire into a flame, began firſt on the 28 of <hi>Octob.</hi> 1641, yet was it ſmoking, as may well be conjectured for many yeers before; God having given us many and apparant grounds for the diſcovery of it, had they been duely conſidered, or fully proſecuted to a diſcovery, of which kinde we finde theſe following four particulars:</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt, That about three or four yeers ſince, amongſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Books brought into <hi>Limrick</hi> from forraign parts and ſeized upon by the Reverend Biſhop of that Sea, as prohibited, being thereunto authoriz<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d by the State, One had a written addition to the firſt part, which was printed, the Manuſcript containing a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the Friars of the <hi>Auguſtine</hi> Order, ſometimes ſeated in the Town of <hi>Armagh,</hi> in <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter,</hi> But by reaſon of the times, and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:115024:16"/>
that Preſent reſident (as that writing imported) in the City of <hi>Limrick</hi> in <hi>Munſter,</hi> That while it flouriſhed at <hi>Armagh,</hi> it was protected, and largely provided for by the then Earl of <hi>Tyrone:</hi> Since whoſe expulſion out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> that Convent was alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed, and driven to thoſe diſtreſſes it did for the preſent undergo; but that within three yeers (this is, as I remember, the time limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) <hi>Ireland</hi> ſhould finde, that he had a ſonne inheriting his fathers vertues, who ſhould reſtore that Kingdom to its former Liberty, and that Convent to its firſt luſtre, or words to that effect. This was related unto me by that zealous and learned Prelate Doctor <hi>VVebb,</hi> now Biſhop of <hi>Limrick,</hi> who ſaw and read the ſaid paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage; purpoſing as his Lordſhip told me, to ſend that book to the Lord Preſident of <hi>Munſter,</hi> to be taken into further conſideration.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Hereunto was added a ſecond paſſage, about the ſame time at <hi>Limrick</hi> aforeſaid; where a Popiſh Prieſt gave out, that within three years there ſhould not be a Proteſtant in <hi>Ireland,</hi> or words to that purpoſe, with ſome other materiall circumſtances which I do not now remember; yet all ſo concurring with the former, or the firſt with this (for which preceded I know not, Both being about one time) that it was thought fitting to be conſidered of, the ſayd Prieſt being ſent unto the Lords at <hi>Dublin,</hi> and he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Caſtle.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The third, did agree with the two former, and fell out about the ſame time in the County of <hi>VVeſtmeath,</hi> in the Province of <hi>Limſter;</hi> where <hi>VValter Newgent</hi> of <hi>Rathaſpeck</hi> in the ſaid County, eldeſt Son to <hi>VValter Newgent</hi> Eſquier (a man of great fortunes) upbraiding an Iriſh Proteſtant, who was the Pariſh Clerk of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaſpeck</hi> aforeſaid, with his Religion; and both ſpeaking Latine, the ſaid <hi>Newgent</hi> uttered theſe words; <hi>Infratres annos venient tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus, &amp; potentia in Hibernia, quandò tu longè</hi> (likely meaning <hi>diu.) pendebis in cruce propter diabolicam vestram Religionem.</hi> (The party to which this was ſpoken feared the power of the man) durſt not ſpeak of it, only in private. Yet being called upon and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned juridically, upon oath he depoſed theſe words. And being demanded whether the words were in <hi>Hiberniam,</hi> or <hi>Hibernia;</hi> the firſt importing an Invaſion, the other, an Inſurrection at home: He depoſed the latter, having time given him to conſider of it. Theſe Examinates were ſent to Sir <hi>George Radcliffe; Newgent</hi> was

ſent for, and committed to the Caſtle of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and remained in long durance, but after was diſmiſſed.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Hereunto was added a fourth, about the ſame time near the <hi>Naas,</hi> about 12 miles from <hi>Dublin,</hi> where a popiſh Prieſt newly arrived out of <hi>Flanders,</hi> did make his addreſſe to the then Lord Deputy, and informed his Lordſhip of an intercourſe of Letters between the Earl of <hi>Tirone,</hi> with others in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Primate of <hi>Armagh, Rely;</hi> concerning an Invaſion within a ſhort time intended upon <hi>Ireland;</hi> the ſaid Prieſt offering (ſo his perſon might be ſecured) to direct ſuch as ſhould be thereunto appointed to the place, where the ſaid Letters were in the cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of the ſaid <hi>Rely: Rely</hi> was thereupon ſent for, together with the popiſh Vicar generall of <hi>Armagh,</hi> as I remember it; both were committed to the ſaid Caſtle of <hi>Dublin,</hi> but ſoon after releaſed, and the Informer diſmiſſed, with x. l. and a ſuit of clothes, or ſome ſuch reward.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Hereunto may this be further added another, not ſo plain as the former; That about the ſame time the Lord Baron of <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſany</hi> did ride diſguiſed throughout all the parts of <hi>Mounſter,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to ſatisfie his curioſity in the knowledge of places and perſons: He not being diſcovered untill his return at the Birr, where having offerd himſelf to be bound for one in his company, he writ himſelf in his own ſtile; being loth to leave under his hand a teſtimony of his diſguiſed perſon, and aſſumed name.</p>
               <p>Hereunto may be added, a motion made by the Recuſant party in the Parliament of <hi>Ireland,</hi> for hindring the ſending away of certain Colonels with their forces raiſed in the Kingdom, and pretended to be for ſervice in foreign parts, many wondring it ſhould proceed from them; but therein, conſidering theſe their former practiſes, their intentions may be diſcovered to be far dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from what others conceived thereof, who aſſented there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto: The imploying of ſo many thouſands abroad, being a great weakning of the forces they purpoſed for this their ſoon after following Rebellion.</p>
               <p>To deſcend now from the antecedents of this treaſon, to the falling in thereupon; and laſtly, to the conſequents, &amp; what ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hath been intended, ſuppoſing it to ſucceed, and that it attained the deſired effect, which by them was not doubted of. And firſt,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:115024:17"/>
for the entrance thereinto: Howſoever that the ground-work were long ſince laid, yet would they not have it ſo to ſeeme: But new occaſion muſt be found, as the ſole cauſe of their breaking out, this being intended for the ſatisfying the mindes of ſuch of their own, as have not hitherto bin acquainted with the depth &amp; myſtery of this Iniquity, that they might not ſtand amazed at the ſuddenneſſe of the undertaking, or ſtand off from joyning with them, the worſt part of their deſignes, it being an apparent Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion. The fitteſt means for this, muſt have bin by caſting aſperſions on the preſent Governme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, which if long tolerated, would prove extremely dangerous, not onely to their Religion, but their lives and poſterity. For effecting hereof, reports were caſt out, that in the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> the cutting off of all the Papiſts in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> of what degree ſoever, was concluded upon, the execution of that Reſolution being committed to the Counſell in <hi>Ireland;</hi> The Lords (ſaid they) had laid down a day for this work, being the 23 of <hi>Nov.</hi> then next following, and now laſt paſt, or thereabouts. For the better, more ſecure, and more ſecret managing of this pretended plot, ſuch of the popiſh Nobility and Gentry of both Houſes as appeared in Parliament at <hi>Dublin,</hi> ſhould be ſecured. And for the drawing together of the reſt, amongſt other preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, this alledged to be one, That his Majeſties rents were pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely omitted, and not called upon in Eaſter-Term with that earneſtneſſe as formerly; and that ſuch as made default ſhould be ſummoned to appear in Michaelmas-Term at <hi>Dublin,</hi> and there ſurpriſed; ſuch of them as were in the Country, wanting the heads, being eaſily cut off. They ſay that this pretended plot, was I know not how diſcovered to them: So that for the ſafety of their lives, and profeſſion, they were inforced to ſtand upon their guard, and to counter-work that day of the 23 of <hi>Nov.</hi> laid for their deſtruction, by their declaring themſelves in arms on the 23 of <hi>Octob.</hi> a moneth before. The ſerious part of this Diſcourſe was related to me by a Friar intimate in their Counſel, and by a prieſt a popiſh Vicar generall, therby to give me ſatisfaction, and to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie their proceedings, whoſe names I do for the preſent for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear, in reſpect of his Majeſties ſervice.</p>
               <p>By others alſo it was informed, That this plot was mainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in that Seſſion of Parliament, next after the Earl of <hi>Straf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords</hi>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:115024:17"/>
beheading, and the manner concluded upon in the popiſh private meetings, which were then obſerved to be frequent, and by ſome ſuſpected might prove dangerous, and that for diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of what proviſion of armes and amunition our ſtore of <hi>Dublin</hi> afforded (it being by ſome ſuſpected, that moſt was ſent before to <hi>Carrickfergus)</hi> one of the popiſh faction, in the houſe of <hi>Commons</hi> put one of the Proteſtant members to move, that ſome of the Earle of <hi>Straffords</hi> men had caſt out ſome threatning words a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Parliament in revenge of his Lord, which could not be conceived to end in leſſe than a blowing up of the whole Houſes of Parliament, the ſtore lying under them: whereupon a Committee of both Houſes, many of them prime Papiſts, were appointed to make ſearch in all the corners in the Store: amongſt theſe the Lord <hi>Mac Guire</hi> was one who was obſerved, without occaſion to be liberall in diſpoſing of money to ſome of the Officers of the Store, in a way more than was ordinary with him.</p>
               <p>The laſt Seſſion of Parliament being prorogued, and the time drawing nigh for putting their deſigne in execution, there was a great meeting appointed of the heads of the Romiſh Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, and other Lay-men of their faction, ſaid to bee at the Abbey of <hi>Mullifarvan,</hi> in the Countie of <hi>Weſtmeath,</hi> where is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of <hi>Franciſcans,</hi> thereof openly and peaceably poſſeſſed for many yeares laſt paſt: the day of their meeting being alſo on their Saint <hi>Francis</hi> day, about the beginning of October laſt, but the time and place I cannot confidently affirm, yet howſoever the ſeverall opinions and diſcuſſions are as follow, like as I have received it from the ſaid Fryer, a Franciſcan, and preſent there being a Guardian of that Order, where among many other things there debated; the queſtion was what courſe ſhould bee taken with the Engliſh, and all others that were found in the whole Kingdom to be Proteſtants. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell was therein divided.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some were for their baniſhment, without attempting on their lives; for this was given the Inſtance of the King of <hi>Spaines</hi> expelling out of <hi>Granado,</hi> and other parts of his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, the Moores to the number of many hundreth of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands: all of them being diſmiſſed with their lives, wives and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:115024:18"/>
children, with ſome part of their goods (if not the moſt part) that this his way of proceeding redounded much to the honour of <hi>Spaine,</hi> whereas the ſlaughter of many innocents would have laid an everlaſting blemiſh of cruelty on that State, that the like uſage of the Engliſh their neighbours, and to whom many there preſent owed (if no more) yet their education; would gaine much to the cauſe, both in <hi>England</hi> and other parts: That their goods and eſtates ſeized upon, would bee ſufficient without medling with their perſons, that if the contrary courſe were taken, and their blood ſpilt, beſide the curſe it would draw from heaven upon their cauſe: It might withall incenſe and provoke the neighbour Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> and that iuſtly taking a more ſevere revenge on them and theirs, even to extirpation if it had the upper hand.</p>
               <p n="2">2 On the otherſide, was urged a contrary proceeding to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cutting off all the Engliſh Proteſtants, where to the inſtance of the diſmiſſed <hi>Moores,</hi> it was anſwered, that that was the ſole Act of the King and Queene of <hi>Spaine,</hi> contrary to the adviſe of their Councell, which howſoever it might gaine that Prince a name of metcy, yet therein the event ſhewed him to be moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifull, not onely to his owne, but to all Chriſtendome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide. That this was evident in the great and exceſſive charge that <hi>Spaine</hi> hath beene ſince that time put unto by theſe <hi>Moores</hi> and their poſterity to this day. All Chriſtendome alſo hath and doth ſtill groane under the miſeries it doth ſuffer by the piracies of <hi>Algiers, Sally,</hi> and the like Dennes of theeves. That all this might have beene prevented in one houre by a generall Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre, applying that it was no leſſe dangerous to expell the Engliſh: That theſe Robbers and baniſhed men might againe returne with ſwords in their hands, who by their hard uſage in ſpoiling might bee exaſperated, and by the hope of recovering their former eſtates, would bee incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed farre more than ſtrangers that were ſent againſt them. Being neither in their perſons injured, nor grieved in their eſtate, that therefore a generall Maſſacre were the ſafeſt and readieſt way from freeing the Kingdome of any ſuch feares.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In which diverſity of opinions, howſoever the firſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:115024:18"/>
with ſome, for which the Franciſcans (ſaith this Frier, one of their Guardians) did ſtand, yet others inclined to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond: ſome again leaning to a middle way, neither to diſmiſſe nor kill.</p>
               <p>And according to this do we finde the event and courſe of their proceedings. In ſome places they are generally put to the ſword, or to other miſerable ends: ſome reſtrain their perſons in durance, knowing it to be in their hands to diſpatch them at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; In the mean time, they being reſerved either for profit by their ranſome, or for exchange of priſoners, or gaining their own pardons by the lives of their priſoners, if time would ſerve, or by their death (if the worſt did happen) to ſatisfie their fury. The third ſort, at the firſt altogether diſmiſſed their priſoners, but firſt having ſpoiled them of their goods, and after of their raiment, expoſing the miſerable wretches to cold and famine, whereby many have periſhed by deaths, worſe then ſword or halter.</p>
               <p>Hitherto of their Counſells, and the effects of them. Now for their intentions, all being reduced, which God forbid, into their power; and thereof do they as by ſome Law, give ſuch pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory concluſions, that it may well be wondred the thoughts of men profeſſing themſelves wiſe, ſhould be ſo vain: and herein I do ſtill follow mine Informer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, their loyalty to his Majeſtie ſhall be ſtill reſerved. Thus ſay they of the modeſt ſort: But both his Revenues and Government muſt be reduced to certain bounds: His Rents none other then the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient reſervations before the plantation, and the Cuſtomes ſo ordered, as to them ſhall be thought fitting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, for the Government, ſuch as would be eſteemed loyall, would have<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it committed to the hands of two Lords Iuſtices, one of the ancient Iriſh race, the other of the ancient Britiſh inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants in the Kingdom; Provided that they be of the Romiſh pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, that a Parliament be forthwith called, conſiſting of whom they ſhall think fit to be admitted, wherein their own religious men ſhall be aſs ſtants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Poinings <hi>Act muſt be repealed, and</hi> Ireland <hi>declared to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:115024:19"/>
be a Kingdom independant on</hi> England, <hi>and without any reference un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it in any caſe what ſoever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fiftly, all Acts prejudiciall to the Romiſh Religion, ſhal be aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and it to be enacted, That there be none other profeſsion in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom but the Romiſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixtly, that onely the ancient Nobility of the Kingdom ſhall ſtand, and of them, ſuch as ſhall refuſe to conform to the Romiſh Religion to be removed, and others put in their room; howſoever the preſent Earl of</hi> Kildare <hi>muſt be put out, and another put in his place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly, all plantation lands to be re-called, and the ancient pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priators to be re-inveſted in their former eſtates, with the limitations in their Covenant expreſſed; That they had not formerly ſold their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts an valuable conſiderations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eightly, that the reſpective Counties of the Kingdom be ſubdivided, and certain bounds or Baronies aſsigned to the chief Septs and others of the Nobility; who are to be anſwerable for the Government therof: And that a ſtanding Army may be ſtill in being, the reſpective Governours being to keep a certain nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of men to be ready at all riſings out (as they term it:) They alſo being to build and maintain certain fortreſſes in places moſt convenient within their precincts! And that theſe Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours be of abſolute power, onely reſponſible to the Parliament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly, for maintaining a correſpondencie with other Nations, and for ſecuring the coaſts. That alſo they may be rendred conſiderable unto others, a Navie of a certain number of Ships is to be maintained: That to this end five houſes are to be appointed one in each province, account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Meth <hi>for one of them: That to theſe houſes ſhall be allotted an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall penſion of certain thouſands of pounds to be made up of part of the lands appropriate to Abbeys: And a further contribution to be raiſed in the reſpective provinces to that end: That theſe houſes are to be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to a certain</hi> Order of Knights, <hi>anſwerable to that of</hi> Malta, <hi>who are to be ſea-men: And to maintain this Fleet, that all prizes are to be apportioned; ſome part for a common bank, the reſt to be divided; to which purpoſe the felling of woods ſerviceable for this uſe, is to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden: The Houſe for this purpoſe to be aſsigned to the province of</hi> Leinſtor, <hi>is</hi> Kilmainham, <hi>or rather</hi> Howth, <hi>the Lord of</hi> Howith <hi>being otherwiſe to be accommodated, provided be joyn with them; that place being eſteemed moſt convenient, in reſpect of ſituation, which they have ſmall grounds to hope for.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:115024:19"/>
For effecting of all which, they caſt up the accounts of the forces of this Kingdom, That it is able to make up readily, two hundreth thouſand able men, wanting onely Commanders, and ſome expert ſouldiers for the preſent with arms and ammunition: of all which, they expect a ſpeedy ſupply out of <hi>Flanders,</hi> their own Regiments there exerciſed, being to be ſent over, and ſome ſhipping from <hi>Spain</hi> allotted for ſervice: That this Kingdom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſetled, there are thirty thouſand men to be ſent into <hi>England,</hi> to joyn with the French and Spaniſh forces, and the ſervice in <hi>England</hi> performed, joyntly to fall upon <hi>Scotland,</hi> for reducing both Kingdoms to the obedience of the pope; which being fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, they have ingaged themſelves to the King of <hi>Spain</hi> for aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting him againſt the <hi>Hollanders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for drawing their followers to ſome head, and for giving the fairer gloſſe to their foul Rebellion, it is to be admired, what ſtrange and unlikely rumours of their own deviſing they caſt abroad; ſometimes that many ſail of Spaniards are landed now at one port, then at another: That <hi>Drogheda</hi> was taken at ſuch a day and hour, with all the circumſtances at large, and Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to that purpoſe dated from <hi>Drogheda</hi> by the Rebels that beſieged it: That <hi>Dublin</hi> was taken: And being infinitely am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious of gaining the Earl of <hi>Ormond</hi> to their part, for the greater countenance to their cauſe, giving out that he was their own; which was ſo long beleeved by the ſaid followers, until that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Earl giving daily thoſe honorable Teſtimonies to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and they finding it to their coſt, though with the hazard of his own perſon, further then his place might well allow; they are now otherwiſe ſatisfied, and place him in the rank of their mortall enemies, together with that terrour to them, Sir <hi>Charls Coot,</hi> and others.</p>
               <p>And thus have I laid down all that I have heard to me related, omitting what I finde others more largely to inſiſt upon. All which their treacherous, vain, and ayry projects God diſappoint.</p>
               <p>As for my own private ſufferings by the preſent rebellion, I refer them to another Schedule, this being ſo far taken up.</p>

                  <p>Maſter <hi>VVright,</hi> Archdeacon of <hi>Dromore,</hi> had his houſe which coſt him much, burnt; I ſaw himſelf, his wife, and two children, in extream miſery at <hi>Charlemont,</hi> from whence they journied to <hi>Kinard.</hi>

                  <p>At <hi>Armagh</hi> Archdeacon <hi>Maxwell</hi> related, That about fourty men, women, and children were drowned at <hi>Cor</hi> Bridge, neer <hi>Glaſlough;</hi> the children going merrily hand in hand, as to a place of refuge; and one of their company having licenſe to pray, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo effectually, that one of his Executioners went frantick with the conceit of his impious fact.</p>
                  <p>The words which I took notice of, were theſe: Sir <hi>Phelim ô Neal</hi> told, in my hearing, That he had Commiſſion for what he did, not only from moſt of the chief of the Nobility of this Kingdom, but from his Majeſty; and had alſo Letters to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe from the Earl of <hi>Argile.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And that their intentions were onely for the liberty of their Religion, and for the recovery of their Lands, which ſhould appear by the Law of the Land to be unjuſtly held from them.</p>
                  <p>Colonell <hi>Plunket</hi> told us at <hi>Armagh,</hi> That ſeeing this exploit was begun, he was one of the chief plotters thereof, and was ſeven yeers emplyed in the compaſſing of it.</p>
                  <p>Frier <hi>Malone</hi> of <hi>Skerries</hi> did take the poor mens Bibles, which he found in the Boat, and cut them in pieces, and caſt them into the fire, with theſe words, That he would deal in like manner with all Proteſtant and Puritan Bibles.</p>
                  <p>At Maſter <hi>Connors</hi> houſe (where the Frier was) they had <hi>Hanmors</hi> Chronicle, out of which they animated the Rebells with the Story of the <hi>Danes</hi> Diſcomfiture by the Iriſh, though for the moſt part unarmed, and paralelled the Hiſtory with theſe times.</p>

                  <p>At <hi>Armagh,</hi> Colonell <hi>Pluncket</hi> told us of another Viſion

ſeen at <hi>Liſneigarvey,</hi> which he and about twenty more beheld, after the Battle (wherein the Iriſh loſt very many of their men, and moſt of their Arms) There was an houſe ſet on fire at the end of the Town; by the light of which fire, they diſcerned a number of Horſe-men riding to and fro; the number ſeemed to the Colonell, to be about a Thouſand, or Fifteen hundred: Upon which relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I was bold to enquire whether they ſeemed their own, or their enemies: he anſwered, That ſometime they conceived them their own, other while their enemies.</p>
                  <p>Yet I believed they could hardly ſeem their own, becauſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them they had not neer ſo many Horſes. I further deſired to know what they ſuppoſed them to be: he ſaid, They were conceived to be Fayries, or ſuch like.</p>

                  <hi>The Examination of</hi> Roger Holland <hi>of</hi> Glaſlogh, <hi>in the County of</hi> Monaghan.</head>
               <p>THis Examinate duly ſworn, depoſeth <hi>inter alia,</hi> That during his impriſonment, he was credibly informed, that there were <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ex.</hi> 77.</note> 38 perſons, men, women, and children drown'd, being thrown over into the river of <hi>Corr-</hi>bridge in the County of <hi>Armagh;</hi> and alſo ſaith, That Sir <hi>Phelim ô Neale,</hi> under pretence of ſending a Convoy with many of the Engliſh of <hi>Loghgall,</hi> and thereabouts, the ſaid Convoy did drown at the Bridge of <hi>Pontie-Down,</hi> 68 perſons, as he is credibly informed: And likewiſe, that he did ſee 14 or 15 kill'd by the Iriſh as he paſſed in the country.</p>
               <p>And further ſaith, That Friar <hi>Malone,</hi> when this Examinate arrived at <hi>Skerries,</hi> that his Company ſhot one ſhot at the Veſſel; and that the ſaid Company asked whether we had a Paſſe or not, which we told them we had; whereupon they replyed, That if we had not, we ſhould all ſuffer: But ſo ſoon as we ſhewed them our Paſſe, they made much of us, &amp; told us that we ſhould take no hurt; which they performed the next day, being Chriſtmas-day.</p>
               <p>The ſaid Friar took a boat, to go to the boat to ſee whether
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:115024:42"/>
there were a leak in our Veſſell or not, and ſearching for the leak, he found ſome Bibles, and other Prayer-Books, which ſaid Books he caſt into the fire, and wiſhed that he had all the Bibles in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom, and he would ſerve them all ſo, and demanding of him what was the reaſon, he anſwered, That it was fitting for every man to have the Bible by rote, and not to miſinſtruct them which ſhould have it by rote: and the ſaid <hi>Roger</hi> ſitting by him alone, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of him, what might be the reaſon of their going out in ſuch manner, as in killing and robbing the Engliſh, and perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him to make peace; he replyed, unleſſe all men that had eſtates loſt, by the Kings giving them unto great men, that were little worth in former times, unleſſe they had their eſtates given under the Kings Broad-Seal, that they would never yeild; And withall, that it they had not the Duke of <hi>York</hi> for their Governour and Ruler in this Kingdom, and to be a Papiſt, they would never yeild as aforeſaid. And further ſaid, That they would have the whole Kingdom to themſelves, and that they have been about this plot this ſeventeen yeers paſt, but never had ſo fit an opportunity as now they had.</p>
               <p>And the ſaid <hi>Roger</hi> ſaith further, That being in company with Colonell <hi>Pluncket</hi> at <hi>Newry</hi> and <hi>Carlingford,</hi> the ſaid Colonell told the ſaid <hi>Roger</hi> and many others, that this ſaid plot was for theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteen yeers paſt in plotting, and that the ſaid Fryar <hi>Malone</hi> and himſelf, and one of the Lord of <hi>Trimbortons</hi> ſonnes, which is a Fryer, with many others of the Nobility of the <hi>Pale,</hi> and in the North, knew it of long time, but that others of the Nobles knew not of it, but of late; but as for the reſt they have known of it the ſpace and yeers aforeſaid: And that they ſaid they would have their Religion or not any, or elſe that they would looſe both their lives and eſtates, for in ſtrength they were able enough, for he ſaid all the Iriſh would not fail, but ſtick cloſe to them, for they fought for God and their Country, for certain they knew that there cauſe was juſt, and that God would not ſee them ſuffer, and that they were ſure of <hi>Dublin,</hi> for there was not any thing done, but that they had ſuch friends, that they heard out of <hi>Dublin</hi> every day, and as for Sir <hi>Phelomy ô Neal</hi> he made no accompt as he ſaid, of all <hi>Ireland</hi> to be his own, and others, for that was there intents.</p>
               <p>And further ſaith, That at <hi>Carlingford,</hi> when the foreſaid <hi>Roger</hi>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:115024:42"/>
was there three or four dayes, Sir <hi>Con Magenis</hi> ſent his Warrant, to ſend away all ſuch priſoners as came from <hi>Newry</hi> over to <hi>Green Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle;</hi> which Warrant was directed to one <hi>Jo.

               <p>And further ſaith, That an owner of a Boat in <hi>Carlingford</hi> told him, that one M<hi rend="sup">ris</hi> 
                  <hi>Holland</hi> was hang'd; and as ſhe was hanging, was delivered of two children; and further cannot ſay.</p>

               <p>THis Examinate duely ſworn, depoſeth <hi>inter alia,</hi> That about <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ex.</hi> 78.</note> the 30 day of <hi>October,</hi> this Examinate, with moſt of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, was caſt into the Dungeon, which was a place of that noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomeneſſe, by reaſon of great heaps of mens excrements, that had been there a long time, that they were almoſt ſtifled; the Dungeon was ſo little, and the people ſo many, being ſome fourty eight per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that they were fain to lie one upon another; ſo that the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminate, after he had been ſome ſeventeen dayes, ſometimes in the Dungeon, ſometimes in the Goal, got ſuch a looſeneſſe, with cold and hard lodging, that he was not able to go, but as he was carried betwixt men. During their continuance in this miſerable reſtraint, no meat was allowed the priſoners by the Rebells, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would they ſcarce ſuffer either their wives or friends to ſee or ſpeak with them; but oftentimes, both in the night and day, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of the Rebells came to the priſoners with ſwords, and Skeans drawn, with Piſtolls cocked, to the great terrour of the priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: and ſome came often and ſcarched them; and if they found any ſilver, either more or leſſe, they took it from them, and ſtripped them of their clothes, in the very Dungeon, and left
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:115024:43"/>
many almoſt naked, with few or no rags to cover them: And when theſe priſoners were ſet at liberty, ſoon after many were murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Skeans, ſome drowned, and ſome hanged: Maſter <hi>Richard Blaney,</hi> who was priſoner in another place, being bolted with Irons, was taken forth ſuddenly, and hanged, and caſt into a kinde of a Boggie place, without Buriall, ſtark naked. The ſame day one Maſter <hi>Luke VVard</hi> was taken and hanged in the ſame Town of <hi>Monaghan;</hi> in the beginning of the night, and was never told he ſhould die; but being taken by one <hi>Patr: oge ô Connelley,</hi> was brought into a houſe in Town; and there <hi>Patr:</hi> gave him worth 12<hi rend="sup">d</hi> or more of drink, as though no hurt were intended, preſently went to the back ſide, and called out the ſaid <hi>Luke VVard,</hi> and with others of his company laid hold on him, and hanged him, and after threw him into a little River, where he lay naked and unburied: The next morning many of thoſe that were let out of priſon, being almoſt ſtarved and famiſhed, were murthered with Skeans, and others drowned: Maſter <hi>Oliver Peirce,</hi> Enſigne to the Lord <hi>Blaney,</hi> murthered with Swords and Skeans; Maſter <hi>John Francis, Edward Lewis, Richard Bollard,</hi> and <hi>VVilliam Iones,</hi> murthered with Skeans and Swords; and many others purſued, who eſcaped that night: <hi>Thomas VVeſt</hi> was never heard of ſince. A poor Engliſh-man unknown came ſtragling to the Towne, having eſcaped from ſome other place, was hanged.</p>
               <p>Some of thoſe that were impriſoned, were ſent out of the Town of <hi>Monaghan,</hi> to <hi>Glaſlough,</hi> where they had lived formerly; and there they, with others, to the number of fourty, were caſt into a River at the edge of the County, men, women, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: In the mean time, ſo many as eſcaped were in great miſery and fears, dayly hearing, that not an Engliſh man, woman, or childe ſhould be left alive; that there was the like ſtirre in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Scotland;</hi> and that never a Proteſtant muſt be ſuffered to live in any of the three Kingdoms; and that the Seas wre full of Spaniſh and French Shipping; and that all the Iriſh in other parts, were coming homewards to help to ſubdue the Engliſh in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and then they were to be in <hi>England</hi> before <hi>May</hi> for the ſame purpoſe; and the like to be done in <hi>Scotland</hi> alſo. It was uſually reported that none muſt bear rule in <hi>Ireland,</hi> but onely the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:115024:43"/>
Natives; and that all the Lands which were enjoyed by any of the Britiſh, muſt forthwith be taken from them; which was according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done in all parts hereabouts.</p>
               <p>It was frequently noyſed and reported, That the Kings Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty was dead, or not to be had; and that there was a Crown con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated for ſome other that ſhould deſerve it beſt; and when af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards it was reported His Majeſty was in <hi>England,</hi> it was ſaid that Sir <hi>Phelim ô Neal</hi> was made Generall by His Majeſties appointment; and that there were others that had command by the ſame appointment.</p>
               <p>We dayly heard of moſt cruell murthers of priſoners on all ſides of us, beſides what we ſaw committed in our own Town: in ſome places neer were hanged ſometimes 17, ſometimes 22 at a time; as at <hi>Clowniſh,</hi> and <hi>Carrick mac Roſſe.</hi> And within ſeven miles were murthered ſome 25 men, women, and children in the night; and every hour we expected the like uſage, being often threatned that not any Engliſh ſhould be left in <hi>Ireland.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyes were ſent with many, pretending to bring priſoners ſafe to ſuch places as they were deſired to go, and were moſt pitifully murthered and drowned by the way by ſuch as conveyed them, others were turned out without any Convoy, and ſo mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered.</p>
               <p>About ſix weeks ſince, I, my wife, and four ſmall children, with ſome other Engliſh, were turned out of the Town of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naghan,</hi> about three of the Clock in the afternoon, the Drum beating, and <hi>Art Roe mac</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Patrick mac Art Moyl,</hi> who is chief Governour there, went before, and declared that we muſt be gone forthwith, and not ſuffered to return, on pain of death; when we were aſſured, that not paſt a quarter of a mile before us, there were men with Swords and with Skeans, lying in wait to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and ſtrip us, of which we were fully aſſured; but it pleaſed God we eſcaped that time, by means of one <hi>Bryan mac Hugh mac Roſſe mac Mahon,</hi> about a week after we had leave to come as far as within a mile of <hi>Drogheda,</hi> called <hi>Bewley;</hi> neer unto which place are encamped many Rehels, which came from towards <hi>Monaghan,</hi> and other places of the North; at which place S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lim ô Neal</hi> was, where might he perceived by the Speeches of the Rebels, that they were very confident to take <hi>Drogheda,</hi> and <hi>Dublin,</hi>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:115024:44"/>
but during this Examinates remaining there, were driven off the Walls, which they aſſayed to aſſault with ſcaling-Ladders, on Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day laſt was a ſennight, in the morning before day, and many prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be God, run from the Walls, and left ſome of their Muskets and Pikes behinde them, as they related amongſt themſelves, from thence this Examinate was ſent into <hi>Drogheda,</hi> and a Priſoner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed thence for him, and from thence is gotten to <hi>Dublin</hi> by Sea with his Wife and four ſmall children, neer famiſhed and ſtarved, being left quite deſtitute of all relief for the preſent.</p>
