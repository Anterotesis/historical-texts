            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

A METHOD Concerning the Relief and Employment OF THE POOR: Humbly offer'd to the Consideration of the KING and both Houses of PARLIAMENT. Taken out of Sir <hi>Josiah Child</hi>'s Writings.

            <head>A METHOD Concerning the Relief and Employment OF THE POOR.</head>
            <p>IN the Discourse of this Subject, I shall first assert some Particulars, which I think are agreed by common Consent, and from thence take occasion to proceed to what is more doubtful.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That our Poor in <hi>England</hi> have always been in a most sad and wretched condition, some Famished for want of Bread, others starved with Cold and Nakedness, and many whole Families in all the out Parts of Cities and great Towns, commonly remain in a languishing, nasty and useless Condition, Uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable to themselves, and unprofitable to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, this is confessed and lamented by all Men.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the <hi>Children</hi> of our <hi>Poor</hi> bred up in <hi>Beggary</hi> and <hi>Laziness,</hi> do by that means become not only of <hi>unhealthy Bodies,</hi> and more then ordinary subject to many loathsome Diseases, whereof very
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59482:3"/>
many die in their tender Age, and if any of them do arrive to years and strength, they are, by their idle habits contracted in their Youth, rendred for ever after indispos'd to Labour, and serve only to stock the <hi>Kingdom</hi> with <hi>Thieves</hi> and <hi>Beggars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. That if all our impotent <hi>Poor</hi> were provided for, and those of both Sexes, and all Ages that can do Work of any kind, employed, it would redound some Hundreds of Thousands of Pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> to the Publick Advantage.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That it is our Duty to GOD and Nature so to Provide for, and Employ the Poor.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That by so doing one of the great Sins (for which this Land ought to Mourn) would be removed.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That our fore-Fathers had pious Intentions towards this good Work, as appears by the many Statutes made by them to this purpose.</p>
            <p n="7">7. That there are Places in the World, wherein the <hi>Poor</hi> are so provided for, and employed; as in <hi>Holland, Hamborough, New-England</hi> and others, and as I am informed, now in the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus far we all agree: The first Question then that naturally occurs is,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>How comes it to pass that in</hi> England <hi>we do not, nor ever did comfortably Maintain and Employ our Poor?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The common Answers to this Question are two.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That our Laws to this purpose are as good as any in the World, but we fail in the execution.</item>
               <item>2. That formerly in the days of our Pious Ancestors the work was done, but now Charity is deceased, and that is the reason we see the Poor so neglected as now they are.</item>
            </list>
            <p>In both which Answers (I humbly conceive) the Effect is mistaken for the Cause: For tho' it cannot
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59482:3"/>
he denied, but there hath been, and is a great failure in the Execution of those <hi>Statutes</hi> which relate to the <hi>Poor;</hi> yet I say, the <hi>Cause of that failure, hath been oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned by defe<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t of the Laws themselves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For otherwise, what is the reason that in our late times of the Confusion and Alteration, wherein al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most every Party in the Nation, at one time or other, took their turn at the Helm, and all had that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass (those Laws) to Steer by, and yet none of them could, or ever did, conduct the <hi>Poor</hi> into a Harbour of security to them, and profit to the Kidgdom, i. e. <hi>none sufficiently maintained the Impotent, and employed the Indigent amongst us:</hi> And if this was never done in any Age, nor by any sort of Men whatsoever in this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> who had the use of those Laws now in force, it seemes to me a very strong Argument that it never could, nor ever will be done by those Laws, and that consequently the defect lies in the Laws themselves, not in the Men, <hi>i. e.</hi> those that should put them in Execution.</p>
            <p>As to the second Answer to the aforesaid Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, wherein <hi>want of Charity</hi> is assigned for another cause why the <hi>Poor</hi> are now so much neglected, I think it is a <hi>scandalous ungrounded accusation</hi> of our <hi>Contemporaries;</hi> for most that I converse with, are not so much troubled to part with their Money, as how to place it, that it may do good, and not hurt to the Kingdom: For, <hi>If they give to the Beggars in the Streets, or at their Doors, they fear they may do hurt by</hi> encouraging that Lazy unprofitable kind of Life; and <hi>if they give more than their Proportions in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective Parishes, that</hi> (they say) <hi>is but giving to the Rich,</hi> for the <hi>Poor</hi> are not set on Work thereby, nor
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59482:4"/>
have the more given them; but only their <hi>Rich</hi> Neighbours pay the less. And for what was given in <hi>Churches</hi> to the <hi>Visited Poor,</hi> and to such as were <hi>impoverished by the Fire;</hi> we have heard of so many and great Abuses of that kind of <hi>Charity,</hi> that most men are under sad Discouragements in Relation thereunto.</p>
            <p>I write not this to divert any Man from Works of Chaity of any kind: <hi>He that gives to any in Want does well, but be that gives to Employ and Educate the Poor, so as to render them useful to the Kingdom, in my judgement does better.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here by the way, not to leave men at a loss how to dispose of what GOD shall incline their Hearts to give for the Benefit of the <hi>Poor,</hi> I think it not impertinent to propose the <hi>Hospitals</hi> of the <hi>City,</hi> and <hi>Poor Labouring People that have many Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> and make a hard shift to sustain them by their industry, whereof there are multitudes in the out Parts of this <hi>City, as the best Objects of Charity at present.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to return to my purpose, <hi>viz.</hi> to prove that the want of <hi>Charity</hi> likewise that is now, and always hath been in relation to the <hi>Poor, proceeds from a defect in our Laws.</hi> Ask any Charitable-minded Man, as he goes along the Streets of <hi>London,</hi> viewing the <hi>Poor,</hi> viz, <hi>Boyes, Girles, Men and Women</hi> of all Ages, and Many in good Health, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> why he and others do not take care for the setting those poor Creatures to Work? Will he not readily answer, that he wisheth heartily it could be done, though it cost him some part of his Estate, but he is but one Man, and can do nothing towards it; giving them Money, as hath been said, being but to bring them into a liking and continuance in that way.</p>
            <p>%<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59482:4"/>
Question 2. <hi>Wherein lyes the defect of our, present Laws relating to the Poor?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I answer, that there may be many, but I shall here take notice of one only, which I think to be Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, and which until altered, the <hi>Poor</hi> in <hi>England</hi> can never be well provided for, or Employed; and that when the said Fundamental Error is well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, it is almost impossible they should lack ei<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>er Work or Maintainance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The said radical Error I esteem to be the leaving it to the Care of every Parish to maintain their own Poor only;</hi> upon which follows the shifting off, sending or whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back the poor Wanderers to the place of their Birth, or last Abode; the Practice whereof I have seen many Years in <hi>London,</hi> to signify as much as ever it will, which is just nothing of Good to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in general, or the <hi>Poor</hi> thereof, though it be sometimes by accident to so<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> of them a Punishment without effect; I say without effect, because it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms not the Party, nor disposeth the minds of others to Obedience, which are the true ends of all Punishment.</p>
            <p>As for instance, <hi>a poor idle Person,</hi> that will not Work, or that no Body will employ in the Country, comes up to <hi>London, to set up the Trade of Begging,</hi> such a person probably may <hi>Begg</hi> up and down the Streets seven Years, it may be seven and twenty, before any body asketh why she doth so, and if at length she hath the ill hap in some Parish, to meet with a more Vigilant <hi>Beadle</hi> then one of twenty of them are, all he does is but to lead her the length of five or six Houses into another Parish, and then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, as his <hi>Masters</hi> the <hi>Parishoners</hi> do, that he hath
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59482:5"/>
done the part of a most diligent Officer: But suppose he should yet go further to the end of his Line, which is the end of the Law; and the perfect Execution of his Office; that is, suppose he should carry this poor wretch to a <hi>Justice</hi> of the Peace, and he should order the <hi>Delinquent</hi> to be <hi>Whipt</hi> and sent from <hi>Parish</hi> to <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish,</hi> to the place of her <hi>Birth</hi> or last Abode, which not one <hi>Justice</hi> of twenty (through Pity or other cause) will do; even this is a great charge upon the Country, and yet the business of the Nation it self wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done: For no sooner doth the <hi>Delinquent</hi> arrive at the place assign'd, but for Shame or Idleness she pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently deserts it, and wanders directly back, or some other way, hoping for better Fortune, whilst the <hi>Parish</hi> to which she is sent, knowing her a Lazy, and perhaps a worse qualified person, is as willing to be rid of her, as she is to be gone from thence.</p>
            <p>If it be here retorted upon me, that by my own confession, much of this mischief happens by the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>on, or ill Execution of the Laws, I say, Better Execution then you have seen, you must not expect; <hi>and there was never a good Law made, that was not well execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; the fault of the Law causing a failure of execution;</hi> it being natural to all men to use the remedy next at hand, and rest satisfied with shifting the Evil from their own Doors; which in regard they can so easily do, by threatning or thrusting a <hi>poor Body</hi> out of the verge of their own <hi>Parish,</hi> it is unreasonable and vain to hope that ever it will be otherwise.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For the Laws against Inmates,</hi> and empowering the Parishioners to take Security before they suffer any poor Person to inhabit amongst them; it may be they were prudent constitutions at the times they were
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59482:5"/>
made (and before <hi>England</hi> was a place of Trade) and may be so still in some Countries; but I am sure in <hi>Cities</hi> &amp; great <hi>Towns</hi> of <hi>Trade,</hi> they are altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper, and contrary to the practice of other <hi>Cities</hi> and <hi>Trading Towns abroad.</hi> The Riches of a <hi>City,</hi> as of a <hi>Nation,</hi> consisting in the multitude of <hi>inhabitants;</hi> and if so, <hi>you must allow Inmates, or have a City of Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages.</hi> And if a right course be taken for the Susten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the <hi>Poor,</hi> and setting them on Work, you need invent no Stratagems to keep them out, but rather to bring them in. For, <hi>There sort of Poor to a City or Nation well managed, is in effect, the conflux of Riches to that City or Nation;</hi> and therefore the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til <hi>Dutch</hi> receive, and relieve, or employ all that come to them, not enquiring what <hi>Nation,</hi> much less what <hi>Parish</hi> they are of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Question 3. If the defect be in our Laws, how shall we find a remedy that may be rational and consistent?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This I confess is a hard and difficult question, it is one of the <hi>Ardua Regni,</hi> &amp; may very well deserve the most deliberat consideration of our wisest <hi>Counsellors.</hi> And if A WHOLE SESSION OF PARLIAMENT WERE EMPLOYED ON THIS SINGULAR CONCERN, I think it would be time spent as much to the Glory of GOD and good of this <hi>Nation,</hi> as in any thing that noble and worthy <hi>Patriots</hi> of their Country can be engaged in: But seeing I have adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured thus far, I shall humbly proceed to offer some General Proposals that have a tendency towards the effecting this great Work, which being seriously thought of and debated by a COMMITTEE, may be capable of such melioration as may render them in a great measure effectual to the <hi>Kingdom</hi> in
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59482:6"/>
general, although at present, to prevent that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Objection, that great Mutations are dangerous; I shall only propose them to be experimented in these parts of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> which are the Vitals of our body politick, which being once made sound, the care of the rest will not be difficult.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Proposition, 1. That the City of</hi> London <hi>and</hi> West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster, <hi>Burrough of</hi> Southwark, <hi>and all other places within the usual Lines of Communication,</hi> described within the weekly Bills of Mortality, <hi>may by Act of Parliament be associated into one Province or line of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication for relief of the Poor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That there be one Assembly of men (and such as they shall from time to time appoint and deputise) entrusted with the care for, and treasure of all the Poor within the said Pale or Line of Communication.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>That the said Assembly be incorporated by Act of Parliament,</hi> with perpetual Succession by the name of <hi>Fathers of the Poor,</hi> or some other honourable and significant Title.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>That all Constables, Church-wardens, Overseers, or other Officers in all Parishes,</hi> within the said Line, <hi>be subordinate &amp; accomptable to the said Fathers of the Poor, and their Deputies, for, &amp; in all things relating to the Poor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>That the said Fathers of the Poor may have liberty to Assess and receive into their common Treasury,</hi> for relief of their Poor, <hi>so much Money from every Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish as they yearly paid to that purpose any of the three Years preceding this Constitution, and to compel the Payment thereof, but not of more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. That the said <hi>Fathers of the Poor,</hi> and their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties, may have very large and sufficient Power in all things relating to the Poor, and particularly to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59482:6"/>
have and receive the charitable benevolence of all Persons once every <hi>Sunday</hi> in every Parish-Church, and in any other place, and at any other time or times which they shall think fit.</p>
            <p n="7">7. That the said Fathers of the Poor, and such as they shall authorize, may have Power to purchase Lands, erect and endow Work-houses, Hospitals and Houses of Correction, and to exercise all other Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers relating to the Poor, that any number of <hi>Justices</hi> of the <hi>Peace</hi> now may do, in their <hi>Quarter Sessions</hi> or otherwise.</p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>That the said Fathers of the Poor may have</hi> Power <hi>to send such Poor beyond the Seas as they shall think fit into his Majesties Plantations, taking Security for their comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Maintainance during their Service, and for their freedom afterwards.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. <hi>That the said Fathers of the Poor may have</hi> Power <hi>to erect petty</hi> Banks <hi>and</hi> Lumbards for the benefit of the Poor, if they shall find it convenient, and also to receive the one half of what is paid at all the Doors of <hi>Play-Houses</hi> [if they be continued] and have the <hi>Patent</hi> for <hi>Farthings,</hi> and to do whatever else his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty</hi> and the <hi>Parliament</hi> shall think fit to recommend to them, or leave to their Discretion.</p>
            <p n="10">10. <hi>That the Treasure that shall be collected for this purpose, be accounted sacred; and that it be</hi> Fellony to misapply, conceal, lend or convert it to any other use or purpose whatsoever.</p>
            <p n="11">11. <hi>That there be no</hi> Oaths, <hi>or other</hi> Tests <hi>imposed upon the</hi> Fathers <hi>of the Poor, at their Admission, to bar out Nonconformists,</hi> amongst whom there will be found some excellent Instruments for this good Work, and such as will constantly attend it, for if
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59482:7"/>
they be kept out, the People will be cold in their Charity, and in their hopes of the success.</p>
            <p n="12">12. That the said <hi>Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Poor</hi> may constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wear some honourable Medal, such as the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament shall devise,</hi> besides the <hi>Green Staff</hi> which is now used in <hi>London</hi> to such like purpose (but upon extraordinary days only) <hi>to denote their Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Office,</hi> at all times, and in all places, after the manner of the Habits in <hi>Spain,</hi> or rather, as have all the <hi>Familars</hi> of the <hi>Inquisition</hi> in most <hi>Romish</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, with admirable effect, tho to a wicked purpose; the consequence whereof will be, that the said <hi>Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Poor,</hi> being Numerous, and disperst by their Habitations and Business into most parts of their <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,</hi> will readily see any neglects of Officers, and as easily redress them; the <hi>Medal</hi> which they wear about them, being a sufficient Warrant to command Obedience from all <hi>Parish Officers</hi> wherever they come, although their Persons be not known there.</p>
            <p n="13">13. That the said <hi>Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Poor</hi> may have Liberty to admit into their Society, and all <hi>Powers</hi> and <hi>Priviledges</hi> equal with them, any Persons that are willing to serve GOD, their King and Country in this Pious and publick Work, the Persons desiring to be so admitted, paying at their admission <hi>100l.</hi> or more, into the Poors Treasury, as a demonstration of the Sincerity of their Intentions to labour in and cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate this most Religious Vineyard. This I only offer because the number of the said <hi>Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Poor</hi> hereafter mentioned, may be thought rather too few than too many.</p>
            <p n="14">14. That the said Fathers of the <hi>Poor,</hi> besides the Authority now exercised by <hi>Justices</hi> of the <hi>Peace,</hi> may
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59482:7"/>
have some less limited Powers given them, in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Punishment of their own, and Parish Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers by pecuniary mulcts for the Poors benefit, in case of neglect, <hi>and otherwise, as his</hi> Majesty <hi>and the</hi> Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>shall think fit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="15">15. That the said Fathers of the <hi>Poor</hi> may have freedom to set the <hi>Poor</hi> on Work about whatsoever Manufacture they think fit, with a <hi>Non obstante</hi> to all Patents that have been or shall be granted to any Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Person or Persons for the sole Manufacture of any Commodity; the want of which priviledge, I have been told, was a prejudice to the Work-house at <hi>Clerkenwell,</hi> in the late design of setting their <hi>Poor Children</hi> about making of <hi>Hangings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="16">16. That all Vacancies by reason of Death of any of the said <hi>Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Poor,</hi> be perpetually supply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Election of the Survivors.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest. 4. Who shall be the Persons entrusted with so great a Work, and such excess of Power?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is a Question likewise of some difficulty; and the more, in regard of our present Differences in <hi>Religion;</hi> but I shall answer it as well as I can.</p>
            <p>In general I say, <hi>They must be such as the People must have ample satisfaction in, or else the whole Design will be lost:</hi> For if the universality of the People be not satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the Persons, they will never part with their Money; but if they be well satisfied therein, they will be miraculously charitable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qest. 5. What sort of men the People will be most satisfied in?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I answer, I think <hi>in none so well as such only as a common Hall of the Livery-men of</hi> London <hi>shall make choice of,</hi> it being evident by the experience of many
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59482:8"/>
Ages, that the several <hi>Corporations</hi> in <hi>London</hi> are the best <hi>Administrators</hi> of what is left to <hi>ebaritable Uses,</hi> that have ever been in this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> which is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest in the regular, just and prudent management of the <hi>Hospitals of London,</hi> and was wisely observed by <hi>Doctor-Collet Dean of</hi> St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> that prudent <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastick,</hi> when he left the Government of that <hi>School,</hi> and other great Revenues assigned by him for cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Uses, unto the disposition of the <hi>Mercers Company.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> That <hi>Country-Gentlemen,</hi> who have Power in places of their Residences, and pay out of their large Estates considerable sums towards the Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of their <hi>Poor</hi> within the aforelimited Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincts, may be justly Offended if they likewise have not a share in the distribution of what shall be raised to that purpose.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The force of this Objection may be much taken off, if the <hi>City</hi> be obliged to choose but a certain number out of the <hi>City,</hi> as suppose seventy for <hi>London,</hi> ten out of <hi>Southwark</hi> for that <hi>Burrough,</hi> twenty for <hi>Westminster,</hi> this would best satisfie the People, and I think do the Work: But if it be thought too much for the <hi>City</hi> to have the choice of any more than their own seventy, the <hi>Justices of the Peace</hi> in their <hi>Quarter-Sessions</hi> may nominate and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point their own number of persons to assist for their respective Jurisdictions, and so to supply the vacan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in case of Death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But all must be conjunctive, but one <hi>Body Politick,</hi> or the work will never be done.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest. 6. What will be the advantage to the Kingdom in general, and to the Poor in particular, that will accrue by such a Society of men, more than is enjoyed by the Laws at present?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:59482:8"/>
               <hi>I answer,</hi> innumerable and unspeakable are the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits to this Kingdom that will arise from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultatons and Debates of such a wife and honest <hi>Council,</hi> who being men so elected as aforesaid, will certainly conscionably study and labour to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge their trust in this Service of GOD, their <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Country.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Poor,</hi> of what quality soever, as soon as they are met with, will be immediatly relieved or set on Work where they are found, without hurry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them from place to place, and torturing their Bodies to no purpose.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Charitable minded men, will know certainly where to dispose of their Charity, so as it may be employed to right purposes.</p>
            <p n="3">3. House-keepers will be freed from the intoler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Incumbrance of Beggars at their Door.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Plantations will be regularly supplyed with Servants, and those that are sent thither well provided for.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The said Assembly will doubtless appoint some of their own Members to visit and relieve such as are Sick, as often as there shall be occasion, together with poor Labouring Families both in <hi>City</hi> and <hi>Suburbs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Poor Children will be instructed in Learning and Arts,</hi> and thereby rendred serviceable to their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and many other worthy Acts done for publick good by the joint deliberation of so many prudent and pious Men, assisted with such a Power and Purse, more then can be fore-seen or expressed by a private Person.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest. 7. What shall all the Poor of these Cities and Countries, being very numerous, be employed about!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>%<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59482:9"/>
This question will be answer'd best by the said Assembly themselves when they have met &amp; consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted together, who cannot be presumed deficient of Invention to set all the <hi>Poor</hi> on Work, especially since they may easily have Admirable Presidents from the Practice of <hi>Holland</hi> in this particular, &amp; have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy very good ones of their own, in theOrders of their <hi>Hospitals</hi> of <hi>Christ-Church</hi> and <hi>Bridewell</hi> in <hi>London;</hi> the <hi>Girles</hi> may be employed in mending the Cloathes of the <hi>Aged,</hi> in <hi>Spinning, Carding,</hi> and other <hi>Linnen Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures,</hi> and many in <hi>Sowing Linnen</hi> for the <hi>Exchange,</hi> or any <hi>House-keeper</hi> that will put out Linnen to the <hi>Matrons</hi> that have the Govenment of them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Boys</hi> in <hi>picking Okam, making Pins, rasping Wood, making Hangings,</hi> or any other <hi>Manufacture</hi> of any kind, which whether it turns to present profit or not, is not much material, the great business of the Nation being first but to keep the <hi>Poor,</hi> from <hi>Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging</hi> and <hi>Starving,</hi> and en<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ring such as are able to Labour and Discipline, that they may be hereafter useful Members to the Kingdom: But to conclude, I say the wisest Man living solitary cannot propose or imagine such excellent ways &amp; methods as will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented be the united Wisdom of so garve an <hi>Assembly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The sitting of the said <hi>Assembly,</hi> I humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, ought to be <hi>de Die in Dlem;</hi> the <hi>Quoram</hi> not more then thirteen; whether they shall Yearly, Monthlyor Weekly choose a <hi>President,</hi> how they shall distribute themselves into the several quarters of the <hi>Communication,</hi> what <hi>Treasurers</hi> and other <hi>Officers</hi> to Employ, and where, and how many, will be best de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by themselves, and that without diffculty; because many that will probably be Members of the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59482:9"/>
said <hi>Assembly,</hi> have already had large experience of the Government of the <hi>Hospitals</hi> of <hi>London:</hi> The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Election of the said <hi>Fathers of the Poor,</hi> I humbly suppose, cannot possibly be better contrived then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the same way which the <hi>East-India Company</hi> choose their <hi>Committee,</hi> which will prevent the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion, Irregularity and Incertitude that may attend the Election of Voices, or holding up of Hands; especially because the Persons to be Elected at one time will be very many; the said manner Proposed is, Every <hi>Elector, viz.</hi> every <hi>Livery-Man,</hi> to bring to <hi>Guild-Hall</hi> at the appointed day for Elections, a List of the whole number of Persons, such as he think: fit that are to be Elected, and deliver the same openly unto such Persons as the <hi>Lord Mayor, Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> and <hi>Common-Council-Men</hi> shall appoint to make the Scrutiny; which Persons so entrusted, with the said Scrutiny, seven, or ten days after, as shall be thought fit, at another <hi>Common Hall</hi> may declare who are the Persons Elected by the Majority of Votes.</p>
            <p>If it be here Objected to the whole purpose of this Treatise, that this work may as well be done in distinct <hi>Parishes,</hi> if all <hi>Parishes</hi> where oblidged to Build <hi>Work-Houses,</hi> and Employ their <hi>Poor</hi> therein; as <hi>Dorchester,</hi> and some others have done, with good success.</p>
            <p>I answer, That such attempts have been made in many places to my knowledge, with very good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents and strenuous Endeavours, but all that ever I heard of, proved vain &amp; ineffectual (as I fear will that of <hi>Clarken-well)</hi> except that single Instance of the Town of <hi>Dorchester,</hi> which yet signifies nothing
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59482:10"/>
in relation to the Kingdom in general, besides all other places cannot do the like, nor doth the Town of <hi>Dorchester</hi> entertain any but their own <hi>Poor</hi> only, and <hi>Whip</hi> away all others; whereas that which I design is to propose such a Foundation, as shall be large, wise, honest and rich enough to maintain &amp; employ all <hi>Poor</hi> that come within the Pale of their <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication,</hi> without enquiring where they were Born, or last Inhabited: Which I dare affirm with Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, that nothing but a <hi>National,</hi> or at least such a <hi>Provincial Purse</hi> can so well do, nor any persons in this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> but such only as shall be prickt out by Popular Election for the reason before al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, <hi>viz.</hi> That in my Opinion <hi>three fourths</hi> at least of the <hi>Stock</hi> must issue from the <hi>Charity</hi> of the <hi>People;</hi> as I doubt not but it will to a greater propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if they be satisfied in the <hi>Managers</hi> thereof; but if otherwise, not the fortieth; I might say not the hundreth part.</p>
            <p>I propose the Majority of the said <hi>Fathers of the Poor</hi> to be <hi>Citizens (though I am none my self)</hi> because I think a great share of the Money to be employed, must and will come from them, if ever the Work be well done, as also, because their Habitations are nearest the Center of their Business, and they best acquainted with all affairs of this Nature, by their Experience in the Government of the <hi>Hospitals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Earnestly to desire and endeavour that the <hi>Poor</hi> of <hi>England</hi> should be better provided for and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, is a Work that was much studied by my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased <hi>Father,</hi> and therefore though I be as ready to confess, as any shall be to charge me, with Disability to propose a <hi>Model</hi> of Laws for this great Affair,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:59482:10"/>
yet I hope the more Ingenuous will pardon me for endeavouring to give aim towards it, since it is so much my duty, which in this particular I shall be careful to Perform (though I may be too remiss in others) as shall appear by MORE VISIBLE AND APPARENT DEMONSTRATIONS, if ever this design, or any other (that is like to effect what is desired) succeed.</p>

            <head>This following, Judge HALE writ (with much more to the same purpose) in his Book, Intituled, <hi>A Discourse touching Provision for the Poor.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>WE have very severe Laws against <hi>Theft,</hi> possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly more severe than most other Nations, yea, and than the Offence simply considered deserves; and there is so little to be said in defence of the severity of the Law herein, but the multitude of the Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and the design of the Law rather to terrifie them punish: <hi>ut metus in omnes paena in paucos:</hi> But it is most apparent that the Law is frustrated of its Design therein; for altho more suffer at one Sessions at <hi>Newgate</hi> for Stealing, and Breaking up Houses, and Picking of Pockets, and such other Larcenaries, than suffer in some other Countries for all Offences in three Years, yet the Goals are never the emptier: Necessity and Poverty and want of a due Provision for the Employment of Indigent persons, and the custom of a loose and Idle Life, daily supply with advantage, the number of those who are taken off by the Sentence of the Law: And doubtless, as the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of <hi>Poor</hi> and necessitous, and uneducated Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons increase, the multitude of <hi>Malefactors</hi> will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, notwithstanding the Examples of Severity.</p>
            <p>So that upon the whole account, the Prudence of Prevention, as it is more Christian, so it will be more
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59482:11"/>
effectual that the Prudence of Remedy. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of <hi>Poverty,</hi> Idleness, and a loose and disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly Education, even of <hi>Poor Children,</hi> would do more good in this Kingdom, than all the <hi>Gibbets</hi> Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terisations, and Whipping-Posts and Goals in this Kingdom, and would render these kind of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plines less necessary and less frequent <hi>Pref.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In that State that things are, our Populousness, which should be a blessing to the Kingdom, becomes the Burden of it; by breading up whole Families, and Succesful Generations, in a meer. Trade of Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Thieving, Begging, and a Barbarous kind of Life, which must in time prodigiously increase and overgrow the whole face of the Kingdom, and eat out the heart of it, unless care be taken to prevent it. <hi>p.</hi> 32.</p>
            <p>He Concludes his Book thus, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That it would be a Work of great Humanity (to relieve and imploy the <hi>Poor)</hi> and such as we owe to those of our own Nature as we are men. The wise GOD did tell his ancient People that the <hi>Poor</hi> should be always among them; 1. to exercise their Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality and Charity in supporting the wants of some by the abundance of others And 2. to Exercise their Discretion and Industry to think of and set on foot such means as might put them in a Course of honest Imployment, and encourage them in it. They that are Rich are Stewards of their Wealth, and they that are wise are Stewards of their Wisdom unto the Great MASTER of the Family of Haven and Earth, to whom they must give an account of both, and one (I am sure) of the best accounts they can
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59482:12"/>
give of both is, to imploy them in the <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>formation and Relief of those that want both or either.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A work that as well becomes a Christian as any: Christianity commending Charity as one of the Principial Vertues, and indeed the ill Provision for the <hi>Poor</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> is one of the greatest Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to us in relation to our Christian Profession.</p>
            <p>The want of a due Provision for <hi>Education</hi> and Relief of the <hi>Poor</hi> in the way of Industry, is that which fills the <hi>Goals</hi> with <hi>Malefactors,</hi> and fills the <hi>Kingdom</hi> with <hi>Idle</hi> and unprofitable persons, that consumes the Stock of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> without improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, and that will daily encrease even to a Deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in time. And this Error in the first Concocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is never remediable but by <hi>Gibbits</hi> and <hi>Whipping.</hi> But there must be a Sound Prudent and Resolved Method for an Industrious Education of the <hi>Poor,</hi> and that will give better remedy against these Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions than any Penalties can.</p>
