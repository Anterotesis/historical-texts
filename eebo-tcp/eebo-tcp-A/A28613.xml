            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A PREFACE <hi>In Defence of</hi> TRADE &amp; COMMERCE.</head>
            <p>THere is none that curiously observes, and takes notice of the various, yet neat and orderly Frame of this Terrestrial Globe, but must confess so <hi>vast</hi> a Body was not designed for the use of any <hi>single</hi> person, but even then in its first Original looked forward to <hi>Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> whose provision the Great <hi>Creator</hi> of all things chiefly had care of, when he enriched it with infinite <hi>conveniences,</hi> both for <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity</hi> and <hi>delight,</hi> which the Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring 
<pb facs="tcp:105116:5"/>
of <hi>Adam</hi> doth now enjoy. As therefore the <hi>World</hi> it self was too great a Patrimony for <hi>one</hi> man, had not God been pleased to have given him a large and numerous <hi>issue</hi> to enjoy and improve it: so had those secret and immense Treasures, wherewith it is embellished and enriched, layn still obscure, either in the bowels of the Earth, or in the vast distances and inaccessible parts of forrein Countries, had not <hi>Commerce</hi> and <hi>Traffick,</hi> heightned by the ingenuity and industry of man, unlocked these <hi>hidden</hi> Mines and secret Treasures, and by an easie yet speedy passage brought them to our very doors. By these it is we come to be as it were <hi>Citizens</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> and to have correspondence and intercourse with the remotest Countries. By these then it is the Globe was first inhabited, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind made a Citizen thereof, and
<pb facs="tcp:105116:5"/>
the whole World become a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Mart,</hi> where each Inhabitant thereof, though never so distant, may freely commute the Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of their own into the riches and treasures of another. By these Nations became first civiliz'd by corresponding with Strangers, and learning from each other those forms of Policy and Government, which might become useful and profitable. What had become of the <hi>Western</hi> part, had not <hi>Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> and other ingenuous <hi>Arts</hi> been brought to us, either by Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and faught from them by Noble Spirits of our own.</p>
            <p>And surely <hi>Nature</hi> wisely did forsee the many inconveniences of <hi>Idleness,</hi> how that it would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the World into another <hi>Chaos,</hi> making the Earth but as one dull and useless <hi>mass,</hi> when she hid her Rarities and Treasures in the secret
<pb facs="tcp:105116:6"/>
Bowels thereof, and buried them in the <hi>watry Deep,</hi> and lodged them at so vast and remote a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, that so their <hi>worth</hi> and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue might be a <hi>spur</hi> to Labour and Industry to fetch them thence. Nay God himself is particularly called the <hi>God of the Isles,</hi> as looking on them, by virtue of their skill in <hi>Navigation,</hi> to be the best <hi>factors</hi> for the Common <hi>Good;</hi> and as a blessing upon their Industry, we find most <hi>Isles</hi> and Maritime places exceed all In-land Cities and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries in Riches; and variety of plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But besides his particular fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to <hi>Isles,</hi> he hath created such a dependance of each on the whole, that what one Country is deficient in, another doth supply. Thus we borrow Silks from <hi>Persta,</hi> Drugs from <hi>Egypt,</hi> Furrs from <hi>Russia,</hi> Gold from <hi>Barbary;</hi> and in lieu thereof we furnish them with Cloth, and
<pb facs="tcp:105116:6"/>
Lead, and Tin, and Corn, and other good Commodities which our Country doth afford.</p>
            <p>Nor has <hi>Religion</hi> less honoured <hi>Trade</hi> than <hi>Nature;</hi> for what has been the Propagation of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, but a kind of a <hi>Religious Commerce,</hi> whereby the <hi>Souls</hi> as well as the <hi>Bodies</hi> of Mankind might be supplied with necessaries for a better life: for it cannot be imagin'd that the Doctrine of the Blessed <hi>Jesus</hi> was at one time pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulged and declared through all the Habitable World, but by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, as places were found out, and men were qualified with A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities and Capacities for so great a Work. Hence is it, our <hi>Saviour</hi> made choice of <hi>fishermen,</hi> who were to pass as it were through the <hi>Zodiac,</hi> and disperse his Precepts; their <hi>Calling</hi> and <hi>Trade</hi> rendring them skilful in <hi>Navigation,</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:105116:7"/>
bold in adventuring, and their Blessed <hi>Master</hi> inspiring them with Gifts and Parts to improve it to the inlargement of his Doctrine and Kingdom. For at first, the true Religion was confined to one small Spot, but by little and little the <hi>care</hi> of Heaven, and the indefati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable Industry of <hi>Man,</hi> what was then onely known in <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> became both the Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Glory of the World. So that we that live so remote from the first Declaration thereof, are more than ordinarily endebted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the pains and travail of those pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and religious men, who adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd hither, which could not well have been done, had not <hi>Commerce</hi> first found out our Coafts, and then <hi>Religion</hi> civiliz'd them.</p>
            <p>Besides, <hi>Trade</hi> is the very Life and Soul of the Universe, which, like the <hi>vital</hi> Blood in the
<pb facs="tcp:105116:7"/>
Body, <hi>circulates</hi> to the health and <hi>well-being</hi> of the whole. What were the World but a rude and dull <hi>indigested Lump,</hi> a noisome and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilential Mass, did not <hi>Commerce,</hi> like the Sun, by its Universal Rays exhale all its malignant and noxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Vapours, and by a continual motion and transaction render it wholsome and profitable. What would become of the <hi>busie Soul</hi> of Man, had she not found out <hi>variety</hi> of Imployment for its Exercise? How would each Country become the Sink or common Shore of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery</hi> and Wickedness, did not <hi>Traffick</hi> devest their Inclinations by the use of <hi>Liberal Arts</hi> and Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries? So that it is the <hi>salt</hi> of the Earth, which preserves Mankind from putrefaction and ruine.</p>
            <p>Nor is it onely profitable to the <hi>whole,</hi> but to each <hi>single</hi> Country, and City, and Family. It is the
<pb facs="tcp:105116:8"/>
               <hi>strength</hi> and <hi>glory</hi> of a Kingdom, the <hi>beauty</hi> and splendor of a City, the <hi>sinews</hi> of War, the <hi>support</hi> of Peace, the true <hi>foundation</hi> of Honour and Gentility; the best security of a Fortune when got; and the best way to get it when wanting. I cannot but confess, that in the common re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute of the World, there are several other ways whereby men may arise to Wealth and Honour, as the <hi>Sword</hi> and <hi>Gown;</hi> yet I think, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out injury to the credit of either, I may safely say, that strictly taken those very ways and methods are in effect <hi>Trades</hi> and <hi>Mysteries,</hi> the End of all being Emolument and Profit.</p>
            <p>Nay, the <hi>Universities</hi> themselves are but as it were a <hi>learned Corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and <hi>Society,</hi> each several <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Science</hi> therein not much unlike our several <hi>Companies,</hi> and inferior Schools, which fit <hi>Youth</hi> for those
<pb facs="tcp:105116:8"/>
places, but as <hi>Shops,</hi> wherein young men are initiated <hi>Apprentices,</hi> and afterwards commence <hi>Masters.</hi> There might be much more said in the defence of <hi>Trade</hi> and <hi>Commerce,</hi> but the Book consisting of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars in relation to the <hi>City,</hi> and its <hi>policy,</hi> an Enlargement here would but anticipate the Kind and Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Reader, who will I hope par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the length of this <hi>Preface,</hi> and supply the rest with his own Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor and Ingenuity.</p>

I shall not crave any <hi>Patronage,</hi> or other <hi>Acknowledgment,</hi> nor repeat here how the <hi>Noble People</hi> of <hi>Eldest Rome</hi> accepted the <hi>Book</hi> which <hi>Guecus Flavius</hi> dedicated to their <hi>Name</hi> and Use, <hi>de origine Juris,</hi> in the <hi>Caesarian</hi> Laws; but leave the Issue to those that may receive the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> and <hi>Profit</hi> thereof; with this Caution, First, that it belongs only to such <hi>Masters</hi> or <hi>Citizens</hi> as are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously disposed, and worthily qualified <hi>Men,</hi> who say with <hi>Publius Syrus, Damnum appellandum est cum mala fama lucrum;</hi> and then to such among <hi>Apprentices</hi> as resemble <hi>Poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer</hi>'s chast <hi>Servant,</hi> or St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted <hi>Onesimus, young men</hi> who say with <hi>Statius Caecilius</hi> in his <hi>Plo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, Liberè servimus salva Urbe atque Arce,</hi> meaning by the <hi>City,</hi> and the <hi>Citadel,</hi> the <hi>Body</hi> and the <hi>Head</hi> of Man.

            <p>The principal <hi>Objection</hi> against the Publishing of this, or the like <hi>Discourse</hi> of this <hi>Argument, is,</hi> That the Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the <hi>Youth,</hi> and the Irregular <hi>Frie</hi> of the <hi>City,</hi> may hereby take in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease.

            <p>In a word, the City of <hi>London</hi> (which before <hi>Rome</hi> it self was built) was rocked in a <hi>Trojan</hi> Cradle, by the <hi>Founder</hi> and Father thereof, Heroick <hi>Brute</hi> or <hi>Brytus,</hi> (as the most ancient Monuments, setting aside all late fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, bear witness;) and under <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius Caesar</hi> It was the Metropolis of the <hi>Trynovants;</hi> under other <hi>Caesars</hi> afterwards it was <hi>Augusta,</hi> the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesterial</hi> City, which at this time, for Hugeness, increase of beautious <hi>Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, Concourse, Navigation, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pularity,</hi> and <hi>Trade,</hi> (notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the hand of God's Correction by late <hi>Sickness</hi> and <hi>Fire,)</hi> very hardly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving place to any one City in <hi>Europe,</hi> or at lest doth match and equal them.</p>

               <p n="3">3. The transcendent power of Opinion; To derogate from the Splendor of Birth deputed an Injury; whence comes the present Question of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentiship.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The main reason why some do hold, that <hi>APPRENTISHIP</hi> extinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Gentry; Apprentiship no Bondage either in truth, or at all; the case truly propounded; The skill of honest Gettings a precious Mystery; what

                  <hi>Whether</hi> APPRENTISHIP <hi>extinguisheth</hi> GENTRY? THE FIRST PART.</head>
               <p>THE present Question, <hi>whether Apprentiship ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguisheth Gentry,</hi> being now not so much a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radox, as grown in secret to be of late a common Opinion, I am bold to call it a weighty and important Question, unjustly grounded upon the learned folly of <hi>Erasmus</hi> of <hi>Roter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> and the incircumspection of Sr. <hi>Thomas Smith</hi> Knight, in his Book <hi>de Republica Anglorum,</hi> and out of certain wandring conceits hatcht
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:105116:15"/>
among Trees and Tillage, as shall appear hereafter. Weighty and Important I call it, and it is so; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in looking out upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernings of the Case, I find that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect so specious, that within the compass thereof as well the greater as the lesser Nobility of <hi>England,</hi> are very notably and very inexplicably enwrapped: what do I say of the subalternate Nobility, when the Royal Name it self was deeply in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teressed in the Proposition? For Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> though a free Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, and chief of the <hi>English</hi> in her turn, was a Party to the Cause, which she ingenuously and openly acknowledged, calling Sir <hi>Martin Calthrope</hi> Kinsman, as indeed he was, being at that time Knight, and Lord Mayor of <hi>London:</hi> as also Sir <hi>Godfrey Bullen</hi> Knight, and Lord Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> was lineal Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor to Queen <hi>Anne,</hi> Mother to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:105116:15"/>
Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> no longer before than in the Reign of Henry the sixth King of <hi>England.</hi> Both which Knights being also Gentlemen born, and of right worthy Families, ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by due degrees from the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Apprentices, to the greatest Annual Honour in this Kingdom. It is Weighty and Important, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause without much impropriety of speech it may be called <hi>Quaestio status,</hi> which in the ancient phrase of the Emperor <hi>Justinian,</hi> is as much as to say, <hi>a Tryal,</hi> whether one is to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged bond or free, servile or inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous, and implieth that odious and unnatural sequel, which by Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuists is named <hi>Capitis diminutio;</hi> whereof though the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws make a threefold division, yet in this our question is but only, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the third and lowest degree were incurred, (which happeneth <hi>cum qui sui juris fuerunt, coeperunt ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eno</hi>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:105116:16"/>
                  <hi>juri subjecti.)</hi> It is weighty and important, and can appear none other, because it directly tends to darken, and as it were to intercloud the luminous body of that beautious Planet <hi>Honour,</hi> with foul and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting Spots. For what can lightly be a more disparagement, than for the Free-born to become a kind of Bond-men, or to come of such? nay there is nothing without it, which can be of so great disparagement. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, it is weighty and important, for very many other reasons, and particularly because it is not only fit that states of Opinions should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified in this kind, as breeding bad affections among people of this Nation, (from whence great mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs often arise, even to hatred, quarrels, and homicides;) but that such also as through vanity, or other distempers of the wit or judgment, disdain to seem either City-born or
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:105116:16"/>
bred, or to own any thing of their Worship or Estate, either to the City or Citizens, may understand their own place and true condition, lest they be convinced to be among them, who are unworthy of so ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest either Original or Accession as the City yeildeth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But let us first behold the Cities Honour in Arms, as it stands displayed in Ancient Heraldry, and as it is commented upon out of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick Monuments, in that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable <hi>Survey of London,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised by its Chronologer and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen, <hi>Stowe.</hi> The present figure, with the same words as here they stand, is a copy of that which an old imperfect Legier volumn at the Office of Arms containeth. <q>There needeth no greater demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Cities ancient Honour, and of her peoples free quality than this, that a principal Baron
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:105116:17"/>
of the Realm of <hi>England</hi> was by Tenure her Standard-bearer, being the Lord <hi>Fitz-Water,</hi> from whence the now Lord <hi>Fitz-Water</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended. The figure of St. <hi>Paul</hi> advanced it self in the Standard, and upon the Shield those famous well known Armouries of the Cross and Weapon.</q> The like Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of which Apostle was also embroidered in the Caparisons of that Horse of War, which for the purpose of the Cities Service he received of Gift at the hands of the Lord Mayor. Upon the Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard-bearers Coat Armour, are painted the Hereditary Ensigns of his own Illustrious Family, <hi>viz. Or a Fesse between two Cheverons Gules.</hi> Which kind of Field the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients called <hi>Clauric,</hi> perhaps <hi>à cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritate,</hi> because such Fields as were all of one colour made their Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges more cleerly seen and perspicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:105116:17"/>
And as they gave to that spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Blazon a peculiar Name for the Dignity, so did they also assign to this manner of bearing two Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verons the term <hi>Bialle,</hi> or a Coat <hi>Bialle, à numero binario.</hi> In which brave times had that noble Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man but slightly and far off suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, that he displayed that Banner for a kind of Bondmen, or as for their Service, his great Heroick spirit would rather have troden such an offer under foot. In good Assurance therefore of this common Causes justice, we proceed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Sound Opinion (meaning Doctrine) is the <hi>Anchor of the World;</hi> and Opinion (meaning a worthy conceit of this or that person) is the principal Ingredient which makes words or actions rellish well, and all the Graces without it are little worth. To take the fame from any man that is a Gentleman born, is a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:105116:18"/>
kind of disablement and prejudioe, at least wise among the weak, (who consider no farther than Seemings) that is, among almost all; conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently a wrong, and if a wrong, then due to be redressed. To find the Injury we must first enquire, <hi>Whether Apprentiship extinguisheth Gentry?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The main reason, certainly the most generally used, to prove it doth, is, <hi>That Apprentiship is a kind of Bondage,</hi> and Bondage specially voluntary; (in which case the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Law-rule, <hi>Non officit natali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus in servitute fuisse,</hi> may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps defective,) doth not extinguish Native-Gentry. But I deny that Apprentiship is either <hi>vera servitus,</hi> Or <hi>omnino servitus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For explanation of this <note place="margin">The Case in Question.</note> difficulty, I will set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your eyes the Case as it is. A Gentleman hath a Son, whom he
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:105116:18"/>
means to breed up in an Art of thrift, not rising meerly out of a stock of Wit or Learning, but out of a stock of Money and Credit, managed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that Art; and for this cause he brings his Child at fifteen or sixteen years of age, more or less, to the City of <hi>London,</hi> provides him a Master, and the Youth by his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's counsel willingly becomes an Apprentice, that is, he interchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably seals a written Instrument, that he for his certain years of true and faithful Service, shall learn that precious Mystery of how to gain honestly, and to raise himself. Let the legal and ordinary form of that Instrument (extant in <hi>Wells</hi>'s <hi>Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,</hi> and familiar every where) be duly pondered, and it will appear a meer Civil Contract, of which, as all the world knows, a Bondman uncapable. If you would know un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what kind or <hi>species</hi> of Contract
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:105116:19"/>
that doth fall, I answer, that it seems to be a Contract of Permutation or Interchange: in which mutual Obligation or Convention the act of Binding is no more, but that (as Reason and Justice would) the Master might be (determinately for the time, and sufficiently for the manner) sure to enjoy his Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. Apprentiship being therefore but an Effect of a Civil Contract, occasioned and caused by that prudent respect which the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trahents mutually have to their lawful and honest Commodity; and such only as are free-born, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing capable to make this Contract with effect, <hi>Apprentiship therefore doth not extinguish Gentry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. On the contrary it is urged, that although <hi>Apprentiship be not a true Bondage</hi> to all constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions <note place="margin">Except.</note> and purposes, yet that it is a temporary Bondage, and equal (for
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:105116:19"/>
the time it lasteth) to very Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. Of which Opinion <hi>Erasmus</hi> is, making his Etymology of our Apprentices to be, for that they are like to such as are bought with money, <hi>pares contisiis;</hi> which conceit, as it is more literate than right, so if it were set to sale, would find few Chapmen, but to smile at it. But we absolutely deny that Apprentiship is in any sort a kind of Bondage; for notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that to prove it be so, they make a parallel between the ancient <hi>Roman</hi> Servitude, and the <hi>London</hi> Apprentiship, yet will these <hi>compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rata</hi> be found <hi>disparata,</hi> if not <hi>dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratissima.</hi> For <hi>Servus</hi> among the old Romans was so called of <hi>servan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> of preserving and saving, and not of <hi>serviendo,</hi> of serving, (saith the Law-maker himself, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Justinian)</hi> but the word <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice</hi> cometh of <hi>Apprenti,</hi> the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:105116:20"/>
French word, a raw Soldier, or young Learner, <hi>Tyro, rudis discipulus,</hi> or of the French verb which signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies to <hi>learn,</hi> or of the Latin word <hi>apprehendo,</hi> or <hi>apprendo,</hi> which is properly to <hi>lay hold of,</hi> and transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively to <hi>learn;</hi> which derivations are consonant to the thing, and true, however Sir <hi>Thomas Smith</hi> in his book <hi>de Republica Anglorum,</hi> not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring to distinguish between Servitude and Discipline, Bondage and regular Breeding, injuriously defined them to be a kind of Bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, (meaning meer Slaves,) and not, as in some places of <hi>England,</hi> Bondsmen are taken for such as are in bonds for actionable Causes) and such Bondmen, as differ only thus from very Bondmen, (whose like words for signification are those fou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest ones, <hi>Slaves</hi> and <hi>Villains)</hi> that Apprentices are but for a time, is certain: An oversight of so grave
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:105116:20"/>
and learned person, a privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellor, and in place of Secretary to Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, that which did consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute a Bondman among the old <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> was such a Power and Right vested in the Lord, over the very body of his Bondman or Slave, as descending to him under some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Title, or rather <hi>jure gentium,</hi> was maintained to him <hi>jure civili Romanorum;</hi> by virtue whereof he became Proprietary in the person of his Bondman, as in the body of his Oxe, Horse, or any other Beast he had: which Proprietaryship was indeterminable, but only by <hi>Manumission,</hi> and that act meerly depended upon the will of his Lord, without any Indentment or condition on the behalf of the Slave, which a right <hi>Roman</hi> would never indure from his Bondman.</p>
               <p>Finally, (which in the quality
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:105116:21"/>
of that Servitude was most base) <hi>Servus</hi> among them <hi>nullum caput ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buit,</hi> had no Head in Law, and neither was <hi>in censu</hi> nor <hi>in lustro con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dito,</hi> as much as to say, that they were out of the number of Men, their Names being neither put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong such as had wherewith to pay in the Rolls of their Exchequer, or Tables of their <hi>Capitol,</hi> nor as Bodies wherewith to serve in the general Musters of their Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weal, but in brief were reputed <hi>ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viliter mortui,</hi> dead in Law; Death and Bondage being alike among them; without any more reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of being members in the Body Politick than brute Cattle, for Bondmen were reputed No-body, <hi>Servi pro nullis habiti.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And albeit the Authority of the Common-weal, upon the ground of State, <hi>Interest rei publicae nè quis re suâ malè utatur,</hi> and the Majesty

of Soveraign Princes, meerly as in Honour, and as moved with the commiseration of Humane mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, did sometime interpose it self upon just cause, as when the Lord did attempt to ravish his Bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman, or the Bond-man took Sanctuary at the Emperour's Statue and Image, or at the Altar of some one of their Gods, (an Example whereof is in <hi>Plautus;)</hi> yet the Bond-man after <hi>Manumission</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in such relation to his late Lord, that in certain cases (as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude) he who was once infran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chised, was adjudged back to his Patron, and condemned again to a far more miserable Servitude, than ever before.</p>
               <p>These things considered, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing being like it in the matter of <hi>Apprentiship,</hi> who is there that lives so careless of the honour of the <hi>English</hi> Name, as to bring the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples 
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:105116:22"/>
of honest Arts, and Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of Mysteries, in civil Trade and converse for virtuous causes, all of them being called by the fair Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of <hi>Apprentices,</hi> into the state and quality of Bondmen? <hi>Fair</hi> I called it, because that title is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to them with the <hi>Inns of Court,</hi> where <hi>Apprentices at Law</hi> are not the meanest Gentlemen. <hi>Apprenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> therefore is no voluntary Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, because it is no Bondage at all, but a Title only of Politick or Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Discipline. <hi>Apprentiship there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth not extinguish Gentry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So then Apprentices, whether Gentlemen of Birth, or others, whatsoever their Indentures do im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and howsoever they may seem conditional servants, are in truth not bound to do or to suffer things more grievous, than young Souldiers in Armies, or Scholars in rigorous Schools, or Novices in Noviceships,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:105116:22"/>
each of whom in their kind usually do and suffer things as base and vile in their own qualities, simply and in themselves considered, without respect to the final scope or aim of the first Institution, as perhaps the very meanest of five thousand Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices in <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9, 10">9, 10. The final cause therefore of every Ordination qualifies the course, and the end denominates the means and actions tending to it. For if that be noble, no work is base prescribed <hi>in ordine,</hi> or as in the way to that end; though, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracting from that consideration, the work wrought, in the proper nature of it, be servile, as for a Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier to dig, or carry Earth to a Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, or for a Student to go bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed to a Fellow of the House within the Colledge, as far off as he can see him, omitting the more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed necessity of suffering private
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:105116:23"/>
or publick discipline; or for a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in a Noviceship to wash Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes, or the like seeming base works, as is usual; If then the general scope, or final reason of Apprenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship be honest, and worthy of a Gentleman, (as will appear hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that it is,) what can be clearer, than <hi>that Apprentiship doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish Gentry?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I am the more fervent in this case, because this one false Conceit (at all times hurtful, but chiefly in these latter times, in which the means of easle maintenance are infinitely straitned,) that for a Gentleman-born, or one that would aspire to be a Gentleman, for him to be an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice to a Citizen, or <hi>Burgensis,</hi> is a thing unbeseeming him, hath filled our <hi>England</hi> with more vices, and sacrificed more serviceable bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to odious ends, and more souls to sinful life, than perhaps any other
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:105116:23"/>
uncivil Opinion whatsoever. For they who hold it better to rob by Sea or Land, than to beg or labour, do daily see, and feel, that out of Apprentices rise such as sit upon them, standing out and pleading for their lives as Malefactors, when they (a shame and sorrow to their Kindred) undergo a fortune too un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, even of the basest of honest Bond-men.</p>

                  <hi>Whether</hi> APPRENTISHIP <hi>extinguisheth</hi> GENTRY?THE SECOND PART. </head>
               <p n="1">1. THese things considered, how should it fall into the mind of any good or wise Discourser, <hi>that Apprentices are a kind of Bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> and consequently, <hi>that Apprentiship extinguisheth Native Gentry, and disinableth to Acquisitive?</hi> For if that Opinion be not guilty of impiety to our Mother-Countrey, where that laudable policie of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentiship, necessary for our Nation, is exercised as a point of severe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline, warrantable in Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; 
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:105116:25"/>
certainly it hath in it a great deal of injurious temerity, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerance, and why not impiety also, if they wilfully wrong the wisdom of <hi>England,</hi> their natural common Parent, whose Children are free-born? Surely, notorious inconsiderance is apparent, because there are but two main Pillars of Common-wealths, PRAEMIUM &amp; POENA, <hi>Reward,</hi> and <hi>Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> and of the first Rewards, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is the highest, according to that most eloquent <hi>Tully</hi> in his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished Works, <hi>de republica,</hi> (as S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustin</hi> stileth them,) as that thing with which he would <hi>his Prince should be fed, and nourished;</hi> and in his Philosophy hath uttered that famous sentence concerning the same, <hi>Honos alit artes, omnesque ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenduntur ad studia gloriae.</hi> Among us therefore Coats of Arms, and Titles of Gentlemen (which point
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:105116:26"/>
the Knight aforesaid, howsoever erring in Apprentices estate, hath truly noted to be commodious for the Prince) being the most familiar part of <hi>Honour.</hi> But they rip up and overturn the principal of those two Pillars of Common-weal from the very Basis: a strange oversight, specially of Professors of skill in the Art of publick Government; unless perhaps they speak it, because they would have things reformed, or changed in this particular of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentiship. But we do not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that either Sir <hi>Thomas Eliot</hi> in his <hi>Governour,</hi> or Sir <hi>Thomas Chaloner</hi> (Leigier Embassadour for Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> in <hi>Spain)</hi> in his Books of Latin Hexameters <hi>de rep. Anglorum instaurandâ,</hi> (published with the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of the Lord Treasurer <hi>Burghleys</hi> before it,) or any other Author, rightly understanding our <hi>England,</hi> and her generous People, did ever
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:105116:26"/>
once tax our Countries Policy in this point. Yea some make it a <hi>Quaere,</hi> whether the Cities disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline had not more need to be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced nearer to the ancient severity thereof, considering with what vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <hi>London</hi> flows, and overflows, than that it should be altered, or removed, though but a little, from it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now then, let any one but rightly weigh with what consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence or common sense, the first In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutors or Propagators of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> form of Government, could lay upon <hi>Industry</hi> and civil <hi>Virtue</hi> (whose subject are the lawful things of this life, and whose nearest ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is Honour, and honest Wealth) so foul a note as the brand of <hi>Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,</hi> or any the least disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at all? Whereas to quicken and inflame affections in that kind, all wise Masters in the most noble
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:105116:27"/>
civil Art of Government, and all Founders of Empires, and States, have bent their counsels and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to cherish such as are virtuously industrious, yea, God himself (the only best Pattern of Governors) hath made it known, that even Mechanical Qualities are his speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Gifts, and his infused, as it were, <hi>charismata.</hi>
               </p>

For <hi>Moses,</hi> having put into eternal Monuments, that <hi>Jabal</hi> was <hi>pater pastorum,</hi> (the most ancient Art of increase,) and that <hi>Jabal</hi> was <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter canentium,</hi> (the first of which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions was for necessary provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of food and rayment, and the second to glorifie <hi>God</hi> and Honesty, to solace men towards sweetning the bitter Curse which <hi>Adam</hi> drew upon humane life,) it is, thirdly, underadded in the accomplishment of the three main Heads, to which mortals use to refer all their world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly 
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:105116:27"/>
endeavours (Necessity, Profit, and Pleasure,) that <hi>Tubal-Cain</hi> was <hi>malleator,</hi> and <hi>faber ferrarius,</hi> an Hammer-smith, or worker in Iron, that being one of those arch Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, <hi>sine quibus non aedificatur civitas,</hi> as the words are in <hi>Ecclesidsticus.</hi> Nay, there belonged in <hi>God</hi>'s own judgment so great praise to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular excellency of some Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, as that in building of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Temple, they are register'd to all Posterities in Scripture, and their skill is not onely made immortally famous, but a more curious mention is put down of their Parentage and Birth-place, than of many great Princes, as in <hi>Hiram</hi>'s case, not the King, but the Brass-founder. And in the New Testament, S. <hi>Paul</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Gentleman born, of a noble Family, as the Ancients write, and a Lawyer bred up at the feet of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maliel)</hi> learned, as an addition to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:105116:28"/>
that perfection, for the relieving of his necessities, the manual Art of <hi>Scaenopaea,</hi> commonly Englished, <hi>Tent-making:</hi> upon which place of S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Trade (whereof in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles he doth often glory) it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to us out of the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> that S. <hi>Paul</hi> (who himself tells King <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippa,</hi> that he had lived a <hi>Pharisee,</hi> according to the most certain way of <hi>Jewism)</hi> was brought up so, by a Traditional precept, which did bind such as would study Sacred letters, to learn some one or other Mystery in the <hi>Mechanicks.</hi> And at this present, among other things which the <hi>Turks</hi> retain of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Rites, this seems one, when even the <hi>Sultan</hi> himself, or <hi>grand Seignior</hi> (as all his Progenitors) is said to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise a manual Trade, little or much, commonly once a day. And in fresh memory <hi>Rodulphus,</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of <hi>Germany,,</hi> had singular
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:105116:28"/>
skill in making <hi>Dials, Watches,</hi> and the like fine works of Smith-craft, as had also a late Baron of <hi>England,</hi> which they practised; and other persons also, of Royal progeny, are at this day excellent in several Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If then such honour be done by God himself (as aforesaid,) not onely to those that are necessary Handy-crafts, but to those also which are but the Handmaids of Magnificence, and outward Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, as Engravers, Founders, and the like; he shall be very hardy, who shall imbase honest Industry with disgraceful censures; and too unjust, who shall not cherish or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage it with praise and worship, as the ancient Policy of <hi>England</hi> did, and doth, in constituting Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations, and adorning Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies with Banners of Arms, and some special men with notes of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness.</p>
               <p n="5">

5. And, as of all commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Arts all worthy Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weals have their use, so in <hi>London</hi> they have as it were their Palace. But into the body of the City none generally are incorporated, but such only as through the straight gates of Apprentiship aspire to the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and state of Citizens. That the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Bondmen were not, in <hi>Moses</hi>'s Law, among themselves, like to our Apprentices (howsoever the seventh year agrees in time with the ordinary time of our Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices Obligations) is evident, both in the Books of <hi>Exodus</hi> and <hi>Deute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronomy.</hi> For, first, their title to their Bondmen grew to their Lords by a Contract of Bargain and Sale, which was indeed a kind of <hi>Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</hi> For, when the <hi>seventh</hi> year, in which the Bondage was to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, and expire, if then he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved not to continue a Bondman
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:105116:29"/>
for ever, he was compelled to leave his wife (if married in his Lord's house during bondage) together with his children, born in that mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, behind him, though himself departed free, but withall rewarded also. So that voluntary Bondage is not only <hi>de jure gentium,</hi> (as the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws import, by which a man might sell himself, <hi>ad partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pandum pretium,)</hi> but also <hi>de jure di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vino positivo.</hi> By which, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing it doth not appear, that such a Bondage was any disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or dis-enoblement in <hi>Jewish</hi> blood, among the <hi>Jews,</hi> because in <hi>Exodus</hi> we read of a provision made for the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Bondwoman, whom her Lord might take in marriage to himself, or bestow her upon his Son, if he so thought good, but might not to violate her Chastity, as if he had <hi>jus in corpus.</hi> But the Condition of an Apprentice of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:105116:30"/>
resembleth the Condition of no person's Estate in either of the Laws, <hi>Divine,</hi> or <hi>Imperial;</hi> for he directly contracteth with his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster to learn his Mystery, or Art of honest living, neither hath his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster (who therefore is but a Master, not a Lord) <hi>Despoticum Imperium</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his Apprentice, (that is, such a power as a Lord hath over a Slave) but <hi>quasi curaturam,</hi> or a Guardian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and is in very truth a meer <hi>Discipliner,</hi> or <hi>Teacher,</hi> with autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of using moderate Correction as a <hi>Father,</hi> not as a <hi>Tyrant,</hi> or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise. Immoderate Correction who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever doth use, is (by a Gracious Statute of the fifth of Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth)</hi> subject to be punished with the loss of the <hi>Apprentice,</hi> by abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely taking him away.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Which things so often as I deeply ponder, I cannot but hold it as loose, and as wandring a conceit,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:105116:30"/>
and as uncivil a Proposition in civil matters, as any: <hi>that Apprentiship should be imagin'd either to extinguish, or to extenuate the Right of Native Gentry, or to disable any worthy or fit person to acquisitive Armories;</hi> for how can it in God's name work that effect, unless it be criminal to be an <hi>Apprentice?</hi> Because no man loseth his right to bear <hi>Arms,</hi> or to write <hi>Gentleman,</hi> unless he be attainted in Law, for such a cause, the Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction whereof doth immediately procure corruption in Blood, which as in this case no man yet hath drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of.</p>
               <p>Again, when by the old Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law of <hi>England,</hi> there are but onely two sorts of Bondmen, <hi>Villains</hi> in <hi>gross,</hi> and <hi>Villains regardant</hi> to a Mannour; and it is most certain, that our <hi>Apprentice</hi> or Scholar in City Mysteries, is neither one nor other of them: what ignorance then,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:105116:31"/>
or offence was Mother at first, of this, not Paradox, but palpable Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity, that <hi>Apprentiship extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth Gentry,</hi> or that <hi>Apprentices</hi> are a kind of Bondmen? when as the greatest and most famous Cities of <hi>Germany,</hi> which were or have been composed of Apprentices, or such as from them have become Masters, as <hi>Norimbergh, Lubeck, Magden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg, &amp;c.</hi> are as Imperial and free Cities, not thought unworthy to be matriculated into the Empire, or to have places in their <hi>Dyets,</hi> as some of the Estates thereof.</p>

               <p n="2">2. Such an <hi>Apprentice</hi> therefore, when first he comes to his Master, is commonly but of those years, which are every where subject to Correction. His ordinary Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces these: he goes bare-headed, stands bare-headed, waits bare-headed before his Master and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress, and while as yet he is the youngest <hi>Apprentice,</hi> he doth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps (for Discipline sake) wipe over night his Master's shooes for the morning, brusheth a Garment, runs of Errands, keeps silence 'till he have leave to speak, followeth his

Master, or ushereth his Mistress, and sometime their young Daughters, (among whom, some one or other of them doth not rarely prove the <hi>Apprentice</hi>'s Wife) walks not far out but with his permission, and now and then (as Offences happen) he may chance to be terribly chid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, or menaced, or (which must sometime be) deservedly corrected; though all this onely <hi>in ordine,</hi> and in the way to Mastership, or to the estate of a Citizen, which last worst state of this <hi>Apprentice</hi>'s Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on continues peradventure for a Year, or two, and while he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly but at the age of a Boy, or at the most but of a Lad, or Strip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; and, take things at the very worst, he doth nothing as an <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice</hi> under his Master, which, when himself comes to be a Master, his <hi>Apprentices</hi> shall not do or suffer under him. Such, or the like, is
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:105116:34"/>
the bitterest part of an <hi>Apprentice</hi>'s happy estate in this world, being honestly provided at his Master's charge of all things necessary, and decent. The <hi>Master</hi> in the mean while serving his <hi>Apprentice</hi>'s turn with Instruction, and universal Conformation, or Moulding of him to his Art, as the <hi>Apprentice</hi> serves his Master's turn with Obedience, Faith, and Industry.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Here have we a Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an Apprentice's <hi>being,</hi> or rather the <hi>well-being</hi> of a Child un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Father, who hath right of Correction. Upon view whereof we demand, why it should be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed that <hi>Apprentiship extinguisheth Gentry?</hi> For if an Apprentice in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> (since to have Apprentices is a power, not derived to Corporations out of Prerogative, Royal Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but out of Common Law) be in their conceits a kind of Bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, 
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:105116:34"/>
it must either be <hi>ratione gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris obsequii,</hi> or <hi>ratione temporis adje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cti,</hi> or <hi>contractûs,</hi> or <hi>conditionis,</hi> or for all together; a fifth Cause being hard to be either assigned or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined.</p>
               <p>For the first point, <hi>ratione gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> (which is in regard of the <hi>Kind of Service,)</hi> that is but an effect of the Contract, or Bargain, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently depends thereon, or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipates in nature with it; which not importing any kind of Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, neither can the Service it self, due by that Agreement, be the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of a Bondman: so that as on the one side we grant, that <hi>Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices,</hi> as <hi>Apprentices,</hi> do some things, which <hi>Gentlemen</hi> would not do, that lived <hi>sui juris,</hi> specially upon a necessity to obey; yet on the other side we constantly deny, that they do any of them, either as servile, or as servilely but <hi>propter finem nobilem,</hi>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:105116:35"/>
that is, to learn an honest Mystery, to enable them for the Service of God and their Country, in the sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, place, or calling of a Citizen.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>second, ratione adjuncti</hi> (which is in respect of a <hi>certain time,</hi> as of <hi>seven</hi> years at least, added and limited in the Contract) that is meerly but a Circumstance of the Question. For if <hi>Apprentices</hi> are not a kind of Bondmen, abstracting from the time which they are bound to serve, the addition of Time ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth nothing to the quality of the Contract, to make it servile.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>third,</hi> the <hi>Contract</hi> (which is in regard of the Contract as it rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth a relation, or the titles between two, of Master, and Servant,) if the very Art of binding to performance be a sufficient reason to make <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices</hi> a kind of Bondmen, and so to disenable them to <hi>Gentry,</hi> either <hi>derivative,</hi> or <hi>acquisitive;</hi> the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters 
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:105116:35"/>
themselves are also a kind of Bondmen, because <hi>suo genere</hi> they as well were, and are bound as the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices one to the other.</p>
               <p>For the fourth, <hi>conditionis,</hi> (which is in respect of the Conditions, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther literally or vocally expressed, or virtually implied in the Contract) there is in it no proof of Bondage, but the contrary; for in that the Obligation is mutual, it proves the Apprentice free as from Bondage, though (for the Apprentice's own good) not free from Subjection to his Master, or Discipline, because only Freemen can make Contracts, and challenge the benefit of them. The Verb is not, <hi>servire,</hi> but the Verb, <hi>deservire,</hi> (which is of far less weight) comprised in the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or Indenture, and containing the whole force of the Obligation, hath only in that place the sense of <hi>obsequi</hi> &amp; <hi>facere,</hi> to obey and do, as
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:105116:36"/>
an Apprentice, and not according to the ancient sense which it had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Romans.</hi> This ought not to seem a Paradox; for the word <hi>Dominus,</hi> to which <hi>Service</hi> is a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and the word <hi>Servus</hi> have, in tract of time been so softned, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarized, as they are grown to be words of singular humanity. And what so common among the Noble, as to profess to serve one another? But the relation constituted in this Case is peculiar, and proper. The word <hi>Dominus</hi> is not there at all, nor <hi>Servus,</hi> no nor <hi>famulus;</hi> the relation constituted is directly named <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Master and Apprentice,</hi> a clear case that all Injuries to Blood and Nature are of purpose avoided in the Interchangeable sealed Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it self: so clear a case, that in the Oath which all Freemen make in the Chamber of <hi>London</hi> at their first Admission, this Clause, among
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:105116:36"/>
many others, is sworn unto by them, <hi>That they shall take none Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices, unless they are free born,</hi> that is to say, <hi>no Bondman's son,</hi> which are the very words of the Oath. And by an Act of Parliament, made in the fifth year of the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> it is expresly provided, That no Merchant, Mercer, Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, Goldsmith, Ironmonger, or Clothier, shall take any Apprentice, except it be his Son, whose Father or Mother shall at the time of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king such Apprentice, have in Lands, Tenements, and Heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Inheritance of the cleer yearly value of Forty Shillings, the Children of Labourers, and of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons not being Freemen or occupy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Husbandry. Thus carefully o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen was the Eye of Institution in this Noble point of the Cities Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, to prevent, that no stain, no blemish, nor indignity, should
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:105116:37"/>
wrong the Splendor thereof; a thing which could not but follow inevitably, if when it was provided that no Bondmen's Issue into the estate of Apprentiship, should them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, by making Apprentices, make Bondmen; or should in any sort embase their Blood, whose Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters they were to be, as to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of coming to be Citizens in time. They never meant to make any man Bond, who would have none but the Sons of <hi>free-born</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons bound Apprentices: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it shall be wilful ignorance or malice from henceforth to maintain the contrary.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A most memorable example in Scripture, to the purpose of the present Question, is that of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Laban, Genesis</hi> 29. where the time <hi>(seven years,)</hi> yea and the very word <hi>(servire)</hi> are plain in that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, which was made between the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:105116:37"/>
Uncle and the Nephew: yet who did ever say, that <hi>Jacob</hi> was for this a kind of Bondman? The reason why he was not, ariseth from consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the final Cause, or inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Contract, which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded to have been worthy and unblameable; the obtaining of a virtuous Wife, and of an Estate to maintain her with. Neither, when he was no longer defrauded of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel</hi> than seven days after his first <hi>seven years,</hi> and when for the fruiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Rachel</hi> he served also other <hi>seven years,</hi> was he a Bondman; by, as it were a relapse or cessation of expecting his reward, which he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed in enjoying her? Out of which it follows, that as <hi>Jacob</hi> was no kind of Bondman, though he <hi>served,</hi> and <hi>served</hi> out all his time twice over, so neither are Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices. And from this place of Holy Writ it is unanswerably proved,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:105116:38"/>
that <hi>bodily service</hi> is a laudable means to atchieve any good or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable purpose, a means truly worthy of a Gentleman.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Hereunto we finally adde, and repeat, that as an Apprentice ties himself to his Master in the word <hi>deservire,</hi> that is, to obey and do restrictively to the ancient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and traditional Discipline of Apprentiship in <hi>London;</hi> so the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster ties himself to his Apprentice in the word <hi>docere,</hi> in lieu of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest service, to teach him his Art to the utmost. Which Master's part is grown to such estimation, as that Apprentices now come commonly like Wives, with treble more porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons than formerly to their Masters. If then Apprentiship be a kind of <hi>servitude,</hi> it is either a pleasing Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, or a strange madness to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase it with so much money.</p>
               <p>For proof of this Assertion, let me
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:105116:38"/>
give a late Example. A Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of quality gave <hi>300l</hi> with his younger Son, an Apprentice to a Merchant, and having continued together for three years, and the Servant not as yet imployed in the particular mystery of Merchandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, himself complain'd to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of loss of time, and both of them referred their Case to another Merchant for rendition of such part of the <hi>300l</hi> as might turn him over to a better Master. The Referrer rebuking the Master, urged this as a truth and ancient custom, defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Contract as we have inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, and adding withall, that the Father had right in Law and Custom to be repaid all his <hi>300l,</hi> and good dammage to his Son for the loss of so much precious time, without profit of the Art and My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery contracted to be taught him, to the dishonour of the City, and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:105116:39"/>
the very intention of the Contract, and custom of <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. An Apprentice therefore, as an Apprentice, being neither <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione obsequii, temporis, contractus,</hi> nor <hi>conditionis,</hi> in any kind or any respect a Bondman: and hath there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no more lost his title and right to Gentry, than he hath done to any Goods, Chattels, Lands, Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alties, or any thing else, which, if he never had been an Apprentice, either had, might, or ought to have come to him. Nay, much less can Gentry be lost in this case, than right to Lands and Goods, how much more inherent the rights of Blood are than the rights of Fortune; for, according to the Law-rule, <hi>jur a san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinum nullo jure civili dirimi possunt,</hi> unless in cases of Felony or Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, whereas those other may be dissolved. And that <hi>Gentry</hi> is a right of Blood, may appear by this,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:105116:39"/>
that no man can truly alienate the same, or vest another in it, though legally he may in case of <hi>Adoption,</hi> which is but an humane invention of Nature, and therefore, <hi>in reive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritate</hi> no Alienation at all, but a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or an acception in Law, as if it were such. So that none can any more pass away his Gentry, to make another a Gentleman thereby, who was not a Gentleman before, than he can pass away any Habit, or Quality of the Mind, as Virtue, or Learning, to make another honest or learned, who was unlearned or dishonest before; for Gentry is a quality of Blood or Name, as Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Learning are of the Mind. Upon which reason that rule of Law is grounded, which teacheth us, that <hi>annulus signatorius ornamenti appellatione'non continetur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. To all this if it be replied, that Apprentiship is a kind of Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage; 
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:105116:40"/>
for that, if an Apprentice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon his Master's service, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster may both fetch him back again, as Lord for the time over his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant's Body, and compell him also to live under obedience. We an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer thus: That such a power over the body of the Apprentice is not sufficient to constitute a Bondman, though the Service of the Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice belongs to the Master, God's part in him and the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths being first deducted. <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi> held, that only the <hi>Grecians</hi> were free, and all other barbarous, that is to say, all not being <hi>Grecians</hi> were Bond. Some among us seem <hi>Aristotelians</hi> in this point, who as he gloriously overvalued his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen, so these overvalue their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragon Gentry, and repute none worthy of <hi>Arms,</hi> and <hi>Honour,</hi> but themselves; we supposing on their behalf, that they are indeed not vain
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:105116:40"/>
Pretenders, but true dependents from the most unquestionable No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Races, howsoever troubled per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps with some little of the spirit of vanity, and of too too much scorn of others. But as the <hi>Italians,</hi> and their Nobility, in our time, (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding they think meanly of all who are not <hi>Italians,</hi> calling them (in <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s humour) <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montanes,</hi> and in that word imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to be <hi>Barbarous)</hi> do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit an error as well as the great Philosopher, whilst they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves do take it to be no disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to <hi>merchandize;</hi> nor the haughty <hi>German</hi> Nobility, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they do believe it to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable to marry with the Daughter of a <hi>Burgher,</hi> or Citizen, do not refuse gain of Commerce or Merchandise: so these Gentlemen (how eminently Noble soever) will be likewise found to live in error,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:105116:41"/>
for that others may be truly <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> for any thing that as yet is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the former <hi>Sophism,</hi> viz. <hi>that the Master hath power over his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice's body,</hi> Ergo <hi>Apprentices are a kind of Bondmen;</hi> because if such a power be enough to constitute a Bondman, we will say nothing of those Free-born persons being in Minority, whose bodies their <hi>Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> in Lands holden by <hi>Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>service,</hi> might (not long ago) not only by a right in Law fetch back, after escape or flight, but give away also in Marriage; nay, if for that reason, Apprentices, born Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, shall be thought to have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited their Gentry, in what estate are all the Sons and Children of all good houses in <hi>England?</hi> whose bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies in their Minority their Parents, by a right of Nature, may fetch back after flight, and exercise their pleasure or displeasure upon them,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:105116:41"/>
even to disinhereson of Lands not entailed. Scholars under their Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, or Schoolmasters, are not Bondmen. Nay, in what case are Soldiers, (to whom most properly, and most immediately the Honour of <hi>Arms</hi> doth belong) who for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing themselves from their Banner, or Captain without leave, may not only be forced back to serve, but (according to the usual Discipline of War) may, by <hi>Martial</hi> Law, be hanged up, or shot at the next Tree, or wheresoever depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at once of life and reputation together? so absurd it is to dispute, that the power of a Master, by the title of a Contract over the body of an Apprentice, in case of Discipline, doth convince a Servility of condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Sufferer. For if the right to exercise corporal Correction should absolutely constitute a state of <hi>Bondage</hi> in the Subject, the injury
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:105116:42"/>
of that untrue assertion would reach to persons of far higher mark than <hi>City-prentises,</hi> as is most plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prov'd. And therefore they must alledged somewhat else besides <hi>subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> of Body, to draw the estate of Apprentiship into that degree of reproach; which as they cannot do, we having prevented those Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, so must they leave it clear from taint or scandal.</p>
               <p n="8">8. We lay it down therefore, out of all the antecedences, for a clear Conclusion; <hi>That Apprenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are so far from being a kind of Bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as that in our Common-weal they then first begin</hi> habere caput, <hi>and to be</hi> aliqui: <hi>to be of account, and some body.</hi> For Apprentiship in <hi>London,</hi> is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree or order of good regular Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and out of whose (as it were) Nurseries, or Colledges, Citizens are supplied. We call them <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,</hi> according to the old <hi>Roman</hi>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:105116:42"/>
Law-phrase, or Fellowships of men, for so indeed they are comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded within several Corporations, or Bodies of <hi>free</hi> persons, intended to be consociated for Commerce, according to Conscience and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice; and named <hi>Companies,</hi> each of them severally bearing the Titles of their several worthy Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies or Corporations, as <hi>Drapers, Salters, Cloth-workers,</hi> and so forth. And we say as before, that Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices, in the reputation of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weal, when first they came to be Apprentices, then first begin to be <hi>somebody,</hi> and that Apprentiship is a degree, to which out of Youth and young men, who have no vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in the World, they are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced; and that out of Apprenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, by other ascents or steps, as <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nari civitate,</hi> to come to be free of LONDON, or <hi>Citizens,</hi> from thence to be of their Companies Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, 
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:105116:43"/>
the Governors of Companies, as <hi>Wardens</hi> and <hi>Masters,</hi> and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors in the City, as <hi>Common-Council<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Aldermens Deputies, Sheriffs,</hi> and <hi>Aldermen;</hi> and lastly the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Governor, or Head of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the <hi>Lord Mayor;</hi> yea sometimes also Counsellors of State to the <hi>Prince</hi> (whereof <hi>Stow</hi> hath Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples) are very orderly elected, and the whole Policy disposed after as excellent a form, as most at this day under Heaven.</p>
               <p n="9">9. True it is, that <hi>Apprentiship,</hi> as it is a Degree, so is it the lowest Degree, or <hi>Class</hi> of Men in <hi>London: lowest</hi> we say, that it may come to the highest, according to that of S. <hi>Augustin,</hi> and of common sense, That those Buildings rise highest, and stand fastest, whose Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are deepest. And as <hi>Apprenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> is the first in order, and meanest in dignity, so can that be no title
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:105116:43"/>
to embase the vocation, because there must be a <hi>first</hi> in all things.</p>
               <p>Of this degree, anciently the flat round Cap, Hair close-cut, narrow falling Band, course side-Coat, close Hose, Cloth-stockings, and the rest of that severe Habit, was in Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity not more for Thrift, and Use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, than for Distinction and Grace, and were original Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or tokens of Vocation, or Calling; which point of ancient Discipline the <hi>Catoes</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> grave common Lawyers, to their high commendation therein, retain in their Profession, and Professors at this present, even to the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coloured Coats of <hi>Serjeants at Law,</hi> during the first year after they are made, or called; an object far more ridiculous among the new Mode of our time (enemies of rigor and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline) than that of <hi>Apprentices.</hi> At which retained signs, and distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive 
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:105116:44"/>
notes, as among Lawyers, though younglings, and frivolous Novices, may somewhat wonder, 'till the cause be understood, yet is the thing it self so far in it self from deserving contempt, as that they who should offer it, would them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves be counted ignorant. For Sir <hi>Edward Coke,</hi> in the Preface of his third Book of <hi>Reports,</hi> hath affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, for the dignity of the word <hi>Apprentice,</hi> that a <hi>double Reader,</hi> whose degree is next to that of a <hi>Serjeant at Law,</hi> who is only infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to a <hi>Judge,</hi> and to no other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of <hi>Lawyers,</hi> is but an <hi>Apprentice</hi> at <hi>Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. Here now let me be bold to say, that <hi>Apprentices</hi> of late seem to have drunk and sacrificed too deeply to their new Goddess Saint <hi>Fashion,</hi> a <hi>French Idol,</hi> which was always no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted fatal to the <hi>English;</hi> as at the Periods, or universal concussions of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:105116:44"/>
                  <hi>Empire</hi> in our portion of <hi>Great Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> may in old Writers be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. This they do not without wrong, in our opinions, to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty of their degree, at least wise in so far abandoning their proper Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament, the <hi>Cap,</hi> (anciently a note of Liberty among the <hi>Romans)</hi> as not to have, one day at least in the year, wherein to celebrate the Feast of their <hi>Apprentiship</hi> in the peculiar Garb thereof; which they should do well and wisely to frequent, for the suppression and beating down of that ungrounded Contumely and scorn, by making profession in this wise, that they <hi>glory</hi> in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs of their honest Calling.</p>
               <p n="11">11. For revocation of which into use, though we see no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of hope, yet are those late Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates of the <hi>City,</hi> who laboured to reduce <hi>Apprentiship</hi> to practice this laudable point of outward <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity,</hi>

not the less to be commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. And it were to be wished, perhaps, that instead of scattering Libels, and of discovering Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to Tumult, <hi>Apprentices</hi> had rather submitted their Understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings and resigned their wills in this particular to their loving Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors, making humble and wise O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience the glory of their Persons, much rather than <hi>Apparrel</hi> in the <hi>fashion.</hi> For they who are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed of their <hi>Professions,</hi> ought not to be ashamed of the <hi>Ensigns</hi> and Tokens of their Profession, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. They indeed are out of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion, who are not in the fashion which is proper to their quality; the flat <hi>round Cap,</hi> in it self consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as a Geometrical figure, is far more worthy than the <hi>square,</hi> according to that ground in the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks, Figurarum sphaerica est op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tima,</hi> and in <hi>Hieroglyphicks</hi> is a Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bol

of Eternity, and Perfection, and a resemblance of the World's <hi>rotun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity:</hi> but I will make no <hi>Encomium</hi> for <hi>Caps.</hi> This I say, that as the <hi>square Cap</hi> is retained, not onely in the <hi>Universities,</hi> and <hi>Chancery,</hi> but also abroad among us, as well by <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> persons in high places, as by <hi>Judges</hi> of the Land when they sit in Court; so the <hi>round Cap</hi> being but a note in <hi>London</hi> of <hi>Apprentices,</hi> and <hi>Citizens</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> as it is of <hi>Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, Barresters, Benchers,</hi> and <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> in the <hi>Inns of Courts,</hi> and chief Officers in the <hi>Court-royal,</hi> so the wearing thereof by <hi>Londoners</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a Reproach, but an Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

some busy Censurer may think it to be a vanity to <hi>hope</hi> to stop the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral stream of predominant Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom by private <hi>wishes.

               <p n="12">12. Well may they in the mean time blush at their temerity, who by teaching that <hi>Apprentices</hi> are called <hi>Apprentices,</hi> as if they were <hi>pares emptisii,</hi> do dishonour and highly wrong the excellent old Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy of this Land: for they (as much as lyeth in the credit of their words) most dangerously discourage flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing Industry, who cast such an aspersion upon any Civil Profession, and Order of men, (assembled to uphold a <hi>Kingdom</hi> by Commerce,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:105116:46"/>
according to the rules of Law and Justice,) as the least conceit of so hateful a Note as Bondage.

This therefore is my meaning; that some <hi>Citizen</hi> may be a <hi>Citizen,</hi> and yet truly a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> as one and the same man may in several re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects be both a <hi>Lord,</hi> and <hi>Tenant; Citizen</hi> in regard of his Corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in <hi>London, Gentleman</hi> in regard of his Birth, or of <hi>Armories</hi> assigned for encouragement of <hi>Industry,</hi> to <hi>ennoble</hi> his honest <hi>Riches</hi> and <hi>Titles</hi> of <hi>Honour</hi> or <hi>Worship</hi> in that <hi>City</hi> whereof he is a qualified Member.

without any relation to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> which notwithstanding raised them; Hence it follows, that as an <hi>Apprentice</hi> being a <hi>Gentleman</hi> born, remaineth a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> with edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Splendor and Title, as God blesseth his labours, so a worthy <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen</hi> is capable of the <hi>Honour</hi> of <hi>Arms,</hi> notwithstanding his former <hi>Apprentiship.</hi> And by this distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made between a <hi>Citizen</hi> meerly as a <hi>Citizen,</hi> and of a <hi>Citizen</hi> as he may also be a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> that Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction (which some bring out of a Statute, enacted under one of our Kings, which forbiddeth the dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement offered by the Guardian to marry the <hi>ward</hi> (born Gentile) to a <hi>Burgensis)</hi> may easily be salved, and answered: for in that Statute, the word <hi>Burgensis</hi> is spoken in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and more narrow sense thereof, which is of one who is simply <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gensis,</hi> without any consideration of

him as he may otherwise be a <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, Esquire,</hi> or <hi>Knight,</hi> which in some cases happens.

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:105116:53"/>
of <hi>Apprentiship,</hi> and such the condition of <hi>Citizens</hi> estates, as to the purposes of Honour and Arms; let Fathers, who are Gentlemen, put their Children, who are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining to Arms or Letters, to <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentiships,</hi> to the Discipline and Art of honest Gain, giving them a Title of <hi>being</hi> somewhat in our Countrey; for it is a Vocation, if not misused, simply honest, and may prove a stay to Posterity, and give Credit to their Names, when licentious and corrupted <hi>Eldest sons</hi> have sold their <hi>Birth-rights</hi> away; for albeit many Citizens thrive not, yet those <hi>Fathers,</hi> and such who are in place of <hi>Fathers,</hi> provide more probably, who put their Children or Orphans into a certain Method of Life, than others who leave them at large.

Ten to One, which do not; and many of those who are not Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men born, and being put by their Parents to be <hi>Apprentices,</hi> that as God may bless their just, true, and virtuous Industry, so they may be <hi>Founders</hi> of a New Family, and both raise themselves and theirs to the title of <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> lawfully bearing <hi>Arms.</hi> For which cause, those who may perchance own their worldly estate, and the foundation of that greatness or amplitude of means to such as have been Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> are not free enough to bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie themselves in detracting from those, whose original Greatness was drawn from the others; nor those others, whose Originals were from <hi>Chivalrie</hi> and <hi>Martial</hi> Service, (the most pure and proper Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of all, as to the purpose of bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Arms,</hi> and have since been mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>Citizens)</hi> ought to think it

               <p n="4">4. Which acknowledgement, besides that it is in the laws of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> an act of bounden Duty, they may the rather take it for a Glory.

7. In disputing thus, let me not be thought to set up an envious Comparison between these two de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees or qualifications of men: that is very far from me; for it must ever be granted to the Authority of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Opinion, founded upon cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom among us, that the true <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Esquire, caeteris paribus,</hi> is, in his proper place, before the <hi>City Esquire,</hi> which with the perpetual clause be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid of <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> holds also throughout the other degrees of the inferior <hi>Nobleness</hi> in <hi>England.</hi> I rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son here as Reason bids, not against the right or dignity of persons, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as in parallel, or as in disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but against the vanity and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences rising out of causeless Elation, and Arrogancy, and against their Errors, who not understanding the things of their own Country, are indeed meer <hi>Meteoroscopes,</hi> and hover in the Cloudy Region of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration 
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:105116:58"/>
upon rude and unlearned <hi>phantasies;</hi> for which cause, as minds needing to be healed, so would I sincerely wish that they were healed. Such are theirs, who would perhaps think the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies or <hi>Monopolies</hi> of the <hi>City</hi> more worthy of their acknowledgment, if where now they are denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of some particular <hi>Ware,</hi> or <hi>Craft,</hi> they were named of <hi>Eagles, Vultures, Lyons, Bears, Panthers, Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,</hi> or so forth, as the several Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of <hi>Nobility</hi> in <hi>Mexico</hi> (which <hi>Josephus Acosta</hi> writes) under their <hi>Emperour.</hi> Yet much better, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause more truly, these Fellowships of <hi>London</hi> carry the Names of <hi>Men,</hi> and their <hi>Trades,</hi> as they have Vocations in Professions, which onely Men can execute, better or more Noble; if those Societies were denominated of <hi>Eyes, Ears, Hands, Feet,</hi> or of other Members:
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:105116:59"/>
as <hi>Philostratus,</hi> in the life of that <hi>Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor, Apollonius Tyaneus,</hi> saith, the Officers, and Instrument of a <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophical King</hi> his <hi>Eyes, Ears,</hi> and so forth; so have these Mysteries some one or other Professor in each of them, from a higher Trade to the lowest, eminently dignified with the Honour of being the <hi>King</hi>'s Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, as the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Mercer,</hi> the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Draper,</hi> and so forth. Again, how much more worthy is the <hi>whole</hi> than the <hi>parts,</hi> because the parts are in the whole; so by that Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it is more honourable to be marshalled as a man among Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Civil men, than to be distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished by Allusions to particular Members; at least wise those Singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <hi>Gentlemen</hi> might certainly in their most contempt of the <hi>City,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that rare and real <hi>worth</hi> may be in the Persons of <hi>Citizens</hi> themselves, seeing <hi>Terrentius (Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul</hi>

Finally, they may remember, that in the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity</hi> of <hi>Citizens</hi> many Right No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and worthy <hi>Gentlemen</hi> are often found; and that, besides the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal mixture with City-races
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:105116:60"/>
through the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> it may not be denied, that true Nobleness or <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi> shineth often very bright among them, as it did a little before his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie</hi>'s happy Restoration, when a great number of <hi>Apprentices,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably the Sons of <hi>Gentry,</hi> and such as would not forget the accustomed <hi>Loyalty</hi> of their Progenitors, due at all times to their <hi>Soveraign,</hi> when these threatned the <hi>Lord Mayor</hi> to pull him off his horse, if he would not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare for the <hi>King;</hi> for even as where the <hi>Sun</hi> is there is no darkness, so where <hi>Soveraign Princes</hi> are interes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Parties, there is no Baseness.
