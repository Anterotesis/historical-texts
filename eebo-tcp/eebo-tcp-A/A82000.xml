         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>SAd News by th' Poſt, from <hi>Albion,</hi> doth me call,</l>
               <l>To know what mighty Planet there did fall</l>
               <l>So lately down, that all the people were</l>
               <l>In darkneſs, till another placed there.</l>
               <l>Some ſay 'twas <hi>Mars,</hi> or ſome ſuch Ruling ſtar;</l>
               <l>For they had ne'r his like, to manage War:</l>
               <l>Some ſay 'twas <hi>Jupiter;</hi> for ſuch was He,</l>
               <l>A <hi>Juvans Pater</hi> to the Nations three.</l>
               <l>Planets (we know) do govern Countries, Men,</l>
               <l>And other things below; but God rules them:</l>
               <l>So here, this Planet rul'd, with awe, and love,</l>
               <l>Being always rul'd himſelf by God above.</l>
               <l>Our grief for Him, and joy for his Succeſſor,</l>
               <l>We know not which was greater, nor which leſſer.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>When War was at the height of tears and blood,</l>
               <l>The LORD ſent <hi>OLIVER</hi> the Great, and Good,</l>
               <l>Who prov'd our Olive-branch, and Peace he got</l>
               <l>To all in time, but thoſe that lov'd it not:</l>
               <l>Moſt fit PROTECTOR was he then to be,</l>
               <l>To keep that Peace he gain'd the Nations three.</l>
               <l>Not reſting here, but better to ſecure</l>
               <l>Our Peace at home, abroad he did procure</l>
               <l>A Peace with all our Neighbour-Nations, and</l>
               <l>With honor much to him, and to our Land.</l>
               <l>Then martially did he ſo act abroad,</l>
               <l>He whipt the <hi>Spaniard</hi> with an Engliſh rod;</l>
               <l>So that the Popiſh Donns in ſeveral parts</l>
               <l>Do tremble in their Kingdoms, and their hearts.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>What Plots with vain attempts were 'gainſt our Land!</l>
               <l>Yet God did proſper all he took in hand;</l>
               <l>And he preſerv'd by Grace, until become</l>
               <l>The worthieſt Worthy of all Chriſtendom:</l>
               <l>Then <hi>Europe's</hi> Corner-pillar being grown fit</l>
               <l>For Heavens throne, was ſummon'd there to ſit;</l>
               <l>Who (as in life his precepts were t'obey)</l>
               <l>Being call'd (too ſoon for us) he went his way.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But here's another Poſt: What news, my Friend?</l>
               <l>Is <hi>Albion's HERO</hi> dead, as ſome pretend?</l>
               <l>He is not dead; nor can he die, whoſe Fame</l>
               <l>Will ever live in honor, and his Name</l>
               <l>So great in <hi>Albion,</hi> that S. <hi>George</hi> hath been</l>
               <l>Forgotten there, till on a Sign-poſt ſeen:</l>

               <l>S. <hi>Patrick</hi> was for <hi>Ireland</hi> renown'd,</l>

               </l>
               <l>Did ne'r for them, as He for us did gain:</l>
               <l>The <hi>Dutch-man's</hi> Champion that did <hi>Trump</hi> about,</l>
               <l>And for the ninth take in <hi>Guſtavus</hi> ſtout;</l>
               <l>Yet read them all together in true ſtory,</l>
               <l>You'll find them ſhort of <hi>Oliver</hi> his glory:</l>
               <l>So that his Enemies can ſay no leſs,</l>
               <l>He was a <hi>Cato,</hi> and an <hi>Hercules:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>His Wiſdom, Courage, rul'd our Commonwealth,</l>
               <l>And yet took little glory to himſelf,</l>
               <l>But gave it where 'twas due; and ſo ſhould we</l>
               <l>Give thanks to God for him eternally.</l>
               <l>Yet greater was his good; He did provide</l>
