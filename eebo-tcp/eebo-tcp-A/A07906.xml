            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

aptly alluding to the other deuiſe; but in

happy Gouernement, in that ſupreame

               <p>In the moſt eminent place ſitteth <hi>Fame,</hi>
ſeeming as if ſhee ſounded her Golden

be ſilent, all eyes and eares wide open,
when <hi>Fame</hi> filleth the world with her ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred

               <p>This day, ſhee ſeemeth to preſent the
new ſworne <hi>Lord Maior</hi> to Soueraigne
Maieſty, whoſe Lieutenant and lawfull
Deputy hee is now inueſted for <hi>London.</hi>
Shee ſheweth him, what other gracious
perſonages ſhee hath there attending her,
for more honourable ſolemnity of this
generall Triumph; preſaging a happy and
ſucceſſefull courſe to his yeare of gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
By her is figured a goodly Shippe,
<pb facs="tcp:20606:8"/>
whereby ſhe conueighes all beatitudes of
Kingdomes, Cities and Nations, to the
furtheſt remoate Countries. Intimating
thereby, how the Magiſtrate may honour
his Prince, in that high truſt and care com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to him, and ſupplying the State

Trafficke and Commerce are continually
required.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Expectation</hi> (ſitting ſomewhat lower on

expecte from him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in regard, that hee is
now mounted like a <hi>Beacon</hi> on an Hill,
to flame forth brightly, and not to burne
dimly. Whereof <hi>Hope</hi> (ſitting on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide) ſeemeth to giue a gracious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion.
In regarde, that his worthy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did formerly ſupply the ſame place,
and left ſuch ſenſible inſtructions to his
Sonne, as cannot but edge his temper the
more keenely, and quicken his ſpirits the
more induſtriouſly. Becauſe it is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
thing, for a Son, to ſucceed his Father
<pb facs="tcp:20606:8"/>
in ſuch eminencie, and therefore bindeth
him to the more ſerious obſeruance.</p>
               <p>Wherein to encourage him the more,
ſhee ſheweth him all thoſe ſacred <hi>Vertues,</hi>
that gaue his Father comfort in his Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracie,
<hi>Iuſtice</hi> and <hi>Fortitude,</hi> who will as
forwardly further him; treading downe
thoſe vile Incendiaries, <hi>Ambition, Treaſon,</hi>

may be the better ſecured, againſt all their
violences and treacherous attempts; they
ſit gyued, and manacled together in Iron
ſhackles, purpoſely made and ſent from
the <hi>Ironmongers Myne,</hi> to binde ſuch baſe
villaines to their better behauiour.</p>
               <p>Now, becauſe <hi>Fame</hi> cannot endure, that
any part of her Mount ſhould bee vnfitly
furniſhed: In a degree more backward, &amp;
ſomewhat lower then her Seat, ſit her two

when any diſorder threatneth danger to

any ſuch inconuenience happeneth, forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with

beene allowed of beſt obſeruation: both

findeth, that in this yeare of 1618. the letter
<hi>H.</hi> ſhall haue predominance in three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
perſons, as eminent Gouernours, &amp;
namely in the City of <hi>London, viz.</hi> the <hi>L.
Maior,</hi> and both the <hi>Shieriffes.</hi> And if his

ſelfe, he ſaith that their names, will be <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey,
Herne</hi> and <hi>Hamarſley,</hi> for ſo the booke
of <hi>Fate</hi> hath concluded of them, againſt
which can be no contradiction. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
making triall of his diuination hy his
ſtaffe (which vſually directed him in all
ſuch courſes) as hee ſpeaketh to the <hi>Lord
Maior;</hi> he ſmiteth the Staffe vpon his foot,
&amp; ſuddenly iſſueth forth the three ſeuerall
letters of H. apparantly to be diſcerned of
all. So, finding his iudgement to be fallen
out true, &amp; that the perſons figured by
