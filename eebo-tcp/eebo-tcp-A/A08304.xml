            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Good Father, thou seest that
I am most weake, and without

suppresse my desires, but rather
they the more strongly rise in me:
I cannot denie my selfe, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Therefore I beseech thee sanctifie
me, that I defile not my selfe with
the filthinesse of the flesh, or fleshly

swearing to be courage, and
meekenesse to be madnesse, pride to

are the enormities that rise vp in

tollerable, but as things laudable:
oh mortifie therfore, mortifie these
euils, let vs no longer be besotted

may be simply grounded vpon the

in memorie, that I can not follow
mine owne will, and thy woord.
I may not impart my affections
to the deedes of the flesh, and the
woorkes of the spirite. I can not
walke in darknesse and light, the
way of death, and the way of life,
I cannot serue thee and sinne.
Direct me therefore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> good Father,
direct mee in my whole life, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate

in the worlde: &amp; fare far better
then such as speake the truth from

            <p>Certain idle persons, whose in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
do annoy a great parte of
this bodie, are to bee cured or cut
off, for they are daungerous mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
for whose reformation haue
beene made many notable prouisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
by sundry sage &amp; graue actes,
and howses of correction for vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants,
erected in euery shire. But


<pb n="92" facs="tcp:3689:100"/>
it falleth out, that the number of
such daungerous weeds rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
then diminish, to the great
detriment of our quiet abiding in
this standing howse of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
weale: wherein I suppose the
negligence of inferiour officers, is
a great occasion of their increase.</p>
            <p>I haue trauelledm any shires,
and it appeareth that there is little
or no executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of these good lawes,
greatly to be lamented, not only in
regard of the common quiet which
by them is like to be disturbed, but
also in regard of the persons them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
who endaunger their own
estates, by their vngodly loosenes
and lewdnes of life. The common
wealth also loosing their labour &amp;
trauel, which might in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
steed their brethren, if with a
sound and godly disposition, they
would frame their lims to labour,
yet eat they that which is gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by
the sweat of other men. The num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of these persons is great, the
persons themselues for the most
part, able of body, hardy, stout har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and fit to be imploid in strong
affaires, a number of them yet


<pb facs="tcp:3689:101"/>
counterfeyting impotency, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
themselues with rotten
ragges, passe through the country
halting in the day time, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
annoy the good members of
this publike weale in the night.
These passe and repasse by such as
haue authority to examine, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
to punish, and to reforme their
disorder, and yet fewe or none set
hand to redresse it. If the Citie of
London be viewed, the streetes
within it, &amp; the suburbes &amp; fieldes
neere it, will yeeld of young &amp; old,
men and women, able of body to
serue maisters, and to labour for
their liuing, a great number of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabondes.
And which is most la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable,
the young and tender
girles &amp; lads of all ages, lie vnder
stalles in the streets by great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
vnder hedges in the fieldes,
&amp; no man taketh them vp, to bring
them to some faculty to get their
liuings, as is commanded, but suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
them to wallow stil in idlenes,
vntill they be past to be reclaimed,
falling into breach of the lawes,
and so are eaten vp with vntimely
death: who if they had beene care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully


<pb n="93" facs="tcp:3689:101"/>
prouided for, they might haue
proued good members of the weale
publike. It is no new thing, and
would God it might bee nowe at
the eldest estate, that these euilles
might be cut off, or in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
reformed. The roote being cut
in sunder, the branches would wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
for there are diuers occasions
giuen and tollerated, whereby they
thus grow into these idle and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant
courses. It seemeth lawful,
for it is tollerated, that euery man
at his pleasure may leaue his tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel,
and go to the play house, bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Allyes. Beare gardens, Ale
houses, Tauernes, and gaming,
where they lose their time, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sume
their thrift, and offende the lawes
of God, and her Maiesty. And the
Sabboth day which shoulde bee
sanctified with prayer, and hearing
of the worde, is prophaned with
these accustomed euils, which if
they were cast out as vnprofitable,
in this our earthly abiding place,
wee should the more sweetely passe

that soonest atteineth to the enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereof but in part, that is, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in this life, through the quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of conscience in our Christ,
or being departed hence, hath the
fruition thereof in spirit, expecting
the comming of that great Judge,
when soule and body shall enioy
the same at full. Oh let vs all
therefore, in all godly watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
in this our pilgrimage which
shortly shall haue ende, haue due
regard vnto our walking, that we
walke not awry. Let vs dayly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
our selues, &amp; consider with
iudgement, that we shall all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
before that high Judge, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
whome, no step of our progresse
shall be hidden, and whome soeuer
he shall finde halting, or walking
awry, he will bereaue of that most
sweete hearts ease in heauen, and
will giue most sowre and vnsauery
hearts sore in hell. If I should
discourse of the comforts which
shal be shewed vnto such as walke


<pb facs="tcp:3689:106"/>
this progresse, and end the same as
they ought, &amp; as they are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
alas, I am as vnable, nay,
there is no toong of man or angell
can neerer declare y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deapth of the
sweetnes therof, then I am able to
number y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> starres in the firmame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t:
the excellencie thereof, is such &amp; so
vnspeakeable, as no hart is able to
comprehend or conceiue the same:
but let this satisfie all curious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits,
that, that our heauenly man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
our euerlasting tabernacle,
that our spirituall inheritance, is
such and so full fraught with such
variety of ioy, with such vnspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
comforts, with such endlesse
felicitie, and surpassing glory: yea,
such is the fulnesse of all spirituall
contentation there, that we shall
not couet to see more, the eare de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to heare more, the body haue
will to feele more, nor y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hart thirst
to conceiue more, then we shall
there for euermore enioy, howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
they are now, whilst we are in
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> flesh, far remoued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our grosse
conceits, and euery report of them
seemeth dark vnto our senses, vntil
our all sufficient God, our Christ,


<pb n="98" facs="tcp:3689:106"/>
and our Sauiour, shall himselfe
appeare againe in the clowdes:
then shall our vnderstandings be
opened, then shall our senses be
lightened, and then shall we most
plainely see, euidently perceiue, and
to our absolute comfort taste of
the fulnesse thereof, yea, then shall
we see our God face to face, when
there shall be an end of all our tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailes,
of all our toyle, of all our
carke, care, feare, trouble, and irke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
passage: then shall we hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
no more, thirst no more, then
shall we neede no friend, nor feare
any foe, then shall we that are here
now in prison, be set at libertie, and
we that are pressed downe with
misery shall be raysed vp to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort:
yea, then shall be an end of
all things that now discomfort vs.
Oh let vs therfore be euer thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
vnto our God, that hath not
only prouided this heauenly harts
ease, and endlesse ioyes for vs, but
hath also layde out the way there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
and giuen vs his owne hand
to leade vs, yea, himself to conduct
vs vnto the same. Let vs without
ceasing therefore pray vnto him,


<pb facs="tcp:3689:107"/>
and let vs be alwayes in good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
in him: yea, let vs groane in
our hearts, with most longing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation,
for the appearing of him
that shall deliuer vs, and free vs
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dangers, and settle vs in these
ioyes. And let vs cut off all lets
and impediments, how neere or
deere soeuer they bee vnto vs,
whether it be the eye, the hand, or
the foote, let vs cast away all excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
wife, children, lands, goods,
gold, and siluer, honours, digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
yea, let not life it selfe be deere
vnto vs, if it seeme to hinder vs
from a speedy passage vnto our
God: knowing, that so long as
we are heere in this earthly house,
our estate is miserable, our passage
dangerous, our pleasures peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
and we wander as wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
through many miseries.</p>
            <p>We are heere but as in a strange
countrey, farre off from our owne
home, whereunto we must ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor
to attaine in all simplicitie,
carrying onely with vs, as our
staffe to stay vs vp, the merites
of our Christ, and for our defence
heere, the swoord of the spirit,


<pb n="99" facs="tcp:3689:107"/>
whereby we shall be able to walke
through all the perils and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
yea the fire &amp; water, through
which we are to passe. Let vs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
yea and wish with ioy that
most happy daye, wherein that
sweete trompet of our sauing
Christ shall sound out to call vs:
let vs hearken for it continually,
and let vs thinke it will sound to
morrow. Then to morrow shall be
our merry day, for then to morrow
shall we meete our God, that will
carry vs home with him, that in
body and soule we may dwell with
him for euermore. Oh come Lord
Jesu, come quickly, and let all the
people of God say, <hi>Amen.</hi>
