            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>R. Sherlock's <hi>Discourse concerning the Nature, Vnitie, and Communion of the Catholique Church</hi> came forth in the Year 1688. not long before the great Revolution that has hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened among us, and through the unsetlednesse of the times, the watchfull care over the presse, and the difficulties of sending a Copie of an Answer to be printed beyond sea, he has had ever since all the advantage of a Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, which is to be cried up and admired by men of his own persuasion without any check and controll. But seing of late our Adversaries begin again to traduce their inoffensive neighbours in print on the account of their Faith, there can be no fair excuse now for any longer silence since the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blication of the Peace and the opening of the seas, and it will be expected, that we say something to Dr. Sherlock in behalfe of the Catholique Church, if our Caus can afford us any thing to say a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his Principles; it being a thing very natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral for men to speak when they are spoken to, to defend themselves when they are attacqued, and to returne Answers when their silence is like to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound
<pb facs="tcp:108855:3"/>
to the prejudice of the Caus which they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve espoused. It is for this reason that I have been induced to draw the following Discourses out of the obscuritie wherin they have lain for severall Years, which if Protestants will but read with the same impartialitie as they read Books of a much lesser concern, I make no doubt, but they will find more than sufficient grounds to question the truth of the Drs. Anticatholique Notions, which have nothing else to recommend them to any man's esteem besides their Noveltie and singularitie, which are the things of all others which ought to be most suspected in matters of Religion.</p>
            <p>The most proper way of answering him would have been by a just and methodical Treatise of the <hi>Nature, Vnitie, and Communion of the Catholique Church</hi> as they are setled in our Principles. But by reason our Authors, who have writ very copiously on these subjects, are in every one's hands, I shall make use of no other method than his own, and follow him step by step with as much brevitie as is consistent with clearnesse, by which means I may chance to give the Reader as great a satisfaction as if my thoughts were swelled into a Book of a gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ater bulk, seing I shall take notice of every thing which he shall offer of any seeming moment, and omit onely those things that have litle or no opposition to our Principles.</p>
            <p>The grand Principle wheron he pretends to build his whole Discourse is, that <hi>the Church in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aven
<pb facs="tcp:108855:3"/>
and Earth is the one Church, and the one Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of Christ.</hi> We are no strangers to this Position, which we are as well acquainted withal as with any Article of our Creed: neither do I remember that any of our Schoolmen, or other Divines who are seldom sparing in starting objections against themselves, have taken notice of any ground for any objectlon that might be taken from thence against our Doctrins; or that any of our Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Adversaries have at any time made any use of it to justifie their separation from us, as they might very easily and and effectually have done, if the Drs. inferences from thence be necessarie. So that the glorie of this great action is due to him alone, and the weapons whereby he defends his Church are not onely his own but of his own invention too, which I suppose has been the caus of that great sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in his undertaking which he discouvers in the following Citations out of him.</p>
            <p>He tels us in his Preface, that <hi>after all that is said on one side and t'other he is very sensible, that there will never be an end of these wranglings</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Catholiques and Protestants) <hi>without set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the true Notion of the Catholique Church, which thô a great manie good things have been said about it, he thinks was never throughly done yet.</hi> And altho immediately after this he pretends to leave the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of what he has written on this subject to others, yet he sufficiently insinuates in these words, that he takes his own performance to be in a singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb facs="tcp:108855:4"/>
manner effectual above all others. For in case no Protestant Writer has hitherto attained to <hi>the true Notion of the Catholique Church,</hi> it is manifest that both he and all of his persuasion may be mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken herin, if his Notion proue to be wrong. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore he must either pretend to certaintie that his Notion is right, whereby he makes all Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Writers to be Punies to himselfe in wit and abilities; or else grant, that for any thing he knows, both he and all those who have writ before him may be mistaken about it, whereby he excludes all pretence of certaintie, that the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Churches are not guiltie of the Heresie and Schism wherwith we Charge them; becaus their freenesse from these crimes cannot be certainly known without being certain that they performe the necessarie Conditions of Communion with the Catholique Church, and this performance cannot be certainly known withour being certain what is the <hi>true Notion of the Catholique Church.</hi> It deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves a very serious remark, that Dr. Sherlock, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Reformation has been above an Age and an halfe in the world, starts up at last and tels us, that the first Reformers had not the <hi>true Notion of the Catholique Church,</hi> from whence it is evidently inferred, that they separated from the Catholique and visible Church of their time, without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what necessarie obligations they might have of being visibly united to it. Can any prudent Man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve with himselfe according to this account that
<pb facs="tcp:108855:4"/>
these Reforming Heads were pushed on by the Spirit of God to do what they did?</p>
            <p>He talks again with the same assurance p. 8. <hi>The whole Church,</hi> sais he, <hi>both in Heaven and Earth are united to Christ in the same covenant, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes it his One Mystical Bodie: and it was necessarie to lay the foundation here; for without this, it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to understand what the Unitie of the Church on Earth means, most of the mistakes in this matter being plainly owing to that first and Fundamental im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake about the Notion of Catholique Unitie, as that includes the universal Church, part of which is tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated into Heaven, and part still Militant on Earth.</hi> I suppose he designs in this passage to reflect on the Writers of the Church of England, who will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver confesse ignorance, that <hi>the Church in Heaven and Earth are united to Christ in the same couenant,</hi> nor rest satisfied with his cajoling aknowledgment, that they have said a great manie good things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Notion of the Catholique Church, when he tels them, that it is impossible to understand what the Unitie of the Church on Earth means without his Principles, and that they have been no lesse than <hi>fundamentally mistaken</hi> in all their Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses <hi>about Catholique Unitie,</hi> whereby the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of this great discoverie belongs to him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusively to all others.</p>
            <p>He then censures the Presbyterians p. 29. in these words, <hi>These who have been aware of this, that the Church in Heaven and Earth is but one Church,
<pb facs="tcp:108855:5"/>
have hence concluded, that the Catholique Church is onely the number of the Elect; that none but truly good men, who are renewed and sanctified by the H. Spirit, are Members of Christs My<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>al Bodie, which makes the Church on Earth as invisible to us as the Church in Heaven.</hi> Here he owns the Presbyterians whom he grants to be separatists from his Church, to be better skilled in the Principles of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie than the most learned Pen-men of his own Communion, as not denying, but that they are wel acquainted with this unqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>stionable Principle of the Christian Faith that <hi>the Church in Heaven and Earth is but one Church,</hi> and laying to their char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge onely, that they make a wrong use of it, I am much mistaken if it will not appear herafter, that he has no great reason to value himselfe above the Presbyterians for making a better use of it than they do. At present I desire it may be taken notice of, that he blames these People for <hi>making the Church on Earth as invisible to us as the Church in Heaven,</hi> and p. 54. he professes to <hi>believe that there always has been, and always will be, a true Visible Church to the end of the World,</hi> and yet in the same Page he teaches those who hold that the Church may be sometimes invisible, how they may make this Position good, which is a sign that the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians erre not much in the use they make of it in this particular, if they erre any thing at all. For what Divine or Minister of the Gospel will show separatists a way how they may defend such
<pb facs="tcp:108855:5"/>
Doctrins as he accounts erroneous?</p>
            <p>In the next place he falls upon Catholiques. <hi>Others,</hi> sais he, <hi>when they talk of the unitie of the Church, never think of the Church in Heaven, and therefore advance such a Notion of Church unitie as excludes the Church in Heaven as if the Church on Earth were the whole Church of Christ, or that the Church in Heaven and Earth were not one Church; or that the Notion of Church-unitie must not relate to the whole Church, but onely to one part of it.</hi> This char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge against us shall be considered anon. What I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve now is, that he will have us as wel as the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians to make an ill use of his principle, altho in a different manner from them. For if he make us as ignorant of it as his Church-of-England Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, he cannot but know that this is notoriously false; and I am verily persuaded, if the truth were known, that the first knowledge he had of it was from our Authors, and perhaps from the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the <hi>Aggreement between the Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland and the Church of Rome</hi> &amp;c. (if he were a Catholique) becaus he takes notice of it in his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to this Book p. 74. For which reason me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks he might have been more civil in his lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage to him, since he has furnished him with such a Principle as he thinks has put an end to the <hi>vain and arrogant pretences of the Church of Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly, he censures the Independents, who by</hi> considering that the Unitie of the Church con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>s in the Union of all the parts and members of it to Christ, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
<pb facs="tcp:108855:6"/>
               <hi>no regard at all to the Unitie of the Church on Earth as that also is one Bodie and Communion.</hi> We are beholding to him for his civilitie in ranking us before this People. The last words of this quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are very remarkeble: and since he holds it for an errour to denie the Church on Earth to be <hi>one Bodie and Communion,</hi> it will be a strong prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce against his Notion of Church-unitie, if the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Church on Earth cannot be maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in his Principles.</p>
            <p>It is plain from all these places, that Dr. Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock makes full account that he has done our bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse for us; but I hope the contrarie will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the following Discourses, which I shall not submit, as he does, to the judgment of any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different Reader, but to that of the learned, who are best able to judge of the conclusivenesse of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asonings that are managed after a speculative and scholastique way, which the frequent occasions I have received from his new and singular Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and the manner of proposing his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have unavoidably drove me to in several places.</p>

               <hi>CHAPTER I.</hi> Concerning the Unitie of the Catholique Church in Heaven and Earth.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>§. p. 6. HIs Grand Principle, as I have said in the Preface, is this, that</hi> the whole Church in Heaven and Earth is the One Church, <hi>from whence he concludes, that</hi> to place the Unitie of the Church in any thing that can concern onely one part of the Church, but not the whole, as suppose, that part which is on Earth, not that which is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, is manifestly absurd, becaus it does not give an account, how the whole Church is One, and yet the Onenesse of the Church properly relates to the whole, not to a part, for a part be it never so much one, can be but One part, not the One Church.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Replie. All this and more that he has said there to this purpose is very true, if by <hi>One Church</hi> we understand the Church as it is taken in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Latitude, that is, as it comprehends the Church in Heaven and the Church on Earth; but it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinently alledged by him as a Principle to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend us withal. For what Catholique, or what Man of common sense was there ever yet in the world, who endeavoured to make the Church One as the word <hi>Church</hi> is taken in the greater Latitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, by such an Unitie as <hi>can concern onely one part</hi> of it?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:108855:10"/>
§. 2. Ib. From <hi>hence,</hi> sais he, <hi>we may learn wherin the unitie of the Church does not consist, and and wherin it does consist;</hi> and he first considers wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Unitie of the Church does not consist. As first, <hi>the unitie of the Church does not consist in it's being One Organized Politique Bodie, under the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment of One Visible Head upon Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Replie. This is a terrible blow, and altho it be aimed at the Pope, yet it neither hurts him, nor any one of his belief. For it is no Doctrin of ours, that the Pope is Head of the <hi>Invisible as wel as of the Visible Church,</hi> that is, that he is Head of the Church taken in the greater Latitude, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the frivolous reasons which, he sais, are apt to <hi>make him suspect it.</hi> He knows wel e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, that this is none of our Doctrin, nay he sais, that he <hi>supposes</hi> it is not, and therefore he sets down in behalfe of us this Replie to his Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence which we willingly admit, viz that <hi>when we speak of the unitie of the Church, we mean onely the unitie of the Church on Earth, and that the Pope is the Visible Head of this unitie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>§. 3. p. 7. To which he Answers, that</hi> then we must grant, that we speak very improperly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus the Church on Earth is not that One Church which is the one Bodie of Christ, and therefore the unitie of the Church does not consist in the Headship of the Pope, but that we ought to say, that the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Church on Earth consists in it's union to the Pope.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:108855:10"/>
3. Replie. This is meer trifling; for when he had drawn an insignificant Inference against us, and alledged for us a just answer to it, he here tels us that we speak <hi>improperly,</hi> that seing our Doctrin cannot justifie his Inference, he may show the necessitie of it from our <hi>improper</hi> words and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions. He would have cone much better and more like a fair disputant, if he had blotted out that Inference, after he had reflected on the false supposition which it proceeded on. But this would have spoiled a pretty compact Paragraph, where the reasoning was strong and all clear, if we had held the same Doctrin which it supposes: and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we do not, this Paragraph must be published with the rest, and our <hi>improper</hi> words must passe for a just occasion for it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But pray, Sr, why do we speak <hi>improperly?</hi> We use the same manner of speech as our Forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have done before us, which has been so <hi>proper</hi> and clear till this your new way of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting an <hi>end to wranglings,</hi> that none of your writers that I know of, have ever found any fault with us for the same. When we dispute with Protestants about the Church we speak li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trovertists, that is, we take the word <hi>Church</hi> in that sense wherin it is the subject of the differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that are between us. We have no dispute with you about the <hi>One Church</hi> as it includes the souls in Heaven and the Faithful on Farth, which may engage us to use twentie words when two or three
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:108855:11"/>
will do the businesse. And supposing we had any such dispute, yet there would be seldom any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion for <hi>distinguishing</hi> terms, when the caus of the dispute <hi>hic &amp; nunc</hi> would sufficiently deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min the sense of these words <hi>One Church.</hi> We hold that the Church is Infallible in defining matters of Faith, that we are all bound to submit to her Decisions, that she has the power of granting Indulgences &amp;c. Now who is there among you, who will desire us to explain, what we mean by the word <hi>Church</hi> in the said Propositions, whether we mean the Church in Heaven, or the Church on Earth, or both together? And if it be ridiculous to demand further light, when you are under so great a certainty of our meaning by the word <hi>Church</hi> in the aforesaid Propositions, it must needs be so too when you tel us, that we speak <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly</hi> when we say that the B. of Rome is Head of the Church, and desire to learn from us of what Church we affirme him to be the Head, whether of the Church in Heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or of the Church on Earth, or of both together? Sure our Saviour does not speak <hi>improperly</hi> when he sais <hi>Dic Ecclesiae, Si autem Ecclesiam non audierit &amp;c. Portae inferi non praevalebunt adversus eam &amp;c.</hi> which places relate to the Church on Earth, whatever their further meaning be. Finally, custome which is a secure Principle to relie on for the sense of words, is a sufficient warrant for us to retain the same terms we use at present, and therefore I shall still make
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:108855:11"/>
bold as often as I say that the B. of Rome is He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad of the Church, to signifie thereby, that he is Head of the Church on Earth without fearing your reproaches of speaking <hi>improperly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>§. 4. He 2. Answers our aforesaid Replie, that</hi> therefore we must quit all our Arguments for the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe's Headship, taken from the Churche's being One, the One Bodie of Christ; for the Church on Earth is not this One Bodie of Christ, and therefore it does not follow, that becaus Christ has but One Bodie, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Church on Earth must have One Vifible Head.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Replie. We may easilie <hi>quit all our Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the Pope's Headship taken from the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che's being One, the One Bodie of Christ,</hi> if by these terms be meant the Church as it includes the B. souls in Heaven, and the Faithfull on Earth. For I know of no Arguments we have that are deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved barely from thence; neither do we say, that becaus Christ has but One Mystical Bodie, the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore the Church on Earth must have One Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Head, but onely that becaus Christ has but One Mystical Bodie on Earth whereof he is the Invisible Head, therefore the Church on Earth as it is also a Visible Bodie and Societie must have One Visible Head. The Dr. has no reason to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel at the terms of One <hi>Mystical Bodie on Earth,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus he grants the Church on Earth to be Mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally One, and on the other side, he cannot be ignorant, that it is called by S. Paul the Bodie of Christ 1. at Cor. 12. <hi>Vos estis Corpus Christi.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:108855:12"/>
does it follow, becaus the Church on Earth is Christ's Bodie, that therefore he has two Bodies, but onely that every part of it has the denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the whole, as it happens in the Bodie of a Man, where if the hand or leg be wounded, we say that his Bodie is wounded, altho his hand or leg is not his whole Bodie, but onely an integral part of it. Thus likewise we say, that the Church as it is taken in the greater Latitude is but One, and yet the Dr. will not denie, but that the Church on Earth is One also, and will not take it well, if any one infer from hence, that Christ has two Churches, becaus one and one make two.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>§. 5. Ib. He thirdly answers,</hi> Nay they must confesse, that the formal and essential unitie of the Church on Earth does not consist in it's union to the Pope, becaus the Church on Earth is one with the Church in Heaven, they being both but One Church, and therefore must have the same essential unitie; for how they should be One by two sorts of unitie, that is, be One without the same formal unitie, is very mysterious and near akin to a contradiction. And therefore since the unitie of the Church in Heaven does not consist in it's union to the Pope, no more does the unitie of the Church on Earth, the unitie being the same in both.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Replie. The Church on Earth may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered two ways, either as it is a part of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Bodie of Christ, or as it is a Visible Societie. If it be taken under the former consideration, there
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:108855:12"/>
can be no difficultie in granting, that it's <hi>formal and essential unitie does not consist in it's union to the Pope</hi> for the reason given, uiz becaus seing the Unitie of the Church in Heaven does not consist in it's Union to the Pope, so neither does the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of the Church on Earth. But if it be taken under the second consideration, nothing can hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but that it's <hi>formal and essential unitie may consist in it's union to the Pope.</hi> The Dr. himselfe, if he own One Visible Church, is bound to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of some Union which is essential to it as it is thus considered, which is distinct from that Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie whereby it is united to the Church in Heaven, let him place this Unitie in what he pleases.</p>
            <p n="7">7. It is no strange thing that a Bodie of men should be capable of different Unions to different extremes, and that these Unions should be all essential to this Bodie, if it be considered as a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die in different respects. Thus a Bodie of Vassals which is united, and pays obedience to their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Prince who has a Superiour Lord over him, is not hindred from paying obedience, and being united to this Superiour Lord in all such matters, and services, as are required by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of their immediate Lord's Tenure. Neither does this hinder, but that they may be united to God who is both Lord over their immediate Lord, and the Lord that is Superiour over him. And it would be very ridiculous to affirme, that it is <hi>near akin to a coutradiction,</hi> to say that this Bodie of Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:108855:13"/>
is One by two or three sorts of Unities, which signifies no more, but that they are One two or three sorts of ways.</p>
            <p n="8">8. And as a Bodie of Vassals may be One two or three sorts of ways, so likewise may a part of it be One by means of an Unitie which is not common to the other part; as supposing the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce has no Superiour Lord over him, but depends immediately on God for the power which he has over part of them. In which case the whole Bodie is One by being under the same Prince's Iurisdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and and yet is not One if we consider the nature of the Prince's Jurisdiction. For part of them are One by acknowledging a Superiour Lord over their Prince and them, and the other part is One by acknowledging no other Superiour over them but God and their immediate Prince. Now I hardly think that any Man of sense will endeavour to prove, that one part of this Bodie of Vassals cannot be united to their Superiour Lord, becaus they are united to the other part which is not united to him. And yet this undoubtedly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, if the Unitie of the Church on Earth can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not consist in it's Union to the Pope, becaus it is united to the Church in Heaven whose Unitie does not consist in it's Union to the Pope. Wherefore seing the same Collective Bodies may be One and not One in different respects, nothing can hinder but that the Church on Earth which is Mystical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly One with the Church in Heaven, may be Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:108855:13"/>
One in it selfe by being united to the Pope, altho it be not One, but distinct from the Church in Heaven under this consideration.</p>
            <p n="9">9. When the Dr. writ this answer, he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindful of another Doctrin which is inconsistent with it, and which he has laid down p. 38. viz that <hi>the Catholique Church is united in One Bodie to Christ onely, who is the onely Head of his Church, but that particular Bodies (</hi>of Christians <hi>) are under the government of particular Bishops, which makes a particular Church, and is essential to the Definition of it.</hi> Which words import, that it is absolutely necessarie for particular Bodies to have Bishops over them to whom they are to be united, before they can be Churches; as for example Canterbury or York with the Countries adjacent to them can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be Churches, unlesse they have Bishops. This is a very surprizing Assertion from one who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves, that the Unitie of the Catholique Church on Earth cannot subsist in it's Union to the Pope, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus it is One with the Church in Heaven whose Unitie does not consist in it's Union to the Pope. For certainly particular Churches on Earth are as much One with the Church in Heaven as the who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le Church on Earth can be, and by consequence if the Unitie of the whole Church on Earth does not consist in it's Union to the Pope becaus it is One with the Church in Heaven, the Unitie of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Churches on Earth does not consist in their Union to particular Bishops, becaus these Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches

            <p>§. 6. P. 8. After these Answers to our Replie he proceeds to conclude 2. from his grand Principle, that <hi>the unitie of the Church does not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in joyning together in the external and visible Acts of Worship, or in maintaining mutual correspondence, and intercourse with one another becaus the Church in Heaven and Earth are One without them, and so may distant Churches on Earth be without any such vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible correspondence.</hi>

               <hi>The Church in Heaven has no external and visible Acts of Worship, and yet is one with the Church on Earth.

The Drs. thoughts are so fixed upon the invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Union whereby the Church in Heaven and Earth become the One mystical Bodie of Christ, that he seems to have wholly forgotten, that the Church on Earth is one Visible Societie by our

Lord's Institution, and that whenever we break the Conditions of this visible Societie which are not such as are common to the Church in Heaven, we at the same time forfeit our Union with the Church in Heaven.</p>

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:108855:15"/>
Doctrin which is delivered below concerning Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies must be applied to it as it is taken in this sense. But if it signifie the same thing still, as it did before the pretended Reformation of the Church, viz Masse, or the Unbloudie Sacrifice of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and Bloud of our Saviour as a Propitiation for the living and the dead, it may be considered ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther according to it's Forme, or according to it's substance. If it be considered according to it's For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, that is, according to the manner of it's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, it's several parts, collects and variati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons suitable to the seasons and Festivals of the year, the same Doctrin that is delivered below concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Ceremonies must here likewise be applied to it, at it is taken in this sense. Neither can the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of the Church necessarily consist in <hi>joyning together in it,</hi> becaus the manner of offering this Sacrifice has never been one and the same throug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hout the Catholique Church, as neither is it at this day, manie of the Oriental Christians who communicate with the see Apostolique, making use of the Liturgies of S. James, S. Basil, and S. Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostom, which are likewise common to the Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiques in those parts. And altho the present Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man way of offering this Sacrifice has prevailed in most parts of the West ever since the first plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Christianitie among them, yet manie An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient and famous Churches in these Countries ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve had, and still have some special differences of their own annexed to it. Nay the Bishops of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:108855:16"/>
have in several Ages made several additions and alterations in the forme of it, according as they judged it to conduce most to the edification of the Faithfull.</p>
            <p n="13">13. But if the <hi>Liturgie</hi> be considered precisely according to it's substance, that is, the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration of the Sacramental Elements and the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of them, the Unitie of the Church necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily consists either in <hi>joyning together</hi> in it, or in <hi>joyning together</hi> to renounce it. For those who own this Sacrifice, hold it for a Fundamental Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of their Faith, which if it be, all Christians ought to <hi>joyn</hi> in it; and if it be not, all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ought to renounce it. So that here is a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in a matter of Faith in the Unitie wherof the Unitie of the Visible Church principally consists, since Roman Catholiques hold an Unbloudie Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to be a Revealed Truth, and Protestants ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it for an <hi>idolatrous Fiction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="14">14. If it be said, that an Unbloudie Sacrifice is a Non-fundamental Point, and that therefore the Unitie of the Church on Earth may wel subsist without the belief of it, altho it should chance to have been Revealed: I answer, that the Church on Earth cannot be One with the Church in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aven, unlesse every Reuealed Truth be Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental and necessarie to be believed.</p>
            <p n="15">15. For it is impossible to conceive how the Church on Earth should be one with the Church in Heaven, if the <hi>Faith</hi> of the Church on Earth
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:108855:16"/>
does not correspond with the <hi>Vision</hi> of the Church in Heaven in all such Points as are <hi>sufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed</hi> to her belief; for the Church on Earth should <hi>believe</hi> nothing to be true, which the Church in Heaven does not <hi>see</hi> to be true, nor <hi>believe</hi> any thing to be false, which the Church in Heaven does not <hi>see</hi> to be false; for seing the translation of souls into Heaven changes their <hi>Faith</hi> into <hi>Vision,</hi> the Objects of their Faith are still supposed to be unalterably the same when they are <hi>seen,</hi> as they were before when they were one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>believed.</hi> Wherefore if the Church in Heaven <hi>sees</hi> any Object of our <hi>Faith</hi> to be otherwise than as we <hi>believe</hi> it to be, she cannot be One with the Church on Earth, neither can the Church on Earth be united to the Lord of Truth to whom the Church of Heaven is united, but has renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the <hi>Gospel-Covenant</hi> which was the Medium of their Union together and of both of them to Christ. There is to be onely <hi>one Faith</hi> on Earth, becaus there is onely <hi>one Vision</hi> among the B. souls in Heaven (I mean onely <hi>one Vision</hi> in relation to such Objects of our Faith as are Revealed in the Gospel.) The <hi>Vision</hi> of the Church in Heaven shall be the touchstone of our <hi>Faith,</hi> becaus it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the truth of the Gospel. And in this sense we are to understand that saying of our Saviour, <note n="*" place="bottom">Ioan. <hi>12.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>The word which I have spoken shall judge him at the last day.</hi> And thus likewise it shall be true what is said of the Apostles, that they shall <hi>judge
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:108855:17"/>
the twelve Tribes of Israel,</hi> by convincing them, that every tittle of what they preached on Earth was infallibly true by the ocular experience which they have had therof in the Divine Essence.</p>
            <p n="16">16. Again. There is no Point which the Church on Earth has a <hi>sufficient Light</hi> to judge that it is Revealed by God, which does not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford a necessarie Object of Happinesse to the Church in Heaven, becaus there is no such Point which does not argue in God some necessarie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection relating either to his Wisdom, Justice, Power, Mercie, Goodnesse, or some other Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute in the knowledge and love whereof the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse of the Church in Heaven consists. Now no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be an unnecessarie and Non-fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Object of Faith to the Church on Earth, which is a necessarie Object of love to the Church in Heaven, becaus the belief of those Objects which make the Church in Heaven Happie, is ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by God as a means to lead the Church on Earth to the enjoyment of the same happinesse. Does Dr. Sherlock think, that we shall ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy or have a <hi>sight</hi> of those perfections in God, which he has designed as a reward of our <hi>Faith,</hi> if we positively disbelieve such Divine Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as have a connexion with them? Does he think that God will ever save us, if we reject those means which he has appointed for our sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, as al do who disbelieve a Revealed Truth when there is <hi>sufficient light</hi> to know it? If he
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:108855:17"/>
not conceive this, let him grant, that the Church on Earth cannot be One with the Church in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, unlesse every Bodie and Congregation wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it is composed, concurre all alike in the same Points of Faith. And methinks a man of his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, if he will but seriously examin the Truth of them, should be wel disposed to close with me in this Conclusion. For seing in his way the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church upon Earth is composed of manie se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Bodies of Christians who are at variance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themselves, what Doctrins are Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and what not, and seing every one of them ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes to be saved by the <hi>belief</hi> of such Doctrins as they account Fundamental, it is impossible, that they should be all of them One with the Church in Heaven, unlesse the Church in Heaven be said to <hi>see</hi> Contradictions in God; becaus all these Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies if they are taken Collectively believe Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, and all of them but one must necessarily refuse to give their assent to God when he speaks to them with <hi>sufficient clearnesse.</hi> For as God has Revealed but one Truth, so he cannot propose any more than one Truth to the belief of men. Which shows the necessitie of maintaining, that such Gospel-truths as the Church in Heaven <hi>sees</hi> in God and which are <hi>sufficiently proposed</hi> to the <hi>belief</hi> of the Church on Earth, are to be found all together onely in one Congregation of Christians who are of the same denomination, which Protestants uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally denie, and which we affirme to be most
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:108855:18"/>
true of such Christians, as communicate with <hi>S. Peter's Chair</hi> all the world over.</p>
            <p n="17">17. I said above, that <hi>The Faith of the Church on Earth ought to correspond with the Vision of the Church in Heaven in all such Points as are suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently proposed to her belief;</hi> From whence the Dr. may chance to object, that one and the same Faith is not <hi>sufficiently proposed</hi> to all the disagreeing Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of Christians that compose the Catholique Church; as for example, that the Real Presence and an Unbloudie Sacrifice are not <hi>sufficiently proposed</hi> to the belief of Protestants. And therefore they may be all One among themselves and with the Church in Heaven, becaus their Faith <hi>corresponds with the Vision of the Church in Heaven in all such matters as are sufficiently proposed to them.</hi> And in case the Church in Heaven <hi>sees</hi> any thing to be true which they <hi>believe</hi> to be false, or any thing to be false which they <hi>believe</hi> to be true, this is onely in such Doctrins as are not <hi>sufficiently Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to their belief.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="18">18. I answer, that the objection would be of verv great force supposing God had made every person the <hi>Proposer</hi> of his to own Faith himselfe, and put the Scripture into our hands to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted by us according to our own private hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and fancie, and reason, without any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of conforming our judgments to any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Authoritie. But our all-wise Lawgiver who has ordained that the Faith of his Church shall be
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:108855:18"/>
but One, has taken other measures to compasse this end, than such as unauoidably tend to the making of it various and contradictorie, as may be seen below in answer to §. 22. Chap. 2. whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re I have shown the Infallibilitie of the Church, and in answer to §. 28. ib. Where I have shown it's Authoritie in a General Council or Visible Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal. And if the Dr. tell me, that neither the Infallibilitie nor Authoritie of the Church are <hi>suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently proposed</hi> to the belief of Protestants; I ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, that their disbelief of these Doctrins is no Argument at all that they are not <hi>sufficiently propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</hi> to them, as the Infidelitie of the Jews was no Argument, that our Saviour had not given them grounds <hi>sufficient</hi> to believe in him. No doubt, but the Jews would have believed in him if they had judged those Motives and Reasons whereby he proved his Mission, to have been strong, and convincing. No doubt, but they would never ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve <hi>crucified the Lord of Glorie,</hi> if they had known him to be the <hi>Lord of Glorie.</hi> But this ignorance could not excuse them from the damnable guilt of their Infidelitie, becaus it was voluntarily brought upon themselves through their spiritual pride and obduracie, which were the occasion, why those Motives and Reasons which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour made use of in order to their conversion, wanted the good effect which he designed by them. The Motives were in themselves strong and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing, but they resolved not be convinced there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:108855:19"/>
becaus they resolved to continue in their pride and obduracie which kept them from a convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Others who were of a more humble and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible temper, as the Apostles, the 70. Disciples &amp;c. and the Gentils in succeeding times, believed him to be the Messia upon the same Motives which could not prevail with the Sanedrim, and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees to give any credit to him, which clearly shows, that his Mission was <hi>sufficiently proposed</hi> to the belief of them all, altho there did not follow the same conviction in all. For what can rational<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convince one man, may as rationally convince another of equal parts and endowments, if he be as willing to be convinced. They did not know him to be <hi>the Lord of Glorie,</hi> but they ought to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve known him to be <hi>the Lord of Glorie,</hi> and the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> bloud. And therefore their ignorance became cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minally sinful, and their Infidelitie which ensued upon it, was a just forfeiture of their Union with the Church in Heaven, which <hi>saw</hi> Christ to be the Messia and the Holie One of God.</p>
            <p n="19">19. If the Dr. think fit to denie, that the Missi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Saviour was <hi>sufficiently proposed</hi> to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing Jews, let him make out, if he can, how their infidelitie was a sin. And if he grant that it was <hi>sufficiently proposed</hi> to their belief, the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is, that the <hi>sufficiencie</hi> of a <hi>proposal</hi> of a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Faith is not alwais followed with an assent and conviction of mind. And hence it is plain, that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:108855:19"/>
he cannot pretend, that the Infallibilitie and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the Catholique Church are not <hi>suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently proposed</hi> to the belief of Protestants, becaus they cannot meet with any convincing reasons that are able to persuade them that they are true, which is no more than what the Jews alledged against the Mission of the Son of God. The Motives which persuade the Authoritie of the Catholique Church are such as have continued the greatest Lights of Christianitie in the Communion of it, such as have converted millions of souls to the Faith in past Ages, and such as in the present times wherin we live, extend daily the limits of the Gospel wider and wider, and reduce the empire of Satan to a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower compasse. They seem weak onely to those who are blind, and inefficacious onely to those who are proud and wilful. Antiquitie, Universali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, Unitie, Sanctitie, Miracles &amp;c. are no trifling Arguments, but such as are able to move the most wise, the most warie, and most reflecting minds in the world. They are just and vehement presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Truth, and if men will but act according to their nature, and believe what is Credible, it is impossible but it must be their own fault, if they embrace not those Truths which they attest and point at. It is not enough to invalidate their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, that some things like Arguments may be brought against them. For what Truth was the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re ever yet so plain, against which there might not be brought some fallacious and captious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:108855:20"/>
of reasoning, which would not seem plain to some persons, particularly when they we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re engaged in an opposition by the instigation of some disorderly passion? The Sanctitie of our Saviour was called into question, becaus of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asie accesse in conversing with Publicans and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; his Temperance was censured for his being sometimes present at weddings and great dinners; and his Miracles were traduced as tho they had been done by the help of the Prince of the Devils. What excellent Inducements were these to believe in him, and how unworthily were they rejected on frivolous accounts! A meer colour will serve malice to work upon, becaus it never acts accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to reason. There is no sufficient fence against proud, perverse, and crooked Spirits, who seing all things by their own light, vilifie when they ought to esteem, envie when they ought to admire, and hate when they ought to lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve. Let Protestants be of an humble and docible disposition, and they will not want reasons to belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve the Authoritie and Infallibilitie of the Church. Let them lay aside presumption in their own abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and then they will easily see the strength of those Motives of Credibilitie which attend the Church in all she <hi>proposes.</hi> Saints and Holie men without number have been influenced by these Motives, and so may they too, if they will do their parts to dispose themselves for the attaining of Sanctitie. Men of the greatest wit and Judgment have yeelded to them, and so may they too, if
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:108855:20"/>
they wil forsake fancie, and Passion, and interest, which are bad attendants on wit, and judgment. And if they may be rationally and prudently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by them, they are under an obligation of being convinced by them, and their disbelief of those Doctrins which they recommend, will be a forfeiture of their Union with the Church in Heaven, which necessarily <hi>sees</hi> the truth of all such Doctrins as God has furnished with so man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ie powerful Motives, as are able to extort from men a rational and prudent belief of them.</p>
            <p n="20">20. As to the 2. If he mean when he sais, that <hi>the unitie of the Church does not consist in joyning to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the external and visible Acts of Worship,</hi> that it does not consist in the same Sacraments, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough has been alreadie said. For if the Unitie of the Church must consist, as we have seen, in the same Faith through all it's parts, it must needs consist in the same Sacraments which are matters of Faith, and the same Principles which evince, that there is no distinction of Faith into Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental and Non-fundamental, will prove likewi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se, that there is no distinction of Sacraments into Fundamental and Non-fundamental.</p>

Faith and Obedience are the necessarie Conditions of our admission into it, which being accompanied with suitable disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of heart give us that <hi>Right</hi> whereby we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the benefit of Christ's Sacraments. For if I am of the same Faith of the Church, and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to the Authoritie which Christ has placed therin, and not conscious to my self of any mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal sin, or in case I am conscious, if I am contrit for it, I am a pious and dutiful Child of the Church, which is the <hi>Right</hi> by which I claim the benefit of the Sacraments of the Church.

Seing they are one with me as I am one with them, the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re can be no reason why they should exclude me from a common good, which was committed to them for no other caus, but that they should dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense it to all those who have a <hi>Right</hi> to receive it.

So that the <hi>Right</hi> we have to partake of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is so absolute so long as we observe the afo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resaid Conditions, that whatever Kingdom, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,

            <p n="24">24. Let us now see whether the Unitie of the Church can subsist, altho the several Bodies and Congregations whereof it is made up, refuse the Sacraments to one another. I am persuaded, that nothing lesse than the meer force of truth and the great Authoritie which appears in Scripture, the Fathers of the Church, and Christian Principles could extort from him a concession which is so advantageous to Catholiques, as that <hi>all true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians have a Right to Communion in all true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Churches.</hi> For the Unitie of the Church which includes this common <hi>Right</hi> is onely consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent with our principles, who make the Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que Church to consist of Christians of one deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, and who are in a perfect harmonie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themselves in all matters relating to Faith, by which means all the Faithfull throughout the world have the same <hi>Right,</hi> and are under the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:108855:22"/>
Conditions of receiving the Sacraments. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras in the Protestant way, who will have the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church to result out of several Bodies and Congregations of Christians, who disagree in matters of Faith, that is, in such Points which some of them affirme to have been Revealed by God, and others again maintain to be false and erroneous, it is impossible, but that there should be as manie different <hi>Rights</hi> to give and receive the Sacraments as there are Bodies that disagree in Faith; because the children of each Bodie are not common to them all, inasmuch as they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der different Conditions of receiving the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and are onely children of thir own Bodie by professing the Faith of their own Bodie, from whom alone they have a <hi>Right</hi> (if they have any <hi>Right</hi> at all) to ask the benefit of Christ's Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

            </p>
            <p n="25">25. I'le give an instance in Catholiques and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants, and the same may serve for other disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing Bodies, as those of the Greek Church, Nestorians, Eutychians &amp;c. if this Author ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count them for Members of the Catholike Church as he does Catholiques and Protestants, and by consequence that they are <hi>true Christians,</hi> and by consequence that they have a <hi>Right to Communion in all true Christian Churches.</hi> If I who am of the

Catholique and Romain Faith, should applie my selfe to Dr. Sherlock for the Communion, he would bid me abjure the B. of Rome's Universal Headship; if to Dr. Stilling fleet, he would requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re me to quit my Worship of Saints and Images, and if to the Disciples of Dr. Tillotson, they would catechise me about Transubstantiation, and the veracitie of my senses. And as they affirme, that they have no <hi>Right,</hi> nor Power to give the Communion to one of my Faith, so neither does the Church wherof I am a Member, pretend to any <hi>Right</hi> or Power to give it to any one of their Congregations. Nay neither I nor any of my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasion can with a good Conscience ask it at their hands, as they also believe, that they cannot ask it at ours. Each of these Bodies looks on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Faith, worship, and Sacraments to be so far from appertaining to them so as to joyn in the participacion of them, that they judge it impious and profane to pretend any <hi>Right</hi> to them. And certainly nothing can be lesse mine, or more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others, than that which I positively renounce, and which I firmly believe, that I cannot challenge to be mine with a good conscience.

               </gap>fagreeing Bodies say, that their Altar belongs onely to men of their belief, shall we not say, that the Altar is theirs, if we wil not be of their belief? And it there be three Bodies who affirme this of their respective Altars, shall we not say, that each Bodie's Altars is it's own exclusively to

all others? And if each Bodie's Altar be it's own exclusively to all others, shall we not say, that there are three Altars, if there be three Bodies? And if there be three Altars, shall we not say, that there be three <hi>Rights</hi> to receive the Sacraments, and three Churches, that is, three <hi>Societies, Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> and <hi>Families</hi> of Christ Jesus.</p>
            <p n="26">26. One Chimera never comes alone: which observation in Metaphysiques we find by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to be true at present. For as great as this ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surditie is, yet it has God himselfe for it's Author, if any credit be to be given to a certain Principle of Dr. Sherlock's, which he had not in view when he granted <hi>all true Christians to haue a Right to Communion in all true Christian Churches.</hi> For he holds, that each Congregation of the pretended Reformed Church, and every individual person among them are the proper and sovereign Judges for themselves, what Doctrins are true, and what false; what are truly Revealed, and what are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely said to be Revealed. Now he cannot denie the same Priviledge to other disagreeing Bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, which if he grant, he must acknowledge, that they have as much <hi>Right</hi> to judge of Faith, and Doctrin, as he himselfe or any of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. From whence it follows, that seing the <hi>Right</hi> of giving and receiving the Sacraments is necessarily annexed to the Faith of the givers and receivers of them, these disagreeing Bodies can o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely pretend a <hi>Right</hi> to give and receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:108855:24"/>
to and from those persons whom they know to professe that Faith which they judge to be true, which to be sure will be always the same which they professe themselves. And if they have a <hi>Right</hi> of judging that their own Faith is true, and this, as Protestants will have it, by God's appointment, they must consequently have by God's appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a <hi>Right</hi> to give and receive the Sacraments o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely to and from those persons whom they hold to professe the true Faith, that is their own. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore supposing these disagreeing Bodies be three in number, there are by God's institution and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment three distinct <hi>Rights</hi> to the Sacraments, and the dispensation of them must be said to be so contracted, and limited by three distinct Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, viz three distinct Faiths, that the <hi>Right</hi> of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and receiving the Sacraments in each Bodie must terminate within themselves alone, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Members of each Bodie.</p>
            <p n="27">27. These three distinct <hi>Rights</hi> and Altars ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily infer three distinct Communions. And then let the Dr. make out <hi>the unitie of the Church whose whole mysterie,</hi> he sais ubi supra, <hi>is no more but this, that the whole Christian Church by the Institution of our Saviour is but One Church, and this One Church is One Communion, that is, One Bodie and Societie wherof all Christians are Members, and wherin they have a Right to communicate in all Christian Priviledges, and both a Right and obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to communicate in all Christian Duties.</hi> He must
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:108855:24"/>
be a very subtle discourser, if he can reconcile this Unitie of the Church with several distinct <hi>Rights</hi> to administer the Sacraments, which are nothing else, but so manie <hi>Rights</hi> whereby the disagreeing Bodies of Christians are empowred to continue in a state of disunion from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; or show how they can be <hi>One Bodie</hi> and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie,</hi> where the advantages are not common to all the Members that are said to compose it; or how that can be <hi>One Familie, Hous,</hi> and <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> in which God has appointed three distinct ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and the Overseers and Stewards of each Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie are to act so independently of the Stewards and Overseers of the other Companies, that they are not so much as obliged to follow their advice and judgment in any thing: and in which each Companie is bound under damnation to eat by it selfe, and rather to fast than to take our Lord's Bodie with any of the other Companies, so long as they persever in their own Faith, which they are commanded not to forsake whilst they believe it to be true, and not to mistrust whether it be true, whilst they are persuaded that it is so by their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate reason.</p>
            <p n="28">28. From what has been said I infer the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of the pretence, that manie disagreeing Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of Christians such as I have mentioned abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve, may be One in Fundamental Faith. For if this were so, they could not have manie distinct <hi>Rights</hi> to the Sacraments. because the <hi>Right</hi> of giving and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:108855:25"/>
receiving the Sacraments is, as I have said, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily annexed to the Faith of the givers and receivers of them, which if it be said to be Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentally One among Christians who differ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Faith and Doctrin, it must be said in like manner, that there is one common <hi>Right</hi> of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and receiving the Sacraments among them, which we find by manifest experience to be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted by the practice of those disagreeing Bodies, who all thinck it a sin to give the Sacrament to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others than those of their own Communion and belief.</p>
            <p n="29">29. As to the 3. I answer, that seing prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching is nothing else but the deliverie of God's word, and God's word is matter of Faith, as the Unitie of the Church necessarily <hi>consists in joyning together</hi> in the same Faith, so it must needs <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in joyning together</hi> to deliver and hear the same word of God.</p>
            <p n="30">30. As to the 4. If he mean by <hi>joyning in the external and visible Acts of Worship,</hi> that the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Church does not consist in the same Ceremonies, I answer, that his inference may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar a double meaning, either 1. that the Church would not be One if the same Ceremonies were not observed in all the parts of it; or 2. supposing that there are different Ceremonies allowed by the Church in different parts of it, that whoever obstinately opposes them in the places where they are practiced, does not ceas to be a Member of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:108855:25"/>
the Church altho he be excommnnicated for the same. We Catholiques do not own Ceremonies to be necessarie to the Unitie of the Church in the first of these senses, but onely in the latter, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to which my Answer proceeds.</p>
            <p n="31">31. I say therefore, that the Unitie of the Church does not consist in Ceremonies, if they are considered barely as they are in themselves; for under this consideration they are not Divine, but at most Ecclesiastical things; wheras the Unitie of the Church is supernatural, and results from Faith. The Unitie of the Church cannot consist in any Institution of her own, becaus the Church may abrogate what she has established, whenever she has as good reasons for such an abrogation, as she had for the first establishment of it. And yet she cannot destroy her own Unitie; for this were to destroy her selfe, which we are sure she cannot do, becaus of our Lord's repeated promises to her of teaching, assisting, and preserving her till the <hi>consummation of Ages.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="32">32. But if Ceremonies are considered with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the Power that has approved them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended them to our practice and veneration, they are thus become of a superiour degree to what they were, and are clothed with such a Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, that none may dare to gainsay or slight them, lest he slight the Authoritie by which they are countenanced, And we know how dangerous a thing this is from that saying of our Saviour <hi>He
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:108855:26"/>
that despises you despises me.</hi> This is no more in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect than what is acknowledged by the Church of England in the <hi>Chapter of Ceremonies</hi> before the Common-prayer Book, where it is likewise said, that neither the <hi>appointment</hi> nor <hi>alteration</hi> of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies belongs to <hi>private men</hi> (as they will ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve the choice of Faith to do), but onely to those who are <hi>authorized therunto.</hi> This new Church was very sensible of the great danger that might accrue to her, if it were lawful for <hi>private men</hi> to alter publique regulations, for which reason she has taken care to secure her selfe from such factious and innovating spirits, by prefixing in the front of her pretended Liturgie and Offices such a Rule as she had not observed her selfe, when she relinquished the Customs and Ceremonies which had been <hi>appointed</hi> by her Catholique Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, and received from her Forefathers time out of mind.</p>
            <p n="33">33. I suppose this Author who makes Bishops <hi>essential to particular Churches, and to belong to their Definition,</hi> will not denie, but that the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of particular Churches cannot withdraw themselves from obeying, and communicating with their Bishops on the account of such Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies as they allow of as decent, and which are in themselves harmlesse and innocent. For if a Bish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>op be <hi>essential to a particular Church,</hi> whoever renounces his obedience to him on the account of such harmlesse Ceremonies, renounces his Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianitie;
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:108855:26"/>
for altho Christianitie do not consist in meer Ceremonies, yet it consists in <hi>commanded</hi> Ceremonies as such, which signifies as much as if I should say, that it consists in Obedience where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Diocesans are united to their Bishops. So that particular Bishops, whom this Author <hi>In his Vindie of some Brot. Prino. &amp;c. p.</hi> 96. will have to be the proper Judges what Ceremonies are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and harmlesse in their respective Districts, may justly excommunicate all those who shal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>in, unlesse they can bring a Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration that their Commands are unlawfull. I fup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the Dr. will not say, that those who are thus excommunicated by their Bishop are One with the Church in Heaven, since a separation from Christ's Mystical Bodie is the proper effect of a just Excommunication. And if they are rightly cut off from Christ's Mystical Bodie, it follows that the Unitie of a particular Church consists <hi>in joyning together</hi> in the same Ceremonies. And if it be a necessarie condition of Communion with a particular Church to <hi>joyn together</hi> in the same Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, it must needs be a necessarie conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of communion with the Catholique Church to <hi>joyn together</hi> in the same Ceremonies of a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church. For that which makes us Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of a particular true Church necessarily ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes us Members of the Catholique Church, and that which causes a separation from a particular true Church does in like manner caus a separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:108855:27"/>
from the Catholique Church.</p>
            <p n="34">34. There still remains to examin that part of this passage wherin he sais, that the Unitie of the Church does not consist in a <hi>mutual inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course and correspondence.</hi> Which words are of so great a latitude, that I know not how to fix a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate meaning on them. Perhaps he may sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie thereby (in case they do not relate to what has been alreadie considered about the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the Church in the same Liturgie, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Preaching, and Ceremonies) that the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of the Church may subsist without those demonstrations of love, esteem, confidence, and concern for one another whether by word or acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as is usual among such as are engaged in one common Caus. And I am apt to think, that this is his meaning by the exceptions which he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes (alitle out of their order) against our <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping</hi> our Brethren of the Church in Heaven. For this <hi>Worship</hi> is a plain <hi>correspondence</hi> between us and them, and unlesse he had said something to show the unreasonablenesse of it, he could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have pretended to infer, that <hi>distant Churches on Earth</hi> might be One without any mutual <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence,</hi> becaus the Church in Heaven and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arth are One without it.</p>
            <p n="35">35. If this be his meaning, I answer, that where there are no such reciprocal expressions of Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse among distant Churches, we may presume that Faith and Charitie are wanting to some of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:108855:27"/>
them; for Faith is operative and so is Charitie too. And where we may presume these vertues to be wanting, we may presume that there is not One Church, as where we feel no heat we presume there is no fire.</p>
            <p n="36">36. As to what he sais against onr <hi>Worship</hi> of Saints, whereby he insinuates, that there is no <hi>mutual correspondence</hi> between the Church in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and the Church on Earth, the nullitie of it appears from this, becaus he forms his Arguments from the equivocation that lies in the word <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi> which he honestly takes in the wrong sense. He cannot be ignorant, and our Authors have put him in mind of it an hundred times over, that the word <hi>worship</hi> may either signifie the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Honour which is due to God alone; or else an inferiour Honour which may be given to a pure creature. Thus God alone is <hi>worshipful</hi> as the word <hi>worship</hi> is taken in the first sense, and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices of Peace are <hi>worshipful</hi> as the word <hi>worship</hi> is taken in the latter sense. the nature of <hi>Humane acts</hi> is measured from their tendencie to their respec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Objects, and not from their names, which many times are doubtfull, and suggest such No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as are essentially distinct. Thus the H. Ghost sais <hi>To God alone be Honour and Glorie,</hi> in which saying the words <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Glorie</hi> must be so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, as to signifie the <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Glorie</hi> which is due to God alone; so that the meaning of the Text be, that we ought to give to God alone that
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:108855:28"/>
               <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Glorie</hi> which are due to him alone. For <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Clorie</hi> may be given to Kings likewise, and to other great Personages upon Earth 1. <hi>Pet. Chap.</hi> 2. And as in this case the Dr. must explicate the word <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Glorie</hi> after our way, when he meets with a Quaker who imputes it as a cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me to him, and a transgression of the aforesaid Text, that he <hi>Honours</hi> his Superiours here upon Earth: so I hope he will not take it amisse, if we also explicate the word <hi>worship,</hi> when we are charged with a breach of the first Commandment by <hi>worshipping</hi> our betters in Heaven.</p>
            <p n="37">
               <hi>37. Hence the weaknesse of the Drs. discourse is visible. He sais 1. that</hi> it is as absurd to Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship the Saints in Heaven, as for one Member of the same Bodie on Earth to Worship another, becaus they are the same Bodie still, and tho there is a great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in honour between the Members of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ame Bodie, yet the relation that is between them will not admit of the Worship of any Member. For it is no Act of Communion in the same Bodie for one Member to Worship another.</p>
            <p n="38">38. I answer to this, that we may very lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly <hi>Worship the Saints in</hi> Heaven, if there be no greater absurditie by so doing, than <hi>for one Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the same Bodie on Earth to worship another.</hi> For are we not tied by God's Commands to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <hi>worship</hi> them in that sense wherin I have said that <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>worship</hi> are the same thing. Neither can it be any inconvenience to this <hi>worship</hi> of our betters upon Earth, that we are <hi>Members of the same Bodie,</hi> seing, as the Dr. sais, <hi>there is a great difference in honour between the Members of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me Bodie,</hi> for which reason <hi>the relation that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them will admit of one Member's Worshipping,</hi> that is, honouring <hi>another.</hi> Nay <hi>it is an Act of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in the fame</hi> Civil <hi>Bodie for one Member to worship,</hi> that is, to honour <hi>another,</hi> and in a sort necessarie to humane Societie, which being knit and compacted together by the subordination of Inferiours to their Superiours and betters, cannot wel susist without Inferiours <hi>worshipping,</hi> that is, honouring their Superiours and betters, which is a means of continuing them in their dutie to them, as being an acknowledgment of the distance they ought to keep from them, and of the service they ow unto them.</p>
            <p n="39">39. The Dr. may replie, that the word <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> is not in use, when we signifie the honour and respect which we show our superiours and betters upon Earth, but onely when we give to God the honour which is due to him.</p>
            <p n="40">40. I Answer, that it is in use in the H. Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as 1. Chron.

We read it likewise 1. Kings Ch. 25. where A bigail is said to have <hi>worshippeed</hi> David, as likewi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> Gen. Ch. 24. where Joseph's Brethren are said to have <hi>worshipped</hi> him. Which passages the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Bible renders so as to denote that Abigail and Joseph's Brethren bowed themselves to the ground; which altho we should grant to be a true translation in all respects, yet seing Protes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, whenever we bow our selves to a Saint be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Image, call this action by the name of <hi>worship,</hi> there is no reason why Abigail should be denied to have <hi>worshipped</hi> David, or Ioseph's Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren to have <hi>worshipped</hi> him, when they bowed themselves to the ground before them. In Latin the case is plain, for the word <hi>colo</hi> which answers the English word <hi>worship,</hi> is indifferently used to expresse the honour which we give to God, or man. So is likewise the word <hi>veneror,</hi> which sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies the same thing. Neither are we wholly stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to it in England, as when we say a <hi>worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi> Knight, and give to a Iustice of Peace the same epithete, which corresponds with the Latin words <hi>Colendissimus</hi> and <hi>venerabilis,</hi> And altho the use of it be not so common among us as that of <hi>honour, respect,</hi> or <hi>Veneration,</hi> yet there is no reason why we should not allow it as great a latitude as it has in Latin, whenever the rarenesse of it's use is turned to our disadvantage, seing we know in our souls and consciences (which are the Reposito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Prototypes of words) that we signifie
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:108855:29"/>
thereby no honour which is due to God alone, but such an one as may be paid to a finit Object. If the vulgar language of this Nation were Latin, or the Dr. had writ his Treatise in the same ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, he must have left out most of what he has written against our <hi>worship</hi> of the Church in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. For certainly he that owns it to be lawful to <hi>colere</hi> or to <hi>worship</hi> men with an inferiour ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, would blush to maintain it to be unlawful to <hi>colere,</hi> or to <hi>worship</hi> the Church in Heaven with the like honour. Which is an evident Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that what he sais at present is of no great moment; for what is good reason in one language cannot fail to be so in another.</p>
            <p n="41">41. But the Dr. may enquire, whether I am in good earnest when I say that the word <hi>worship</hi> signifies no more when we honour the Church in Heaven, than when we honour our superiours and betters upon Earth? I answer, that for what concerns the Controversie that is between Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques and Protestants about our <hi>worship</hi> of the Church in Heaven, the signification of that word is exactily the same in both cases. For the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between us and them is, whether we give not to the Church in Heaven some Honour which is due onely and proper to God (and in case this be not the question at present, it is ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for Dr. Sherlock to say, that it is <hi>absurd</hi> to worship our Fellow-members in Heaven with an inferiour Honour)? To which question we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that our <hi>worship</hi> of the Church in Heaven
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:108855:30"/>
supposes them to be Creatures, as much as the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour we give to our superiours and betters upon Earth supposes them to be Creatures. And so the word <hi>worship</hi> suits exactly with our superiours and betters on Earth and the Church in Heaven, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus we believe them to be Creatures both alike, and not to deserve any honour that is due to God alone.</p>
            <p n="42">42. But notwithstanding this, our Divines af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that the word <hi>worship</hi> as it is applied to the Church in Heaven, imports an honour of a higher Nature than when it is applied to our superiours, and betters on Earth (and so it fares likewise with the word <hi>colo,</hi>) becaus honour is diversified ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the diversitie of excellence in the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. Wherefore seing the state of the Church in Heaven by means of it's perfect Union with God and fruition of him, is of an incomparablie greater excellence than our Superiours and betters upon Earth whether Ecclesiastical or Civil, hence it is they say, that the word <hi>worship</hi> as it is applied to the Church in Heaven, has a special difference of it's own whereby it is distinguished from the <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> of our superiours on Earth. Which special Difference can afford the Doctor no advantage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us, becaus it is occasioned onely by the Preheminence which the Church in Heaven has over our superiours and betters upon Earth, which he cannot denie. He may in like manner, if he pleases, affirme that the honour which is due to Kings is different from that which is paid to any
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:108855:30"/>
of their subjects, and give this reason for it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus as the Dignitie of a King is incommunicable to any of his subjects, so the honour which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends this Dignitie as a shadow follows a Bodie, ought to be so far his as not to appertain to any of his subjects, no more than the shadow of his bodie does to theirs. I say if he affirme this I know of no bodie that can reasonablie be angrie with him, or judge him to be Heterodox for so doing, whether his opinion be tru or false, or the reason whereby he proves it be of great or small mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p n="43">43. Neither do our Divines onely diversifie the <hi>worship</hi> of the Church in Heaven from the <hi>worship</hi> of our superiours on Earth, but they diversifie like -wise the <hi>worship</hi> of the B. Virgin both from the <hi>worship</hi> of the rest of the Church in Heaven, and of our Superiours on Earth. For altho she be a Creature as much as any Member of the Church in Heaven, and our superiours on Earth, nay as much as a pismire on Earth, and that under this consideration the word <hi>worship</hi> suits as wel with any Member of the Church in Heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and with our Superiours on Earth as it does to her; yet by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of her being the Mother of God, and becaus she is placed immediately after God by means of this Grace, Divines assigne her such an honour as is answerable to so great a Dignitie, which they expresse by the name of <hi>Hyperdulia,</hi> wheras they call the <hi>worship</hi> of the other Saints by the name
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:108855:31"/>
of <hi>Dulia.</hi> And as they assign to the B. Virgin a <hi>worship</hi> different from the rest of the Saints, so whoever pleases may hold that different <hi>worships,</hi> or rather different degrees of <hi>worship,</hi> which are inferiour to the supreme Honour which is due to God alone, belong to the several degrees of the Hierarchical Orders of Spirits in Heaven, altho there want words whereby to expresse them.</p>
            <p n="44">44. What is here said concerning the distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in our <hi>worships</hi> of the Church in Heaven is not mentioned, as tho the Catholique Church were engaged to make it all good, she having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared her selfe no further, than that we ought to <hi>worship</hi> the Church in Heaven, and that it is <hi>good and profitable</hi> to invoke them, and crave their as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance, and left it to the consideration of learned men, whether the <hi>worship</hi> of the B. Virgin be specifically distinct from that of the other Saints. VVe never entertain our selves wich any such thoughts as these when we make our application to them, neither do our Priests when they ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techise the ignorant, take care to instruct them in such niceties, which conduce litle or nothing to their salvation. Neither is it material to know, whether this <hi>worship</hi> may be called <hi>Religious,</hi> or no No doubt, but that it is not properly <hi>Religious</hi> as neither is it Divine, becaus <hi>Religion</hi> has God for it's immediate object. But in a loos sense it may be called <hi>Religious,</hi> becaus of the near relation which the Saints have to God, and becaus we di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:108855:31"/>
our prayers to them, that we may the more easily save our souls by the enjoyment of God who is our last end. This <hi>worship</hi> may be called <hi>Religious</hi> much after the same manner as Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies are called <hi>Acts of worship,</hi> becaus of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and dependance on the immediate Acts of God's worship, and becaus they further and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the same.</p>
            <p n="45">45. Thus much I have thought fit to say, to remove the odium which Protestants have annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the very terms of <hi>worship of Saints.</hi> What harme is there now in them after this explication? Can any one discover any thing here which may justifie the Drs. Assertion, that our <hi>Worship of Saints is a contradiction to the belief of One Church?</hi> Cannot we <hi>worship</hi> the Church in Heaven and be One with them, as wel as <hi>worship</hi> our superiours on Earth, and be One with them.</p>
            <p n="46">46. The Dr. may replie, No; becaus our <hi>worship of Saints</hi> does not onely import an honour which we do them, but includes likewise our Invocation of them.</p>
            <p n="47">47. What if it does? Must we needs break off Union with the Church in Heaven, becaus we addresse our prayers to them to pray to God for us? This is all that is meant by our Doctrin of Invocation of Saints, notwithstanding the slie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of some men to persuade the people to the contrarie, by calling it <hi>formal Invocation,</hi> as tho there lay an Idolatrical malice under these
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:108855:32"/>
terms, and an injurie to God. It is an unquestio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable truth, that Christians upon Earth may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend themselves to one another's prayers, and daily experience teaches, that Protestants <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally Invocate,</hi> or pray their Ministers to pray for them, as often as they find themselves under any great affliction of mind or bodie, as believing their intercessions with God to be more efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than their own prayers. Now it seems very strange, that such an application to Ministers should be harmlesse and laudable in Protestants and yet that our addresses to the Church in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven should be so criminallie evil in us, as to make us lose our Union with it, when we are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that the Saints are free from sin, and in all things conformable to the Divine pleasure, and we may presume, that they want neither power nor will to promote our requests with God, as often as they conduce to his glorie.</p>
            <p n="48">48. I am told in answer to this, that the case is very plain, why the practice of Protestants is very good, and ours erroneous, becaus their Ministers are present with them, and the Church in Heaven are at a great distance from us.</p>
            <p n="49">49. I haue often wondred at this common an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to a difficultie so wel grounded as that which I have proposed. For what has distance or presen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> to do with the injurie to God wherwith we a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> charged by our Invocation of Saints? Or ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> can they contribute any thing towards the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:108855:32"/>
or forfeiture of our union with the Church in Heaven? The onely inconvenience which may be pretended to be drawn with any kind of colour against our Doctrin to our prejudice is, that it is a sillie thing to pray to the Saints who are at a great distance from us, which were it true, is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to prove it to be a wicked thing. I suppose if any Protestant at London should desire the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Ambassador's Chaplain at the Hague to pray for him, as we desire the Saints to pray for us, he would not be censured by those of his Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, as tho he had forfeited his Union with the Church in Heaven by making such a prayer, but onely will passe among them for a mad man, which they cannot affirm of us when we pray to the Saints, as we shall see presently. Wherefore if it be no crime in Protestants to pray their Ministers to pray for them, it can be no crime in us to pray the Church in Heaven to pray for us. For in nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther case is there any honour given to a Creature which is due to God alone, it being certain, that we Catholiques do no more believe the Saints we pray to from the highest to the lowest to be Gods, or fit objects for Divine honour, than Protestants believe the same of their Ministers. Nay our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin in the very terms supposes there is but one God, and that all the Saints in Heaven are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant on him, seing our prayers to them to pray to God for us, supposes the right of gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our petitions to be solely in God, and all the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:108855:33"/>
power they have of being beneficial to us to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on his good pleasure.</p>
            <p n="50">50. Those Protestants who grant with the Catholik Church, that God has appointed Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian Angels to every one of us in this our Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage, to be assistant to us and to be the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seers of our lives and actions, should have no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie, one would think, to hold it lawful for us to beg their intercessions with God in our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe. For in this suppofition they are as much present to us, as we are to one another. And what imaginable pretence can there be, that we offer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny injurie to God by begging the assistance of his Favourits, whom he has deputed to us to take care of our spiritual concerns? Tis incredible, that we can offend him by holding corresponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce with our companions, guides, and Tutors. He speaks to us by their means: why may not we speak to him again sometimes by the same way? why may we not thank them for their good offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and desire their continuance of them? Can any one think, that God commands, or allows of ingratitude towards Angels, when he forbids it towards men?</p>
            <p n="51">51. We read in the acts of the Apostles Ch. 16. of a Vision which S. Paul had, wherin we may discover a plain <hi>correspondence</hi> between An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and the Church on Earth. For there appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to him v. 9. <hi>A man of Macedon</hi> who <hi>prayed him saying, passe over into Macedonia, and help us.</hi>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:108855:33"/>
We may reasonably conclude, that the Spirit, who is here called <hi>a Man of Macedon</hi> was the Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian Angel of that Countrie. <hi>Help us,</hi> said the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel to S. Paul, that is, <hi>help</hi> the poor Macedonians by removing their blindnesse by mea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of thy prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching; and <hi>help</hi> me in the discharge of my dutie of providing for their good which manner of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is in use among us towards the Church in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. For thus we <hi>pray</hi> to S. Paul, <hi>saying, help us,</hi> our parents, brethren, and relations, and all that stand in need of thy assistance upon Earth. And as the Angel <hi>prayed</hi> not to S. Paul to <hi>help</hi> the Macedoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans whilst he was in the world, but onely inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as he was an instrument of the Divine Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, so neither do we <hi>pray</hi> to him now he is in Heaven for any other reason. For we hold, that the <hi>help</hi> which we receive from him by his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession proceeds no lesse from God's mercie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, than the <hi>help</hi> which the Macedonians received by his preaching. Thus we see an Angel become a suppliant to a man and <hi>praying for help,</hi> which is a terme which gives so much offence to Protestants when they read it in any of our Devotions to Saints. The Dr. will be hard put to it to give a satisfactorie reason, why it would have been a crime in S. Paul to have <hi>prayed</hi> the Angel to intercede with God for the good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of his preaching, when it was no crime in the Angel to <hi>pray</hi> him to preach to the Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians. If then the <hi>worship</hi> and Invocation of our
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:108855:34"/>
Guardian Angels be no forfeiture of our Union with the Church in Heaven, it can be said with as litle reason that the Invocation of any other Angel, or Saint in Heaven implies a crime of so heinous a nature.</p>
            <p n="52">52. As to the scruple of Protestants, which way the Saints in Heaven hear, or understand that we pray to them; I answer, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not know that we pray to them, or any thing else that passes in this world by vertue of any natural perfections which they have. Altho the lavvfulnesse of their Invocation be a sacred Truth amongst us, yet it is a matter of Dispute, which way they come to know our Prayers, whether they see the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the Divine Essence wherin they mav see all creatures, or whether they are conveyed to them by the Ministrie of our Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian Angels, or other Spirits, God having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed from our knowledge manie things rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the government of this world by his invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fible Agents. It is enough for us, that the Saints may know our prayers either of these ways, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being sollicitous which way it is; and the Authoritie of the Catholique Church which has always believed Invocation of Saints, ought with better reason to persuade us to continue in the profession of this Doctrin, than the uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie we lie under about the particular way that the Saints hear us, ought to withdraw us from the practice and belief of it.</p>
            <p n="53">
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:108855:34"/>
53. We are assured by S. John in his Revelat. Ch. 5. that <hi>the four Beasts, and the four and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Elders fell down before the Lamb, having eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one harps, and golden vialls full of odours, which were the Prayers of the Saints,</hi> that is, of the Saints on Earth; for the felicitie of the Saints in Heaven is complete, and they stand in no need of each others assistance, seing they all enjoy God in whom the fullnesse of all good things is. Now our Doctrin is, that the <hi>four and twentie El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> at this day <hi>fill their vials</hi> with the <hi>prayers of the Saints</hi> after the very same manner as they did when S. John saw them <hi>full,</hi> and that it is altogether as unreasonable to doubt, whether they hear our prayers when we addresse them to them, becaus we cannot positively say, which way they come to hear them, as it is to doubt, whether their <hi>vials</hi> were <hi>full of prayers</hi> in S. John's time, becaus neither he nor any of his Brethren have left upon record, which way they came to be <hi>full.</hi> You may see in the 8. Chap. ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther relation how an Angel offered to God the prayers of the Saints.</p>
            <p n="54">54. There are two passages in Scripture which Protestants particularly urge against our <hi>worship of Saints.</hi> The 1. is out of the same Book of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations Ch. 19. and Ch. 22. where we read that S. John who would have <hi>worshipped</hi> an Angel, was forbidden by him to do so, and ordered to <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship God.</hi> They stand in great need of Arguments
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:108855:35"/>
who will make use of this place against us. For it is plain our of the reason which the Angel gave why he refused this <hi>worship,</hi> that S. John took him to be God, and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>re it is no wonder, if the Angel a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>pted not that <hi>worship</hi> from him which was cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> to God alone. <hi>See thou do it not,</hi> said the Angel, <hi>for I am thy fellow servant,</hi> which shows that S. John took him for the Creatour and Lord of all things. Otherwise the Angel would never have given such a reason why he should not <hi>worship him.</hi> For seing it is very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the Gospel for inferiours to honour their betters, we cannot presume, that the Angel would have given such a reason as destroys this precept of Christianitie. For if it be not lawful to <hi>worship</hi> an Angel, becaus he is our <hi>fellow servant,</hi> or fellow creature, it must needs be unlawful to <hi>worship</hi> or honour men, who are as much our fellow creatures as Angels, nay who by means of the inequalitie of their natural perfections are at a greater distance from God than Angels are. I do not see how any Protestants who hold it lawfull to honour their betters on Earth, can hold it unlawful to fal down, as S. John did, at the feet of an Angel of peace who should appear to them. Nay natural reason assures us, that it would be a sin, and a great irreverence to show him no respect, or do him no kind of <hi>worship,</hi> conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Dignitie and excellence of his nature and person, and the incomprehensible greatnesse of God
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:108855:35"/>
without whose order he could not make them a visit. When we honour our betters we practice humilitie, which the Angel knew to be a vertue very pleasing to an Incarnate God, and therefore he would never have forbidden the exercise of it in S. John for such a reason, as makes the most visible demonstration of it impracticable among Christians. Quakers need never desire a stronger Argument than this Text to justifie their unman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerlie behaviour towards their superiours and betters, if it be once granted them, that an Angel refused an inferiour <hi>worship</hi> and honour from S. John, becaus he was his <hi>fellow servant</hi> and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Creature.</p>
            <p n="55">55. If then the Angel did not forbid S. John to give him an inferiour honour and <hi>worship,</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants cannot gather from this passage any thing that may tend to the prejudice of our Doctrin of the <hi>worship</hi> of Saints; for all the <hi>worship</hi> we allow them is such an honour as may be given to creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res without any disrespect to the Creatour. And if they can prove, that S. John committed Idolatrie, we condemne him for it as much as the Angel. But there is no great fear of effecting this any further, than that he committed <hi>material</hi> Idolatrie, that is to say, that if he had known, or could have known, that the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>rfon with whom he conversed was not God, he would have been a downright Idolater in giving him the honour which was due to God alone, which is a crime we can never suppose the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:108855:36"/>
Apostle to have been guiltie of. For we may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume, that whilst he was in these Visions, his mind was filled with thoughts relating to the Glorie, Power, and Majestie of his beloved Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and that he had a more clear and perfect knowledge of a God, and of One God by means of those wonderful things that were revealed to him, than all mankind can possibly have by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural discourse, which being joyned together with the Faith which he had in our Lord, can leave no room for a reasonable suspicion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he adored something for God, which he knew or could know to be a creature; particularly considering, that during the time of his Visions, he was freed from all sensible distractions and suggestions of the enemie, and his understanding was wholiy taken up with the regalos of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. His love of God could never grow lesse fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorous by the more Graces that were heaped on him, nor his Faith lesse lively by finding experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally that several particulars of it were true. Which considerations put it out of all doubt, that as long as he was in this state, the libertie of his will was so far abridged, and limited to what was good, that he could not possibly prevaricate so far from his Creatour, as to renounce him by preferring a creature before him, or equalling a creature to him.</p>
            <p n="56">56. But letus suppose now, that S. John knew the Spirit with whom he conversed to be an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:108855:36"/>
yet it will not follow from hence, that the reprehension of the Angel imports a sinfulnesse in the <hi>worship</hi> which S. John gave him. For why might not the Angel refuse to be <hi>worshipped</hi> by S. John becaus of the Dignitie of his Apostolique Character, and the honour which humane nature had attained to by the Incarnation of the Son of God? And why might not S. Iohn continue to offer it to him as he did the second time, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding this refusal, becaus of the excellence of the Angel's nature, and the honour which he had of being a perpetual attendant on the Lamb.</p>

            <p n="63">63. For my part upon a serious consideration of the context of this Epistle till the verse under debate and some verses following, it seems ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely probable to me, that S. Paul reflects not onely upon the Jews for endeavouring to draw the Colossians to Judaisme which is evident in this Chapter, but also for endeavouring to persuade them to that Superstitious <hi>worship of Angels</hi> which is here condemned; not that I think this to have been the general judgment of the Jews of those times, but onely of a certain sect of them, who having left the true Tradition of their Forefathers about the <hi>worship of Angels,</hi> embraced this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veltie through their presumptuous speculations and enquiries into the nature, perfections, and properties of these spirits, and (what is worse) perhaps into the Nature and Attributes of God. Which I hold to be S. Paul's meaning when he sais, that these seducers <hi>intruded into those things which they had not seen, and were vainly puffed up by their fleshly mind,</hi> pride being always the main encourager of those who eagerly desire, that their groundlesse and airie Notions should passe for truths and demonstrations. I believe likewise, that he points at the same thing when v. 8. he bids the Colossians to have a care of being <hi>decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

by Philosophie</hi> (by which Theodoret under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands <hi>probabilem &amp; ad persuadendum aptam Oratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem)</hi> that is, by captious and surprizing Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that were made according to the direction of Artificial Logique, and turned against any Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of the Faith which they had received, as for example, against the lawful <hi>worship of Angels;</hi> which he sufficiently declares by calling this Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophie or arguments <hi>vain fallacies according to the Tradition of men, and the Principles of worldlie sciences, but not according to</hi> the Principles of Faith which were delivered hy <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="64">64. But I dare not venture to hold with Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doretus, that these Jews caused a Heresie and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision in the Church, seing Scripture is silent in this case, and Ecclesiastical Historie and Tradition too, which are the onely Principles which we can certainly relie on for the knowledge of any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of fact of this nature which is said to have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in passed Ages. However I am contented at present to take no further notice of the excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which Baronius makes against the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of this Father in this case, nor of what he sais to prove, that the Canon of the Council of Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicea underwritten does not relate to this preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Heresie, as Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

the force of unsuspected Historie. And by reason I have no Greek Authors by me in the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances I am under at present, and cannot easily procure them, I shall relate Theodoret's words out of the Latin Version which are these. <hi>Qui legem defendebant eos etiam ad Angelos colendos inducebant, dicentes fuisse legem per eos datam. Mansit autem diu hoc vitium in Phrygia &amp; Pisidia. Quocirca Synodus quoque quae convenit Laodiceae, quae est Phrygiae Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis, lege prohibuit ne precarentur Angelos. Et in hodiernum usque diem licet videre apud illos &amp; fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timos Oratoria S. Michaelis.

Those,</hi> sais he, <hi>who stood in defence of the Law induced them also to worship Angels, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Law was given by them. This vice has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for a long time in Phrygia and Pisidia. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore the Synod which assembled at Laodicea, which is the Metropolis of of Phrygia, forbad them by a Law to pray to Angels. And even to this day there are Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories of S. Michael to be seen among them and their borderers. They therefore advised them to this</hi> (to pray to Angels <hi>) making use of the pretence of humilitie, saying, that the God of the universe is invisible, incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehens<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:108855:40"/>
               <hi>Council of Laodicea which runs thus:</hi> Non opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tet Chrisiianos derelicta Ecclesia abire, &amp; ad Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los Idololatriae abominandae congregationes facere: quae omnia interdict a sunt.

Chtistians, <hi>sais the Council,</hi> ought not to forsake the Church, and go away, and hold Assemblies of abominable Idolatrie towards Angels: which are things forbidden. Whoever therefore is found to be addicted to this secret Idolatrie, let him be Anathema, becaus he has forsaken our Lord Iesus Christ the Son of God, and gone over to Idols.</p>
            <p n="65">65. I suppose these two Authorities are plain enough too <hi>till men begin to play tricks with them,</hi> that is, till we show that they are impertinently urged against us, which is no hard matter to do. For it is evident, that the <hi>worship of Angels</hi> which the Iews advised the Colossians to was inconsistent with the Mediatorship of our Saviour, which they placed in Angels exclusively to him. <hi>The Law was given by Angels,</hi> say they; and therefore An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are to be our Mediators with God. God spoke to Mofes by an Angel; and therefore we ought to treat with God by Angels too. God is <hi>invisible;</hi> and therefore we must pray to Angels, that we may have a sight of him. God is <hi>incomprehensible;</hi> and therefore it must be by the prayers of Angles, that we come to know what he is. God is <hi>inacces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible;</hi> and therefore we must have accesse to him
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:108855:40"/>
by Angels. All which Inferences from a Jews mouth ought to be taken so as to exclude the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of Christ, whom this perverse generation will not allow to be our Mediator with God on any account or consideration whatsoever. And as they destroy the Mediation of Christ, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>o they prove it unlawful for Christians to pray to him, seing he is God as wel as man. Which may serve for a main reason, why the Canon sais, that these superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Worshippers</hi> of Angels <hi>forsook our Lord Iesus Christ the Son of God.</hi> I do not at all wonder, that the Canon calls this <hi>worship</hi> a <hi>secret Idolatrie,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus it substitutes Angels in the place of Christ, who in consequence of his Incarnation, and as <hi>Head</hi> of the Church, has it for an incommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble prerogative to be the supreme Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his Father and the Faithfull. And altho the pretence of this <hi>secret idolatrie</hi> be <hi>humilitie</hi> arising from the consideration of God's Perfections as his being <hi>invisible,</hi> and <hi>incomprehensible,</hi> yet in realitie it destroys the very foundation of Christianitie, (which true humilitie cannot do), by making God <hi>inaccessible</hi> even to such souls as are the most pious, most innocent, and most affectionate to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, for want of Goodnesse to hear their prayers if they are immediately directed to him. I say <hi>for want of Goodnesse;</hi> for if it be an act of boldnesse and presumption in us to make our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate addresses to him becaus of this pretcnded <hi>inaccessibilitie,</hi> what is become of that Love and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:108855:41"/>
Goodnesse which according to the Gospel inclined him to send his beloved Son into the world to take our nature upon him, and together with our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture all our frailties that were purely natural? which consideration leads me to say, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ascribes to God such an <hi>inaccessibilitie</hi> as this, must in consequence of this Principle hold that Christ was not God, seing the same <hi>invisibilitie, incomprehensibilitie,</hi> and <hi>inaccessibilitie</hi> which in this opinion of the Jews hinder God from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versing and treating immediately with the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, will prove <hi>a fortiori,</hi> that God could not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>base himselfe so low as to be <hi>made Flesh,</hi> becaus by his Incarnation he communicated to human nature the aforesaid Attributes of <hi>invisibilitie, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cemprehensibilitie,</hi> and <hi>inaccessibilitie</hi> together with the <hi>fulnesse of the Divinitie,</hi> as S. Paul sais in this Chapter, <hi>in ipso inhabitat omnis plenitudo Divinita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis corporaliter,</hi> which is certainly a condescension infinitly lower than to receive immediately by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe the prayers and petitions of men.</p>
            <p n="66">66. None of all these horrible blasphemies and absurdities can be charged upon our <hi>worship of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</hi> For as we acknowledge God to be essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <hi>invisible,</hi> and <hi>incomprehensible,</hi> so we confesse him to be essentially Good, which according to the Gospel engages him to treat us immediately by himselfe, when ever we make our addresses to him in his Son's name, for whose sake alone he bestows his graces and favours on us, being ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorously
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:108855:41"/>
               <hi>inaccessible</hi> to all such as sue to him by any other means, or ways whatsoever. And altho we hold it lawful to pray to Angels as wel as to his Son (as the Church has practised in all Ages) yet we make the intercessions of Angels to be no other than Appendixes of his Son's Mediation (which we say likewise of our intercessions for one another here upon Earth), in as much as the efficacie of their prayers has a necessarie connexion with our cooperation with the Graces which Christ has merited for us by his Passion, and an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute dependance on the Mediation of Christ, which we never forsake at the very time that we crave the intercession of Angels. Nay when we pray to them, we implicitly beg the Mediation of Christ, becaus we steadfastly believe, that no petitions will be granted in Heaven, whether they are of Angels, or of Blessed souls, or of holie men upon Earth without the application of Christ's Merits to this purpose, which he as our Redeemer, and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Mediator can onely effectually procure his Eternal Father to accept. Angels may present our petitions in Heaven, but it must be Christ who takes them, and tenders them to his Father. Angels are no more than Honourable Officers attending in that Court, who according to the measures of God's Providence over his Church are enabled to speak a good word for us, but if their plea be not seconded, and promoted by our Saviour, all they can say signifies nothing with his Father.</p>
            <p n="67">

manner to <hi>forsake our Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> and to <hi>go over to Idols,</hi> becaus they gave to Angels that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Mediatorship which was due to Christ alone. And it is moreover proved out of the 9.

Neither do we assemble therin once, or twice, or fiue times in a year, but we celebrate many festival days in them; nay we meet here several times in the day to sing prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to the God of the Martyrs. Those who are in good

Those who are barren beg chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren here, and those who have children alreadie, pray that they may enjoy them in safetie. Those who are to begin a journey, ask of the Martyrs to be their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions or rather their guides, and those who are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned safe, give them thanks, and acknowledge the favour which they have received; not that they judge that they have recourse to them as to Gods, but as to divine <hi>(glorified)</hi> men, to crave their intercession with God for them. Now that those who ask with devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Faith have their petitions granted, is evident from the Guifts which such as have madeVows bring in acknowledgment of their cures. For some hang up eys, others hands and feet made in gold and silver. <hi>If this passage, do not contain the exact Doctrin of the Roman Church at present touching the invocation and</hi> worship <hi>of Saints, I am yet to seek for a due in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of my Faith in this particular. And if it do contain this Doctrin, it is a vain attempt to cite Theodoretus against our</hi> worship of Angels, <hi>which comes recommended to us by the same Authoritie of Scripture, the same conveyance of Tradition, and the same congruities of reason as the other, and whatsoever may be said to the prejudice of the one will have the same force against the other Doctrin, as for example, if playing to Angels be a</hi> forsaking of Christ <hi>and a</hi> secret Idolatrie, <hi>praying to Saints will be so too, and the same course may be taken</hi>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:108855:44"/>
with all other Arguments, and Objections that are made against either of them.</p>
            <p n="69">69. Now I infer from what has been said, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Theodoretus affirms of the Council of Laodicea, that it forbid the Colossians <hi>to pray to Angels,</hi> he did not mean, that they should not pray at all to them, but onely that they should not pray to them after a superstitious manner as their onely Mediators, which is the overthrow of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, and a <hi>forsaking of Christ</hi> and <hi>cleaving to Idols.</hi> And when he sais, that in his time there were <hi>Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories to be seen of S. Michael in Phrygia and Pisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> we are not to understand him, as tho he sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnified thereby, that it was a devotion proper to Heretiques alone to erect Oratories in honour of S. Michael and other Angels (for he who allows of great and magnificent Temples of Martyrs, can never account it an Antichristian practice to build Oratories in honour of Angels, provided this be done according to the Rule of the Catholique Faith, and without any encroachment made upon that Honour wich is due to God alone), but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that those Oratories were still remaining in those parts, and frequented by Heretiques, which had been erected in former times for the supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious <hi>worship</hi> which I have declared. If the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pleas to consult Baronius in the place which I have cited above, he will find mention made of a great manie Churches which were built in the East by Catholiques, as likewise in other parts of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:108855:44"/>
the Church in honour of Angels, and in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar that S. Michael was honoured by the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of Colosse with a sumptuous Church, and a solemne annual devotion by reason of some illus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious wonders which he wrought among this People, which we ought to ascribe to the special Providence of God, who was pleased by Miracles to confirme the Catholique Faith about the true <hi>worship of Angels</hi> in the same place, where this <hi>worship</hi> was turned into a most detestable and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous practice by Heretiques, in case there ever were any such Heretiques, as Theodoretus affirms there were.</p>

            <p n="71">71. I answer, that this is a heavie charge; but who are those that <hi>pay Divine Honours</hi> and <hi>erect Temples and Altars to Saints</hi> as to the Proprietors of them? Not Catholiques. And this Author knows as much, or (what is as bad in a slanderer) he may know as much. The chief and principal end which we propose to our selves in the <hi>erection of Temples and Altars</hi> is the glorie of God, to whom alone we offer the dreadfull Sacrifice of our Lord's Bodie Neither do we, as the Council of Trent has observed with S. Augustin, say in the Masse, <hi>I offer this Sacrifice to thee, Peter, or to thee, Paul,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:108855:45"/>
but giving thanks to God for their victories we implore their Patronage, that they whom we commemorate on Earth will vouchsafe to intercede for us in Heaven.</hi> We offer Sacrifice onely to God in acknowldg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his supreme Dominion over us and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation for our sins: and seing it is evident, that we do not make Peter, or Paul, or any other Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Church in Heaven to be God or Gods, it is a plain case, that their honour cannot be our ultimate end in the <hi>erection of Temples.</hi> For we <hi>erect</hi> Temples principally for the sake of Altars, and seing the ultimate end of Altars and Sacrifices is the Glorie of God, the ultimate end of our Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples must be so too.</p>
            <p n="72">72. Tis true we erect <hi>Temples and Altars</hi> to God <hi>in honour of the Saints,</hi> which is far different from giving them Divine honours. For the honour we do the Saints when we frequent the Temples and Altars which bear their names is to beg their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession, which, as I have said, supposes them to be Creatures; to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p n="73">73. When we <hi>erect a Temple or an Altar</hi> to God in honour of S.

It was an Argument of great power and goodnesse in God, to fortifie the soul of a poor frail, changeable mortal with so great vigour as to be able to lie broiling on a gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diron, and to be turned first on the one side and then on the other, with his senses as quick as those of his tormentors, and his natural desire of preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his life as strong as theirs, and all this for no other reason, but becaus he would not renounce his Saviour. Now how is it possible for us to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit our Union with the Church in Heaven by <hi>erec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Temple or an Altar</hi> to God in memorie of this his great power and goodnesse towards S.

Temple or an Altar</hi> to him <hi>in honour</hi> of S. Laurence. For that which deserves to be honoured in S.

We honour God whenever we honour his Saints, as we honour the Artificer by praising his work. God is <hi>wonderful in his Saints Psalm.</hi> 67.

            <p n="74">74. Altho it be a great honour for Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, that their names are used to make up God's name, when he is called <hi>the God of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Isaac, and Iacob,</hi> yet this is no <hi>Divine honour.</hi> Why then should it be a <hi>Divine Honour</hi> to these Saints to erect a Temple to God under that name? You'l say, that this is no <hi>Divine honour</hi> to them, and that it is always lawful to <hi>erect Temples</hi> to God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any name that he himselfe has chosen: then, say I, it is no <hi>Divine honour</hi> to Marie, Peter, Paul, Laurence &amp;c. whenever we <hi>erect a Temple</hi> to the God of Marie, Peter, Paul, Laurence &amp;c becaus we are to understand all God's Elect under the name of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob who are expressed in God's name. And if it be no <hi>Divine honour</hi> to Marie, Peter, Paul, Laurence &amp;c. to <hi>erect a Temple</hi> to the God of Marie, Peter, Paul, Laurence &amp;c. all the <hi>honour</hi> which we give to the Saints by the

               <hi>erection of Temples and Altars</hi> which bear their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes is allowed for good and lawful.

            <p n="75">75.

Thus the difficultie which the Dr. has star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted against us is common to Protestants as wel as to us, and to all those who own the Authoritie of the <hi>Acts of the Apostles.</hi> Let him come off with it as wel as he can. As for our solution, it is very easie and intelligible, and equally shows, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther S. Peter's Faith after his Vision at Joppe, nor the Faith of the Church in following Ages are to be accounted <hi>new,</hi> notwithstanding the several Declarations of Faith which have been made since our Saviour's A scension into Heaven. We say there fore, that our Saviours Declaration of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Doctrins to S. Peter did not make <hi>new Articles of Faith,</hi> or establish a <hi>new Church,</hi> but onely laid a new obligation on the Faithful of believing them in <hi>exprese terms,</hi> which is that which we mean by <hi>explicit</hi> Faith, wher<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>s before they believed them onely <hi>in their Principles,</hi> which is that which we mean by an <hi>implicit</hi> Faith. S. Peter before his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion at Joppe believed <hi>the Law of Christ to be a state of libertie,</hi> and that <hi>God would build again the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle of David out of the Gentils;</hi> the first of which Principles he made use of in the Council which was held at Hierusalem, to shew the uselesnesse of Circumcision and the Law of Moses among Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians; and the other was managed by S. Iames to the same purpose. He believed likewise what our Saviour said viz <hi>Iohn indeed baptized with water, but ye shall be baptized by the H. Ghost,</hi> from which saying he proved after this Vision, that it was
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:108855:50"/>
lawful to reconcile the Gentils to Christ, as we have seen above. Therefore he believed <hi>implicitly</hi> all the aforesaid Doctrins which were included in these Principles; and after our Saviour had <hi>proposed</hi> them upon his Vision, he believed them <hi>explicitly</hi> and in expresse terms So that S. Peter's and the Churche's <hi>implicit</hi> Faith were always the same, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus the Principles from whence it was inferred, were revealed and always believed; as supposing our Saviour should propose to my belief the meaning of several obscure passages in S. John's Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in this case my faith would not be different from what it is now. I should onely have an <hi>expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit</hi> Faith of some Truths whereof I have onely now an <hi>implicit</hi> belief. We have here no coyning of a <hi>new Faith,</hi> nor making of a <hi>new Church,</hi> but onely a <hi>new</hi> Declaration and Proposal of such Doctrins as were delivered in the beginning by the deliverie of those Principles from whence they were dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.</p>
            <p n="83">83. This solution of a difficultie which the Dr. is obliged to remove is a just answer to what at present he urges against us. For altho the Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Declarations of the Church are <hi>new,</hi> yet the matters Defined and Declared were delivered by our Saviour either <hi>implicitly</hi> in such Principles from whence the truth of them is gathered; or else <hi>explicitly</hi> and in expresse Terms. In both which cases the Faith of the Church is the same, and by consequence the Church is One and the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:108855:50"/>
same in all Ages. For as to the first, seing the Church has in all Ages <hi>explicitly</hi> believed the Principles, it must necessarily have given an <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit</hi> assent to such Doctrins as were contained in them. And as to the second, the vindication and declaration of a truth which was delivered in the beginning does no more than restore an Old Truth, and not establish a <hi>new</hi> one, and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence cannot make a <hi>new Church.</hi>

               <hi>§. 7. P. 10. 11. After the Drs. endeavours to show us wherin the Unitie of the Church in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth does not consist, he proceeds 2. to tell us wherin it does consist, viz in the</hi> Gospel-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant by which we are all united in One Bodie to Christ, the one and onely Head of the universal Church ..... The onely Medium or Bond of this union between Christ and his Church is the Gospel-covenant: for that is the foundation of our relation to Christ. He is our Head and Husband, our Lord and Saviour, we his subjects, Disciples, Spous, and Bodie by Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
            <p n="84">84. Replie. 'T is strange, that this Author who lays so great a stresse upon the <hi>Gospel-covenant,</hi> should not take a litle pains to give us an account what he means by it, it being not a matter evident of it selfe, and rarely applied to Controversial uses. I am persuaded, that the Unitie of the Church had wanted a Champion, had not the Ambiguitie that lies in these terms set him upon the underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. Wherefore before I grant it to be <hi>the Bond of
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:108855:51"/>
union between Christ and his Church,</hi> it is fit that I establish the Notion of it, and not passe it over, as he does by acknowledging the name, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing from the Reader the thing signified by it.</p>
            <p n="85">85. We understand by the <hi>Gospel-covenant</hi> the Covenant which we find mentioned by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Jeremie <hi>chap.</hi> 31. (who is quoted by S. Paul <hi>Hebr. chap.</hi> 10. <abbr>v</abbr>. 16) in these words, <hi>Behold the days come, saith the Lord, that I will make a New Covenant with the Hous of Israel and the Hous of Iuda ... This shall be the Covenant that I wil make ... I will put my Law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts, and I will be their God, and they shall be my People.</hi> The Prophet calls it a <hi>New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> not becaus all the Elect from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the world were not included in it, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus Christ was to preach the <hi>Law</hi> which was to be <hi>written in our hearts,</hi> and to appear as a visible Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of the world after a great number of Ages, wherin men were either totally ignorant and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindfull of God, or else tied to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> and burthensome observance of Types and Figures as among the Jews, or of no lesse ineffectual Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, as among the Gentils. All which were to have an end, and to give way to the <hi>Law</hi> of Love, which Christ would <hi>write in our hearts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="86">86. The word <hi>Covenant</hi> imports a mutual Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise and obligation between two or more persons, about something that is to be done by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misers to the Honour, or advantage of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:108855:51"/>
This Notion of a Covenant in general is easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applicable to the <hi>new Covenant,</hi> or that which passes between God and man relating to the Gospel-For the performance of God's Promise to us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounds to his Honour, and the performance of our Promise to him redounds to our Honour and advantage. What God promises us is, that we shall be the <hi>Spous</hi> and <hi>Bodie</hi> of his Son if we will believe in him; and our Promise to him again is, that we will believe in him in hopes of so great a reward. But it is not sufficient for men to be comprized un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Gospel-covenant,</hi> that they promise to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in the Son of God: they must likewise signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie this their Promise to him in such a manner as he himselfe has enjoyned, which has been different in different Ages of the world. For we Christians accept, and lay hold on God's Promise at the time of our Baptisme, the receiving of which Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is ordained by God as an expression of our assent to his Proposal to us according to that of our Saviour, <hi>He that believes, and is baptized shall be saved. Marc</hi> 16. Those who were of the seed of Abraham had Circumcision appointed them for this purpose, whence S. Paul calls this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>the seal of the Righteousnesse of Faith. Rom.</hi> 4. Those who were not of the seed of Abraham from the beginning of the world, who had neither Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision, nor Baptisme whereby to signifie their assent to God's Proposal to them, might make the same known to his Divine Majestie by their Faith
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:108855:52"/>
in Christ who was to come. For these chosen Vessels having been for manie Ages so very extraordinarie and few, it may be doubted, whether there were any Sacraments appointed them for this end, since Sacraments are ordained for the exteriour Union of manie, as wel as to significa a sacred thing; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially considering, that as every Divine Revelation that is made us for our spiritual good is a virtual Promise of a reward that is to be given us for our belief of it, so our belief of it is a virtual ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of the same reward. But we may with more probabilitie judge, that the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices which we read to have been offered by Job (and the like may be said of other Holie men of his Classe) were commanded by God, and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by him as an expression of the belief of the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Incarnation of his Son, and as a Condition of their becoming Members of his Mystical Bodie. And it is a matter beyond dispute, that the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of Melchisedech were instituted for this end, seing Christ our Lord is <hi>a Priest for ever according to his Order.</hi> Thus these three states of men who constitute the one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Spous</hi> and <hi>Bodie</hi> of Carist, make one and the same Promise to God, altho the manner of their expressing it be diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</p>
            <p n="87">87. I have onely mentioned Faith as a necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Condition which we promise to performe in the <hi>Gospel-covenant,</hi> having followed herin the method of the Church, which demands of those
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:108855:52"/>
who come to the Sacrament of Baptisme, <hi>whether they believe?</hi> But besides Faith there is another Condition no lesse necessarie, which is Obedience to our Ecclesiastical Superiours, which the Church forbears to mention becaus it is included in Faith, which being an assent to all that God reveals, it is by consequence an assent to all such things as he has commanded for the validitie of his <hi>Covenant</hi> with us. Now obedience is a matter of this nature, as the Church has believed in all Ages, and as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears out of our Saviour's words to his Apostles, <hi>He that hears you, hears me, and he that despises you, despises me. Luc.</hi> 10. From whence we gather, that seing we <hi>despise</hi> onr Superiours as often as we disobey them, we <hi>despise</hi> Christ, as often as we disobey them; and if we <hi>despise</hi> Christ, we renounce our <hi>covenant</hi> with him. And in case this Author will not allow of this Doctrin, which shall be fully proved in the sequel of these Discourses, he must consequently hold, that Christ may have a true Church, and that his Mystical Bodie may sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist, altho all the Christians in the world were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely unconnected, disunited, and independent of one another in matters of Goverment, and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
            <p n="88">88. Obedience to Ecclesiastical Superiours was no lesse necessarie to the <hi>Gospel-covenant</hi> under the Law of Moses than it is now, wherein there is this onely difference, that those who under the Old Law would not acquiesce with the determination
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:108855:53"/>
of the Priests, should be put to death, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. wheras under the Gospel, those who disobey their Pastors are onely excommunicated, whereby they have time given them to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap>. In both these cases disobedience is a forfeiture of the <hi>Gospel-covenant;</hi> for those who died for it under the Law died in a state of damnation as outcasts and rebels against the <hi>chair</hi> of Moses; and those who die excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated for the same under the Gospel will fare no better unless they are certain of the injustice of their Excommunication, which we cannot reasonably presume of such as are excommunicated for their errours in Faith, seing the Gospel obliges them in such cases to <hi>hear</hi> those by whom they are excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated as they <hi>hear</hi> Christ himselfe. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition appertained likewise to all those who neither lived under the Law nor the Gospel, and yet were Members of Christ's Mystical Bodie; for altho they had onely the actual exercise of Faith, yet seing their Faith in Christ was an assent to his whole Law, it must needs have been an appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of that Obedience to our Superiours which was to be commanded by it. Those who passe out of this life into Heaven are freed from the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p n="89">89. Now from what I have said we may learn 1. that the Notion of the <hi>Gospel-covenant</hi> is this, <hi>A mutual Aggreement between God and some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons whom he has <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

that we should be his <hi>Disciples, subjects, Spous, and Bodie</hi> on this account.

If we say that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in the character which we receive in Baptisme, we shall make Heretiques, Schismatiques, and Apostats (supposing they have been baptized) to be Christ's Mystical Members.

            <p n="93">93. D Sherlock gives a broad hint p. 13. and 14. that it is one thing for the Church to be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in One Bodie to Christ by the <hi>Gospel-covenant,</hi> and another thing to be united to him as his <hi>Spous</hi> and <hi>Bodie,</hi> which certainly he would never have done, had he considered the double meaning which I lately assigned to the <hi>Gospel-covenant.</hi> For altho, as I have said, the mutual Promises that passe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Christ and his Church, are the <hi>Beginning</hi> of the Churche's <hi>relation</hi> to him, yet seing these Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises alone cannot unite her to him any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than as Heretiques and Schismatiques are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited to him, her complete Union to him must be by the performance of the mutual Promises, which they make to each other. And this is the Union

which makes her his <hi>Spous</hi> and <hi>Bodie.</hi>

I say he hints <hi>at</hi> such a distinction very cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly, for having asked the question, <hi>how the whole Church</hi> (in Heaven and Earth) <hi>is but one Bodie?</hi> He answers that <hi>he knows of no other way, but that they are all united to Christ in the same Covenant, and all who are thus united to him, Christ accounts for his One Bodie.</hi> After which he sais, that <hi>it is true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that the Church is called also the Bodie and Spous of Christ, but it is called so for Mystical reasons,</hi> which I willingly grant, but he must know that these <hi>Mystical reasons</hi> are the mystical Union where -by the Church is united to Christ as to her <hi>Spous,</hi> and wholly indistinct from the performance of God's Promise in the <hi>Covenant,</hi> as will appear out of these reasons which I have cited out of him below N. 96. and which being supposed here, I shall leave it to him to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Promises which they have made each other, but becaus she has received from him the performance of his Promise upon her performance of what she had promised him.</p>
            <p n="95">95. Since the Mystical Union of the Church to Christ is onely by way of similitude, the most effectual way to establish it's Notion will be to consult the H.

            <p n="96">96. In the first place the Church is called the <hi>Spous</hi> and <hi>Bodie</hi> of Christ as wel becaus of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit love wherwith he cherishes, supports, and regales her, as also for certain Mystical Reasons which are delivered by this Author P. 14. 15. 16. 17. and seing his words are not amisse, I shall make use of them; for to be sure no others will pleas him halfe so wel. <hi>To understand,</hi> sais he, <hi>why the Church is called the Spous and Bodie of Christ we must enquire, why the Wife is called the Bodie of the Man, Flesh of his Flesh, and Bone of his Bone, and the reason of that is, becaus the Woman was formed cut of the Man ...... Thus the</hi> B. <hi>Iesus out of his great pitie and compassion to fallen Man intending to marrie us to himselfe, and thereby to recover us out of a state of sin and miserie, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

the same Nature, but the Woman must be formed out of the Man, which makes her Flesh of his Flesh, and Bone of his Bone. And thus accordingly the Church is formed out of the Bodie of Christ, and is in a Mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal sense his very Flesh and Bones, as S.

So that as in the Natural Bodie the Spirit and Vertue of the Head is derived to all the Members through the providential care it has o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, according to the capacitie of every one of them in particular and the necessitie of the whole, so in the Mystical Bodie of Christ the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> Spirit of Christ is lodged in all it's Members, whether they are in Heaven, or strugling still with temptations on Earth.

For these diversities of operations proceed all from the same Spirit of their Head, who lives in them after a more special manner than he does in inanimate beings, which is onely on the account of his Immensitie and Power; or than he does in Infidels who know not his name, in whom he lives by natural reason; or than he does in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techumens, who altho they know his name, and

Wheras he lives in all such as are Members of his Mystical Bodie as a readie Principle of supernatural operations.

            <p n="98">98. And to carrie the Analogie yet further, as in the Natural Bodie such services as are proper to each part are communicated to every Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, and there is no good so peculiar to any one of them, which all the rest do not partake of: so it fares likewise in Christ's Mystical Bodie,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:108855:57"/>
where such meritorious actions as are performed by any Member in particular, redound to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of them all, according to that of David <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticeps ego sum omnium timentium te. Psalm.</hi> 118. By which means we are not onely Members of Christ, but as S. Paul sais ad Eph. 4. <hi>Members of one another,</hi> by contributing towards one anothers salvation by such good actions, as are proper to the stations and places which God has assigned to us; as the <hi>eye,</hi> the <hi>ear,</hi> the <hi>hand,</hi> the <hi>foot,</hi> and the <hi>bellie</hi> contribute towards the mutual good of one another by such operations as are proper to each one in particular. Thus if God has made me a Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of souls here in England, and I discharge my office according to his Divine Will; or if he has made me poor and afflicted, and I bear my neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities with patience and resignation, he will in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of my Merits have mercie on my Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members who are in far distant Countries, as sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose in Mexico or China. Wheras without such a communication of Merits, whatever good I may do to my Fellow-members here in England by my example or the like, yet those in Mexico or China will be never the better for it. Seing the Church in Heaven is no longer capable of meriting, their prayers and Intercessions are the onely services that they can render to their Brethren on Earth: but this is too general a means for all the Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members to assist one another withall, and makes them all onely of one kind, as suppose an <hi>eye,</hi> an
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:108855:58"/>
               <hi>ear,</hi> a <hi>hand,</hi> or a <hi>bellie,</hi> becaus they contribute all alike towards the common good by one and the same operation. Thus S. Paul's excellent Analogie is fully salved in our Doctrin, but must needs be very imperfect in the Drs. way, who by denying Merit, makes it impossible to explicate, how the Mystical Bodie of Christ has a complete resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance with the Natural Bodie, when the Members of it are onely <hi>Members of one another</hi> by their being all united to Christ, and not by any special assis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances which their respective stations enable them to afford to one another. The contrarie wherof happens in the Natural Bodie, where the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are one among themselves, not onely by their common subjection to their Head, but by their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serviencie to one another by means of such good offices as are proper to each of them in particular.</p>

Our Saviour is compared Luc. 15. to a <hi>Vine,</hi> and <hi>ad Rom.</hi> 10. to an <hi>Olive tree,</hi> and we are said to be his branches, and to derive our growth and nourishment from him. So that whilst we are not broken off but united to him, we partake of the fatnesse of his root, and may bring forth fruit.</p>

               </gap> is deprived of this Heavenly Guift is as much dead in order to any actions that may deserve a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward from God, as a withered or rotten branch of a tree, or a Bodie that is forsaken by the soul. But if it be understood with relation to Christ who is the Efficient Caus of Charitie, that is, of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation and Newnesse of spirit, there can be no inconvenience in saying, that the dead Members of Christ's Bodie have an Analogie with Paraly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques, becaus we are sure that they have Christ dwelling in them by Faith, who sais of himselfe that he is <hi>Life.</hi> So that as we say of a Paralytique, that he is not absolutely dead whilst his soul con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues united to his Bodie, but onely that he is dead as to his sensations by reason of the ill dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions that affect his nerves: so we may say of a dead Member of Christ's Bodie, that he is not absolutely dead so long as he has the Lord of <hi>Life</hi> dwelling within him by a special presence, which is not common to those who have Faith and yet are not of his Bodie, but onely that he is dead as to any good and meritorious actions through the want of Charitie.</p>
            <p n="102">102. Now from all these Analogies and simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:108855:59"/>
we may gather, that to be a Member of Christ's Mystical Bodie denotes a special Grace and favour, whereby our Lord receives us under his more particular care, whereby he looks after our true and onely interest as tho we were parts of himselfe, and with the same concern as every one has for his natural Members. For what signifies his <hi>forming us out of his broken Bodie,</hi> but that he has placed us in such a state wherin we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the benefit of his death and Passion, which is signified by the Prophet Jeremie above, when God sais that <hi>he will be our God, and that we shall be his People?</hi> And that he has given us a superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural strength to attain the enjoyment of him, which is an end above our natural abilities? And what fignifies his being as it were the soul of his Church, and the root from whence she derives her juce and fatnesse, but that he is readie prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to do us good, if we will lay hold on him; that he is our All in All, that he supports our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, mollifies our hardnesse, enflames our luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warmnesse, removes our blindnesse, and that without an Union with him by means of Faith and Obedience to our Pastors, as in the Church Militant, or by means of the Beatifique Vision, as in the Church Triumphant, we are able to do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what is imperfect and impure, and which will not end in death and destruction. Wherefore I conclude from all that has been said, that to be a Member of Christ's Bodie, or to be Mystically

               <hi>united to him as our</hi> Spous <hi>imports</hi> A special Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which all those have to Christ as their last end, who have not retracted their acceptance of the Graces and favours which he promised them, through their renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the necessarie Conditions which he required of them, and which they promised to performe at what time the Gospel-Covenant passed between them.</p>

            <p n="2">2. Replie. This is the killing Proposition which is to put and end to the <hi>vain and arrogant Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Church of Rome.</hi> This is to be the bane of the Infallibilitie of the Church, of the Pope's Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie, and of the Authoritie of General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils &amp;c. This is to be she shield of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the defence of the Protestant Caus, which till the publication of this Discourse has been car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on but very unluckily, altho he will have <hi>manie good things</hi> to have been said in it's behalfe. And yet we do not find any one word to make it good, unlesse it be that which I have examined above in Replie to this 3. Answer, N. 6. altho it be not a Principle of so great clearnesse as to be it's own proof. Nay it is nothing else in effect but a Proposition which he advances in opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to our Doctrin. For we affirme, that the Church on Earth has a Visible Unitie Essential to it by Christ's Institution by means of Faith and Obedience to our Pastors, from whence we show by pressing consequences the Infallibilitie of the Church, the Supremacie of the Pope, and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of General Councils. In answer to which he tels us, that <hi>the</hi> onely <hi>Essential unitie of the Church on Earth, that which makes a Church, and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:108855:62"/>
it one, is that all true Churches are Members of the One Mystical Bodie of Christ, as being all united to him as to their Head by the same Covenant,</hi> that is, that there is no other Unitie Essential to the Church, but that wereby it is united to Christ as to it's <hi>Mystical Head</hi> and <hi>Spous,</hi> from whence he very manfully concludes the falsenesse of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Doctrins. Can he think, that we will lay aside our Faith becaus he tels us that it is not true, or that any prudent man of his partie will judge, that he has put <hi>an end to wranglings</hi> by a bare denial of our Tenets, which all Authors of his Communion who have writ before him, have done no lesse than himselfe? Nay they have brought proofs, such as they are, to justifie their dissent from us; but he brings none, and yet would have the world think, that he has done more than any of them. He must have a strange confidence in his own abilities, who can presume, that a simple Affirmation or Negation of his own will go further than other mens Syllogisms, as it is certain the Dr. does; for otherwise he would never censure Protestant Writers for the ill ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of their Caus against us, when he to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

For if the meaning of it be, that the Essential Unitie of the Church on Earth, as it is Christ's Mystical Bodie, is that all true Churches are united to him as to their Head by the performance of the Promises that passed between them in the <hi>Gospel-covenant,</hi> it is undoubtedly true. Neither do I know of any thing else that can make a Mystical Church, and make it Mystically One, becaus the <hi>Relation to Christ</hi> which arises from the <hi>formation of us</hi> out of his <hi>broken Bodie</hi> which he promised us, is that which makes us Members of his Mystical Bodie, in consideration of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the Conditions which he required of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, viz Faith and Obedience to our Ecclesiastical Superiours, wherin we place the Essential Unitie of the visible Church as such.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But the immediate connexion which this Proposition has with the last which I took no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, evinces that he can have no such meaning as this, from whence it is very clear, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs to say, that the <hi>onely</hi> Essential Unitie of the Church on Earth is the Mystical Union of it to Christ as to it's <hi>Spous.</hi> For he having said in the foregoing Chapter, that the Essential Unitie of the whole Church in Heaven and Earth consists in the Union of them both to Christ, and having at present applied this Doctrin to that part of the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:108855:63"/>
whole Church which is on Earth whose Unitie he pretends to establish, it follows, that he allows of no other Unitie as Essential to it; otherwise we might expect an account of it here which is it's proper place, seing the Notion of the Churche's Unitie must needs be defective without it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Besides, his inferences throughout the second Chapter suppose, that the Church on Earth has no other Unitie Essential to it, but that whereby it is Mystically united to Christ as to it's <hi>Spous.</hi> Which Position has engaged him to maintain, that the Catholique Church <hi>is nothing else but the whole Companie, or multitude of individual Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, who are all singly united to Christ, and made one in him.</hi> From whence he is enforced to hold, that <hi>the Clergie do not belong to the Definition of a Church;</hi> that <hi>they are not the Church;</hi> that <hi>the Church has no Authoritie, nor any visible Tribunal wherein to exercise this Authoritie;</hi> that <hi>the Faith of General Councils is not necessarily the Faith of the Church;</hi> that the <hi>Indefectibilitie of the Catholique Church does not depend upon the Indefectibilitie of Organized Churches;</hi> that <hi>it is possible for the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church to be unknown and invisible;</hi> that <hi>the indefectibilitie of the Church does not prove the Infallibilitie of any Organized Church.</hi> All which Doctrins and a great manie more which I have omitted, suppose that our Mystical Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Christ is the onely Essential Unitie which the Church has. And to put the matter out of dispute, he sais in expresse terms p. 47. that the Essential Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:108855:63"/>
of the Catholique Church consists <hi>onely in the union of all Christians to Christ, which makes them his one Mystical Bodie;</hi> and p. 31. that Christian Churches <hi>are One Bodie by being all united to one Mystical Head, the Lord Iesus Christ; not by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and visible union to each other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. And truly if he hold, that it is Essential to the Church on Earth to be visibly One as wel as to be Mystically One, what he sais against us p. 7. to prove that the formal and Essential Unitie of the Church on Earth does not consist in it's uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Pope, is very sillie. For his Argument runs thus. <hi>The Church on Earth is One with the Church in Heaven, they being both but One Church, and therefore must have the same Essential unitie; for how they should be One by two sorts of unitie, that is, be One without the same formal unitie, is very mys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terious and near akin to a contradiction. And therefore seing the unitie of the Church in Heaven does not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in it's union to the Pope, no more does the unitie of the Church in Earth, the unitie being the same in both.</hi> To which Argument we have a very readie and convincing Answer, if he hold it to be Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to the Church on Earth tobe Visibly One; for if this be so, why may not it's Visible Unitie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in it's Union to the Pope, as wel as by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther visible means? For it cannot follow, becaus the Unitie of the Church in Heaven does not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in it's Union to the Pope, that therefore the Unitie of the Church on Earth does not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:108855:64"/>
in the same, no more than it follows, becaus the Unitie of the Church in Heaven does not consist in that wherin Dr. Sherlock will have the visible Unitie of the Church on Earth to consist, that therefore the Unitie of the Church on Earth does not consist in the same. And as in this Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis he will denie; that it is <hi>near akin to a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction</hi> to say that such a visible Unitie as he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, is Essential to the Church on Earth, becaus he does not pretend, that the <hi>Formal and Essential unitie</hi> of the Church in Heaven and Earth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in such an Unitie as he judges to apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain onely to the Church on Earth: so we may in like manner say, that it is far from being a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction,</hi> to place the visible Unitie which we acknowledge for Essential to the Church on Earth in it's Union to the Pope, becaus we do not hold, that the formal and Essential Unitie of the whole Church in Heaven and Earth consists ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, but in another kind of Unitie which is distinct from it.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Having said thus much concerning the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the aforesaid Proposition, I would now gladly know, how the Dr. can reconcile the Visibilitie of the Church on Earth, which he sais p. 18. is <hi>plainly taught in Scripture</hi> with the truth of it. For seing the Church is nothing else but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny individuals united into One Bodie, if the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential Union of them together be Invisible (as our Mystical Union to Christ as our <hi>Spous</hi> is)
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:108855:64"/>
the Church must be invisible to. I shall prove our Mystical Union to be Invisible in my Replie to the Answer which he returns to this Objection, which was too notorious to be dissembled by him, and therefore he starts it against himselfe <hi>ubi su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra,</hi> and takes an occasion to show his dislike of those who are of opinion, that the Church is composed of no others but the Elect.</p>
            <p n="8">8. As I do not blame him for impugning this Opinion, so I must needs declare my dissatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at the Answer which he makes to the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Objection, which is, that <hi>the union of the Church to Christ which he had explained</hi> (that is, her Mystical Union to him as to her <hi>Spous</hi>) <hi>is a visible union, for,</hi> sais he, <hi>we are nnited to Christ by the Gospel-covenant, and the Covenant is visible; the Sacraments of the Covenant Baptisme and the Lord's Supper are visible, the profession of Faith and Obedience to Christ made <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> these Sacraments are visible also; and therefore the Church which is united to Christ by a visible Covenant, visible Sacraments, and a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible profession is visible also.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. I say, that I am not at all satisfied with this Answer; for by his good leave, the <hi>union to Christ which he had explained</hi> is an invisible Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for it consists in this, that all those who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the Conditions of the <hi>Gospel-covenant</hi> are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited to Christ as to their <hi>Spous,</hi> and this for Mys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Reasons which I have cited out of him above Chap. 1. N. 96. viz becaus they are <hi>formed out of
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:108855:65"/>
Christ's broken Bodie, as Adam's bodie was broken, and a rib taken out of him to forme the woman.</hi> Which Mystical Marriage, Relation, and <hi>Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of us out of his <hi>broken Bodie</hi> is a thing which we believe and cannot see. Will Dr. Sherlock pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to see, that we are <hi>Flesh of Christ Flesh and Bone of his Bone?</hi> It is plain, that we see it not any other way than by Faith, as we see the B. Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. On which account the B. Trinitie is as visible to us, as that we are <hi>Flesh of Christ's Flesh and Bone of his Bone.</hi> No doubt, but that the Faith whereby we believe the Church to be <hi>Flesh of Christ's Flesh, and Bone of his Bone</hi> is visible by by the visible profession of it; but the Object of this Faith is no more visible than the B. Trinitie. Neither can the visibilitie of this Union be proved from the visibilitie of the <hi>Gospel-covenant</hi> &amp;c. there being a great disparitie between the visible Marriage of Man and Woman and the Mystical Marriage of the Church to Christ. For the Marriage of Man and Woman becomes visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by the visible expression of the consent of both parties being visibly present, which is a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible deliverie of them into each others power so as to unite them into <hi>One Flesh.</hi> But in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of the Church to Christ, altho the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> which God makes his Church be visible, yet it is not visible that it is God's <hi>Covenant,</hi> which is a truth which we believe onely, and cannot see. And altho our acceptation of God's Promise
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:108855:65"/>
and <hi>Covenant</hi> be visible by our visible profession of Faith, yet seing it is not visible that the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> which we call God's is really his, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be visible, that we are <hi>Flesh of Christ's Flesh, and Bone of his Bone.</hi> A visible Marriage cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult from the visible consent of one of the Parties, when the consent of the other partie is invisible, nay when it is not visible that the other partie is in <hi>rerum natura</hi> to give any consent, as it happens between the Church and Christ who is invisible to her; neither has she any other means of knowing that he <hi>is,</hi> or that he is God, than what she has from Faith, which (as I have said) sees not it's Objects to be true, but judges them to be so upon the Authoritie of the Revealer.</p>
            <p n="10">10. And thus the Argument which the Dr. uses against those who hold the Church to be the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Elect, is turned against himselfe; for thus he discourses against them: <hi>The internal Grace which makes a Church-member is invisible, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Church-members are invisible too, and then I fear</hi> (he may be sure of it) <hi>the Church it selfe must be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible, if all the Members of it are invisible; for invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Members cannot make a visible Societie.</hi> Which Argument will serve as wel against him as against them; for <hi>the Mystical union which Essentially makes a Church-member is an invisible Grace,</hi> whereof S. Paul sais ad Eph. 5. Marriage is a <hi>great Sacrament,</hi> Sign, or Mysterie; <hi>and therefore Church-members are invisible too, and then the Church it selfe must</hi>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:108855:66"/>
be invisible; for invisible Members cannot make a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Societie.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Notwithstanding what has been here said, it cannot be denied, but that the Church on Earth is <hi>united to Christ by Faith in him, by being bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in his name, by feeding on the Sacrament of his Bodie and Bloud</hi> &amp;c. p. 51. Which Union, altho it be Mystical, may become visible by the visible profession of Faith, and visible Sacraments, as Faith it selfe becomes visible by the visible profession of it. But it does not follow from hence, that the Church is visible; for this Union signifies no more than an adhaesion of the Church to Christ by means of Faith, and the Sacraments, as the understanding and will adhere, and are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited to their Objects by their respective Acts, much after such a manner and in such a sense, as when we say, <hi>Anima est magis ubi amat, quam ubi animat,</hi> or that <hi>affection makes two souls one.</hi> Mahometans may be thus said to be united to God whom they pretend to obey by following Mahomet, and Pagans to be united to their Idols, which, S. Paul 1. <hi>ad Cor. c.</hi> 8. sais are <hi>nothing.</hi> Thus likewise the same Apostle 1. <hi>ad Cor. c.</hi> 6. sais that <hi>whoever cleaves to a harlot becomes one with her,</hi> becaus of the conjunction of their wills, as wel as of their Bodies. This kind of Union is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

I say this Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not that Mystical Union which knits the Church in Heaven and Earth together, by which this Author will have the Church on Parth to be Essentially united to Christ as to it's <hi>Spous,</hi> but is distinct and of another nature from it, as is plain; becaus it does not necessarily suppose, that we have any <hi>special relation to Christ as our last end,</hi> or that we are in such a state wherin our Lord has appointed us to receive the benefit of his death and Passion, wherin consists the Notion of our Mystical Union to Christ as our <hi>Spous.</hi> This is the Mystical Union which I denie to be visible by the <hi>Gospel-covenant, Profession of Faith</hi> and the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> which besi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des what has been alreadie said, the following Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations will make it impossible for him to prove.</p>
            <p n="12">12, For the Union of Christians to Christ by means of the <hi>Gospel-covenant, Profession of Faith,</hi> and the <hi>Sacraments</hi> imports no more, but that the Christian Religion may be said to make one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the other Religions that are in the world, as when we say that there are four Religions in the world, the Christian, Jewish, Mahometan, and Pagan; from whence we cannot conclude, that
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:108855:67"/>
the Church is visible, but onely that the men who are said to constitute the Church, are visible, and that their Religion is visible, which is not the same thing as to say that the Church is visible, if the onely Essential Unitie it has be that whereby it is Mystically united to Christ as to it's <hi>Spous.</hi> And yet we Christians intend to say something more than this by the <hi>visible Church,</hi> which signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies a visible Bodie; for we intend, to signifie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a multitude of men, who are linked and tied together by such an Unitie as Christ has made Essential to it, and that this Unitie is visible. And in case this Notion be not admitted, we must change our terms, and not say the <hi>visible Church</hi> but visible Professors of Christianitie, or at best manie disjoyned Congregations and Churches who are become One by a voluntarie combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among themselves, which, one would think, this Author should not wel like, who p. 29. will have the Church on Earth to be <hi>also one Bodie and Communion,</hi> and this, if I mistake him not, by Christ's Institution.</p>
            <p n="13">13. Neither are we visibly united to Christ by the Obedience which we visibly professe to pay him. For seing it is not visible that Christ <hi>is,</hi> or that he is God, it cannot be visible that he lays any Commands upon us. And if it be not visible that he lays any Commands upon us, it cannot be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible that we obey him. And if it be not visible that we obey him, it cannot be visible that we are
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:108855:67"/>
               <hi>united to him</hi> by the Obedience whlch we prosesse to pay him. Our Faith is all the evidence we have that he <hi>is,</hi> or that he is God, and therefore our Obedience to him cannot bear a greater evidence than the Act of the Understanding whereby we apprehend him to <hi>be,</hi> which being obscure, and far from enabling us to see that he <hi>is,</hi> the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence we pay him must by consequence be far from being visible. As we believe him to <hi>be,</hi> so we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that we obey him by the performance of those Commands which we believe to be his. And it it impossible that we should have a greater evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that we obey him, than we have that he <hi>is,</hi> becaus every Act of our Obedience supposes onely the evidence of our Faith that he is. No doubt, but men visibly performe those Commands which they believe to be Christs, but if it be not visible that Christ <hi>is,</hi> it cannot be visible that they are his Commands, and if it be not visible that they are his Commands, it cannot be visible that they obey him by the performance of them.</p>
            <p n="14">14. The Church therefore is invisible, if it's Visibilitie must be taken from Obedience to Christ's Commands. And it stands to reason that it should be so, becaus Christ who is Invisible is a necessarie Principle of it's Visibilitie. The Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church is a Visible Bodie. And who can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend a Visible Bodie, when the onely Power which makes it a Bodie by commanding ouer it is Invisible. A visible Power and visible Obedience
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:108855:68"/>
the things that constitute a Visible Bodie, and when either of them are wanting, we are to seck for a Visible Bodie. Will Dr. Sherlock say, that there can be a Visible King whose subjects are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible? It is evidently ridiculous; for the man may be Visible, but his Kingship is not so. For as a King in the Notion of it imports one who has Power over manie, so a Visible King imports one who has Power over manie who are Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, How then can be say, that the Church is a Visible Bodie, and a Visible Kingdom, when the subjects are onely Visible, and the Commanding Power is Invisible? As a King in the Notion of it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p n="15">15. No such absurdities as these ensue upon our Doctrin, who do not hold the Church to be Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by a Visible Union to Christ, whether this be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 line">

Visible profession of that Faith which she be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves to have been taught by Christ, and by a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Obedience to such Pastors as she believes he has set over her, by which means she is knit and compacted together, as much as any Civil Bodie or Societie; and we may in all rigour of speech say that she is Visible, becaus the visible professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Faith and Obedience to her Pastors makes her in our way to be a Visible Church, and is no lesse Essential to her during her Pilgrimage on Earth than her Mystical Union to Christ as her <hi>Spous.</hi> Thus the Visibilitie of the Church is it's own proof, and is so plain that Infidels may see it, becaus it is the Object of their senses. I say that Infidels see the Church altho they do not believe it, becaus Christ has appointed that it shall essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially be as they see it is, and has truly taught her that Faith which she believes to have received from him, and has truly commanded her to obey those Pastors whom she believes that he has set over her. For which reason Infidels do not see the Church when they see true Christians, if Christ has made their onely Essential unitie Invisible. Neither do they see the Church when they see Heretiques and Schismatiques, and are acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with their Faith and Obedience, becaus Christ is not the Author of their Faith, neither has he ordained them any Governours to continue them in their separation from the One Church Matters
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:108855:69"/>
ching judgment in nature whether of Christians, or Infidels, cannot comprehend how an Union to Christ which is, as we have seen, Invisible, can make the Church a Visible Bodie; or how a visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Obedience can be paid to an Invisible Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding Power, of whose existence and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands those who are said to obey, have no other certaintie than by Faith.</p>
            <p n="16">16. Besides this sensible Visibilitie, the Church may be likewise said to have a <hi>Rational</hi> Visibilitie (if I may have leave to call it so), which arises from the manie and supernatural Motives which make her Authoritie and Doctrins evidently Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, by means wherof Infidels are induced to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of what they see, and to unite themselves to the Church by embracing her Faith, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to her Pastors. We cannot say, that He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques and Schismatiques are Visible Churches in this sense neither; for altho we see their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Faith, and Obedience to their Pastors, yet by reason we do not see that they have any Motives of Credibilitie to recommend their Faith and Obedience to our veneration, we cannot see, that is, we cannot conclude that they are true Christian Churches. Both which sences of the Churche's Visibilitie are commonly joyned by our Divines into one when they speak of the Visible Church, as they are also in the H. Scriptures. We are easily taught by this way how to distinguish the Visible Church from Heretiques and Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiques,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:108855:69"/>
which the Dr. will never be able to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect with all his skill; for how can he pretend to make a Visible distinction between them, when the Church which is to be distinguished is, as we have seen, essentially Invisible?</p>
            <p n="17">17. But let us suppose now, that he has made out the sensible Visibilitie of the Church by what he has said in it's defense, yet we shall find, that he is never the nearer distinguishing of it from Heretiques and Schismatiques by the pretence of Obedience to Christ, if we suppose a great truth, that Obedience to Christ's Commands has a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie and essential respect to the meaning which Christ will have his Commands to be taken in. For in this Hypothesis, if it be certain (as who can doubt of it?) that the different Bodies of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans who are now in the world, put different con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions on Christ's Command's in Scripture, it necessarily follows, that they are not all of them Christ's Visible Church, becaus there is among some of them a notorious Disobedience to him by not performing his Commands in his own way. I suppose Dr. Sherlock will aggree with me thus far, especially if any of these Bodies are said to be Guiltie of a Fundamental Disobedience by a Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental misconstruction of any of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. Now seing Christ's Church is to be found among these Bodies, which way are we to come to the knowledge of it? This must be done either by extrinsecal Motives which may give to one or
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:108855:70"/>
more of them a preference before the rest, and found an evident Credibilitie that they are Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to Christ; or else by an examination of their Faith and Practices by such intrinsique Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as are drawn from the Text by every one's private reason to prove the meaning of Christ's Commands. If the trial be made by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> Motives, the Dr. must own the Church to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible, that is, not to be distinguisheble from He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques and Schismatiques, becaus he is destitute of any such Motives, for which reason he lays no claim to them. If it be made by an examination of their Faith and Practices by Intrinsique Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he must likewise grant that it is Invisible after the same manner too, becaus altho all those Bodies of Christians who are Obedient to Christ's Commands are Visible, and such Doctrins and Practices of theirs whereby they really obey him are Visible too, yet seing there can be no <hi>certainty</hi> in the Protestant way, that they really obey him by such their Doctrins and Practices, they cannot be Christ's Visible Church so as to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Which Consideration effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:108855:71"/>
proves, that no one can be <hi>certain</hi> in the Protestant way, which Bodie, or Bodies pay a real Obedience to Christ's Commands.

            <p n="19">19. I may chance to show the <hi>uncertaintie</hi> of the private interpretations of Scripture more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly by the following familiar example, than by the most pressing Metaphysical reasons. Let us suppose, that Dr. Sherlock has a friend of whom he is fully persuaded by his long acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with him, and unquestionable experience, that he has as good eys as himselfe to discover an Object of an equal distance from them both. Let us suppose likewise, that this friend of his and he together in the fields perceive a far off an Object, of which there starts a dispute what it is, the Dr. affirming it to be a house, and his friend maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it to be a tree. The Dr. gives his friend his reasons why it should be a house which he disal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows: and his friend gives him his why it should
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:108855:71"/>
be a tree, wherwith he remains as litle satisfied. It would be a strange presumption, if the Dr. in this Hypothesis should pretend to <hi>certaintie,</hi> that what he sees is a hous and not a tree, when he is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently <hi>certain</hi> that his friends judgment in the case is as good as his own. Which consideration alone may wel make him apprehensive lest he be mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, but if we adde to this the distance of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject from his sight, what he affirms must needs be <hi>uncertain</hi> in the highest degree, so that no man of sense would venture to lay upon the truth of it any thing that he is unwilling otherwise to part with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al.</p>
            <p n="20">20. The case is exactly the same at present (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Principles of Protestants) between the several Bodies of Christians, who differ about their interpretations of Scripture. I will put it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Church of England and the Arians, and the same may serve between the Church of England and any of the other disunited Bodies. These two Bodies have both equal qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to attain the true meaning of Scripture, which is a truth so plain and incontestable, that the bare proposal of it is a proof sufficient. They both read in the H. Scripture these words <hi>My Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and I are One,</hi> and it is acknowledged on both sides that such words are evidently to be seen there; just as the Dr. and his friend aggree in this, that they evidently see a bulkie appearance at a distance from them in the fields. But they differ
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:108855:72"/>
concerning the meaning of these words, whether they signifie that our Lord and his Father are One in Nature, or affection? The Church of England affirms the first, and the Arians the latter onely, after the same manner as the Dr. and his friend dispute, whether the bulkie appearance which they see in the fields be a house, or a tree? For seing the meaning of those words is to be deduced by a long train of consequences, hence it is, that the Truth wants a sufficient approximation and application to determin their judgments both one way; as the reason why the Dr. and his friend cannot aggree, whether what they discover be a hous, or a tree is, becaus they are at too great a distance to discerne evidently those connatural qualities and Accidents of the Object, which being once perfectly seen would quickly remove all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions of dispute, and make them both aggree in the same sentence. The Church of England gives her reasons why these words <hi>My Father and I are One</hi> ought to be understood so as to denote their Unitie in <hi>Nature,</hi> as the Dr. gives his friend his reasons, why he judges that which he sees to be a house: and the Arians after a mature consideration of all that she brings to make good this interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, returne a peremptorie Answer to every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, and contend, that those words signifie onely an Unitie of <hi>Assection,</hi> as the Drs. friend being dissatisfied with his reason why he judges
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:108855:72"/>
that which he sees to be a hous, gives him an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his, why he judges it to be a tree.</p>
            <p n="21">21. What grounds for <hi>certaintie</hi> can the Dr. discover in this contest, that the Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland puts a truer construction on the aforesaid Text than the Arians? It would be meer follie forhim in the dispute which he has with his friend to pretend <hi>certaintie</hi> that what he sees is a house, and not a tree. How the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can he pretend to any such thing in behalfe of the Church of England a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Arians? That which makes the pretence to <hi>certaintie</hi> unreasonable in the first case is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus his friend is evidently as competent a judge in the debate as himselfe, which is an indisputable reason why he ought to adjudge a likelyhood of truth to his sentence, and by consequence <hi>uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie</hi> to his own. And seing in the case which I have put between the Church of England and the Arians, both parties must be acknowledged to be equally capable of finding out the true sense of the aforesaid Text, it must needs be no lesse un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable to pretend to <hi>certaintie,</hi> that the Church of England takes them in the right sense, as tho it were a matter as plain as that there is such a place as Rome, or that there were no dispute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it amongst any who are called Christians. For seing experience teaches us, that when ever there occurre contradictorie reasons to persuade the truth, or falshood of any matter, the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing (so long as these reasons continue of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:108855:73"/>
force) is necessarily reduced to a state of sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense, it must needs be a great levitie in any one to pretend <hi>certaintie,</hi> that he does not actually erre by adhering to a Doctrin, about which two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of equal Authoritie and judgment are at vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
            <p n="22">22. It is not enough that men can find a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to such Objections as are brought against their interpretations of Scripture, or that they meet with nothing which causes any doubt or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietnesse in their minds, or that in debates about Religion they always judge that they come off Conquerours.

               </hi> which Protestants pretend to in behalfe of their Doctrins is exactly of the same nature, they being as destiture of any certain Principle to prove, that their interpretations of Scripture contain the true meaning of the H.

And so seing every Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion becomes disputable for want of evidence to clear it's Truth, or to manifest it's falsenesse, after they have strengthned their interpretations of Scripture with all the plausibilities they can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise, there will still remain room sufficient for their learned Adversaries to thwart their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

That which induces Protestants to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that they have attained the true meaning of Scripture by their private reason is certain discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses which look like Probabilities, and likely hoods of truth, which may stand as wel on the one side as the other, and which may be sufficient to make their favourers stiff in their defence, but not to put the matter out of doubt. I make no question, but men of very excellent natural parts adhere so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metimes so firmly to these Probabilities, that
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:108855:74"/>
they have no actual doubt of the truth which is recommended by them, to which no more is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, but that they judge such Argumens as they bring in their defense to be incomparablie stronger than any that are brought against them: yet the nature of these Probabilities having <hi>uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie</hi> annexed unto it as it's unseparable proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, cannot afford their followers so great a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption of Truth and <hi>certaintie</hi> as may exclude a possibilitie of a reasonable doubt. For the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted Texts will very often bear contrarie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, without any necessitie that either side should passe with the other for fools or mad men for defending that explication which they judge to be true. So that neither of them is able to say of their Opinion, <hi>I am certain that this is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the H.

As <hi>certain</hi> as these persons pretend to be of their exposition of Scripture, yet
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:108855:74"/>
there is no wealthie and prudent man among them who would hazard all that he has in the world upon a wager without <hi>a greater certaintie</hi> that he should come off a winner.

            <p n="24">24. This <hi>uncertaintie</hi> of interpreting Scripture by private reason shows the weaknesse of the grounds wheron Protestants relie for the truth of their Faith, and obliges them to seek out others that are more strong wheron to build their sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. God be thanked they act in the belief of the B.

What they have long believed, they have loved a great while; and what they have loved a great while, they are unwilling to part withall. Any
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:108855:75"/>
Probabilitie seems of great moment to a mind that is thus resolved and preengaged, the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion giving evidence, when Argumen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p n="25">25. Thus we see that Dr. Sherlock is far from being <hi>certain,</hi> which Bodies of Christians puta right interpretation upon Scripture, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence which Bodies are Obedient to Christ's Commands, and by consequence which Bodies are Christ's Church; and by consequence he must say, that Christ's Church is as Invisible in order to our distinguishing of it from Heretiques and Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiques, as if it were not in being, or that it were not perceptible to our senses, notwithstanding that we see their persons, and know their Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trins as wel as every man does his own. Wherefore if he acknowledge Scripture for the word of God, he must necessarily take other measures than he has hitherto done, to show how the Church on on Earth is Visible. And seing i'ts Visibilitie can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be shown from it's sensible and Visible Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Christ, nor from any <hi>certaintie</hi> that it's interpretations of Christ's Commands are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to his meaning, he will do wel to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a more fa ourable opinion or our Motives of Credibilitie, which efficaciously persuade us which is Christ's Church, and that she teaches nothing but what is Christ's Doctrin and conformable to Scripture, and that as long as we cleave to her,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:108855:75"/>
we cannot fail of being Obedient to Christ, if not alter a sensible manner as Obedience is the Object of our senses, yet after a most certain and Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal manner, inasmuch as it is evidently Credible, that the Obedience which we pay the Church in all she teaches is the Command of Christ. If he take this course, he will have as great a <hi>certaintie,</hi> that the Obedience which he pays the Church in all she teaches is an Obedience to Christ, as he pretends to have, that Scripture (for whose Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie Protestants alledge Motives of Credibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie) is the word of God. Wheras if he go his old road, he may prove the Visibilitie of the Church as long as he pleases, before we think our selves obliged to give any heed to what he sais, seing it's Invisibilitie is in his Principles as plain to our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, as any text of Scripture is to our sight.</p>

It is a much more ridiculous Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph in you, Sr. to conclude from any thing which you have hithertho said, that you know where to <hi>find the Catholique Church.</hi> For altho I should grant you, that the onely Essential Unitie of the Church on Earth consist's in it's Mystical Union to Christ whereby it is likewise united to the Church in Heaven, yet this concession can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enable you to find it out, or to tel me which is it, unlesse you can satisfie me, which those Christians and Churches are, who have <hi>One Lord, One Faith, One Baptisme.</hi> For seing the Mystical Union of the Church to Christ is an Invisible Grace, and consequent to the performance of the Conditions of the <hi>Gospel-covenant</hi> which are signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by <hi>One Lord, One Faith, One Baptisme,</hi> you ought to have shown us, which those Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are who have performed these Conditions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you can prove them to be Christ's Mystical Bodie, which is a matter that cannot be known otherwise, than by knowing that they have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the said Conditions.

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:108855:77"/>
of our sight to say <hi>This is it;</hi> and as soon as this is done, there is nothing more easie, than to point out the Nations and Churches wherof it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed. The onely Essence of a true Church is to be united to Christ as to it's Spous. Suppose this. But how shall we know when a Church is Mys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically united to Christ?

            <p n="32">32, But seing it is such an easie thing to <hi>find out the Catholique Church</hi> in your way, let us come to a trial of it, and make use of names by descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to a particular consideration of some Bodies of Christians. You say that Roman-Catholiques and Protestants are both of them in <hi>Covenant</hi> with Christ, and by consequence that they are both of them Members of Christ's Mystical Bodie; for which reason you conclude, that they are both Members of the Catholique Church upon Earth. I confesse that this is a very expedit way to <hi>find out the Catholique Church.</hi> But how will you prove, that both these Bodies are in Covenant with Christ, and Members of his Mystical Bodie? You can effect this no otherwise, than by showing that they performe alike the Conditions of the <hi>Gospel-covenant,</hi> which you will find by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to be a hard task. For we Catholiques be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that the <hi>Lord</hi> to whom we are Mystically

united, neither has given, nor can give to the Protestant Churches that Power and Authoritie which they challenge to excommunicate us on the account of any Doctrins which we professe. In like manner you Protestants hold, that the <hi>Lord</hi> to whom you believe you are Mystically united, neither has given, nor can give to our Church that Power and Authoritie which she challenges to exclude you from the use of the Sacraments on the account of any Doctrin which you professe. From which contradictorie judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Catholiques and Protestants we may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther 1. either that there are two Lords; or 2. that the <hi>One Lord</hi> contradicts himselfe by two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incompatible Authorities, which Catholiques and Protestants pretend to have over each other in the aforesaid cases, Or 3. that at least one of these Churches is a <note n="*" place="bottom">

We do not denie, but that Baptisme is by Institution the first, and most principal, and most universally necessarie among these <hi>Faederal Rites</hi> considered as such, and that the other Sacraments are not so significant to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse our Mystical Union to Christ as our <hi>Spous</hi> as Baptisme is both in it selfe: and in all it's cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstantial Ceremonies, yet they all of them by Institution Represent the Passion of our Lord,

which is the Meritorious Caus of that Relation which we have to him as to our <hi>Spous,</hi> and are all of them so manie solemne renewings and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions of the <hi>Gospel-covenaut</hi> which passed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and man in Baptisme, as being so manie Protestations of Faith and Obedience to our Ecclesiastical Superiours without which no man can have a right to receive them.</p>

Who now has reason to <hi>Triumph,</hi> Sr. You who pretend without any ground, that you can tel where to <hi>find the Catholique Church,</hi> or we who prove that you know nothing of the matter? You say that those are the Catholique Church who are Mystically united to Christ as their <hi>Spous.</hi> I say so too, but I show withal, that you cannot tell who those are who are thus Mystically One with Christ, of which I have given you an instance in Catholiques and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants, whom you hold to be both Mystically One with Christ; and yet I have proved, that they are not Mystically One with One another by means of the <hi>Gospel-covenant,</hi> by which you say they are both Mystically One with Christ. For both these Churches cannot be united to the <hi>one Lord. One</hi> and the same <hi>Faith</hi> which you hold for a necessarie <hi>Condition</hi> of the <hi>Gospel-covenant,</hi> is not common to them both, neither have they One and the same <hi>Faederal Rites</hi> of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> from whence it follows, that they are not One by the same Covenant.

But supposing you were able to performe it with some likelyhood of truth, yet seing this cannot be done by any such Principles as you have laid in this Discourse, you must give your Brethren the other Protestant Writers leave to say of you as you have said of them, that altho you have <hi>said manie good things about the Notion of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church,</hi> yet they are <hi>verily persuaded,</hi> that there will never be an <hi>end of these Wranglings</hi> till it be <hi>setled,</hi> which you have not <hi>throughly done yet,</hi> becaus after all you have said, it does not appear from your Principles which is the Catholique Church, and to the end you may make a further discoverie of it, you are forced to betake your selfe to such Methods as you judge to have proved unsuccesseful in your Fellow-writers.</p>

<pb n="144" facs="tcp:108855:81"/>
is, which all distinct Churches ought to maintain with each other,</hi> they are reserved for a second Part, which I suppose he will think bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on before he publish, since the principles whereon he must depend for the forming of it, have alreadie found so great on opposition in this Part which has alreadie seen light.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>§. 13. P. 32.</hi> Now, <hi>sais he,</hi> it is evident from what I have alreadie discoursed, that the true Notion of a Church is Coetus Fidelium, or the Companie of the Faithful, of those who professe the true Faith of Christ, and are united to him by Baptisme.</p>
            <p n="41">41. Replie. I wonder from what part of what he has <hi>alreadie discoursed</hi> we are to gather this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Church. I have diligently read over all that he has writ from the beginning of his Book till this passage which I am now examining, and cannot find any <hi>evident</hi> grounds for it. He has told us indeed not long since <hi>chap.</hi> 2. §. 3. that <hi>whatever makes a Church, makes it a Member of the one Catholique Church, or of the one Bodie of Christ,</hi> after which he sais immediately, <hi>and here comes in what the Apostle makes essential to this one Bodie, one Lord, one Faith, one Baptisme, which sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisies being united to Christ in the same Covenant.</hi> Which Assertions are far from affording any <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> of the truth of this Notion in his principles, as appears out of the Replies which I have made to them. Nay throughout his Discourse I find evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent grounds to infer the contrarie. For seing he
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:108855:81"/>
will have the Essential Unitie of the Church on Earth to be the Mystical Union whereby the Church in Heaven and Earth are united in One Bodie to Christ as to their <hi>Spous,</hi> this Notion of a Church must be said to be essentially distinct from it's Essential Unitie, which is a meer Chimera. For the Essential Unitie of the Church in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth does not consist in Faith, as I have said over and over, and shall declare fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther herafter. So that Faith in the Drs. way does not so much as belong to the Notion of a Church, becaus it's Essential Unitie does not consist ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. The Dr. seems to have forgotten, that the Notion of a thing is a <hi>really</hi> indistinct from it's Essential Unitie, which is universally true of all beings as they fall under a Metaphyfical consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and without doubt it takes place in Moral Bodies (such as the Church is), which are nothing else but united multitudes. For that which unites them together makes them a Bodie, and that which makes them a Bodie is their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, therefore that which unites them together is their Notion.</p>
            <p n="42">42. The occasion of this monstrous absurditie is the Drs. not allowing the Church on Earth to be as Essentially a Visible Bodie as it is Christ's Mystical Bodie, which being once admitted, there is no fear, that the Notion of a Church will run counter to it's Essential Unitie, or that Faith does not belong to the Notion of it. For as
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:108855:82"/>
has two Unities Essentially distinct, so it has two Notions Essentially distinct. As it is Mystically One, it's Essential Unitie consists in the <hi>Special Relation, which all those have to Cbrist as their last end, who have not retracted their acceptance of the Graces and favours which he promised them, through their renouncing the necessarie Conditions which he required of them, and which they promised to performe at what time the Gospel-covenant passed between them,</hi> wherin consists also the Mystical Union of the Church in Heaven to her beloved, and the Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them both as they are Christ's Mystical Bodie, as I have said aboue <hi>Ch.</hi> 1. <hi>N.</hi> 102. &amp; <hi>seq.</hi> And as it is Visibly One, it's Unitie consists in the actual performance of the Conditions which God required from her, when he promised her his Son for <hi>Spous</hi> in Baptisme, wherein it's Notion also consists as it is a Visible Bodie. So that altho the Church in Heaven and the Church on Earth are both Mystically One with Christ, as being both <hi>Flesh of his Flesh, and Bone of his Bone,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which consideration they have both the same common Notion: yet seing the actual perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the Conditions of the Gospel-covanant is absolutely necessarie, to the end the Church on Earth may be <hi>Flesh of Christ's Flesh, and Bone of bis Bone,</hi> from which Conditions the Church in Heaven is exempted, hence it is, that the Mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Bodie of Christ as it abstracts from both these states resembles a <hi>Genus,</hi> and the actual perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:108855:82"/>
of the aforesaid Conditions is in the nature of a <hi>Difference,</hi> whereby that part of Christ's Bodie which is Militant on Earth is distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed from the other part which is Triumphant in Heaven. This is clear; for if I tel Dr. Sherlock, that Titius is a Member of Christ's Mystical Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, he cannot conclude from these terms, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Titius be in Heaven, or on Earth. But if I tel him, that Titius is Orthodox in his Faith, and Obedient to his Ecclesiastical Superiours, it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident that I mean him to be a Member of Christ's Mystical Bodie upon Earth. If therefore that part of Christ's Mystical Bodie which is upon Earth have a special Difference, whereby it is distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed from the other part which is in Heaven, it must by consequence have a special and distinct Notion from it too.</p>
            <p n="43">43. If the Dr. will admit of these two sorts of U<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>tie, I shall easily grant him, that Faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the Notion of a Church on Earth, but if he will persist in his pretence that this follows from what he has <hi>alreadie discoursed</hi> in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or from what he has said in the first Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter concerning the Essential Unitie of the Church in Heaven and Earth, to the end his Doctrin may seem all of a peece, and to hang by the same thread, I must beg his pardon if I dissent from him herin for the reason given, notwithstanding that he quote S. Paul for <hi>one Lord, one Faith, one Baptisme.</hi> The Church on Earth is more behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:108855:83"/>
to those Protestants, whom he accuses of being ignorant that the Church in Heaven and Earth are One Bodie, than it is to him who va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lues himselfe upon the discoverie of it. For these Gentlemen seem to grant, that the Church on Earth is Essentially One at it is a Visible Bodie, and persuant to this Principle, they affirme that it's Essential Unitie consists in the profession of the same Fundamental Faith; from whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that Faith belongs to the Notion of it. But this Author is so fond of his New Truth, that he has no regard for the Old one, and whilst he establishes the Essential Unitie of the whole Church in Heaven and Earth, he leaves the Church on Earth without a Notion. What my thoughts are concerning this Notion of a Church shall appear below.</p>
            <p n="44">44. Perhaps some Readers (amongst whom the Dr. may chance to be one) will cavil at my saying, that the Mystical Bodie of Christ <hi>resembles a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> as tho Christ had more Spouses and Bodies than one.</p>
            <p n="45">45. To which I answer, that no such absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie as this follows from my Doctrin; for I mean onely that the states and conditions of the Church Triumphant and the Church Militant, wherof Christ's Mystical Bodie is composed, are specially and Essentially distinct, which I believe this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor will hardlie denie. Neither can there be any greater inconvenience in this manner of speech,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:108855:83"/>
than there is in saying, that Man is a <hi>Genus</hi> in respect of innocent and sinful, rich and poor, happie and miserable persons; from whence it cannot be inferred, that an innocent man is Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentially distinct from a sinner, or a rich man from a poor man, but onely that innocence and sinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, riches, and povertie, which are extrinse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal to the nature of <hi>Man,</hi> are Essentially distinct. Thus it happens at present; for neither Invisibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie nor Visibilitie, nor the Vision of God nor Faith belong to the Notion of Christ's Mystical Bodie as such, as is plain; becaus that part of it which is in Heaven is Invisible and without Faith, and the other part which is on Earth is Visible and without the Vision of God. The one part is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, rich, and happie, and the other part is sinful, poor, and afflicted, but for all this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in their circumstances, they make no more than One Mystical Spous and Bodie of Christ. Neither can it follow, becaus they have distinct Notions as they are thus considered under their different circumstances, that therefore they are not the One Spous of Christ, as it does not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that the Nature and Notion of <hi>Man</hi> is not One, becaus as <hi>Man</hi> is considered in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his riches and povertie, happinesse and miserie, he is capable of distinct Notions. This is all that I mean by saying, that Christ's Mystical Bodie <hi>resemble a Genus</hi> in respect of the Invisible Church in Heaven, and the Visible Church on
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:108855:84"/>
Earth whereof it is composed. If I had held the Church on Earth to be Christ's Mystical Bodie inasmuch as it is Visible, no doubt, but Christ would have had more Spouses and Bodies than One; but I hold, that Faith and Obedience which make it Visible, are not the <hi>formal Reason</hi> why it is Christ's Mystical Bodie, but onely the necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Conditions without which she cannot be it. And therefore let Dr. Sherlock, who will have Faith to be the <hi>formal Reason</hi> which makes the Church on Earth to be Christ's Mystical Bodie, make out how Christ has not two Spouses and two Bodies in his way, seing the same <hi>formal Reason</hi> which makes the Church on Earth Christ's Mys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Bodie, cannot produce the like effect in the Church in Heaven which wants Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>§. 14. Ib.</hi> There can be no other Notion of the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Church in Heaven and Earth, but the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of the Faithful, who are united to Christ by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and are his Mystical Bodie in the sense above explained.</p>
            <p n="46">46. Replie. This Proposition is delivered with such a Magisterial peremptorinesse, that (consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the small grounds he has for it) it seems to have been the result of manie a tedious and perplexing thought, which he might have wel spared, if he had reflected on the aforesaid <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Relation</hi> which the Church in Heaven and Earth <hi>have to Christ as their last end,</hi> which as it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> them both in One Mystical Bodie, so it is
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:108855:84"/>
their Notion. This Notion of the Universal Church in Heaven and Earth is so apparently false, that I cannot but wonder, how he came to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture his credit so far as to submit it to the censure of the publique. For Faith, as I lately said, does not belong to the Notion of Christ's Mystical Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die as such, becaus <hi>de facto</hi> the most Illustrious part of it which is in Heaven has no Faith at all, as neither will any of it's Members have after end, and conflragration of this world. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly nothing can belong to the Notion of a thing without which a thing <hi>is</hi> and may <hi>be.</hi> Besides, he has told us more than once, that the Unitie of the whole Church in Heaven and Earth ought not to be placed <hi>in any thing that can concern onely a part of it,</hi> and after all he makes Faith which concerns onely the Church on Earth to belong to the Notion of the Universal Church in Heaven and Earth. I am much mistaken if this be the way to put an <hi>end to wranglings.</hi>

            <p n="47">47. Replie. The onely Difference we find here between the Church in Heaven and the Church on Earth is, that the one is in Heaven and the other on Earth, as tho Faith which is said to make them One Church were professed in Heaven, as wel as on Earth.</p>

P. 33.</hi> The learned Launoy has produced various Texts of Scripture for this Definition of a Church, that it is the Companie of the Faithfull; and has proved by the Testimonie of the Fathers in all Ages, even down to the Council of Trent it selfe, that this was the received Notion of the Church, tillit was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by Canisius and Bellarmin. Canisius puts Christ's Vicar intothe Definition; that the Church is the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Collection of all baptized Believers under one Head Christ in Heaven and his Vicar on Earth, which makes the Church a Monarchie. Bellarmin desines the Church to be a Companie of men united together by the same Christian Faith, and the Communion of the same Sacraments under the government of law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Pastors, but chiefly of the Bishop of Rome as the one Vicar of Christ on Earth, which makes the Church a kind of mixed, and tempered Monarchie; the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Bishops, and the Pope as supreme Pastor.</p>
            <p n="48">48. Replie. It would have been much more to the purpose, if he had produced some Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies to prove, that the Church in Heaven and Earth are <hi>the whole Companie of the Faithfull,</hi> than to cite Authors to show, that this Notion ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to the Church on Earth. But becaus he was not able to prove what he was sure would be disputed, he wisely proves what is willingly granted him. Whoever denied this Notion? We have no exception against it's falsenesse. We know very wel that it is every where to be seen in the Fathers of the Church, and we read it in the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:108855:85"/>
Catechisme of the Council of Trent set out by Pius V. But he must know, that every tru No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a thing is not a good one, becaus every true Notion is not a complete one. We often ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse our Notion of things by something that is Essential to them, and omit other properties that are no lesse necessarie to their <hi>being</hi> than those we mention. In which case the consequence will not hold either that our Notion is false, or that those properties we omit do not necessarily appertain to the things defined. Thus S. Paul <hi>ad Eph.</hi> 4. takes the Notion of the Church from it's Pastors. <hi>He gave some Apostles, and some Prophets, and some Evangelists, and some Teachers, for the perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Saints, for the work of the Ministrie, for the edifying of the Bodie of Christ;</hi> and <hi>ad Philip.</hi> 1. from the Pastors and People, <hi>To all the Saints which are at Philippi with the Bishops and Deacons;</hi> and 1. <hi>ad Cor.</hi> 1. From it's Sanctitie and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salitie, <hi>unto the Church which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Iesus, called to be Saints, with all that in every place call upon the name of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours;</hi> and <hi>ad Eph.</hi> 1. from it's Sanctitie and Faith, <hi>Paul an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle of Iesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints that are at Ephesus, and the Faithful in Christ Iesus;</hi> and <hi>ad Eph.</hi> 5. from it's Mystical Union to Christ, <hi>We are Members of his Bodie, of his Flesh, and of his Bones;</hi> and 1, <hi>ad Tim.</hi> 3. from it's Infallibilitie, <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>he Church is the ground and Pillar of Truth.</hi> Thus
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:108855:86"/>
likewise the same Apostle takes the Notion of Faith from it's inevidence and obscuritie, <hi>Faith is the evidence of things that do not appear, ad Heb. cap.</hi> 11. And the like examples may be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from several other places of Scripture. All which Notions are true, but not complete, that is, they are not <hi>good</hi> Notions in a Logical sense, becaus they do not explain the Nature of the thing according to such considerations as make it aggree with some things, and disagree with all others, or as Logicians say, they do not explain it by <hi>Genus proximum &amp; differentiam ultimam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="49">49. And this is the defect which we find in the present Notion of the Catholique Church. For Schismatiques and Excommunicated persons may be baptized, and have as good Faith as Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, and yet there is nothing more certain, than that they are not comprehended under the Notion of the Catholique Church. The reason of which inconvenience is, becaus Obedience to our Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Superiours in not placed therin which would have distinguished the Church from all those who are cut off from it's Communion. There is no Definition will passe muster in the Schools which has such a wel grounded excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as this brought against it: And certainly there ought to be greater heed taken about a Notion that immediately regards our H. Religion, where the errour will prove of a much more dangerous consequence, than a natural mistake in an unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:108855:86"/>
matter. If you say, that that the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church as such has no Authoritie, and that therefore it is not necessarie to make Obedience any part of it's Definition; I answer, that the contrarie shall appear below §. 28.</p>
            <p n="50">50. Neither are Schismatiks onely and Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated persons comprehended under this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but Heretiques also. For altho this Author P. 32. would have us to understand by <hi>Faithfull</hi> no others than such as <hi>professe the true Faith in Christ, and are united to him by Baptisme,</hi> yet what Heretique is there who allows of Baptisme and a Catholique Church, that will not admit of this Notion of it? Arians, Sabellians, Nestorians, and the most enormous sects in the world who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to believe in Christ judge their own Faith to be <hi>true,</hi> for which reason they are in Dr. Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock's way comprised in the Definition of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church. For in his judgment particular Churches, nay individual Christians are the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and lawful judges for themselves, what Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trins they ought to receive, and what to reject. See what he sais below §. 22. n. 138. So that sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing there be no common and irrefragable <hi>Rule of Faith</hi> which all Christians ought to conforme to in such debates as arise about the meaning of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that must be held for <hi>true Faith</hi> which par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches and individual Christians hold for such, how opposit and contradictorie soever their sentiments are about it. For how dares Dr.
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:108855:87"/>
Sherlock to censure any one's Faith for false, which is declared to be <hi>true</hi> by the <hi>proper aud law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Iudge</hi> therof? whence if follows, that the <hi>true Faith</hi> which is placed in the Notion of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church signifies a contradictorie Faith, and by consequence when he pretends to define the Catholique Church by <hi>the whole number of the Faithful who professe the true Faith of Christ, and are united to him by Baptisme,</hi> the meaning of it is; that it is <hi>the whole number of those who professe the contradictorie Faith of Christ, and are united to him by Baptisme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="51">51. I say this absurditie evidently follows, supposing the Notion he has given be designed to serve for the Catholique Church, as that is said to be One Bodie resulting from manie diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Communions, who are at variance about mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Doctrin, and the Interpretation of the H. Scriptures. For the Faith of the Catholique Church in this way is not One but manifold and contradictorie, and by consequence the <hi>true Faith</hi> which is placed in the Notion of the Catholique Church is contradictorie too. For altho the Faith of particular Bodies of Christians, and of indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual persons who may be said to compose the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church is not contradictorie, yet the Faith of the Catholique Church as such, and as it is One Bodie (under which consideration this Notion is given to it) must needs be contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie, becaus the Faith of all the parts together is
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:108855:87"/>
contradictorie by reason of their contradictorie interpretations of the H. Scriptures.</p>
            <p n="52">52. But in case this Notion relates onely to One Bodie of Christians who professe one and the same Faith, and are of one denomination, the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid absurditie does not follow, buth then there follows another which is not lesse than that, viz that Protestants alone for example are the Catholique Church, as being <hi>the whole num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of those who professe the true Faith in Christ, and are united to him in Baptisme,</hi> unlesse he be so just as to assign us this Prerogative to whom of right it is due, or so good natured as to exclude Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants by allowing it to some other Bodie who has no more right to it than they. We may with very good reason ask them, <hi>where their Church was before Luther,</hi> if there were none before that false Apostle who <hi>professed the true Faith of Christ.</hi> And if there were any such Professors, it will be a hard task to prove that Protestants are the Catholique Church, or that they are so much as parts of it, unlesse they associate themselves to such Christians as <hi>professed the true Faith</hi> before the first Reformers appearance in the world, by which means the <hi>true Faith</hi> of the Catholique Church will be, as I have said, contradictorie.</p>
            <p n="53">53. If the Dr. to salve these Absurdities have recourse to the usual Refuge of <hi>Fundamental</hi> and <hi>Non-fundamental</hi> Faith, and say that by <hi>true Faith</hi> which he has put into the Notion of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:108855:88"/>
Church, he understands <hi>Fundamental</hi> Faith wherin every part of the Church necessarily ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; I Answer, that this will not serve his turne, unlesse he make us know, what those Points are which he calls <hi>Fundamental</hi> Faith; for how can we know what the Church is, without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Fundamental</hi> Faith which makes the Church? Neither is it enough for him to tel us, what the <hi>Fundamental</hi> Faith is, unlesse every part and Bodie of the Catholique Church concurre with him therin. For the <hi>true</hi> and <hi>Fundamental</hi> Faith of the Catholique Church can be on other than that which the Catholique Church will have it to be. And if he abstract and separate from among the Doctrins of the Catholique Church a certain number of them which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes for <hi>Fundamental</hi> Faith, they will be his own <hi>Fundamental</hi> Faith, and not the <hi>Fundamental</hi> Faith of the Catholique Church, which holds the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Doctrins which he rejects, to be as much <hi>Fundamental</hi> Faith as those which he has culled out. Which proves, that the Notion of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church must be likewise that which the Catholique Church will have to be it. It is a just prejudice against any Notion of the Catholique Church, if the Catholique Church it selfe will not receive it (she ought to know best what she is), as it is certain it does not receive this Notion of Dr. Sherlocks, if by
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:108855:88"/>
the <hi>true Faith</hi> which he has placed in it; he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands onely such Doctrins as the Church of England esteems for <hi>Fundamental.</hi> Who sees not, that if it be tollerable for Protestants to insert no other Faith into the Notion of the Catholique Church but that which they hold for <hi>Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,</hi> that it is as lawfull for any of the other Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, whom they account for parts of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church, to do the like, by which means there will he as manie destinct Notions as there are <hi>Fundamental</hi> Faiths, and as manie dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct Churches and Communions, as there are Notions of the Catholique Church.</p>
            <p n="54">54. Again. Since there is as great a variance among the several Bodies of Christians, what Points are <hi>Fundamental</hi> and what <hi>Non-fundamental,</hi> as there is what Faith is <hi>true</hi> and what is false, this Author is still pressed with the weight of the aforesaid Absurdities, and in the very same <hi>forme</hi> too, as you shall see. For as every particular Bodie of Christians looks on their own Faith to be <hi>true,</hi> so they hold it for <hi>Fundamental</hi> and necessarie to be believed. (I say all other Christians do so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides Protestants). And as every particular Bodie of Christians, nay individual persons are the lawful and proper Judges, what Doctrins they ought to receive, and what to reject, what Faith is <hi>true</hi> and what is false; so they are likewise in Dr. Sherlock's way no lesse proper Judges, what Faith is <hi>Fundamental</hi> and what <hi>Non-fundamental.</hi>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:108855:89"/>
So that supposing there be no common and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragable Rule of <hi>Fundamental</hi> Faith which all Christians ought to follow in such debates as arise concerning the sense of Scripture, that ought to be held for <hi>Fundamental</hi> Faith, which particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Churches and individual Christians hold for such. For how dares Dr. Sherlock censure any one's Faith for <hi>Non-fundamental,</hi> which is declared to be <hi>Fundamental</hi> by the proper and lawful Judge therof? From whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that the <hi>Fundamental.</hi> Faith which is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the Notion of the Catholique Church sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies a contradictorie Faith, and by consequence when he pretends to define the Catholique Church by <hi>the whole Companie of those who professe the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Faith of Christ, and are united to him by Baptisme,</hi> the meaning is, that the Catholique Church is <hi>the whole number of those who professe the contradictorie Faith of Christ Iesus, and are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited to him by Baptisme,</hi> which is not much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from the Notion which the Heathens had of it in the primitive times.</p>
            <p n="55">55. I say that this absurditie follows as much here as in the other case, and that for the same reason too, becaus the <hi>Fundamental</hi> Faith of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church in this way is not one but mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold and contradictorie, and by consequence the <hi>Fundamental</hi> Faith which is placed in the Notion of the Catholique Church is contradictorie too. For altho the <hi>Fundamental</hi> Faith of particular
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:108855:89"/>
Bodies and individual persons that may be said to compose the Catholique Church be not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictorie, yet the Fundamental Faith of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church as such, and as it is One Bodie (under which consideration this Notion is given to it) is contradictorie, becaus the <hi>Fundamental</hi> Faith of all it's parts together is contradictorie by reason of their contradictorie interpretations of the H. Scriptures. And in case this Notion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates onely to one Bodie of Christians who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse the same <hi>Fundamental</hi> Faith, the same absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie follows here likewise as above, viz that the Catholique Church consists in a Bodie of one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination, as suppose, in Pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>estants, or in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever other Bodie the Dr. is pleased to place it in, which is an inference that does not wel suit with his Principles.</p>
            <p n="56">56. Thus we see that we are never the nearer knowing what the Catholique Church is by this Notion, as it is handled by Dr. Sherlock. For seing he defines it by <hi>true</hi> and <hi>Fundamental</hi> Faith, and seing this <hi>true</hi> and <hi>Fundamental</hi> Faith is the belief of Contradictions, what understanding is able to comprehend, what the Catholique Church is? If he had told us expressely, that the Notion of it is <hi>the whole number of People who believe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions,</hi> we could presently conclude the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it, becaus the belief of Contradictions would be the thing that made the Church. But to tel us, that the belief of these Contradictions is
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:108855:90"/>
               <hi>true</hi> and <hi>Fundamental</hi> Faith is the greatest Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction that any one can possibly believe. For how can the understanding judge manifest lies, errours, deceits, and Contradictions to be <hi>true</hi> and necessarie to be believed? We expected from him the Notion of a thing that really exists, and he has given us such a Notion of it as makes it a Chimera.</p>
            <p n="57">57. Before this Author can persuade us to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of this Notion for a complete one, he must shew out of the Fathers from whence it is taken, that they held nothing more requisit towards ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> being Members of the Catholique Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides <hi>Baptisme</hi> and <hi>true Faith;</hi> for their words can do him no service, so long as we may justly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> him for having perverted their meaning. They litle dreamed, that this Notion of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church would be turned to the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of that Faith which they held to be true. For whoever has made any progresse in their writings cannot be ignorant, with what vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monce they inculcate to us Obedience to our Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Superiours, and the external and visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Unitie of the Church as things absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie towards our being Members of the Mys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Spous of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. To be a Schismatique in their judgment was as bad as to be a Heathen, and an obstinate continuance in a state of Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation was esteemed by them as a renouncing of Christianitie. If they had understood <hi>the whole
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:108855:90"/>
Companie of the Faithfull</hi> in the Drs. way, they would never have drawn such Arguments as they do from the Authoritie of the Church, and the obligation there is of living in a visible Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with it, when they disputed against Heretiques and Schismatiques, becaus those miserable Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might have had the same plea against them, as the Dr. has against us, viz that they were <hi>bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,</hi> and held the same <hi>Fundamental</hi> Faith with them, and therefore were as much Members of the Catholique Church as they, seing the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church is <hi>the whole Companie of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,</hi> and as such has no Authoritie, neither does Obedience belong to the Notion of it.</p>
            <p n="58">58. The word <hi>Ecclesia</hi> or Church signifies in Greek an Assemblie or meeting of men, and is indifferently applied to unbelievers as wel as to believers, as appears out of the 25. <hi>Psalm. I have hated the Church of the wicked,</hi> as likewise <hi>Acts</hi> 19. where we read, that after the Heathen Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer had quieted the People, he said to them, <hi>If ye have any enquirie into other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful Church,</hi> that is, in a <hi>Church</hi> of Ephesians who worshipped Diana. In which places Protestans expresse the word <hi>Church</hi> by <hi>Congregation</hi> and <hi>Assemblie,</hi> altho the Greek word be the same as in Latin, but since the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of the Gospel the word <hi>Church</hi> has for it's common and principal signification those who believe in Christ.</p>
            <p n="59">
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:108855:91"/>
59. The Fathers called the Catholique Church <hi>the whole Companie of the Faithfull</hi> in Christ Iesus, 1. with relation to Christ who is their Mystical Head whilst they are Obedient to their Pastors. 2. Becaus Faith is the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marie Mark of distinction of the Church on Earth from the Church in Heaven, which sees and enjoys those glorious things which we believe, and hope for. 3. Of the Church of Christ from the Church of the Iews, who believed in God by Moses and not by Christ. 4. Of the Church of Christ from Pagans, whose Religion was not revealed by God, but establis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed by the professed enemie of God and his Church. Faith is the beginning of our Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual life on which all it's succeeding Motions depend; it immediately and directly regards God as it's proper Object, which Obedience to Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle siastical Superiours does not, and therefore it is no wonder, if the Fathers call the Church <hi>the whole Companie of the Faithfull in Christ Iesus</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mentioning Obedience. They designed this Notion rather to diversifie the Church of Christ from all such multitudes as did not believe him to have been sent by God, than from those who were not Members his Mystical Bodie, altho they pretended to believe in him. As for this sort of People, they had another Notion of the Church for them, as is manifest out of S. Cyprian, who sais <hi>Ep.</hi> 69. <hi>ad Florent. Pup.</hi> that <hi>the Church is the People united tot he Priest, and the Flock cleaving
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:108855:91"/>
to theit Pastors;</hi> from which Principle this Holie Martyr concludes in several places, that those who are disunited from their Pastors are no Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Christ's Bodie. There was no such need of mentioning Ecclesiastical Obedience in the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church in respect of those who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved not in Christ: but those who believe, or pretend to believe in him, and yet are not of his Bodie, ought to be put in mind by such a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as particularly regards their condition, of the subjection which they ow to their Pastors whom they have forsaken, and that those whom they follow, are not Pastors but wolues, becaus they are not sent by Christ, whom they believe to have been sent by God.</p>
            <p n="60">60. Besides, the Fathers proved the Faith of <hi>the whole Companie of the Faithfull</hi> by the same Motives of Credibilitie as we do now, viz by Succession of Pastors, Antiquitie, Universalitie, Miracles &amp;c. Which Marks as they made the Faith evidently Credible, so they left no room to doubt, whether Christians were bound to obey their Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors under the penaltie of forfeiting their Mys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Union to Christ, becaus this Point being believed by the Church became as Credible as any other. So that the Christians of their times had no more reason to question, whether Obedience to their Ecclesiastical Superiours were necessarie to Catholique Communion, becaus the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church is <hi>the whole Companie of the Faithfull,</hi>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:108855:92"/>
than Dr. Sherlock has to hold that nothing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> is necessarie to salvation besides Faith and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, becaus he reads in Scripture, that <hi>he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> be the word of God, prove an obligation of performing every Command of God which is contained therin, so those Motives of Credibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie which proved the Faith of <hi>the whole Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of the Faithfull,</hi> proved an obligation of being Obedient to Ecclesiastical Superiours, becaus the was a Doctrin which was believed by <hi>the whole Companie of the Faithfull.</hi> So that this Notion of the Catholique Church cannot be said to exclude, but virtually to include Obedience to Ecclesistical Superiours, becaus it includes every Point of Faith, which was belived by <hi>the whole Companie of the Faithfull,</hi> wherof Obedience to Ecclesistical Superiours was one.</p>
            <p n="61">61. Supposing any one should take the same advantage against the Dr. from S. Cyprian's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition, as he takes against us from <hi>the whole Companie of the Faitfull,</hi> and prove that Faith is not necessarie to wards being a Member of Christ's Church, becaus it is not mentioned in S. Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian's Definition of a Church, no more than Obedience is expressed in the Definition that lies before us: what answer would he return to this Objection, which has so great a resemblance with that which he has made against us? If he say
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:108855:92"/>
that Faith is included in Obedience to Ecclesiastical Superiours; I answer, that Obedience is as much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in Faith, and therefore either no advantage can be taken against us from the Churche's being defined <hi>the whole Companie of the Faithful,</hi> or else the same advantage may be taken against him from S. Cyprian's Definition.</p>
            <p n="62">62. If he say 2. that S. Cyprian's Definition belongs onely to a particular Church, which he seems desirous that we should believe, becaus P. 34. he has fairly remitted the consideration of it to his second Part wherin he has promised to give us the Notion of a particular Church; I answer, that the true meaning of S. Cyprian's Definition will be best known from the occasion which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced him to deliver it, which was this. One Florentius Pupianus had withdrawn himselfe from the Communion of the Church, and, as it seems, had betaken himselfe to the Novatians. He writes to S.

            <p n="63">63. Now there can be no dispute, but that the
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:108855:93"/>
Father designs this Definition of a Church to serve as wel for a particular Church as for the Church Catholik, becaus the words in themselves are very general, and besides his known Doctrin is through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his works that particular Bishops are essential to particular Churches. But then his defining on the one hand the Universal Flock of Christ by the Power which Bishops have over the People, and the Union which the People ought to have with their Bishops, and on the other side affirming that the Universal Church, that is, the whole multitude of Bishops with their respective Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were <hi>built</hi> upon Peter, and that this Apostle spoke in the name of the universal Church, that is, of the other Apostles and the Faithfull when he said, <hi>Lord, thou hast the words of Eternal life</hi> &amp;c, is a clear Argument, that he meant that the universal Flock of Christ should be united to S. Peter's Successors, as wel as particultr Bodies of Christians ought to be united to their respective Bishops who are the Successors of the other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles. For as according to him it was necessarie in the Apostles time, that particular Christians before they could be a Church, should be either immediately united to the Apostles, or to such Bishops as the Apostles had set over them, and that the Apostles and Bishops with their respec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Flocks should be all united to S. Peter on whom the whole Church was <hi>built,</hi> so it is no lesse necessarie now in S. Cyprian's judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:108855:94"/>
that all the Bishops in the World with their Flocks should be united to S. Peter's Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors, who inherit from this first Apostle the Prerogative and Right of having the whole Church of their times <hi>built</hi> on them, as the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors of the other Apostles inherit the Right of making their respective Flocks to be particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Churches, or having their Churches <hi>built</hi> on them. Which is the onely reason why particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Bishops belong to the Definition of particu-Churches. And therefore seing all particular Churches with their Flocks are in S. Cyprian's judgment <hi>built</hi> on S. Peter and his Successors, the Successors of S. Peter ought in like manner to belong to the Definition of the Catholique Church and Universal Flock of Christ. It is most evident, that the Church for which S. Cyprian designed this Definition in this passage, is the Church which was <hi>built</hi> on S. Peter consisting of Pastors and their Flocks, and which <hi>does not depart from Christ</hi> notwithstanding that never so manie <hi>proud</hi> and <hi>stubborn multitudes depart from her,</hi> which no man of sense will denie to be the Catholique Church. And altho he immediately adde after the Definition, that <hi>the Bishop is in the Church, and the Church in the Bishop,</hi> in which Claus he may mean by the word <hi>Church</hi> a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church considering the Schismatique a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst whom he wrote, yet this is onely an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of his general Doctrin about the Church
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:108855:94"/>
to a particular case, and can be no ways prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to what I have said, seing particular Churches are called the Catholique Church as being parts of it, and, as S. Cyprian sais, becaus they are all <hi>built</hi> on Peter. Besides, it may be as truly said and as properly in S. Cyprian's way of S. Peter's Successors as of any particular Bishop, that <hi>they are in the Church,</hi> and that <hi>the Church is in them,</hi> seing the whole Church is <hi>built</hi> upon them, which is that which he means below, when he sais, <hi>who forsakes the Chair of Peter, upon whom the Church is built, does he hope that he is in the Church?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="64">64. This appears to be the true meaning of S. Cyprian's Definition in several places of his works, where he makes an Union of all the parts of the Church to S. Peter's Chair to be necessarie to the Unitie of the whole Church, as in his 40. <hi>Ep.</hi> to his People where he sais, <hi>Deus unus est, &amp; Christus unus, &amp; una Ecclesia, &amp; Cathedra una super Petrum Domini voce fundata, There is One God, One Church, and One Chair established on Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by our Lord's voice.</hi> Which words denote a necessitie of believing all they import no lesse than that saying of S. Paul <hi>One Lord, One Faith, One Baptisme,</hi> nay they seem onely the same thing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in other terms. And in his 45. <hi>Ep.</hi> to Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius he calls the Roman Church <hi>Ecclesiae Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licae radicem &amp; matricem, The Root and Matrix of the Catholique Church. And in his</hi> 55. <hi>Ep.</hi> to Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius he calls <hi>S. Peter's Chair the Principal Church</hi>

thus,</hi> The caus wherof, <hi>sais he,</hi> most beloved Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, is becaus men will not return to the Origin of Truth, nor seek after the Head, nor observe the Doctrin of our Heavenly Master, which whoever will but consider and examin, he will not stand in need of long reasonings and Arguments. The proof of Faith is easie through the compendiousnesse of truth. Our Lord sais to Peter, I say to thee that thou art Peter, and upon this Rock will I build my Church, and the gates of hel shall not overcome it. And will give thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, and what thou bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest upon Earth, shall be bound in Heaven; and what thou loosest on Earth. shall be loosed in Heaven. And again he sais to him after his Resurrection, feed my sheep. He builds his Church upon him alone, and gives him his sheep to feed; and altho he gave equal Power to all the Apostles after his Resurrection, and said, As my Father sent me, so I send you, Receive the H. Ghost, whose sins ye forgive, they are forgiven, and whose sins ye retain, they are retained: Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse to the end he might declare unitie, he constituted One Chair, and appointed by his Authoritie that the Origin of the same unitie should be from one. What Peter was the other Apostles were also, they being all endowed with an equal participation of Honour and Power; But the beginning proceeds from unitie. The Primacie is given to Peter, that there might be shown to be One Church of Christ and One Chair. And they were all Pastors, and but one Flock ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, which was to be fed by the unanimous consent
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:108855:96"/>
of all the Apostles. Which One Church is deciphered in the Canticle of Canticles by the H. Ghost in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of our Lord, when he sais, My Dove is One, my perfect one, the onely one of her Mother, and the choice one of her that brought her forth. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever does not hold this unitie of the Church, does he believe that he holds the Faith? Who resists and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels against the Church, who forsakes the Chair of Peter upon which the Church is built, does he hope that he is in the Church?</p>
            <p n="67">67, These passages afford as good a light as any impartial enquirer can desire for understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the true meaning of S. Cyprian' Definition of a Church. For here we have, that Christ <hi>built his Church upon Peter alone</hi> (super illum unum), and that he <hi>gave him his sheep to feed,</hi> that he <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted One Chair and established it on Peter,</hi> that this <hi>One Chair is the beginning of the Priestly unitie,</hi> that is, of the Ecclesiastical and visible Unitie of the Church, and that the <hi>Primacie was given to Peter,</hi> to the end <hi>Christ's Church might be shown to be One.</hi> All which places show a Jurisdiction, and Superioritie which this Apostle had over his Brethren, and by consequence a Jurisdiction which his Successors have had over their Brethren the other Bishops in every Age of the Church since him.</p>
            <p n="68">68. For what signifies the <hi>building of the Church upon Peter alone,</hi> but that he as the Principle and <hi>Origin</hi> of the Church's Unitie was to make it One
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:108855:97"/>
Visible Bodie by the Union of subordination; which all his Brethren and their Flocks had to him? <hi>The Church was built upon him alone,</hi> inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as he was made the <hi>beginning of the Priestly unitie,</hi> for seing the <hi>Priestly unitie</hi> is essential to the Visible Church as such, <hi>the Church was built upon him alone,</hi> becaus it was necessarily to be One with him, and could not subsist without this Union. And seing the Church cannot be One with Peter, nor be united to his Successors as the <hi>beginnings of the</hi> Visible and <hi>Priestly unitie,</hi> but by means of Obedience and Communion with them, it follows, that all the Members of the Catholique Church ought to be Obedient to them and in Communion whith them. What signifies our Lord's saying to Peter alone, <hi>Feed my sheep,</hi> but that he gave him a special Iurisdiction which was not common to his Brethren? For <hi>feeding</hi> in the H. Scripture is a word which imports Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and a Power of correcting, teaching &amp;c. And here by the way methinks Protestants should be more sparing of their wittie jests against us for alledging this Text to prove the <hi>Primacie</hi> of S. Peter, seing we have so good an Authoritie as that of S. Cyprian for what we do. What sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies the <hi>One Chair</hi> of S. Peter, but a <hi>Chair</hi> of Iurisdiction paramount to all other Churches, being called <hi>One</hi> by way of excellence and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as having a superioritie over all other Sees without having any See Superiour over it? For
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:108855:97"/>
which reason it is called the <hi>root, Matrix,</hi> and <hi>Origin of the</hi> Ecclesiastical and <hi>Priestly unitie.</hi> No doubt, but that there are more Chairs and Sees in the Catholique Church than One, and this S. Cyprian knew wel enough (as we shall see presently), but there is onely one, and that S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's <hi>Chair,</hi> which has an Universal superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence over all the rest, as being the <hi>beginning of the Priestly unitie.</hi> What signifies the <hi>Primacie which was given to S. Peter,</hi> and this absolutely without any modification, or qualifying words? Let the Dr. be ingenuous and confesse with me, that the reason which S. Cyprian gives why a <hi>Primacie</hi> was granted to him, shows that it was a <hi>Primacie</hi> of Iurisdiction, which as it is the onely <hi>Primacie</hi> which can make the Catholique Church One, so it is the onely <hi>Primacie</hi> which can afford a convincing Argument, or <hi>show</hi> that it is One, which is the expresse reason why S. Cyprian sais, that the <hi>Primacie</hi> was given to Peter (<hi>ut una Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>ecedence to S. Peter might be a means of preventing any pretentions to the same in the Successors of the other Apostles, yet it could not afford any remedie against other Schisms, nor be in any tollerable sense the <hi>Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:108855:98"/>
of the Priestly unitie.</hi> Neither could this be so great a favour as might deserve to be called the <hi>building of the Church upon Peter,</hi> no more more than the Peers of England (under which Notion they are all equal) may be said to be <hi>built</hi> upon any one in particular among them, who has a <hi>Primacie</hi> of Precedence over the rest. S. Cyprian's Doctrin is reconcileable to no other <hi>Primacie</hi> than that of Jurisdiction and Power. Lastly, what reason can there be, why any man may not reasonably <hi>hope</hi> that he is in the Church, and that he <hi>holds the Faith,</hi> altho he <hi>forsake the Chair of Peter,</hi> if an Union to this <hi>Chair</hi> be not necessarie to Catholique Communion? And if it be necessarie to Catholique Communion, it is evident that S. Peter's Successors are the <hi>root, Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,</hi> and <hi>Principle</hi> of Unitie to the whole Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church, and by consequence that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Definition of it.</p>
            <p n="69">69. Here comes the cauilling Objection of Protestants against S. Peter's <hi>Primacie</hi> of Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, becaus S. Cyprian affirms a Paritie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Apostles, when he sais, that our Lord <hi>gave equal Power to all the Apostles after his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,</hi> and that <hi>what Peter was the other Apos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles were also, they being all endowed with an equal participation of Honour and Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="70">70. For the clearing of this Point the Dr. may pleas to take notice, that in the Ordination of the Apostles (and the same happens in the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:108855:98"/>
of Bishops and Priests) we may consider two Powers, the one of <hi>Order,</hi> and the other of <hi>Iurisidiction.</hi> By the <hi>Power of Order</hi> I mean a spiritual qualitie, guift, abilitie, or capacitie whereby the person Ordained is enabled to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme all those Functions, which our Lord has annexed to men of this condition. And by the <hi>Power of Iurisdiction</hi> I mean a lawful Power of putting this guift, qualitie, abilitie, or capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in execution. The first Power imports that the Apostle, or Bishop, or Priest by vertue of his ordination is qualified by our Lord for his special service, but does not of it's own nature import a call to the actual exercise which he is designed for. The second Power imports not onely the aforesaid qualification, but likewise a call to the actual performance of our Lord's work.</p>
            <p n="71">71. The <hi>Power of Order</hi> is One and the same throughout all the Bishops of the Catholique Church, as the Faith of the Church is the same through all it's parts. And as the Faith is not multiplied by the multiplicitie of persons who professe it, so the <hi>Power</hi> of the Episcopal <hi>Order</hi> is not multiplied by the multiplicitie of persons who enjoy it. It is One, becaus it proceeds from Christ the <hi>One Lord.</hi> It is One, becaus it is the Power of preaching the same Faith, and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistring the same Sacraments. It is One, becaus it is directed to the same end viz the <hi>edifying of
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:108855:99"/>
the Bodie of Christ,</hi> and the governing, feeding, and illuminating the souls of the Faithfull, who are committed to their care. Lastly, and in one word, it is One, becaus there is not any one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which S. Peter's Successors can do, which any Bishop in God's Church may not in like manner do <hi>vi Ordinis;</hi> neither is there any thing which hinders the meanest among them from being P pes, but onely the want of the Popes <hi>Iurisdiction.</hi> The same Unitie of the <hi>Power of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> is likewise to be seen in the Old Law, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in all the male descendants from Aaron were Priests alike, their birth making them capable of attending on God's Altar, as Order enables Bishops and Priests to performe their respective Functions in the Church of Christ. The <hi>Power of Iurisdiction</hi> on the other hand is different and unequal, more or Iesse, according to the different degrees and steps in the Hierarchie, as in Popes, Patriarchs, Primats, and Bishops, who par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take all of them in their respective stations so much of the Jurisdiction of Christ's Priesthood, as is requisit for the due goverment of the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Flock which is committed to their charge. And thus it was likewise in the Jewish Church, where the Jurisdiction of the High Priest was much greater than that of his infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Brethren, altho they were descended from Aaron no lesse than himselfe. Whence we find <hi>Num.</hi> 20. that God upon the death of Aaron
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:108855:99"/>
commanded Elcazar his Son to put on his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's garments, by which is signified, that as Aaron's Successor he was to take upon him the fulnesse of his <hi>Iurisdiction.</hi> These two Powers of <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Iurisdiction</hi> are apparently distinct; for Dr. Sherlock knows wel enough, that a Bishop who is Canonically suspended, or excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated is as much a Bishop aster he is censured as he was before, if we speak of the <hi>Power of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> which he received at his Consecration. On which account he is not to be Ordained again upon his reconciliation to the Church, and read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to his Bishoprique, but onely entitled anew to his former <hi>Iurisdiction,</hi> and the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full exercise of his Functions, which he had lost by incurring the Censures of the Church. Which is a demonstrative Argument to prove the distinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and separabilitie of these two Powers.</p>
            <p n="72">72. Now this distinction of Powers in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles and Bishops at their Consecration gives an easie solution to the Objection. For when S. Cyprian sais, that our Lord <hi>gave equal Power to all the Apostles after his Resurrection,</hi> and that <hi>what Peter was the other Apostles were also, they being all endowed with an equal participation of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Power,</hi> he means, that our Lord gave them all the <hi>same Honour and power of Order,</hi> and that Peter was no more an Apostle than his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, nor any <hi>beginning of their unitie</hi> inasmuch as he was an Apostle, which are truths which
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:108855:100"/>
we acknowledge as wel as S. Cyprian. But when he sais, that Christ <hi>built his Church upon Peter alone, and gave him his sheep to feed,</hi> and made him <hi>Primat;</hi> here we must necessarily say, that altho he had given him and his Brethren before <hi>the same honour and power of Order,</hi> and toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the <hi>Power of Order</hi> the same <hi>Power of Iurisdiction,</hi> when he said, <hi>As my Father sent me, so I send you</hi> &amp;c (which was at the first time that he appeared to his Apostles after his Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, (see S. John's Gospel Ch. 20.): yet that he gave to Peter alone a special <hi>power of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction</hi> as the first Apostle, when he said <hi>Feed my sheep</hi> (which was at the third time that he shewed himselfe to his Apostles after his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection (see S. Iohn's Gospel Ch. 21.) and by consequence, that he made him the <hi>begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nig of the Apostles unitie,</hi> and by consequence that he gave him a special <hi>Honour,</hi> if it be an Honour to be a <hi>Primat,</hi> as it most certainly is. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in S. Cyprian's judgment he gave to all the Apostles <hi>the same power,</hi> and not <hi>the same power;</hi> the <hi>same power</hi> of <hi>Order,</hi> and not the same <hi>power of Iurisdiction; the same Honour,</hi> and not <hi>the same Honour; the same Honour of Order,</hi> and not <hi>the same Honour of Iurisdiction.</hi> For whenever God bestows an Honour upon his servants he always grounds it upon some guift which he confers on them at the same time. For which reason we must say, that when S. Cyprian affirms the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>

               </hi>
               <pb n="183" facs="tcp:108855:100"/>
to have been <hi>given to Peter,</hi> that he held this <hi>Honour</hi> to have been accompanied with a special guift which was not common to his Brethren, and which can be nothing else but the <hi>power of Iurisdiction.</hi> So that Protestants are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to solve this difficultie as wel as Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, supposing there be any obscuritie in S. Cyprian's words. And from this solution which I have given to them, I shall propose one diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie more to their consideration, which is this. Either our Lord gave Peter a special <hi>Honour</hi> when he gave him the <hi>Primacie,</hi> or he gave him none. If he gave him none, let them show, how God conld give a Spiritual guift and of so great moment as the <hi>Primacie</hi> was without giving a special <hi>Honour.</hi> And if he gave him a special <hi>Honour</hi> when he gave him the <hi>Primacie,</hi> let them show, how our Lord <hi>endowed all the Apostles with an equal participation of Honour,</hi> when he gave the <hi>Primacie</hi> onely to Peter,</p>
            <p n="73">73. It is this Superiour Iurisdiction of S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's Successors which makes the Catholik Church <hi>One Bishoprique,</hi> as S. Cyprian asserts it to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the long passage, which I have quoted out of him in these words, <hi>Episcopatus unus est, cujus a singulis in solidum pars tenetur.</hi> Which place our Author in his <hi>Vindic. of some Protest. princip p.</hi> 34. translates thus. <hi>There is One Episcopacie, part of which every Bishop holds with full Authoritie and Power.</hi> And he sais, that by <hi>One Episcopacie S. Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:108855:101"/>
understands One Bishoprik that is, the universal Church, which as it is but One Church, so it is but One Bishoprique also,</hi> it being all under the Episcopal government, that is, under a multitude of Bishops who govern their respective parts of it with the whole Episcopal Authoritie. This is set down by him as a choice Principle against the B. of Rome's Universal Pastorship, altho he say that <hi>all lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men are a litle puzzled</hi> at the meaning of it.</p>
            <p n="74">74. Here are two things to be considered; the one, in what sense it is that S. Cyprian af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms the, Catholique Church to be <hi>One Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rique;</hi> the other, in what sense it is that <hi>every Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop holds part of this One Bishoprique with full Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie and power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="75">75. <hi>The Catholique Church is One Bishoprique,</hi> which he shows thus in his Book last cited <hi>p.</hi> 77, <hi>S. Cyprian,</hi> sais he, <hi>tels us that there is but One Bishoprique, and therefore all the Bishops who are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> and plenitude of power. And thus we have found out but One Bishop for the One Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church, all the Bishops in the world being but one; for tho they are manie distinct persons, they</hi>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:108855:101"/>
are but one Power, and exercise the same Office without division, and multiplication.</p>
            <p n="76">76. I cannot but think, that this Author has proceeded <hi>mala fide,</hi> and against the light of his conscience in fathering upon S. Cyprian the new models of Ecclesiastical Politie which he has laid in some of his writings. And I can never desire a better Argument to justifie this censure, than the instance of this passage which lies under ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, viz that <hi>the Catholique Church is One Bishoprique.</hi> For he cannot be ignorant, that all the aforesaid quotations out of S. Cyprian, viz that the Church is <hi>built upon Peter alone,</hi> that the <hi>Primacie was given to him,</hi> that <hi>our Lord establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed his one Chair,</hi> and made it the <hi>beginning of the Priestly unitie</hi> &amp;c, are truly to be found in his works, and he is a man of too good natural parts not to see what a fair appearance they carrie of proving the Universal Pastorship of the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors of S. Peter over the Catholique Church, which makes the Catholique Church <hi>one Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rique.</hi> Which required at least, that he should have endeavoured to put another meaning on them, than that which they suggest to our thoughts as soon as we read them, or hear them spoken, before he had provided the Catholique Church with any other Bishop than S. Peter's Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor: and yet he passes them all over in a deep si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and onely culls out this passage, and two or
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:108855:103"/>
more which he thinks he can deal wel enough withal when he has them alone, and by the help of an odde speculation for which he can produce no grounds out of S. Cyprian, he makes them bear a sense quite contrarie to S. Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an's, as you shall see.</p>
            <p n="77">77. For that which makes a Church <hi>One Bishoprique</hi> is <hi>One Chair,</hi> or One Hereditarie Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Jurisdiction. And therefore that which makes the Catholique Church <hi>One Bishoprique</hi> is <hi>One Chair,</hi> or One Hereditarie Episcopal Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction. Which <hi>One Chair,</hi> or One Heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Episcopal Iurisdiction, S. Cyprian sais, <hi>was establishedon Peter by our Lord's own voice.</hi> And therefore in S. Cyprian's judgment the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church is <hi>one Bishoprique</hi> by means of S. Peter's <hi>one Chair.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="78">78. Again. That which makes a Church <hi>one Bishoprique</hi> is becaus it is <hi>built</hi> on One Bishop. And therefore that which makes the Catholique Church <hi>one Bishoprique</hi> must be, becaus it is <hi>built</hi> on One Bishop; which S Cyprian sais our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour has done upon S. Peter, when he sais, that he has <hi>built his Church,</hi> or the Catholique Church <hi>upon him alone.</hi> And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <hi>Bishoprique</hi> in S. Cyprian's Judgment which

was the Centre, <hi>beginning,</hi> and <hi>root of the</hi> Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical, and <hi>Priestly unitie.</hi> But the <hi>one Chair</hi> of S. Peter was in his judgment the Centre, <hi>begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> and <hi>root of the</hi> Ecclesiastical, and <hi>Priestly unitie.</hi> Therefore the <hi>one Chair</hi> of S.

If there be any thing amisse in this Syllogisme, it shall be cleared in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing paragraph.</p>
            <p n="80">80. These Arguments and several others that may be formed out of S. Cyprian strongly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade any sincere searcher after truth, that he held the Successors of S. Peter to be the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Bishops over the Catholique Church. And the onely way the Dr. can have to show the contrarie, is to prove that the <hi>Priestly unitie</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of S. Cyprian sais that the <hi>Chair</hi> of S. Peter is the <hi>beginning,</hi> is not such an Unitie from whence we can lawfully infer, that S. Peter's Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors make the Catholique Church <hi>one Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rique.</hi> And to this end he must let us know dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly, wherin this Unitie consists which takes it's rise from S. Peter's <hi>Chair,</hi> as also what that special priviledge was which our Saviour gave to S. Peter above his Brethren, for which S. Cyprian sais that <hi>the Church was built upon him alone,</hi> seing it is evident <hi>ad Eph.</hi> 2. that the Church was also <hi>built upon the other Apostles</hi> by means of some Graces and Priviledges which were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to them with S. Peter. For my part I have
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:108855:102"/>
diligently read S. Cyprian, and cannot find any one passage in him after all things are wel weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and considered, which seems of any force to persuade me, that he did not intend in these places, and others of the like nature to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that S. Peter and his Successors have a Power of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> as <hi>Primats</hi> over all the Bishops throughout the world, which unites and cements them all together into <hi>one</hi> Bodie and <hi>Bishoprique</hi> by means of the reciprocal ties of Commands and Obedience, which are the nerves and sinews without which One Church and <hi>one Bishoprique</hi> can neither subsist, nor be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. The Union of manie moral parts together (as it is in an Armie) supposes a dependance on their <hi>beginning of unitie</hi> to conserve them in a state of Union, and this dependance of the parts supposes a Superioritie of influence which their Principle of Unitie has over them. And unlesse these grounds be admitted in the explication of S. Cyprian's word's, it will be impossible to make out, how <hi>the Church was built upon Peter alone,</hi> and how his <hi>Chair</hi> is the <hi>beginning of the Priestly unitie,</hi> which is most evidently his Doctrin. This Superiour Power of Iurisdiction in S. Peter's Successors is not onely the <hi>beginning of the Priestly unitie,</hi> but of the Unitie of their Flocks too. For seing in S. Cyprian's judgment a Church is <hi>the Flock cleaving to their Pastor,</hi> the People must be necessarily One by the same Kind of Unitie
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:108855:104"/>
which ioyns their Bishops together, which being their Union to <hi>One Apostle,</hi> or to the <hi>One Chair</hi> of S. Peter, it follows that the whole Church both Clergie and Laitie must be One by the same means. S. Cyprian <hi>Loc. cit. de unit. Eccles.</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes this Universal dependance and Union which all the Members of the Church have with S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's <hi>Chair</hi> by several fit similitudes, as by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring them to manie <hi>rays of light,</hi> which make but One light by means of the sun from whence they all proceed; to <hi>manie boughs</hi> of a tree, which are all united in their root, and to <hi>manie rivers,</hi> which flow from the same head, which are all united in their source. <hi>If you go to separate,</hi> sais he, <hi>a ray from the Sun, the unitie of light is unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of division; if you break a bough from the tree, it will not grow after it is broken off; and if you divide a river from the source, it will drie up after the division is made. Thus the Church of God shining also with light stretches forth her rays throughout the world, and yet the light which is spread every where is but one, neither is there any division made in the unitie of the whole; she extends her boughs into all Countries through her abounding fruitfulnesse, she widely opens her vast rivers, and yet there is but One Head, and One beginning,</hi> which is that which makes the Catholike Church to be One Church, and <hi>One Bishoprique.</hi> And thus we have S. Cyprian's Doctrin pure and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed, as being lawfully inferred from his own
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:108855:104"/>
words and writings, without the help of the Drs. wild speculation, which can onely serve to put him in mind, that seing <hi>One Bishop</hi> is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie to make <hi>One Bishoprique,</hi> he ought not to seek after any other Bishop over it than the Successor of S. Peter, whom S. Cyprian calls the <hi>beginning of the Priestly unitie.</hi> And seing he has so great a deference for this Father, as to believe the Catholique Church to be <hi>One Bishoprique</hi> on his Authoritie, he ought in like manner to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of S. Peter's Successors for the Bishops over it on the same Authoritie too.</p>
            <p n="81">81. It ought to be no prejudice at all to S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's <hi>Primacie</hi> that we do not find in Scripture any evident and indisputable record, that he ever exercised any Superiour Iurisdiction over the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, becaus all the Apostles actions are not recounted in Scripture, and it is a very ill conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to say, that Peter or John never did this or that, becaus Scripture is silent therin. It is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, that the Scripture affords us good grounds from whence we may lawfully infer this Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Iurisdiction, which by the way was not to be exercised towards the other Apostles in matters of Faith, by reason of the perpetual as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance of the H. Ghost, which was promised them all alike in the discharge of their Functions; nor in matters of Disciplin neither, for what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to their particular persons, becaus as their eminent Sanctitie secured them from falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:108855:103"/>
any scandalous crimes, so it freed them from any danger of falling under the coercive Power of S. Peter's Censures. The onely solemne way then that seems to remain wherin he could exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cize his <hi>Primacie</hi> besides what we find in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, was by ratifying and confirming the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations that were taken for the publique Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplin, and government of the Church, in case that Uniformitie of Disciplin which appeared throughout the world after the Apostles deceas, were an effect of any common resolutions to this purpose before their separation among the Gentils, and did not proceed from the same Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Truth, and Prudence, and Goverment, which guided and directed each single Apostle to take such measures in the Politie of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince as were to be observed in all places after the same manner. So that considering the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain knowledge we have from Scripture of the particular cases wherin he did, or might exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise his <hi>Primacie,</hi> we must betake our selves to Tradition, which is the Supplement, and best in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter of Scripture, to know in what cases our Lord designed that the <hi>Primacie</hi> he had given him was to be exercised. And we learn from Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that S. Peter's Successors have in his Right put this Authoritie in practice on several occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which is an Argument, that it was inherent in the Person of Peter, altho <hi>per accidens</hi> it could be seldom put in execution by him. But after his
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:108855:105"/>
deceas, and the deceas of the other Apostles, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the Church grew up and together with years con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted vices, his Successors found amongst their Collegues more matter wheron to exercise their Jurisdiction, which being allowed by the Church ought to be considered by us as a sufficient evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of what he might have done, if he had found as ample a matter for his Jurisdiction, as he had an unquestionable Right to put it in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution whenever it should be offered.</p>
            <p n="82">82. There are two places which are usually alledged out of S. Cyprian to prove, that he did not hold any Superiour Jurisdiction in S. Peter's Successors over the other Bishops. The first is taken out of his Preface to his Council of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage wherin he sais, <hi>Quum habeat omnis Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus pro licentia libertatis &amp; potestatis suae arbitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um proprium, tanquam judicari ab alio non possit, cum nec ipse possit alterum judicare; sed expecte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus universi judicium Domini nostri Iesu Christi, qui unus &amp; solus habet potestatem &amp; praeponendi nos in Ecclesiae suae gubernatione, &amp; de actu nostro judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candi.</hi> In which words he seems to make our Lord Jesus Christ the onely Judge, and <hi>Primat</hi> over Bishops, and that they are accountable to no other Superiour for any measures they take in the Goverment of his Flock. I shall remit the full examination of this passage to <hi>Num.</hi> 199. <hi>&amp; seq.</hi> whither I refer the Reader for an en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>re satisfaction, and shall onely take notice here,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:108855:105"/>
that if this Doctrin be taken as it lies, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a fovourable explication, it wholly destroys any Power in the Church to Censure Heretical and Schismatical Bishops, which this Author as great a friend as he is to the Episcopal Power is unwilling to denie, as we shall see presently. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could 8. Cyprian with any consequence to such a Principle advise S. Stephen B. of Rome (as he does <hi>Ep.</hi> 67.) to excommunicate, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose Marcianus B. of Arles for Heresie and Schisme, when he writ thus to him, <hi>Facere t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and Schisme as Marcian was, we shall have very good grounds to believe, that he holds the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie</hi> of S. Peter's Successors. For here we have
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:108855:106"/>
a Power of deposing and casting an Heretical and Schismatical Archbishop out of the Church, and of commanding his Diocesans and Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Bishops (who had in those time's the Right of Election) to chuse another, which is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and one of the most principal exercises of that universal care and Superioritie, which the B. B. of Rome have over their Brethren, and which S. Cyprian meant by calling them the <hi>beginning of the Priestly unitie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="83">83. The other passage it out of his 55. <hi>Epist.</hi> to Cornelius B. of Rome wherin he acquaints him, that the Affrican Churches had resolved in a Provincial Council, <hi>ut uniuscujusque causa illic audiatur ubi crimen est admissum,</hi> that every one's Caus should be heard in the place where he committed his crime. From whence it seems to follow, that the Churches of Affrique did not believe the <hi>Chair</hi> of S. Peter to have had any Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour Iurisdiction over any Church-men what soever, who were not of the proper Province and District of Rome.</p>
            <p n="84">84. I answer, that this Canon relates onely to the Crimes of Immoralitie, and breach of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plin &amp;c. and not of Infidelitie such as Herefie is, as appears from the occasion which S. Cyprian had to cite it, as likewise from what he sais af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, that the criminals ought to plead their Caus in the place where their accusers are, and those who can bear witnesse against them, <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portet
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:108855:106"/>
illic agere causam suam, ubi &amp; accusatores habere, &amp; testes criminis sui possint.</hi> For in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Doctrin a man carries his accusers and witnesses about him, let him go whither he will to have his Caus tried; and whoever renounces, and denies the errour he is charged withal is <hi>ipso facto</hi> to be accounted innocent, seing no man can be a heretique without an obstinate resolution to continue in his errour, which is to be known by his own confession, and not by interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting witnesses. And if he declare, that he will persist in his errour, he is never the nearer being acquitted, altho he produce never so manie wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses who abet his Doctrin, unlesse he can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the concurrent testimonies of at least the greatest part of the Bishops of the Catholique Church in his favour, which if he be sure of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand, there is no reason to fear, either that the Catholique Bishops of the Countrie where he lives, or S. Peter's Successors will either cite him, or question him as an Heretique for any tenet which he holds on so good an Authoritie. This was the reason why S. Cyprian advised S. Stephen to do summarie justice upon Marcianus, becaus the Doctrin of Novatian which he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely professed, was condemned by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops all the world over. Indeed it may happen, that an obstinate Heretique may conceal his sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, in which case his Heterodox belief is to be detected by overt-acts, and this requires that

witnesses be produced to prove them; but this was a thing not likely to happen often in S. Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian's days, seing the reason why men gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally conceal their private belief is the discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which they find from the secular Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate, who seconds the sentence of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Judge with temporal punishments; which could not be apprehended in those times from the Roman Princes, who made no distinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Catholiques and Heretiques, seing they passed all alike under the name of Christians. This shows, that the Canon ought to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood so as to prohibit the hearing of any Crimes, which were against good manners, or the like in any forreign Court. For as for the Superioritie which the <hi>Chair</hi> of S. Peter has over Bishops in cases of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> and Schisme, I think it plain e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough out of Marcian's case, which could not happen above four or five years after this Canon was signified to Cornelius, unlesse we say, that S. Cyprian and the Churches of Affrique had all changed their sentiments in so short a time, which is a thing incredible without a good attestation from Historie.</p>
            <p n="85">85. I do not intend to affirme here, that this Canon forbids indifferently the Causes of Bishops as wel as of Priests to be tried in any forreign Court, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse it be in cases of Heresie. For no such thing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in S. Cyprian, whose Authoritie alone I relie upon at present for the establishment of the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:108855:107"/>
Superiour Jurisdiction of S. Peter's Successors, what ever grounds there may be alledged for this Opinion in the Age that followed S. Cyprian. Bishops have always had a special consideration allowed them both in their Causes, and in all their other concerns by the Church of God above Priests, and therefore considering S. Cyprian's silence in the matter, I think that no one ought to draw any such <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> out of the general words of this Canon, and this the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus if we carefully weigh the occasion which the Father had to cite it to S. Cornelius, we shall find that it relates meerly to the Causes of Priests, and not of Bishops. And that I may show this the more effectually, I will set down the occasion how it came to be cited, which was thus. There were five Priests, of very scandalous lives and conversations, the overthrowers of the publique Disciplin of the Church, the introducers of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, the Companions of Heretiques, and Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques, and such kinds of Outlaws, and who had been excommunicated by S. Cyprian in a Provincial Council, by name Fortunatus, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postus, Felix, Maximus, and Jovinus. This wicked crew procure Fortunatus to be made a Bishop, who being invested with the name of a Dignitie, which they thought might gain them some credit abroad in the Church, sends one Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licissimus who was their Ringleader with some others of their gang with letres to S. Cornelius
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:108855:108"/>
B. of Rome, who having before hand had a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of him out of Affrique, refused to receive his letres, or to communicate with him, and writ an account to S. Cyprian of what he had done. But this confident blade having hereupon given S. Cornelius very ill language, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to read his letres in publique before all the Brethren, he writ a second letre into Affrique, wherein S. Cyprian discovered some wavering and irresolution in him how he should proceed with this importune and vexatious person. Wherupon he writes this Epistle to S. Corneli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, and in the first place he puts him in mind of the intrepiditie and courage which Bishops ought to embrace as vertues proper, and in a singular manner requisit for the discharge of their duties; and not being wel assured, what the contents of the letres were which his Rebels had sent, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were accusations against himselfe, or that they disired to have their Caus tried at Rome, he arms himselfe against both these Heads; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the first, by laying open the enormous crimes for which they had been excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by him, and manie others of as heinous a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which the Brethren had informed him of, and which as yet had not come to a trial: and against the second, he alledges the aforesaid Canon, saying moreover, <hi>jam eorum causa cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nita est, jam de eis dict a sententia est, nec censurae congruit Sacerdotum mobilis atque inconstantis ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:108855:108"/>
levitate reprehendi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="86">86. We see here, that S. Cyprian considers this Caus as no other than that of simple Priests; for altho Fortunatus were a Bishop, yet this Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie was far from entitling him to the Priviledge of Bishops, becaus it was conferred upon him against the Spirit, Canons, and practice of God's Church by Heretiques, and Schismatiques who had no lawful Power to do it, and whilst he was under an actual Excommunication by a Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Council. S. Cyprian was too zealous a Pastor, and Christian to admit of a man's crime as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent plea to obtain a favour, and too wel ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the Maxims of natural equitie to allow an uniust Intruder the benefit of all the Claims, which belong to a just Possessor. And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly we find, that he treats him in this Epistle as a simple Priest, when he sais of him, <hi>Est unus de quinque Presbyteris jam pridem de Ecclesia pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fugis;</hi> and afterwards jumbles him with his ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merades as perfons who lay all alike under his lash, when he sais, <hi>Opertet eos quibus praesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus non circumcursare.</hi> Which manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding is very good Canon Law at this day in the Court of Rome, which allows no Priledge of Bishops to such as have assumed this Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie under a state of Excommunication, and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion against the Church.</p>
            <p n="87">87. And altho it be no good Canon Law <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> in this Court at present to maintain as S. Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:108855:109"/>
did with his Council, that Provincial Synods are such Sovereign Tribunals to determin the Causes of simple Priests, that there is no Appeal to be made from them to S. Peter's <hi>Chair,</hi> yet this Doctrin can afford no argument to prove, that the Churches of Affrique denied the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioritie of this <hi>Chair,</hi> no more than the oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the Churches of France make against several branches of the Prerogatives which are challenged by that See, evinces that they denio the superioritie of it over all the Churches in the world. Altho Catholiques acknowledge the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie</hi> of S. Peter's Successors to be <hi>Iure Divino,</hi> yet they do not hold every Prerogative which is claimed by them as a consequent of their <hi>Prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie</hi> to be <hi>Iure Divino.</hi> For the <hi>Primacie</hi> it selfe we have Scripture and Tradition, but we are to seek for the same degree of evidence for manie of it's branches. Which is the reason, why in the Histories of most other Christian Countries be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides France, we read of contentions that have happened between National Churches and the <hi>Chair</hi> of S. Peter, and the State engaged in the defence of their Churches, and Bishops, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Laws against encroachments upon them by the <hi>Chair</hi> of S. Peter, which onely shows, that they disallow of the exercise of the <hi>Prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie</hi> in certain cases for which they judge there neither stands reason, nor Tradition. And this they may do without renouncing the <hi>Primacie</hi>
               <pb n="201" facs="tcp:108855:109"/>
of that <hi>Chair,</hi> which in all such branches as are not evident by Tradition is under the regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church, either by means of expresse Canons made in General Councils, or by the Universal acceptation and admittance of them by the Church Diffusive. And whenever both these Conditions are wanting, Kingdoms and Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Churches may dispute with S. Peter's <hi>Chair,</hi> and stand out against any unjustifiable pretences of the same without any danger of separating themselves from this <hi>beginning of the Priestly unitie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="88">88. And this seems to have been the case of S. Cyprian and his Council when they enacted the aforesaid Canon. For we see evidently on the one hand, that he held the Church to have been <hi>built upon Peter alone,</hi> which contains the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the <hi>Primacie</hi> of the B.B. of Rome; and on the other hand we discover as clearly in the Case of Marcian, that he ascribes to S. Peter's <hi>Chair</hi> a Superiour Power of excommunicating, and deposing Heretical, and Schismatical Bishops, which is the proper exercise of this <hi>Primacie.</hi> What then can we say else of his refusing Priests, to have their Causes tried in any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Courts, but that he did not think that the Cognizance of these Causes appertained to S. Peter's <hi>Chair</hi> as a Right of it's <hi>Primacie?</hi> And he might possibly have had this ground for this judgment, becaus there was no Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to be found in the Affrican Churches of any
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:108855:110"/>
Priest's Caus that was ever tried at Rome. And perhaps in those early times of Christianitie, when Charitie, and humilitie, and penance were so much in vogue amongst Christians, this practice was so far from being allowed by the Universal acceptation of the Church Diffusive; that there were very few examples of the like nature to be heard of in any other parts of the Church. Which might induce him to believe, that the <hi>Primacie</hi> of S. Peter's <hi>Chair</hi> did not extend to the hearing and determining such Causes, and upon this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption he might procure a Canon to be made to this purpose, that his Clergie might be the more submissive and Obedient under his Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In which case the <hi>Primacie</hi> of S. Peter's <hi>Chair</hi> remains untouched, and there is onely a bar put to a doubtful consequent of it, which S. Cyprian would have allowed as wel as he did the other Point of excommunicating, and deposing Heretical and Schismatical Bishops, if he had had the like evidence for the one, as he had for the other. I think this Canon to be so far from prejudicing the <hi>Primacie</hi> of Power in S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Successors, that it is a strong Argument, that S. Cyprian and his Council believed this <hi>Prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie</hi> at the same time that thy made this Canon. For we cannot in reason judge, that so grave and wise an Assemblie as a Provincial Council of that Church was would make Constitutions and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons to prevent inconveniencies that were no
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:108855:110"/>
more than purely possible, as that was of Priest's removing their Causes to be tried at Rome, in case there was not a probable ground to apprehend lest this inconvenience should happen, which could be nothing else but the common belief of those Churches, that the B. B. of Rome had a <hi>Primacie</hi> over the whole world.</p>
            <p n="89">89. 11. <hi>Every Bishop holds part of the One Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoprique of the Catholique Church with full Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie and Power.</hi> These words (supposing they are rightly translated) may signifie first, either an equalitie of Iurisdidiction in Bishops, which makes them independent of any one or more of their Collegues in matters of Government, under which Notion are comprised all things relating to Faith, Moralitie, and Disciplin; so that by the Law of Christ, and their Original Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they are not bound to accept of any Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal regulations in any matter contained under any of the aforesaid three Heads, unlesse they voluntarily, and of their own <hi>proper Motion</hi> and consent are pleased to ratifie, and accept of the same: Or 2. that they all equally and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately receive from Christ the Authoritie and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction whereby they act in the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Flocks, altho their Acts of Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction be under the regulation of and dependant on One or more of their Collegues, to whom they are bound to submit their consciences, and private reason, as being the Rule which they
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:108855:111"/>
ought to follow in the lawful exercise of their Jurisdiction. So that by <hi>full Authoritie and Power</hi> be meant an equal relation which they have all to Christ whose Vicars they are, and from whom they immediately receive their Jurisdiction, and not an equalitie of extent in the <hi>matter,</hi> and use of their Jurisdiction.</p>
            <p n="90">90. The first of these senses is Dr. Sherlock's in his aforesaid <hi>Vindication,</hi> but is none of S. Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian's. For S. Cyprian holds, that all the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops in the Church are One among themselves by being all united to S. Peter's <hi>Chair,</hi> which is the <hi>beginning of their unitie;</hi> And this Union ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues a dependance and subordination in matters of Goverment, there being no other imaginable reason why they should be tied to an Union with this <hi>Chair,</hi> but becaus of the Superioritie and Jurisdiction which it has over them, S. Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian holds, that the Decrees of S. Peters Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors, when they are accompanied with the consent of the other Bishops, are to be a stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Rule which Bishops ought to follow in matters of Faith, as appears in his 67. <hi>Epist.</hi> to Stephen B. of Rome in the case of Marcian of whom he sais, <hi>sententiam non dicat, sed accipiat</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Let him not pronounce sentence against us, but receive it from us; nor carrie himselfe so as tho he had judged the Colledge of Priests, when he is jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by them all. For we must maintain the glorious Honour of our Predecessors the Blessed Martyrs Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:108855:111"/>
and Lucius; whose memorie as we honour, so oughtest thou, most dear Brother, who art in their place, and become their Successor, to honour and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port in a more peculiar manner with they gravitie and Authoritie. For they being full of God's Spirit ... judged that the Peace ought to be given to those who had fallen .... which thing we all of us in all parts judged in like manner.</hi> S. Cyprian holds, that the Decrees of S. Peter's Successors when they are made with the aforesaid approbation and consent of the Colledge of Bishops, are to be accounted for a Law throughout the Church in matters of Disciplin, as is seen in his 68. <hi>Epist.</hi> to the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie and People of <hi>Asturica</hi> and <hi>Emerita</hi> in Spain, whom he commends for having chosen other Bishops in the room of Basilides and Martialis, who had sacrificed to Idols in the time of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution. And after that he with his Provincial Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops had proved to them by several places of Scripture the lawfulnesse of what they had done, he put's the matter beyond dispute, when he tel's them, <hi>Maxime cum jam pridem nobiscum &amp; cum omnibus omnino Episcopis in toto mundo constitutis, etiam Cornelius Collega noster ..... decreverit</hi> &amp;c. <hi>More especially considering how together with us, and with all the Bishops in the world, Cornelius al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so our Collegue has some time since Decreed, that such kinds of persons</hi> (as Basilides and Martialis) <hi>might be admitted to do Penance, but that they should be removed from Ordaining the Clergie, and the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:108855:112"/>
Priestly Honour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="91">91. These few instances which Providence has left us, show that when S. Cyprian sais, that <hi>every Bishop holds part of the Catholique Church with full Authoritie and Power,</hi> he does not mean, that there is <hi>no superiour Authoritie in the Church over them,</hi> and that they are <hi>independent as to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,</hi> as this Author affirms in his <hi>Vindicat. p.</hi> 38. For if this were so, they might he Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques, and Schismatiques, and Idolaters, and what they pleased besides without any fear of justice, or being controlled in their course of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse. Which makes me wonder, how he who maintains the aforesaid Propositions, can assert in the next page, as he does likewise in several other places of the said Book, that <hi>Bishops are not exempt from Censures in case of Heresie, Schisme, Idolatrie, and such evil practices.</hi> Certainly a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Power to punish an Offender argues an <hi>Authoritie</hi> in the punisher, and a <hi>subjection</hi> in the person that is punished. O but the Power of censuring Heretical and Schismatical Bishops does not <hi>infer a superiour Authoritie of one Bishop over another, but onely an Authoritie in the Church to censure such crimes whoever be guiltie of them. Vid. loc. cit.</hi> This is a very remarkable Replie. Pray, Sr. is it not the common sense of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that an <hi>Authoritie to censure crimes whoever be guiltie of them,</hi> is an Authoritie to censure all those who are <hi>guiltie of them?</hi> Yes, say you. How
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:108855:112"/>
then comes it to passe, that <hi>an Authoritie in the Church</hi> to censure the crimes of Heresie, Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, Schisme &amp;c. does not <hi>infer an Authoritie</hi> over all those who are guiltie of them? So it does, say you. How then comes it to passe, that <hi>the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie which is in the Church (</hi>which can be no other than that of Bishops) to censure the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said crimes, does not infer an <hi>Authoritie of one Bishop over another,</hi> whenever Bishops are found <hi>guiltie of them?</hi> Here lies the difficultie, if there be any. According to my poor talent it is very clear, that every one who is lawful Judge over a Criminal has <hi>Authoritie</hi> over him, and the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal is in <hi>subjection</hi> to him, seing it is nothing else but <hi>Authoritie</hi> which makes one man a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Judge over another; and wherever there is <hi>Authoritie,</hi> there must of necessitie be <hi>subjection,</hi> becaus of the relation there is between these two qualifications. And therefore if we suppose Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops to be lawful Judges over Bishops, we must consequently say, that Bishops have <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie</hi> over Bishops, and that this <hi>Authoritie</hi> in the one <hi>infers a subjection</hi> in the other.</p>
            <p n="92">92. He tels me in his aforesaid <hi>Vindication p.</hi> 35. that <hi>this is no act of Authoritie over Bishops considered as Bishops, but over Heretiques and Schismatiques.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="93">93. I answer, that it is sufficient that a Judge be said to have Authoritie over Criminals <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered</hi> according to the character, station, and
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:108855:113"/>
Dignitie which they bear in the Church or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth monwealth, if he have <hi>Authoritie</hi> to punish those crimes in them which are proper to men of their station; for example, when a Judge punishes a Viceroy for his ill Government, or a Treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer for turning the Kings cash to his own uses, or a Privie Counsellour for betraying the secrets of State, it is evident, that he punishes the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy <hi>considered</hi> as a Viceroy, and the Treasurer <hi>considered</hi> as a Treasurer, and the Privie Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour <hi>considered</hi> as a privie Counsellour. And thus it happens in the trial of Heretical and Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Bishops, who are punished by other Bishops for such crimes as are the most proper viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their Dignitie; and their punishment di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recttly shows, that their Judges <hi>considers them as Bishops</hi> when they condemne them, seing they deprive them of all Spiritual Jurisdiction, and make their Sees vacant for new Incumbents. Besides the Power of censuring Bishops for Heresie and Schisme is of it's own nature a Power to controll them in the management of their Churches, and of compelling them to govern them by such Laws as they in their consciences do not approve. As for example, a Bishop preaches Arianisme in his Diocese, and is commanded to forbear by the other Bishops, and to preach the contrarie Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin of the Consubstantialitie of the Son of God with the Eternal Father, which he accounts for a most dangerous errour. Another Bishop refuses
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:108855:113"/>
to give the Peace to any who have fallen into any damnable sin after Baptisme, and is present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ordered by the other Bishops to give the Peace to all whom he shall find truly penitent, which he accounts a great impietie. What can any one think of this procedure among Bishops, but that it <hi>infers an Authoritie over Bishops considered as Bishops?</hi> And this Author would be of the same mind too, were it not for the caus of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation which requires, that he say some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to free the English Bishops from Heresie, and Schisme. Which engages him to exalt the Authoritie of Bishops to so great a heighth, as to make them independent of one another as to <hi>subjection,</hi> and matters of Government. Which Principle has the same propertie as all false Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples have, which is to prove more than the advancer of it is willing it should prove. For it so wel secures the English Bishops from being Heretiques, and the Novelties of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from being Heresies, that it makes it impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, that there should be any such thing as He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies and Heretical Bishops, by constituting Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops for the sanctifiers and unaccountable Judges of what Doctrins they are to preach, as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened at the Reformation, which was such a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious violation of all Ecclesiastical Laws, that it can never be defended but by making <hi>Bishops considered as Bishops</hi> superiour to all Laws. From whence it follows that their Acts of Government
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:108855:114"/>
viz the Faith which they preach, and the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplin which they establish, are above the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of other Bishops, and by consequence that they can never be <hi>Heretiques and Schismatiques,</hi> which we find him to denie in the present Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. On the contrarie our Doctrin touching the Authoritie of Bishops is reconcileable to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and all Christian Principles. For we hold, that so long as Bishops will order their lives, and conforme their Faith, and Disciplin according to the prescript of those whom Christ has appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for their Judges, there is no Power on Earth that can controll them in the exercise of their Episcopal Functions. And I think this Author ought to close with me, that they are under this obligation, becaus the consequence is necessarie, that if Christ has left them Judges of their Faith and Disciplin as often as they offend in either (as he grants he has), the Faith and Disciplin of these Judges ought to be the Rule which they are obliged to follow in their conduct and the government of their Churches, as I will show more at large when I treat of the Authoritie of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councils.</p>
            <p n="94">94. A great caus of these puzzling mazes is a strong persuasion that Bishops by their Original Institution were all of equal Iurisdiction, which I have shown to be false out of S. Cyprian, who sais, that S. Peter was <hi>Primat</hi> over his Brethren. And
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:108855:114"/>
altho we should suppose it to be true in the Apos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles yet I do not see any necessitie of granting, that their Successors must have in like manner the same equalitie of Jurisdiction. For if it be lawfull to discourse after this manner, we may as wel infer, that the whole world is the <hi>subject matter</hi> of each Bishop's Jurisdiction, seing it is certain that the Apostles Jurisdiction was not res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trained to any particular Province, but they were empoured by by our Lord to preach his Faith, and administer his Sacraments in what place soever they should come, altho it were in some Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, or Citie where one of their Brethren were before, as we find in S. Peter and S. Paul who were both in Rome at the same time. And yet it is notorious, that since the Apostles time the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops their Successors (I except always S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's Successor's) never had any Iurisdiction over the whole world, but have held onely a <hi>part</hi> of it, as S. Cyprian sais, for the <hi>matter</hi> of their Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction. What reason then can there be to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that Bishops inherit from the Apostles an equalitie of Jurisdiction (supposing the Apostles had it), and yet that they do not inherit from them the whole extent of the <hi>subject matter</hi> of their Jurisdiction? If their Original Institution be of force to prove the one, why should it not in like manner prove the other?</p>
            <p n="95">95. If you say, that Bishops do not succeed the Apostles in the whole <hi>subject matter</hi> of their
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:108855:115"/>
Jurisdiction, becaus the Apostles had a command from our Lord to assign to each Bishop whom they should ordain, a certain <hi>part</hi> of the world for the <hi>subject matter</hi> of their Iurisdiction, and that they left an injunction on the Church of succeeding times to follow the same Rule in the Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of other Bishops: why may not any one say in like manner, that the Apostles had a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand from our Lord to give to the Bishops whom they should ordain, so much of their Jurisdiction as was sufficient for the discharge of their dutie in their respective stations, to some more, to others lesse, to Primats and Metropolitans more, and to inferiour Bishops lesse? If the Original Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Bishops in the Apostles could not tie our Lord's hands, but that he might give them a lesse <hi>matter</hi> of Iurisdiction than he gave to the Apostles, it could as litle tie them from giving them an unequal distribution of Iurisdiction a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, which Dr. Sherlock's Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples will strongly dispose any man to believe that he has done. For in his aforesaid <hi>Vindicdtion p.</hi> 41. he sais of <hi>Arehiepiscopal and Metropolitical Churches, that they were so very early in the Church, that it is most probable, that they had their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the Apostles days,</hi> which being once ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted for a truth (as it most certainly is), the lawful consequence is, that these Churches were established by the Apostles Authoritie. For it is incredible, that there could be any such solemne
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:108855:115"/>
Combinations and Associations of National and Provincial Churches setled without the allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Apostles, who were the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Governours of God's Church, it being a necessarie Prerogative of all Sovereign Power's to give life and being to Politique Bodies, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whose Charter and expresse Erection they are no more than a Companie of unconnected in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual persons. How can any one think, that such prudent establishments as these could be carried on throughout the world without the orders of the Apostles, who were the sources of Christian Prudence? Or that God provided such visible, such illustrious, and such effectual means for the continuance of his Church by his inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations to other men, than to the Apostles on whom he had <hi>built his Church?</hi> And supposing that these Associated Churches were established by the Apostles, it follows, that Archbishops and Metropolitans received from the Apostles all that Authoritie which we learn from antiquitie to have been exercised by men of their eminent rank and station, as to call National and Provincial Synods, to preside in them, to see the execution of their Decrees, and to censure the Bishops of their several Provinces for any enermous crimes &amp;c. All which Prerogatives do not signifie a <hi>Primacie of meer Order,</hi> but of Iurisdiction with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which there can be neither Faith, nor or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, nor Disciplin, nor any thing else that is good
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:108855:116"/>
observed amongst men. Neither is it tollerable to hold, that the Councils which consisted of the Bishops of these Archiepiscopal and Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan Churches (and which our Author <hi>loc. cit.</hi> sais were from the <hi>very beginning</hi>) were insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted onely for <hi>mutual advice,</hi> it being ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to think, that the Apostles empowred them to consult together about the common concerns of their Churches, and to aggree upon Canons and regulations for their better government, without giving them a coercive Power to punish any one who should be a contravener of their orders, or laying an obligation under Obedience on succeeding Bishops, nay nor so much as on themselves by whom the Canons were signed and enacted, to procure the due and faithful observance of them. A great piece of Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Prudence indeed, to command, and to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power Bishops to assemble in Councils, and to make Canons for the better government of their Churches, and yet not to give them when they are thus assembled, Authoritie sufficient to bind themselves to the execution of their common re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions unlesse they pleas themselves! Those who prudently designe an end, make choice of such means as are effectual for the compassing of the same. And therefore it must be granted, that when the Apostles empowred these Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils to frame Canons for the good of the Church, they gave them a direct and <hi>superiour Auhoritie</hi>
               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:108855:116"/>
over Bishops for the more exact execution of them in their several districts, this being the onely way to compasse the end of these Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, which is the good of the Church. And thus we have a <hi>superiour Authoritie of one Bishop over</hi> another, altho we suppose them by their Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Institution in the Apostles to have been all of equal Jurisdiction.</p>
            <p n="96">96. This discourse shows, that we ought to understand S. Cyprian's words in the second sense which I have given above, viz that when he sais, that <hi>every Bishop holds part of the One Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoprique of the Catholique Church with full Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and Power,</hi> he meaus that they receive their Iurisdiction alike from Christ, altho not all of them in the same equalitie, of proportion.</p>
            <p n="97">97. It will be objected against this explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of S. Cyprian, that these two Doctrins which I have ascribed to him, viz that the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie of S. Peter's One Chair is de Iure Divino,</hi> and <hi>the Iurisdiction of each single Bishop is de Iure Divino</hi> seem irreconciliable, and in Consistent with one another. For first, if Bishops receive their <hi>Authoritie and Power</hi> immediately from Christ, how can they have any other Superiour but Christ in the performance of their Functions? 2. How comes it to passe, that in their Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration they take an Oath of Obedience to S. Peter's Successors, and 3 that they are chosen or consirmed by them, and that without their
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:108855:117"/>
Bulls they have no Jurisdiction to act as Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops? 4. How can S. Peter's Successors limit, and restrain their Power so much as we see in matters of Appeals, Dispensations, and Reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of Cases in the Court of Penance, since an immediate Delegation of a Power from Christ act signifies a lawfull Power to act immediately without any subjection to any intermediate Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector and Controller? 5. All those Directions, Commands, and Decrees which proceed from S. Peters Successors, and which are manie times accompanied with threats of Excommunication, and other Ecclesiastical Censures debar Bishops of their libertie to act, or to ceas from acting. Which abridgment of their libertie seems in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent with the Doctrin which makes their Authoritie to be <hi>Iure Divino.</hi> All which great dependances which particular Bishops have on S. Peter's Chair, seem to show, that the <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and Power</hi> whereby they act is not derived immediately from Christ, but from the Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors of S. Peter.</p>
            <p n="98">98. These Objections admit of very easie so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions. As to the first, I answer, that Bishops have no other Superiour but Christ, for what relates to the <hi>Donation</hi> of their Jurisdiction, but they have S. Peter's Successors, and their Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legues in a General Council for their immediate Superiours for what relates to the <hi>regulation</hi> of the same, so that they may be the better able to
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:108855:117"/>
               <hi>edifie the Bodie of Christ</hi> thereby, and proceed all with the greater Uniformitie in the goverment of their Flocks, as becomes the Heads, and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the several portions of the <hi>One Bishoprique</hi> of the Catholique Church.</p>
            <p n="99">99. As to the 2. I answer, that the Obedience to S. Peter's. Successors which Bishops oblige themselves to by Oath at their Consecration, can no ways prejudice their Claim of receiving their Jurisdiction immediately from Christ. For this Obedience may be reduced to two Heads; the one is, when they are commanded to desist from injuring the Flock of Christ either by their ill example, carelesse goverment, or false Doctrin; and the other, when they are commanded to see the execution of such orders as are for the good of the Faithfull. In the first of these Cases they lose nothing of their Authoritie by Obedience, becaus Christ never gave them any Power to <hi>destroy</hi> his Church 2. <hi>ad Cor.</hi> 13. Neither is their Authoritie weakned in the other case, becaus the orders of S. Peter's Successors are performed by the Authoritie which they have immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from Christ to <hi>edifie his Bodie.</hi> For seing the execution of these orders belongs to them as they are Bishops, and as they are Bishops they derive their Authoritie immediately from Christ according that of S. Paul <hi>Quos Spiritus Sanctus constituit regere Ecclesiam Dei,</hi> it follows, that when they execute these orders, they execute the
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:108855:118"/>
Authoritie which they have immediately received from Christ. The Authoritie which they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately receive from Christ is that of gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, feeding, and illuminating souls as S. Paul sais 2. <hi>ad Tim.</hi> 4. <hi>Praedica verbum, insta oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, importune, argue, obsecra, increpa in omnipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tientia &amp; doctrina.</hi> And seing those orders which they receive from S. Peter's Successors are sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to further them in the exercise of this Power, the consequence is, that the performance of them is by the Power which they have imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately received from Christ.</p>
            <p n="100">100. It belongs to the Superiour Iurisdiction which S. Peter's Successors have over their <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable Brethren</hi> the other Bishops, that they have a Latitude of judgment whereby they are ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to judge what is expedient for the general good of the Church, and of particular persons too in certain cases and on certain emergencies, which the other Bishops have not out of a General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil; as also a Coercive Power to see the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of such regulations as they shall make on the like occasions. To give an instance in the first Case, let us suppose, that the Pope takes into consideration, that it will conduce very much towards the better observance of the Lord's day, if the Faithful are under the same obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of hearing sermons, or assisting at Vespers as they are of hearing Masse on this day. Heru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon he orders a Decree to this effect, which as
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:108855:118"/>
soon as it is duly formed, duly received, and duly published in all parts of the Church, it ought to be put in execution by the other Bishops in their several Districts. The instance in the second case may be this. Titius is very desirous to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Caja, but there is an <hi>impedimentum derimens</hi> between them which <hi>jure communi</hi> cannot be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensed withal by the Ordinarie. Wherupon he sues for a Dispensation in the Court of Rome, lays open the reasonable Motives he has for a relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Canons, and having procured it he shows it to his Bishop, who presently gives his consent that he may marrie Caja. Now the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops acting in either of these cases affords no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like an Argument, that they act by the Authoritie which they receive from S. Peter's Successors, but onely that their Authoritie in these cases has a necessarie relation to the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of S. Peter's Successors, which as soon as they have received, they do not receive a new Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie together with it, but onely an obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to exercise the Authoritie which they have immediately received from Christ. The Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie whereby they act in these cases is from Christ, but the obligation of acting <hi>hic &amp; nunc</hi> is from the direction of S. Peter's Successors. And here we may discover a great difference between the Politie of the Church, and that of the Civil State; for when a subject receives from his Prince a Command to govern a Province, or a Citie, the
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:108855:119"/>
Prince's Command is the Power whereby he is to govern: wheras when S. Peter's Successors send their Commands to Bishops, they do not properly speaking give them Power, but lay an obligation on them to exercise the Power which they have immediately received from Christ on such and such occasions; just as when I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand Peter to beat Iohn, altho he beat him at my Command, yet he does it by his own strength.</p>
            <p n="101">101. As to the 3. I answer, that the electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or confirmation of Bishops by the Pope no more proves that they receive their Jurisdiction from him after their admission into their Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riques, than it is an Argument that Popes receive their Jurisdiction from the Colledge of Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, becaus they are chosen by them. In both cases the Iurisdiction is received immediately from Christ, altho the election of the persons be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the customs which the Church at present has admitted. For some Centuries after Christ the People had a great part in the electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Bishops, and yet I suppose no bodie will pretend, that those Bishops received their Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Iurisdiction from the People. It is God who gives the Jurisdiction, and those who have the Power of chusing do no more than present to his Divine Majestie such persons on whom he may confer it, as we we read <hi>Num.</hi> 11. 16. that Moses by God's order chose from among the Tribes 70. men who were to be assistants to him
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:108855:119"/>
in the government of the People. Which Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of those Magistrats was properly Divine, and their Jurisdiction was received immediately from God, altho their persons were nominated by Moses. And thus it is in the Church of Christ, wherin God has commanded the election of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, but reserved to himselfe the Prerogative of investing them in their Iurisdiction after they are chosen. The custom which there is at present for Bishops to receive their Bulls from Rome before they are admitted into their Bishopriques was introduced into the Church not manie Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suries ago. And therefore it cannot afford so good an Argument that Bishops derive their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie from that See, as the contrarie custom which was before can yeeld, that they derive it immediately from Christ. We are at full liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to look upon this Custom as a <hi>Forme,</hi> which ought to be considered according to that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of it which the Fathers of the Church and Tradition lead us to, which is that Bishops Faculties are immediately received from Christ, and that their Bulls signifie no more than that the New-Bishops may govern with the Pope's consent and approbation.</p>
            <p n="102">102. As to the 4. I answer, that the dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of a Power to act many times ties those who receive it to the observance of certain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, without which the exercise of it cannot be lawfull. As for example, a Judge who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:108855:120"/>
from the Prince a Power to hear Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, or Civil Causes cannot pronounce a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full sentence before he has referred the matter to the consideration of a Jurie, and observed the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Forms of Law; nor a Viceroy come to a ful resolution in any matter of great moment, without hearing first the judgment and opinion of his privie Counsel, or others who may be presumed to be able to give him a true and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act information of the case. And thus it is at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, for altho particular Bishops have received from Christ their power to govern their Churches, yet Christ himselfe has subjected the lawfull and valid exercise of this Power to the superiour Wisdom, and Conduct, and Moderation of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councils and S. Peter's Successors, who may limit it in certain cases, as they find it expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for the good of the Church, as they have done in those cases mentioned in the Objection; without whose concurrence Bishops may be said to have no Power nor Jurisdiction, in as much as what they do is neither lawful nor valid; and with their concurrence they may be said to have Power, in as much as what they do is both law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and valid. But from hence it does not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that the Power whereby they act after this concurrence is not received from Christ, but onely that the Power which they have received from Christ becomes lawful and valid by the observance of those Rules which Christ will
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:108855:120"/>
have to be observed in the exercise of it? Every thing that is sufficient to make the exercise of a Power lawful and valid is not necessarily the Caus of the Power whose exercise it makes law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and valid, as is manifest in Iudges and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceroys, who receive their Power from the King, and yet the lawfulnesse, nay the validitie of their Acts in manie Cases depends upon the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of their Juries, and Privie Counsels.</p>
            <p n="103">103. As to the 5. I answer, that the abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the libertie of Bishops by means of the Decrees and Commands of S. Peter's Successors does not in the least impair their claim of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving their Authoritie from Christ, becaus altho God has given them freedom of will to act, or not to act according as he would have them, yet he has given them Authoritie to act onely so as that they may <hi>edifie the Bodie of Christ.</hi> And seing such Decrees as are issued forth by S. Peter's successors according to the Canons and Tradition of the Catholique Church, are suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to <hi>edifie the Bodie of Christ,</hi> whenever Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops complie with them, they properly exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise their Authoritie by exercising the freedom of their wills in such compliances. And seing a non-compliance with such Decrees as <hi>edifie the Bodie of Christ</hi> is an interpretative <hi>destruction</hi> and <hi>disedisication</hi> of the same, we cannot conclude, that Bishops lose any thing of their Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, becaus S. Peter's Successors have a Power
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:108855:121"/>
to force them to Obedience by the threats of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, and other Ecclesiastical Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, becaus this Power is onely the Power of punishing those who <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> and destroy the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of Christ,</hi> which certainly must be granted to have been lodged by our Saviour either in one or more Bishops, or else that he was a very imprudent Lawgiver to design the perpetuitie of his Church, and yet to provide no fitting means for it's preservation. If I who am not S. Peter's Successor, can convince a Bishop of any thing which he ought to do towards the edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of our Lord's Bodie, he is bound in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science to follow my counsel, and yet he loses nothing of his Authoritie by having his will determined to act through my advise. Why then should it be so dangerous an encroachment on his Authoritie as to be an argument that it is deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from S. Peter's Chair, becaus his will is determined to act by such orders and Commands as he receives from thence, seing these orders when they are according to the Practice and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of the Church, are supposed to bring a conviction along with them, that their perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance will tend to the <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>dification of our Lord's Bodie,</hi> and the threats of Excommunication wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they are accompanied, do no more than <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the thoughts of those punishments which private persons may denounce to him, if he omit to act as they advise him, when their
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:108855:121"/>
advice is evidently good, and he is obliged in conscience to follow it?</p>
            <p n="104">104. It is a vain thing to think, that God has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to every Bishop an absolute and Despotical Power to act in all Cases, so as he shall judge to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>duce most towards the <hi>edification of our Lord's Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die</hi> without any obligation to follow the received Customs, Maxims, Principles, and Canons of the Catholique Church; or having any kind of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on a Superiour Authoritie in any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters relating to Faith; Moralitie; or Disciplin. For if this were so, there might be as manie dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct Communions as there are Bishopriques, becaus <hi>every Bishop has full Authoritie and Power</hi> in this Hypothesis to appoint what terms and Conditions of Communion he thinks fitting. And if there may be as many distinct Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as there are Bishopriques, it is possible for the Catholique Church to fail, becaus it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for One Bodie and Communion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult out of manie distinct and independent Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munions. Wherefore when we say, that <hi>every Bishop has full Authoritie and Power,</hi> we must understand it in such a sense, as will not hinder the Catholique Church from being One Bodie and Communion, which is a truth as evidently Revealed, and of at least as great importance, as that <hi>every Bishop holds part of the Catholique Church with full Authoritie and Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="105">105. Thus we see that S. Cyprian's Definition
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:108855:122"/>
of a Church aggrees to the Catholique Church as wel as to any particular Church within it's Communion, if it be sufficient for this purpose to make S. Peter's Successors essential to it by being Primats over the other Bishops, by being the <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of their unitie,</hi> and by being Bishops over the Universal Church. And from hence I infer, that if Dr. Sherlock can lawfully conclude, that Obedience does not belong to the Notion of the Catholique Church, becaus it is <hi>the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of the Faithfull,</hi> there can be no reason why Faith may not be said not to belong to the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it becaus it is <hi>the People united to the Priest, and the Flock cleaving to their Pastor,</hi> which is S. Cyprian's Definition of it.</p>
            <p n="106">106. I do not at all wonder, that Bellarmin has joyned both these Notions into One com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete Definition, which he might very wel do without the introduction of a dangerous Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. For seing Faith and Obedience are equally necessarie Conditions of Communion with the Catholique Church, where lies the fault in inser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them both into the Definition of it? He was certainly no flatterer of the Pope by acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging a Priviledge which the Son of God had given to him, neither had the Pope any reason so much as to thank him for it, unlesse it were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus he had done his dutie. When he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the Pope's Primacie, he confessed Christ before men by confessing his Universal Vicar
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:108855:122"/>
before Schismatiques, as the Learned Launoy would have done himselfe, had he been to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage the Caus of the Church against this sort of People. For seing he held the Pope's Primacie to be an Article of Faith, he held the belief of it to be essential to the Church. And if the belief of it be essential to the Church, why may not this Article be particularized in the Notion of it as often as occasions prudently require it, as wel as covertly expressed under the general name of Faith, when the Church is said to be <hi>the whole Companie of the Faithfull?</hi> In like manner seing the Authoritie of General Councils is no lesse an Article of Faith than the Pope's Primacie, whoever pleases may insert that too into the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, as often as occasions prudently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it, without any danger of errour. One thing the Dr. may assure himselfe, that if Mons. Launoy had lived to see the advantage, which is pretended to be taken from what he writ to Gatinaeus concerning the Notion of the Church, he would not have failed to let him know, that he held Obedience to the <hi>One Chair</hi> of S. Peter to be as necessarie to Catholique Communion as Bellarmin, or any other who has placed it in the Notion of the Church, and that what he had written on this occasion was far from giving any encouragement to Schismatiques, becaus it was no ways repugnant to the Unitie of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church. Let this Author show me, if
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:108855:123"/>
he can, where Monsr. Launoy sais, that obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence does not belong to the Notion of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church as such, which being once granted to have been his Opinion, there is no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie in showing, that he held the Catholique Church to be <hi>the Companie of the Faithfull</hi> in the Protestant sense.</p>
            <p n="107">107. From what has been said we may learn the true meaning of two other Principles drawn out of S. Cyprian, which this Author in his aforesaid <hi>Vindication p.</hi> 35. makes use of to show, that this Father held no Superioritie of one Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop over another. The first is this, <hi>unus Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patus Episcoporum multorum concordi numerositate diffusus,</hi> which he renders thus into English, <hi>One Bishoprique is spread over the world by the consenting multitude of manie Bishops. Ep.</hi> 52. <hi>Pam.</hi> The other is <hi>Ep.</hi> 69. <hi>Quando Ecclesia quae una est scissa non sit, neque divisa, sed ubique connexa &amp; cohaerentium sihi invicim Sacerdotum glutino copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lata,</hi> which he translates thus, <hi>The Catholik Church is not rent, nor divided, but united and coupled by the Cement of manie Bishops who stick close together.</hi> From which places he infers I know not what Chimerical <hi>unitie of the Episcopacie</hi> which is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct from the Essential Unitie of the Church, and without any dependance of subordination to the <hi>Chair</hi> of S. Peter, when it is as clear as noon day, that in S. Cyprians judgment the <hi>Concord, unitie,</hi> and <hi>Cement</hi> of a <hi>multitude of manie Bishops</hi>

do no otherwise make the Catholique Church <hi>One Bishoprique,</hi> or One Ecclesiastical Bodie, but inasmuch as they unite them to the <hi>One Chair</hi> of S. Peter.

            <p>§. 7. P. 32. <hi>I know of late the Clergie have in a great measure monopolized the name of the Church, wheras in proprietie of speesh, they do not belong to the Definition of a Church.</hi>

            <p n="108">108. Replie. What is it he means here by the word <hi>Church?</hi> a Church as it is taken for Christ's Mystical Bodie, or as it is a Visible Societie? If he take it in the first sense, I know of no bodie that denies the latter part of his Proposition;
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:108855:124"/>
for Christians are singly and individually united to Christ as to their Head and Spous, and the Clergie of the Catholique Church are so far from monopolizing the name of the Church in this sense, that they do not pretend to belong to the Definition of it, but leave this Prerogative to Christ alone.</p>
            <p n="109">109. But if he take the word <hi>Church</hi> so as to signifie a Visible Societie, we have alreadie seen that <hi>the whole Companie of the Faithful</hi> is not a complete Definition of it, and therefore for ought yet appears to the contrarie, the Clergie may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to it as much as the People. Nay we have seen, that S. Cyprian places the Clergie as wel as the People in the Definition of it, which makes his postponing of S. Cyprian's Definition to be very suspicious, and a vehement presumption, that he was unwilling to submit his Caus to the judgment of this Father. Nay what is more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markeble yet, he tels us <hi>p.</hi> 38. in behalf of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches, that <hi>the goverment of Bishops is that which makes them, and is essential to their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition.</hi> If he will stand to this, we need no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proof against him than his own confession. For what is essential to a thing belongs to it <hi>in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietie</hi> of speech. Wherefore if the <hi>government of Bishops</hi> (who are the Heads of the Clergie) be essential to the Definition of a particular Church, it follows, that the Clergie <hi>belong to the Definition of a Church in proprietie of speech.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="110">
               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:108855:124"/>
110. And from hence it follows, that the Clergie belongs likewise to the Definition of the whole Catholik Church on Earth as it is a Visible Societie. For what is essential to the parts must needs be essential to the whole, and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence seing the whole Church is nothing else in his way but the Collection of all particular Churches and Christians who are under <hi>the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment of Bishops,</hi> it cannot have a distinct na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Definition from particular Churches and Christians, unlesse he say that men may be Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Visible Church without being Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of any Church in particular. So that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this Doctrin the true and proper Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of the Catholique Church is <hi>the whole Companie of persons who are united together by the profession of the same Christian Faith</hi> (if he will have Faith to be essential to it,) <hi>and Communion of the same Sacraments under the goverment of lawfull Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops.</hi> Which Definition differs from that of Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin, not becaus it excludes the Clergie, but becaus it excludes the B. of Rome, whom Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin acknowledges for the <hi>root</hi> and <hi>beginning of the</hi> Ecclesiastical and <hi>Priestly unitie.</hi> We make with S. Cyprian and all Antiquitie the Pope to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with his <hi>Venerable Brethren</hi> the Bishops to belong to the Definition of the Catholique Church, and this Author (if he persist in affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Bishops to be <hi>essential to particular Churches</hi>) excludes the Pope, and admits onely lawful Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops.
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:108855:125"/>
In both these ways the Clergie belongs to the Definition of the Catholique Church <hi>in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietie of speech,</hi> altho in the Drs. way the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church be not <hi>One Bodie</hi> and Societie for want of a <hi>root</hi> and <hi>beginning of unitie</hi> to knit it's parts together, but rather an Aggregation of several incoherent and unconnected Churches and Christians, as a heap of wheat is in respect of the grains wherof it is composed; which does not hinder, but that the Collection or Aggre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Churches ought to be defined accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that which is essential to every Church in particular, as a heap of wheat necessarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, that it's Definition be made according to such considerations as are essential to the grains that make it. And in case the government of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops be essential to the Definition of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church, it follows, that Obedience must be so too. For seing this obligation of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours is annexed to all lawful Governments, the Government of Bishops can neither be conceived, not subsist without it. From whence it is plain, that Obedience is as necessarie towards our being Members of the Catholique Church as Faith, and by consequence <hi>the whole Companie of the Faithful</hi> cannot be a Complete Notion of the Catholique Church for want of Obedience, as I said lately.</p>
            <p n="111">111. This discourse gives me an occasion of taking notice of a great inconsequence of this

112. I wel see, that this Author will resent the advantages which I have taken from his granting <hi>the goverment of Bishops to be essential to a particular Church,</hi> which he has expressed in as ful and plain terms as possibly can be desired. And yet he will not fail of making use of his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent of <hi>evading</hi> here as I have observed he has done on other occasions, altho I have set my selfe on purpose to guesse at some tollerable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie which he may make to it, and after all my searches I do not find any thing that can carrie so much as the colour of reason. Perhaps he will serve me as he does his Adversarie in the aforesaid Treatise <hi>p.</hi> 23. who having charged him with a Contradiction, he tells him, that the matter was <hi>a litle out of his reach .... and that if he had not understood it, it had been more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest and ingenuous to have made a Querie upon it, and desired him to have reconciled that seeming contradiction, rather than to charge him with such Principles as he often and expressely rejects. But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuitie and modestie are not to be expected from such Adversaries</hi> &amp;c. This good Gentleman blames his Adversarie for want of Ingenuitie and Modestie in letting the world know, that he had contradicted himselfe in a very material Point, as tho these vertues could suffer any thing by the publication of a pertinent truth. But J shall have no scruple at all to charge the same defects upon him, in case he do not acquit
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:108855:126"/>
himselfe very well of the present inconsequence, seing it is no lesse a sign of Ingenuitie and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destie to confesse and acknowledge ones own weaknesse, than it is to acquaint those privately of it whom we find guiltie. But why should he expect a Penny-post letre to advertise him of that which he would have thought to be a blunder? Is there any such practice among Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trovertists? Why should he think himselfe hardly used, when he is treated no otherwise than as good, and as able men as himselfe have been treated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him? Why may not he contradict himselfe as wel as his neighbours, and if he contradict him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in publique, why may not he be censured for it in publique? Those who write Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies out of ambitious ends, or to show their wit, may with a false gallantrie give their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versarie their hand after they have thrown him, but a severe lover of Truth will keep him down whilst he has him down, becaus he judges that he holds errour down together with him. I am very sensible, that men of the best parts, and the managers of the best Causes may sometimes slip, and commit mistakes, and I think it a piece of rudenesse to take a man up, as they say, before he is down; but when we may justly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume, as we may at present, that the inconsis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie of two Doctrins is not a meer slip, but the result of a deliberate and fixed judgment, I think it neither wisdom nor prudence for any
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:108855:127"/>
man who thinks that he defends a good Causnot to presse it upon his Adversarie, and to make use of all the advantages which will serve to streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the Caus which he has undertaken.</p>
            <p n="113">113. To proceed, no one better understands what he belongs to the Essence of a Church than he that made it, and we may securely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the truth of that Definition which our Lord gave to his Apostles. He tels them <hi>Luc.</hi> 10. <hi>He that hears you, hears me.</hi> From whence it is plain, that if to <hi>hear Christ</hi> be to be a Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, and to <hi>hear</hi> those whom Christ has sent to teach us be to <hi>hear Christ,</hi> that Christianitie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in <hi>hearing</hi> those whom Christ has sent to teach us. And if to <hi>hear Christ</hi> be to believe what he has revealed, and to obey what he has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, it follows also, that by <hi>hearing</hi> those whom Christ has sent to teach us, is meant that we ought to believe what they preach, and to obey what they command, becaus we <hi>hear</hi> Christ by <hi>hearing</hi> them. So that the Definition of a Church according to the Founder of it is <hi>a Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of People which hear those whom Christ has sent to teach them,</hi> where we see the Clergie or those whom Christ has sent to teach, and govern his Church to be a part of it's Definition. And from hence we may safely conclude, that the Church is not onely <hi>

<pb n="237" facs="tcp:108855:127"/>
Bodie and Societie by being <hi>a Companie of People who hear those whom Christ has sent to teach them,</hi> or as S. Cyprian delivers it in other words, by being <hi>united to their Priests and cleaving to their Pastors,</hi> that is, by believing what they teach, and obeying what they command.</p>
            <p n="114">114. Our Lord tels his Apostles in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <hi>Luc.</hi> 5. <hi>You are the Light of the world, you are the salt of the Earth.</hi> Which words clearly show the Apostles, or the Clergie to belong to the Definition of a Church. For the Church was the <hi>world</hi> which was to be <hi>illuminated</hi> by them, and the <hi>Earth</hi> which was to be <hi>salted</hi> by them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if <hi>Light</hi> belong to the Definition of an <hi>illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated world,</hi> and <hi>salt</hi> to the Definition of a <hi>salted Earth,</hi> it follows, that the Clergie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Definition of a Church, becaus they are the <hi>Light</hi> wherwith it is <hi>illuminated,</hi> and the <hi>salt</hi> wherwith it is <hi>salted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="115">115. The Clergie are the <hi>Light of the world,</hi> not onely becaus of the Faith which they preach, but likewise by means of the Sacraments which they administer, which are the channels and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyances whereby the Sun of Justice dispenses his rays to the souls of men. Will this Author say, that the Sacraments do not belong to the Definition of a Church? And yet this necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily follows, supposing the Clergie do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Definition of it. For the administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sacraments necessarily requires, that
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:108855:128"/>
there be a Clergie who are duly authorised to do the same, unlesse it be said, that there is no other qualification requisit for this performance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides such natural guifts as may encline the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to Ordain Ministers by their own choice. As for Baptisme, altho it may be validly confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by Lay people, men or women, yet this practice is onely indulged in cases of great necessitie, which cannot vacate the Institution of the Lawgiver, nor the direct Relation which this Sacrament has to those who <hi>ex Officio</hi> are to represent the person of Christ in the administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. It is not absolutely necessarie that every individual person be baptized by a Priest, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus in danger of death the Lawgiver gives way, that they be baptized without one; but it is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely necessarie to the whole Church that there be Priests, becaus where there is no danger of death, the Institution of the Lawgiver ought to take place. We shall deal very ungratefully with our Saviour, if we interpret his gracious Indulgence in one certain case as an abrogation of his Law in all others. But supposing the Clergie be not so necessarie to the Church for the administration of Baptisme, but that it may be conceived to subsist without them, yet what will this Author say of the Sacrament of our Lord's Bodie and Bloud? May Lay people ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister that too? Where does he find any war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for this either in Scripture, or from the
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:108855:128"/>
practice and Tradition of former Ages? All Christian Principles oppose him herin, and he has no other defence but his own prejudiced rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, which it is to be feared may at length work him into a total dislike of Christ and Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anitie, since it has alreadie disposed him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that Bakers and Midwives may succeed the Apostles in being the <hi>Light of the world,</hi> as wel as those whom he acknowledges to derive their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of preaching and giving the Sacraments by an uninterrupted succession of Ordainers from the Apostles down to these times.</p>
            <p n="116">116. The Clergie are the <hi>salt of the Earth,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as they are empowred by our Lord to preserve his Church from putrefaction either in their Faith, or Moralitie. They are the Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans which are to cure all our maladies, which flow from the Original defect which we brought into the world along with us. They are our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours to restrain our Excesses by a saving dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplin, and to direct our steps to our Heavenlie Countrie. They bear the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, where none enter but when they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen. They are to remove all infected Members from the Communion of the Faithfull, and to prevent the contagion from spreading further, Our Author cannot denie, but that they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested with all these Priviledges, and that they have received from Christ our Lord a suitable
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:108855:129"/>
Grace to performe the same, which makes me wonder, how he can hold, that they are not es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential to a Church, nor belong to the Definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it. The Church is a Visible School; and certainly where there are visible Schollars, there must be Visible Masters. The Church is a Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Bodie and Societie, which certainly requires Visible Governours. The Church is designed by God for the Kingdom of Heaven, which certainly supposes the assistance and cooperation of those with whom he has entrusted the Keys of it. The Church is a Companie of Patients under a cure, which certainly argues that there ought to be Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians to performe it. This is a plain case accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the present Principles of the Church of England, and I believe that there are few men of sense among them, who had not rather conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in a state of <hi>wrangling</hi> with us on the old foot it has been hiterto managed, than make use of this new project of <hi>putting and end to it,</hi> by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing so important a piece of Christianitie, as the perpetual and indispensible necessitie of the Evangelical Priesthood till Christ's second co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.</p>
            <p n="117">117. The reasons why he will not have the Clergie to belong to the Definition of a Church are very remarkeble, not for any strength they have, but for their apparent weaknesse <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 words">

               </gap> first <hi>p.</hi> 32. that <hi>they are Members of the Church, as they are of the number of the Faithfull, and they</hi>

are the Governours of the Church, as they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Authoritie from Christ the Supreme Lord and Bishop of the Church, but they are no more the Church than the King is his Kingdom, or the shepheard his Flock.</p>
            <p n="118">118. I answer, if the Clergie are considered barely as they are of the <hi>number of the Faithful,</hi> they do not belong to the Definition of the Church, becaus the Church under this conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is not a Visible Bodie and Societie. But if they are taken as they are the Governours of the Church, they are taken as they are Governours of a Visible Bodie and Societie, and thus they are part of it's Definition, as the King belongs to the Definition of a Kingdom as such, and a Shepheard to the Definition of a Flock that is under care. Can any one define a Kingdom with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conceiving, or mentioning a King to whom the multitude pays Obedience; or a Flock that is under care without saying any thing of the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard who has the care of it? I know of no one who is so sottish as to contend, that the Clergie are the multitude whom the govern, any more than the King is his Kingdom, or the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard his Flock.

               <hi>119. He sais 2.</hi> p. <hi>34. that</hi> the Church is the Mystical Bodie of Christ, which is in subjection to Christ the Head; but the Bishops and Pastors of the Church considered as such, represent the Head, and
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:108855:130"/>
not the Bodie ..... And therefore as Christ the Head is distinguished from his Bodie, so are those who act under the Head, and represent and exercise his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie in the Church; as private believers, they are Members of the Church, as Church-Governours, they are the Vicars of Christ.</p>
            <p n="120">120. I Answer, that we willingly grant the Clergie to be distinguished from the Church they govern, as much as Christ is distinguished from his Bodie, and he needed not to have quoted Scripture as he does <hi>ubi supra</hi> for the proof of a matter which is as visible as the light of the sun; but we denie, that it follows from hence, that the Clergie do not belong to the Definition of a Church, as it does not follow, becaus Christ is distinguished from his Mystical Bodie, that therefore he does not belong to the Definition of it. This is the thing he should have proved, but for this be pretends to no Authoritie out of Scripture. And it would be a very strange thing to prove from thence a thing which is so evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently repugnant to natural Reason. For do we not see in Natural Bodies, that the <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>Forme</hi> are two distinct things? And yet the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them both together makes onely one Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence and Definition. The same likewise hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens in Moral Bodies such as the Church is, where the multitude is the <hi>Matter,</hi> and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning Power is the <hi>Forme,</hi> or that which makes them a Bodie. So that the distinction of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:108855:130"/>
from the Church, or People whom they go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, is so far from proving that that they do not belong to the Definition of a Church, that there cannot be a Church or Ecclesiastical Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, if they are not distinguished. Can any one conceive how there can be a governed People without subjection to a Governing Power? If this be impossible, let him confesse that Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours belong to the Definition of a governed People. And if he grant this, let him confesse that <hi>Church-Governours</hi> belong to the Definition of the Church which they govern. Neither is it at all material what he sais, that as <hi>Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours</hi> they are the <hi>Vicars of Christ,</hi> becaus Christ who is Invisible cannot make his Church a Visible Bodie and Societie, as I have proved, but gives it this qualification by means of his <hi>Vicars</hi> to whom he has given the Visible Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it.</p>
            <p n="121">121. Having thus setled, as he thinks, his Assertion upon good grounds, that the Clergie do not belong to the Definition of a Church, he triumphantly proceeds to summe up the fruits of his labour. <hi>Now from hence,</hi> sais he <hi>P.</hi> 35. <hi>I shall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve some few things, the use of which we shal after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards better understand.</hi>

hel shall not prevail against it: which certainly proves, that the Church shall never totally fail, but does not prove, that the Bishops or any Bishop of the Church shall be Infallible. For the Bishops are not the Church: there are distinct Promises to the Church, and to the Pastors and Ministers of it, and they ought to be kept distinct, which will put an end to a great manie controversies between us and the Church of Rome.</p>
            <p n="122">122. Replie, No such inference as this can be drawn from any thing he has hitherto said; for the Church on Earth is not meerly <hi>the Companie of the Faithfull,</hi> but is moreover a visible Societie consisting of Bishops and Pastors who are the Governours and Teachers, and of the Laitie who are the subjects and Schollars. We do not say, that Bishops and Pastors are <hi>the Church</hi> inasmuch as they are of the number of the Faithful, any otherwise than the Laitie are the Church; for under this consideration there is no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Clergie and the Laitie. Neither do we say, that they are <hi>the Church</hi> inasmuch as this word imports a visible Societie of Governours and subjects, of Teachers and Schollars; for this were to make them the same with those whom they teach and govern. But we say, that the denomination of the <hi>Church</hi> belongs to them becaus they are an essential part of the Church, just as when we read in Scripture, that such, or such a King was <hi>buried with his Fathers,</hi> and that Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:108855:131"/>
was carried into Abraham's bosome, the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and soul which are the essential parts of a man, are called by the name of <hi>man,</hi> altho they are taken separately from one another. When we say, that <hi>Bishops and Pastors are the Church,</hi> we mean that they are the <hi>governing and teaching Church,</hi> for which manner of speech we have no lesse than the Authoritie of Christ himselfe besides the unanimous concurrence of all Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie. For who sees not, that when our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour <hi>Math.</hi> 18. remits us to the Church in cases of Controversie, when he sais <hi>tel the Church,</hi> that he means the Bishops and Pastors of it? And when he sais in the same place, that <hi>whoever will not hear the Church, let him be to thee as a Heathen</hi> &amp;c. that he will have us to be obedient to our Bishops and Pastors? Whom are we to believe now, our Saviour, who says that Bishops are <hi>the Church,</hi> or Dr. Sherlock who sais that they are not <hi>the Church?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="123">123. I see no way for him to escape, unlesse it be by saying, that our Saviour speaks <hi>impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly:</hi> or else that he understands the Laitie as wel as the Clergie in those Texts, which instead of <hi>putting an end</hi> to Controversies with the Church of Rome, encreases their number, and affords occasions of new ones. For hitherto the Church of England has never in expresse terms placed the Laitie on the Ecclesiastical Bench, nor given them a joint Commission to act with the Clergie in
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:108855:132"/>
the Government of souls, which certainly follows, if in such disputes as arise among the Faithful, men are to <hi>Tel the Church,</hi> that is, to <hi>Tel</hi> the Laitie as wel as the Clergie under pain of being <hi>Heathens and Publicans.</hi> I suppose the Dr. will not charge any one with telling an untruth, who shall say that the Common prayer and the Protestant Canons were compiled by <hi>the Church,</hi> altho it be evident that they were made by no others but their Clergie; nor censure any one for speaking <hi>improperly,</hi> who shall say that a person who is excommunicated by a Bishop of his Communion, is excommunicated by <hi>the Church.</hi> In which manner of speeches the word <hi>Church</hi> signifies the <hi>Governing and Teaching Church</hi> (who are <hi>the Church inadaequatè</hi>) as much as it does when our Saviour sais <hi>Tel the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="124">124. It is in this sense that we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand what our Lord said to his Apostles <hi>Matt.</hi> 18. <hi>Teaching them to observe all things what soever I have commanded: and behold I am with you always to the end of the world.</hi> .... And <hi>Ioan.</hi> 14. <hi>I will ask my Father, and he will give you another com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter, that he may remain with you for ever ...... the Spirit of Truth .... for he dwels in you, and shall abide in you ... But the Comforter the H Spirit whom my Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring to your memorie whatever I shall say unto you.</hi> Which promises and several others are made to the Church, altho
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:108855:132"/>
they are onely addressed to the Clergie.</p>
            <p n="125">125. Nay those Promises and passages in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which may relate to the Church as it is a Societie of Teachers and Schollars, as when it is said, that <hi>the Gates of Hel shall not prevaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it,</hi> have a special regard to the <hi>Teaching Church,</hi> from whom the Indefectibilitie of the Schollars Faith proceeds, seing they are to <hi>hear</hi> the <hi>Teaching Church</hi> as they <hi>hear</hi> Christ himselfe. So that when when our Saviour promises, that <hi>the gates of hel shall not prevail against his Church,</hi> he promises, that they shall not prevail against the <hi>Teaching Church,</hi> becaus the <hi>instructed Church</hi> is to receive the benefit of Christ's Promise by <hi>hearing</hi> them. Christ has no where promised the Laitie that their Faith shall never fail, but with a dependance on the Churches instruction, whom if they will will not <hi>hear,</hi> their Faith has alreadie failed, becaus we are to look on them as <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens.</hi> This is the onely necessarie means which our Lord has appointed them for the Indefecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie of their Faith, and by consequence when our Saviour promises his Church, that <hi>the Gates of Hel shal not prevail against it,</hi> he stands enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in a particular manner to preserve the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie from errour, becaus he has grounded the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defectibilitie of the whole Church upon them, by reason of the gracious Promises which he has made them of his perpetual assistance in the discharge of their Offices.</p>
            <p n="126">
               <pb n="248" facs="tcp:108855:133"/>
126. Thus likewise when S. Paul 1. <hi>ad Tim.</hi> 3. calls the Church <hi>the ground and Pillar of Truth,</hi> altho the Infallibilitie of the Church (suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing that be proved by this Text) belongs to <hi>the whole Companie of the Faithfull,</hi> yet it belongs to Bishops and Pastors after a different manner than it does to the Laitie. For it is rooted in the Clergie as in it's proper <hi>subject,</hi> becaus our Lord according to his promise <hi>remains with them,</hi> and the Comforter the H. Ghost <hi>teaches them all Truth;</hi> wheras the Laitie derive it from them, and they are no otherwise infallible, but becaus of the <hi>Objective</hi> Infallibilitie of their Faith, and the Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libilitie of their Pastors from whom they receive it. The Bishops and Pastors of the Church, when they are assembled, and proceed according to the custom, practice, and Canons of the Church in holding of and consulting in General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, cannot possibly erre; but Lay men may erre, let them hold never so manie solemne As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies and Consultations about matters of Faith, becaus there is no Promise, that the <hi>Spirit of Truth</hi> shall <hi>abide</hi> in them, and influence them in such undertakings. The Infallibilitie of the Church is rooted there where the <hi>Spirit of Truth</hi> more especially <hi>abides,</hi> and where the <hi>Spirit of Truth</hi> more especially <hi>abides,</hi> there is <hi>the ground and Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of Truth</hi> in a more special end eminent man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. The whole Church as it includes both Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie and Laitie is <hi>the ground and Pillar of Truth,</hi>
               <pb n="249" facs="tcp:108855:133"/>
becaus it is as impossible for it's Faith to be false as for God not to be be true; but it is the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Bishops and Pastors alone to define, and declare what the true Faith is, and to make us secure that it is the true Faith.</p>
            <p n="127">127. 1 infer from what has been said, that since Bishops and Pastors are the <hi>Teaching Church,</hi> that is, since they are <hi>the Church</hi> in the same sense wherin our Saviour said <hi>Tel the Church,</hi> their Faith and Decrees when they are assembled in General Councils, ought to passe, and to be esteemed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Christians for the Faith and Decrees of the Catholique Church, and under this <hi>venerable Name</hi> (<hi>p.</hi> 36.) they ought to have an <hi>indisputable Authoritie.</hi> From whence I conclude, that the Faith of General Councils cannot be false, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse the Faith of the Catholique Church may be so too.</p>

            <p n="128">128. Replie. We have seen that Bishops are <hi>the Church,</hi> becaus they are the Governours and Teachers of the Church. And as they are the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours and Teachers of the Catholique Church, so they are the Catholique Church. And as they are the Catholique Church, so they may be the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentatives</hi> of the Catholik Church in that sense which I am about to declare, for any thing of moment that he offers to the contrarie, as shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>

            </p>
            <p n="129">129. Replie. I find this Author in his <hi>Vindicat. of some Prot. Prin. p.</hi> 50. not unacquainted with our Doctrin about the <hi>Church Representative. Had the Representatives of the Catholique Church,</hi> sais he, <hi>a Divine Authoritie, superiour to all particular Churches and Bishops, to oblige them to stand to their Decrees, as the Church of Rome asserts a General Council has, then indeed some few Bishops chose by their National and Provincial Bishops, to go to the Council, and to act as Representatives of such Churches might have a Plenarie Authoritie to debate and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min all matters in dispute relating to Faith, or Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, or Disciplin.</hi> And yet at present he delivers his judgment against us in such a manner, as would persuade any one to believe, that he knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this Authoritie which we adjuge to the <hi>Church Representative.</hi> Wherefore it will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to set our entire Doctrin down, to the end the Reader may be the better able to judge of the weaknesse of the exceptions which he makes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it.</p>
            <p n="130">130. We hold that Bishops are by <hi>institution</hi> the Governours and Teachers of the Catholique Church, and that it belongs to them <hi>ex Officio</hi> to regulate any thing that is amisse either in the Faith,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:108855:134"/>
or Moralitie of Christians. But by reason it many times happens, that there is not a perfect evidence of the unsoundnesse of the contested Doctrin, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becaus the Universal Tradition of the Church is not easily to be discovered, or becaus sentence is to be pronounced according to the necessitie of consequences which are to be drawn from Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Faith, hence we say, that they are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <hi>ex Officio,</hi> and as they are Bishops to repair to a General Assemblie or Council of the Catholique Church whenever it is Canonically called, and there to determine authoritatively by common consent the Controversies that are depending a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst Christians. They are each one singly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powred by our Lord to <hi>edifie his Bodie</hi> according to their knowledge, and the utmost extent of their capacities in their several precincts, but when the good of the whole Church is concerned in the decision of a matter which regards the whole Church, as Faith and Moralitie do, they are to act jointly with their Collegues the other Bishops in a General Council (wherin we believe the H. Ghost to preside and govern), that they may be able to <hi>edifie the Bodie of Christ</hi> the more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by such measures as are taken therin, which they could not put in practice by their single Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie either for want of evidence, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, without endangering and <hi>destroying</hi> the Flock wherof they are Pastors. They have likewise the Supreme Power of making general orders and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:108855:135"/>
in Ceremonies, and the exteriour Acts of God's Worship, of hearing the complaints that are brought against Bishops, and examining their Causes, of ending differences between Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop and Bishop either concerning the Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, or Prerogatives of their Churches, or any other matter, and generally to take Cognizance of of all debates, causes, matters, and things that want a redresse and remedie among Christians, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as they are Christians and belong to the Church, but not as they are Members of the civil Commonwealth.</p>
            <p n="131">131. When we say, that Bishops <hi>Represent</hi> the Catholique Church in General Councils, we do not mean, that they <hi>Represent</hi> the inferiour Clergie of each one's Diocese, nor much lesse, that they <hi>Represent</hi> the Laitie who have no Ecclesiastical Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, but are bound to <hi>hear</hi> the Clergie in all things appertaining to their salvation. For if this were so, the Authoritie of General Councils would not be immediately from Christ, but derived from <hi>the whole Companie of the Faithfull,</hi> who must be said to have the Original Right of determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning all differences about Faith, and moralitie, and Disciplin, and Bishops will act onely as their Substitutes, as the Members of Parlament act in the name of the People, who have chosen them for their <hi>Representatives</hi> therin. This is no Doctrin of ours; for we believe the Original Right of determining differences about Faith, Moralite,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:108855:135"/>
and Disciplin, to be placed in those to whom our Saviour has made a Promise of <hi>teaching them all Truth,</hi> who having been no others than the Apos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, we hold that it belongs to Bishops who are the Apostles Successors, with a total exclusion of the Laitie as to the Power of voting, and that all those of an inferiour rank among the Clergie who are called by them, and admitted to sit in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, enjoy this Priviledge by the favour onely, and permission of Bishops.</p>
            <p n="132">132. As Bishops are singly considered, they <hi>Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi> onely the Prelats of their own Countries, but as they are taken all together, they <hi>Represent</hi> the whole Bodie of Bishops in the Catholik Church. For seing there is a moral impossibilitie for all the Bishops in the Church to be present in a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council, becaus several of them will be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by Age, sicknesse, and other unavoidable oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions; nay seing it is necessarie towards the <hi>edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of the Bodie of Christ,</hi> that some of each coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie remain at home to discharge the Functions of the Episcopal Dignitie, we say, that those who give their attendance ought to be held for the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique <hi>Teaching Church,</hi> and to have as full Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie as tho every individual Bishop of the Church were assembled in the Council. They are all summoned to appear and they are bound in conscience to obey their summons, unlesse they have a just and reasonable caus to the contrarie, and therefore they ought to be esteemed as the
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:108855:136"/>
               <hi>Teaching Church,</hi> becaus they are all that can come considering the lawfull excuses of those who are absent. Nay supposing there are some Bishops who will not obey their summons, not for any just and reasonable excuses they have, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus of sluggishnesse, discontent, or other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justifiable Motives, yet this hinders not, but that the Council which is called, assembled, and held according to the Canons and Practice of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church, ought to be esteemed as the whole <hi>Teaching Church,</hi> notwithstanding the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful absence of such sluggards and malecontents. So that in every General Council we may conclude, that all the Bishops are there who ought tobe there unlesse it be such as sin by refusing to come. For which reason we say, that they <hi>Represent</hi> the whole Bodie of Bishops in the Catholique Church, and that our Saviour performs his Promise of <hi>tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Church all Truth</hi> in all such Decisions as they make in Relation to Faith, and Moralitie, in as ample and effectual a manner, as tho every Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop were actually present, which is that which we mean by the <hi>Church-Representative.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="133">133. What has been here said is scarce any thing more than a bare deliverie of our Doctrin, which is all that the consideration of the Passage which I have in hand requires of me, there being no need of Proofs and Arguments to ascertain the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the <hi>Church-representative</hi> (which shall be done below), when the exceptions which he
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:108855:136"/>
brings against it suppose him to be ignorant of what it is. For according to this account it is plain, that Bishops when they assemble in a General Council, are so far from acting out of their Sphere, and not as Governours, that to <hi>Represent</hi> the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church, and to govern it are one and the same thing. Nay their voting and defining in a General Council is one of the most noble and excellent exercises of their Episcopal Iurisdiction, as binding the whole Church to an observance of their Decrees, and securing their respective Flocks from any danger of miscarrying by the wholsom provision which they make against er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. Wherefore if they are Governours by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, they may be the Churche's <hi>Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives</hi> by Institution too.</p>
            <p n="134">134. Neither does it follow, becaus a King is not the <hi>Representative of his Kingdom,</hi> that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Bishops cannot be the <hi>Representatives</hi> of the Church. For altho a King and a Bishop are both Governours, yet there is a vast disparitie in the nature of each one's Power. For a King is a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour so as not to acknowledge any Superiour but God alone in any case whatsoever that falls under the Verge of Temporal Power. Let his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be never so unjust and unreasonable, and misbecoming his Greatnesse and Dignitie, yet he is accountable for the same to no other King, or to his own subjects, but onely to God from whom he has received his Authoritie, whose stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:108855:137"/>
he is, and whose person alone he <hi>Represents:</hi> In what Council, or Assemblie should he <hi>Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi> his Kingdom, who has within his own breast the Supreme Reason wherwith he ought to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern his Kingdom? I say the <hi>supreme Reason</hi> in this sense, that no one has a Right to controll him, or to resist him therin by force. But Bishops, altho they receive their Power immediately from Christ no lesse than Hereditarie Kings, yet the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of this Power, as often as it does not <hi>edifie the Bodie of Christ,</hi> is subjected by God himselfe to the Superiour Power of the first Bishop, or to an Assemblie of them all in a general Council. They <hi>Represent</hi> Christ so long as they follow the Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and Tradition of the Catholique Church, and Right Reason in the discharge of their Offices; but when the same Tradition is gainsaid by oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers, or the nonevidence of it occasions disputes; there is amongst them all onely one Power of as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serting and declaring the lawfulnesse of it, so as to oblige all Christians, which is exercised in a General Council by a competent number of them, who <hi>Represent</hi> their whole Bodie: The Church is but One altho there are manie Bishops in it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus they are closely united and connected among themselves by means of their Union with S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's <hi>One Chair,</hi> which is the <hi>root</hi> and <hi>beginning of the</hi> Ecclesiastical and <hi>Priestly unitie.</hi> But Temporal Kingdoms are not One but manie, becaus their Kings have distinct Powers, and an absolute Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:108855:137"/>
on one another. Wherefore it may wel stand, that Bishops may <hi>Represent</hi> the Church, by which no more is signified, but that some of them may <hi>Represent</hi> their whole Bodie; wheras Kings cannot be said to <hi>Represent</hi> either the whole order of Kings, or their own Kingdoms, or the generalitie of Kingdoms in the world, becaus they derive their Authoritie from God alone, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any intermediate dependance on their own Kingdom, or of any other Kingdom on Earth for the exercise of it.</p>

               <hi>§. 21. Ib.</hi> How then do they come to he the Churche's Representatives? Did all the Christians in the world, who are the Catholik Church, ever intrust them with this Power? Did they ever resign up their Faith into the hands of the Bishops? This never was done, and yet no man has a Representative but by his own consent.</p>
            <p n="135">135. Replie. We have seen that Bishops <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present the Catholique Church</hi> by God's appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that the consent of the Clergie, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> is not necessarie for this purpose, And suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing it were necessarie, yet it would not follow, that all those whom this Author accounts for true Christians and parts of the Catholik Church, ought to have a Power of giving their Votes for the election of Burgesses to serve in this great Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament of the Church. For there is onely one sort of Christians among those who professe contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictorie Faiths, who belong to the Catholique Church, and by consequence there is onely one
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:108855:138"/>
sort of them who can have a Right (if there were any such thing) to elect Deputies for their <hi>Representatives.</hi> The Dr. will do wel to examin which are those Christians, and as soon as he has found them out, he will perceive, that neither their inferiour Clergie, nor Laitie think themselves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured, becaus their Bishops assemble in General Councils without receiving their Power of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from them. And if they are wel satisfied, this Author can have no reason to complain, that General Councils meet and act without the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> of those who are divided from the Church. Can Outlaws and Rebels have reason, when they complain that the Commonwealth assembles, and makes Laws without their leave and concurrence?</p>
            <p n="136">136. It is a must intollerable Assertion in a Divine to say, that <hi>No man has a Representative but by his own consent.</hi> For what does he think of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam? Did not he <hi>Represent</hi> us before we were in being to give any consent thereto? Were not our wills included in his, and have not we dearly paid for his transgression ever since from the first mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that our souls were united to our Bodies? He had best argue the case with God, and ask him, how it was possible for him to sin in Adam, seing <hi>No man has a Representative but by his own consent?</hi> What does he think of the second Adam? Did not he <hi>Represent</hi> all the sinful race of the first Man, according to that of S. Paul 2. <hi>ad Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>Si unus pro omnibus mortuus est, ergo omnes mortui sunt?</hi>
               <pb n="259" facs="tcp:108855:138"/>
And were not all our crimes laid on his blessed shoulders? He may if he pleas renounce this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, by denying that any man <hi>can have a Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative but by his own consent.</hi> But all good Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians will acknowledge the greatnesse of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie that is done them, altho it transcend the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of common discourse. What does he think of the Apostles, when they received the Power of governing, and feeding the Flock of Christ? Did not they <hi>Represent</hi> the Pastors and Teachers of the Church in all succeeding Ages, who have claimed their Authoritie to govern, becaus it was given them by our Saviour in the persons of the Apostles? What does he think of Godfathers and Godmothers in Baptisme? Do not they <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present</hi> the Infant, who is uncapable of giving, or declaring his assent to the Faith in Christ? From all which instances it is evident, that those who are not in being, or unable to give any consent may have <hi>Representatives,</hi> and if this be possible, nay if it be an infallible truth that this <hi>defacto</hi> is, there can be no inconvenience nor any Mysterie in saying, that the whole <hi>Teaching Church</hi> may be <hi>Represented</hi> by a certain number of Bishops in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councils, which is a Doctrin much more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie to be conceived than some of those which I have mentioned; for what more easie than to conceive, that Christ who promised to <hi>teach his Church all truth,</hi> may performe this Promise in a General Council, wherin those Fathers who are present
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:108855:139"/>
may <hi>Represent</hi> their whole Bodie, that is, that Christ may hold and esteem them for their whole Bodie, for what relates to his Promise of <hi>tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching his Church all Truth?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="137">137. It can onely be granted, that <hi>no man can have a Representative but by his own consent</hi> in such matters wherin he has a Right to give his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, as suppose the People have a part in the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislative Power of a Kingdom, they can be <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented</hi> by no others, but such as they chuse themselves to sit in the General Diet; or suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing I am justly possessed of an estate, no man can <hi>Represent</hi> me so as to receive my rents without my leave, becaus in these cases an involuntarie <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation</hi> will be an encroachme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t upon the Right of the just Possessor. But it is otherwise when the <hi>representation</hi> is commanded by a Sovereign Power, and to be <hi>Represented</hi> is a matter of pure grace and favour, as it was when Adam <hi>Represented</hi> us, to whom God made manie pretious Promises on condition that he had persevered in Obedience to him; as also when we were <hi>Represented</hi> by our Saviour in Order to our Reconciliation to God for the disobedience of Adam, and our other sins that flowed from thence. In which cases our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent was not necessarie for the validitie of these <hi>Representations,</hi> becaus there was no injurie desig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned us by them, but a great deal of good. And besides we had no Right to give our consents, and on the other side God had a Right to be obeyd
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:108855:139"/>
by us, and to be adored for directing us to our last end by such a conduct of his Providence as pleased him best. He is our Absolute, Supreme, and Sovereign Lord and Master; and and what should hinder him from treating us after that way that suted best with the Maxims of his hidden Wisdom, and Power? And as our consent was not requisit for those <hi>Representations,</hi> so neither can the consent of every absent Bishop be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit for their <hi>Representations</hi> in a General Council. For certainly Christ as the Sovereign Lord and Lawgiver of his Church might appoint the <hi>Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations</hi> of absent Bishops without any neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie to ask their consents, seing they can have have no Right to give their consents unlesse they receive it from him. When Bishops <hi>Represent</hi> the Catholique Church, they have Christ for their Master and Instructor, which is a matter of the greatest Grace. And what absurditie can there be in saying, that Christ may dispense his favours on such terms as he likes best?</p>

               <hi>§. 22. P. 37.</hi> As Bishops are the supreme Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and Teachers of the Church, they may declare what the Faith is, and aggree what Doctrins shall be taught in their Churches, and consent to censure and excommunicate those will not professe to believe as they do.</p>
            <p n="138">138. Replie All that is here said is the proper and chief employment of General Councils, who are the Supreme Pastors and Teachers of the
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:108855:140"/>
Church; and if it be ascribed to them, we can find no fault at all with such innocent expressions. But that which follows spoils all, viz that <hi>if they make any Decrees contrarie to the common Faith of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> (what General Council ever did so?), <hi>no Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian is bound to believe them, nor is ever the worse for their Anathemas and Excommunications;</hi> as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise what he sais <hi>p.</hi> 43. that <hi>it is the office of Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Bishops and Pastors to preach the Gospel, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, and persuade gainsaiers by reason and Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which obliges all Christians diligently and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially to attend to their instructions, but yet leaves every man at libertie to judge, whether they preach the Gospel of Christ, or their own inventions.</hi> In which expressions we find the People made judges of the Lawfulnesse of the sentence which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by their Pastors, who are commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by God to govern them, and by consequence that they are bound to obey them no further than they pleas themselves.</p>
            <p n="139">139. For when the Pastors teach, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand such things as the People approves, the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in this Authors way ought to say, that they teach and command just things; and when they teach, and command such things as the People disapproves, they are bound to say, that they teach and command unjust things. So that if the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the People be the measure of the jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, or injustice of the commands of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and Pastors, it is a plain case, that their judgment must be the measure of the Right and
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:108855:140"/>
Power which the Pastors have to excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate them for their disagreeing Faith. It is not a pin-matter whether the Faith of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops be true, and their Commands and Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications just, if the People are not satisfied in these particulars, whose obligation of following the Faith of the Bishops is said not to arise from the Authoritie which the Bishops have over their belief, but from the conviction of their private reasons. Thus if the Faith of a Council of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and Pastors pleases me, I will make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of it, but if I judge it to be false after I have <hi>diligently and impartially</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered of it, I will renounce it', and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie all their Anathemas and Excommunications. Where lies their Power over me in this case? Or what Right have they to command me, so long as I can but persuade my selfe, that their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are in the wrong? If they have any Power over me, it is evident that the exercise therof must depend for it's validitie on my pleasure, which is wholly unintelligible. When I <hi>professe to believe as they do,</hi> I pleas my selfe, and not obey them; and when they command me to <hi>believe as they do,</hi> their commands signifie no more, but that I <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve as they do,</hi> if I have a mind to it. So that my conformitie to their belief is not an Act of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, becaus it does not proceed in vertue of an exteriour Command, but is the result of my own voluntarie choice. I should <hi>believe as they do</hi>
               <pb n="264" facs="tcp:108855:141"/>
now, altho their judgment were contrarie to what it is, and that they commanded me, that mine should be so too. And if a Juncto of Weavers can persuade me that what I believe is false, I'le fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them, and leave the <hi>Supreme Pastors and Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="140">140. This pestilent Reasoning shows, that the People are under no obligation of obeying the Bishops of the Church, and if they are under no such obligation, it is manifest, that the Bishops have no Power to command them. For who is able to conceive, how a just and All-wise God can give a Right and Power to an Assemblie of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops to <hi>declare what the Faith is,</hi> to command <hi>what Doctrins shall be taught,</hi> and to <hi>excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate those who will not professe to believe as they do,</hi> and yet at the same time give the People a Right and Power to judge, whether their Declarations of Faith be true, and their Excommunications just? It he has given this Power to Bishops and Pastors, it is questionlesse becaus he would have the People to obey them, and to <hi>believe as they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</hi> And if he has given the People a Right to judge of the Faith of the Bishops and Pastors, it is questionlesse becaus he leaves it in their Power and choice, whether they will obey them, and <hi>believe as they believe</hi> or no. Can God command the People to <hi>believe as the Bishops believe,</hi> and yet leave it to them, whether they will believe so or no? What is this else, but to command and not to
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:108855:141"/>
command them to do the same thing?</p>
            <p n="141">141. Again. If the People do ill in disliking the Faith of the Pastors, when after an <hi>impartial consideration</hi> of it, they cannot reconcile it to their consciences, why has he given them this libertie, and commanded them to do so? And in case they do wel, why has he given the Pastors of the Church a Power of casting them out of their Communion, if they will not <hi>professe to believe as they believe?</hi> A just God cannot punish without a crime, nor for any thing of which he himselfe is the Author. He has commanded us to continue in the visible and external unitie of the Church, and has promised manie blessings to the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of it: why then has he invested the Pastors with a Power of depriving us of the same with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any demerit of ours, as often as we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convinced that they preach a wrong Faith? And why has he made it a necessary and obligatorie Act in us to withdraw our selves from a state wherin he showers his blessings on us? If the Pastors may excommunicate us for not <hi>professing to believe as they do,</hi> it is supposed that they are sufficiently qualified by God to understand the greatnesse of our offence in not <hi>believing as they believe.</hi> And if we may without sin, nay if we may laudably not <hi>believe as they do,</hi> it is likewise supposed, that we are sufficiently qualified by God to discover the innocence of our consciences herin. How now can these two things be compatible, the judge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:108855:142"/>
by God's special grace to discover the heinousnesse of an action, and the Person accused instructed by God's special grace to discover the innocence of the same? Can the same thing be absolutely good; and absolutely bad? And yet this may happen, if God can represent the same Faith as absolutely bad to the Judge, and as absolutely good to the Criminal.

How then is it possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that we should be <hi>never the worse for their Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>themas and Excommunications</hi> which they lay on us becaus of our unsound Faith? How can it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the heart of a reasonable creature, that we deserve no punishment from those who are set over us by God as Judges, when they make use of those means which he affords them for the Cognizance of our crimes, and censure and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne us as often as they find us guiltie accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the obligation of their Office and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
            <p n="142">142. When we are cast in the Courts of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Iudicature, it will not passe for a Legal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption of us from punishment, if we tel the Iudge, that we are persuaded in our consciences, that he pronounces an unrighteous sentence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us. For if this were so, to be sure the Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges would Iways be in the fault, and the King by whom they are empowred to give sentence,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:108855:142"/>
would not be the Fountain of Equitie, but of injustice. Why then should it be a Legal exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christians from the punishment of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, if we tel our Ecclesiastical Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, that we are persuaded, that our Faith for which we are condemned, is sound and holie? It is no lesse than blasphemie to assert, that God is lesse prudent and efficacious in doing justice, and maintaining peace in the Christian Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, than earthly Kings are in their Civil States. And yet who sees not, that the provision of Kings in their Courts of Judicature is much more pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and efficacious in order to the preserving of peace and doing justice, than that of God in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment of his Church (which he will have to be One and Holie) is in the Drs. way, becaus the Plaintiff and Defendant must both submit to the Civil Judges decision and conscience: wheras there is such a great Solaecisme in the Politie of the Church, that Christians are Superiour to all Law and above punishment, if they are persuaded that their Judges are men of bad Faith and profligate consciences, altho they cannot pretend to a greater certaintie that they are in the right, than their jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges have to the contrarie by whom they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. All Heretiques and Schismatiques are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure under the shelter of this Principle, and he must be a man of a weak understanding and strong scruples, who being desirous to make new stirs in the Church, and to raise a separate Altar, can
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:108855:143"/>
be deterred from so doing by such a Power of excommunicating as this Author places in Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Bishops and Pastors.</p>
            <p n="143">143. There is no other way to defend the Right and Power which the Bishops of the Church are acknowledged to have to excommunicate those, who will not <hi>professe to believe as they believe,</hi> than by making the validitie and lawfulnesse of the exercise of this Power independent of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's judgment, so that the Faith of the Bishops be the Rule which the People ought to follow, and their deviation from this Rule be esteemed as a crime sufficient to warrant the justice and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galitie of their punishment by Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Such a Power as this is clear and intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and free from all those horrible absurdities which attend the other way of giving the Bishops a Power to excommunicate those who reject their true Declarations of Faith, and then submitting the truth of their Declarations to the judgment of every particular person. For according to this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, seing our private reason is not the Rule and measure whereby we ought to direct our consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences in matters of Faith, our Faith is an effect of our Obedience to our Pastors when we <hi>believe as they believe,</hi> and our dissent from them is a most criminal Disobedience. We are forbidden to break the visible Unitie of the Church, without the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie of doing the same. We are commanded to consider our Ecclesiastical Judges as sufficiently
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:108855:143"/>
qualified to judge of our errours in Faith, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Priviledge of censuring their judgments as false. We are to esteem their Excommunications as just punishments, becaus we are to esteem them under the Notion of Iudges as men of a Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural knowledge, probitie, and Authoritie. Here are no inconsistencies in the Rules of Government, no interfering and clashing of Rights, nothing that misbecomes an All-wise Lawgiver, but all things are ordered after such a manner as is ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable to Nature, and the reason of mankind.</p>
            <p n="144">144. The Dr. may say, that he cannot admit of such a Right and Power of excommunicating for errours in Faith, without granting the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and Teachers of the Church to be Infallible, whereof there appears no Institution. And he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved in his <hi>Vindicat. of some Prot.

            <p n="145">145. I answer first, that this Author (if there be any heed to be taken to his words) ascribes at present as great an Infallibilitie to the <hi>Supreme Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and Teachers</hi> of the Church, as we Catholiques do to General Councils. For if he had said, that the Bishops <hi>may excommunicate</hi> those who publik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contradict they Faith which they <hi>declare</hi> to be true, we could not infer any thing more from thence, than that in his judgment God has given them a Right of being obeyed in the Non-contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of their Faith, whereby there would be
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:108855:144"/>
libertie left for every one in private to believe what he judged best. But he sais, that they <hi>may excommunicate those who will not professe to believe as they believe;</hi> from whence I infer, that then God has given them a Right of being obeyed by their Flocks in the interiour assent of their minds to the Faith which they <hi>declare</hi> to be true; unlesse he say, that God requires of the People, that they <hi>professe to believe as the Bishops believe,</hi> and yet leaves it in their choice, whether they will interiourly <hi>believe</hi> so or no; which is an Assertion evidently false, becaus of the Essential opposition which the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God has to deceitfulnesse, and dissimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And if he does not onely require of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that they <hi>professe to believe as the Bishops be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,</hi> but likewise that they give an interiour assent to their Faith, he allows of as great an obligation in the People to believe the <hi>Pastors of the Church</hi> as we Catholiques do, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence as great an Infallibilitie in them as we as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to General Councils.</p>
            <p n="146">146. I Answer 2. that if we pretended to prove the Infallibilitie of the <hi>Supreme Pastors and Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Church</hi> from pure natural reason onely, I could not blame any one, who would not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="271" facs="tcp:108855:144"/>
of a thing which depends <hi>wholly upon the Divine will and pleasure.</hi> But our proceedings are quite contrarie; for altho we make use of Arguments drawn from natural reason in the explication of Divine Truths, yet we do not say, that God has done all that seems conformable to natural reason; (for how can natural reason say, that this or that is fitting for him to do without a perfect comprehension of his ends?). Neither do we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of this consequence, <hi>It is suitable to the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, Wisdom, or Power of God to do so, or so: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God has done so or so.</hi> However we hold, that God cannot do any thing that is repugnant to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural reason, becaus he cannot act against the <hi>Light of his own Countenance which he has imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on us, Psalm.</hi> 4. On which account we hold this for a very good consequence, <hi>It is contrarie to the Greatnesse, Wisdom, Goodnesse, or Power of God to do so or so. Therefore God has not done so, or so.</hi> This is the way which I have taken at present; for I prove, that God could not give to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of the Church a Power of <hi>Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> Dissenters in Faith, and yet subject the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse and validitie of the exercise of this Power to the judgment of the Dissenters themselves, becaus such a Power as this misbecomes the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, and is repugnant to natural reason. And from hence I conclude, that if God has left such a Power in the Bishops (as no bodie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies), the lawfulnesse and validitie of the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:108855:145"/>
therof must be taken from the judgment of the Bishops as it's proper Rule and measure which necessarily argues their Infallibilitie (I mean always when they define in a General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, or when they teach the known Faith of the Church Diffusive, or the Definitions of former General Councils). In which inferences it is to be observed, that the reason whereby I prove the judgment of Bishops to be the Rule and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the Lawfulnesse and validitie of their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communications for errours in Faith, is not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, becaus it is deduced from a Principle of Faith, viz that <hi>Christ has left in his Church a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to excommunicate those who erre in Faith.</hi> And the like obfervation we may make in some of our modern Authors, when they prove the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie of an Universal Head of the Church, whom Protestants traduce, as tho they endeavour to make it out by pure natural Reason, and not from the connexion it has with Scripture, or Christian Principles.</p>

               <pb n="274" facs="tcp:108855:146"/>
as we do likewise first, from the Motives of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibilitie wherwith she is accompanied, and which are so manie Marks of God's special Grace and favour towards her. From whence we argue, that it is impossible for her to to erre in what she teaches, becaus it is impossible for an Essential Veracitie to countenance errour, or a possibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of errour so far as to make it evidently Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible. For if God makes those who deceive us, or who may deceive us to be evidently Credible, he acts against his own Attributes, and we may justly lay our destruction to his charge, becaus he has given us such natures, as cannot chuse but believe what he has made evidently Credible. 2. We prove it from several places of H. Scripture, as first from our Saviour's Promises to <hi>remain with his Church to the end of the world,</hi> and to <hi>send the Comforting Spirit, the Spirit of Truth to assist her, and to teach her all Truth.</hi> From whence we infer, that if the Church <hi>teaches</hi> us what the <hi>Spirit of Truth teaches her,</hi> it is as impossible for us to erre so long as we follow the Church, as for the <hi>Spirit of Truth</hi> to be the Spirit of falshood. And we may safely conclude, that the Church shall always <hi>teach</hi> us as she is <hi>taught</hi> by the <hi>Spirit of Truth,</hi> becaus she is <hi>taught</hi> by him, to the end she may <hi>teach</hi> us. 3.

From whence we argue, that those whom we are to <hi>hear</hi> as tho we <hi>heard</hi> Christ, must necessarily be preserved from errour by him; otherwise we are under the same obligation of <hi>hearing</hi> liars and such as may deceive us, as we are to <hi>hear</hi> Truth it selfe. We say likewise, that if we are bound to <hi>hear the Church</hi> under pain of being <hi>Heathens,</hi> the Church cannot deceive us in what she proposes to our belief, unlesse God can command us to <hi>hear</hi> those who may lead us into errour under pain of being damned.

his Caus better service, if he had shown us, how the Catholique Church can be one Visible Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and Bodie without an Oecumenical Pastor, than to prove from such sorrie Principles that it is no <hi>Organized Bodie,</hi> from whence it clearly follows, that it is not One Visible Bodie and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie.</p>
            <p>§. 24. <hi>P.</hi> 38. He draws two Conclusions from this wise Observation. 1. <hi>That no Organized Church can be the Catholique Church, nor the Bishop of it an Oecumenical Pastor, becaus the Catholique Church is not Organized, but every Organized Church is a particular Church,</hi> 2. <hi>That there neither is, nor can be any Visible Tribunal of the Catholique Church, which shall be the Centre of Catholique Communion, and have Authoritie over all particular Churches in matters of Faith, and Worship, and Government. For the. Catholique Church being no Organized Bodie, it has no Authoritie, and can have no Tribunal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="150">150. Replie. The weaknesse of these Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions appears from what I have said in my last Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie, and shall further appear from what I shall say §. 28. concerning the Visible Tribunal of the Catholique Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>§. 25. Ibid. He proves that the Catholique Church has no Authoritie, becaus</hi> the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of the Faithful, which is the true Notion of it, are the Bodie of Christ ..... that it is made up of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular and individual Christians, who are all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately united to Christ their Head ...... that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:108855:147"/>
as they are Members of the Catholique Church <hi>(as it is Christ Mystical Bodie)</hi> are not considered as Bishops, but as private Christians; for it is not their Authoritie in the Church, but their union to Christ which makes them Members of his Bodie .... that if the Catholique Church be onely a companie of private and particular Christians united immediately to Christ, and made one in him, it has is no more Authoritie than particular Christians, which is none at all.</p>
            <p n="151">151. Replie. We willingly grant, that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church as it is Christ's Mystical Bodie has no Authoritie. But what then? This does not prove, that is has no Authoritie as it is a Visible Bodie and Societie. Here lies the difficultie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween me and the Dr. which cannot be cleared without the Notion of the Catholique Church as it is a Visible Bodie and Societie, which we are to expect in his Second part, for at present we can gather no such thing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>§. 26.</hi> The Catholique Church is united to Christ by a belief of his Gospel, obedience to his Laws, and a participation of his Spirit, which is a state of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and absolute subjection to him, and therefore can have no Authoritie to alter the Faith, to make a new Creed, or a new Gospel, which would be to have Power over Christ, and not to be subject to him.</p>
            <p n="152">152. Replie. To what end is all this talk of <hi>altering the Faith,</hi> and making a <hi>new Creed,</hi> or a <hi>new Gospel?</hi> as tho we ascribed any such Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:108855:148"/>
as this to the Catholique Church. If he had first made this out, he would have had reason to provide Arguments against so scandalous an asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but knowing in his conscience that we dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own this Doctrin no lesse than himselfe, as he confesses in effect <hi>p.</hi> 43. when he sais, that <hi>no bodie pretends to an Authoritie of making new Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Faith,</hi> we cannot put any other constructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on his frequent Arguments of this nature throughout his Discourse, than that they are so manie evidences of his insinceritie, or perhaps an effect of his unwillingnesse to omit any occasion tho never so frivolous, and unhandsom of show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his talent in spinning of consequences.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>§. 27.</hi> p. <hi>40.</hi> Christ indeed has placed an Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie in his Church for the instruction and goverment of it; but an Authoritie in the Church and an Authoritie of the Church are two different things. The first signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the Authoritie of Christ who is the Head; the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is the Authoritie of the Bodie, which is the Church; the Head has Authoritie over his Church, and may appoint what Ministers he pleases to exercise this Authoritie, but the Church has no Authoritie at all, no more than the Bodie which is subject to the Head</p>
            <p n="153">153. Replie. He sais that <hi>this may be thought a very nice distinction between the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie in the Church and the Authoritie of the Church,</hi> but I think it rather obscure than nice, how useful soever it may be to a Caus that cannot be maintained without tricking. For what means he by the word <hi>Church,</hi> when he sais that Christ has
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:108855:148"/>
               <hi>placed an Authoritie in his Church?</hi> If he take it as it signifies Christ's Mystical Bodie, it is evident, that he has <hi>placed</hi> no Authoritie therin which is distinct from his own, becaus he immediately sanctifies, governs, and directs it by his invisible Motions and Graces in order to it's last end. But if he take it as it imports a Visible Societie, it is plain, that an <hi>Authoritie in the Church,</hi> and <hi>an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the Church</hi> are one and the same thing. For the Authoritie of Ecclesiastical <hi>Ministers</hi> is all the Authoritie which is <hi>in the Church</hi> as it is thus considered, and there is no other Authoritie <hi>of the Church.</hi> For our Lord has delegated his power of governing to Bishops and Pastors who are the <hi>tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Church,</hi> and not to the People whose dutie it is to <hi>hear</hi> their Pastors and to obey them as tho they <hi>heard</hi> Christ himselfe. So that by the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie <hi>of the Church</hi> we are to understand the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of those whom S. Paul <hi>ad Hebr. cap.</hi> 13. bid us to <hi>obey,</hi> for that <hi>they watch over us, and are to give an account of our souls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="154">154. It is not denied, but that the Authoritie which Christ has <hi>placed in the Church</hi> is the <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of Christ,</hi> but from hence it does not follow, that it cannot be the <hi>Authoritie of the Church,</hi> that is, of the Bishops and Pastors; or that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie which Christ has committed to them is so far Christ's, that it cannot be truly said to be theirs too. For this is to contradict the common sense of mankind, which allows to every one a Right to that which is given him. For which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:108855:149"/>
we say, that the Authoritie of Kings and Princes is the Authoritie of God, and yet we cannot denie, but that is theirs too by guift and participation; and we might as wel denie them to have any Authoritie, as denie that Bishops and Pastors have any, becaus the Authoritie of Kings and Pastors is equally derived from Christ. As to what he sais, that <hi>the Authoritie of the Church sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies the Authoritie of the Bodie,</hi> it is very false, as we have seen, if by <hi>Bodie</hi> we are to understand <hi>the whole Companie of the Faithfull;</hi> for we hold no lesse than he that <hi>the whole Companie of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi> as such has no Authoritie at all, but is under an immediate subjection to Christ their Mystical and invisible Head.</p>
            <p n="155">155. The usefulnesse of this pretended Distinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion appears in the discourse which he makes upon it. <hi>Those,</hi> sais he, <hi>who would impose upon the Faith of of Christions talk of nothing lesse than the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Catholique Church, which sounds very big, and frights People into a submission. Whilst Bishops pretend onely the Authoritie of Christ's Ministers, private Christians make bold to examin their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, and how far their Authoritie reaches, and whether they do not prevaricate in the exercise of it, as it is possible Ministers may do; but the name of the Catholique Church strikes all dead, for who dares op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the Decrees of the Catholique Church? Which is to condemne the whole Church of errour and Heresie; who dares separate from the Catholique Church?</hi>
               <pb n="281" facs="tcp:108855:149"/>
Which must be an unpardonable Schisme, and a state of damnation, since it is universally aggreed, that there is no salvation to be had out of the Catholique Church ..... but now all these amusements vanish, when we remember, that the Catholique Church has no Authoritie.</p>
            <p n="156">156. How pleasing is this libertin lesson to flesh and bloud! How he triumphs with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit that he has destroyed the Authoritie of the Church, which we are bound to <hi>hear</hi> under pain of being <hi>Heathens!</hi> One would think by his confidence, that he had done this great feat by Scripture, Fathers, and Tradition: and yet he has not formed so much as one Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from any of these Heads, but instead ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of tels us, that the Catholique Church is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but <hi>the whole Companie of the Faithfull,</hi> and that <hi>Bishops and Pastors do not belong to the Definition of it,</hi> from which pidling and false Principles he concludes, that it has no Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. The next Replie wil give a further account what litle reason he has to rejoyce on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
            <p>§. 28. P. 43. He 2. proves, that <hi>the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church has no Authoritie, becaus it has no no Visible Tribunal wherin to exercise this Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie;</hi> and he proves, that it has no <hi>Visible Tribunal,</hi> becaus it is nothing else <hi>but the whole Companic of the Faithfull.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="157">157. Replie. I have shown over and over,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:108855:150"/>
that Bishops and Pastors belong to the Notion and Definition of the Catholique Church, from whence it follows, that if they have Authoritie, the Catholique Church must have it too. And if the Catholique Church have Authoritie, it may have <hi>a Visible Tribunal wherin to exercise this Authoritie.</hi> For what should hinder, but that the <hi>Teaching Church,</hi> that is, the Bishops and Pastors may as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble in General Councils (which is that, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, which he means by a <hi>Visible Tribunal</hi>) as often as occasions require, to determin Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies relating to Faith, Moralitie, or Disciplin? Our Author does not denie, but that they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Authoritie, and Power for the government of their respective Churches, the question is, whether when they are assembled in General Councils in the manner above mentioned <hi>chap.</hi> 2. § 20. they have Power to oblige <hi>the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of the Faithfull</hi> to an observance of their common Decrees.</p>
            <p n="158">158. Those who have been Members of the Visible Church in all Ages have acknowledged such a Power in them, and have held all such for Heretiques and Schismatiques, who have not bended their judgments to their Declarations of Faith, and paid Obedience to all other regulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that have been made by them, of which no one can make any question, who is never so litle acquainted with Ecclesiastical Historie, where we learn that General Councils have been always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:108855:150"/>
as the supreme Tribunals whither Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians repaired for the redresse of their Spiritual grievances. And I challenge this Author to show, that any one sort of Christians who have dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in any Age from the Definitions of any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of Bishops which the Visible Church of their times held for General, were esteemed hy the Visible Church as their Fellow-members of Christ's Mystical Bodie. Which unanimous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of the Members of Christ's Church in the same judgment touching the Authoritie of General Councils, is a matter of infinitly greater moment to move us to an acknowledgment of a <hi>Visible Tribunal</hi> in the Catholique Church, than any thing which this Author has produced can persuade us to the contrarie. For if we may safely follow a Doctrin which has been practiced, and believed in the purest times of the Catholique Church, becaus there is a just and vehement Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption that it descended by Tradition from Christ and his Apostles, there can be no reason, why we should disown the Authoritie of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Conncils, which we find to have been exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised on the first great occasion that was presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the case of Arius at the Council of Nice under Constantin the first Christian Emperour, in whose time Christians made a publique pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of their Faith, and declared by their prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice what their belief had been under the persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of unbelieving Princes.</p>
            <p n="159">
               <pb n="284" facs="tcp:108855:151"/>
159. Neither is the use of General Councils re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended to us onely by Tradition, but it is more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over countenanced and proved to be lawfull by the practice of the Apostles themselves, who held one at Hierusalem, as we read in their <hi>Acts chap.</hi> 15. And by reason the assembling of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil was very remarkeble in all it's Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, I shall handle it the more at large for the clearer discussion of the Point which lies before me. There was a great Dispute raised at Antioch between the converted Gentils and certain Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Jews, by whom the Gentils were taught, that <hi>unlesse they were circumcised after the Law of Moses, they could not be saved</hi> 
               <abbr>v</abbr>. 1. This Doctrin was vehemently opposed by Paul and Barnabas, but all they could say was not sufficient to gain credit: wherefore it was resolved, that <hi>Paul and Barnabas with some others from among them should go up to Hierusalem, to consult with the Apostles and Elders about this question</hi> (<abbr>v</abbr>. 2.) who accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly set forwards, and when they were come thither, they found there likewise <hi>certain believing Pharisees, who judged it necessarie, that the Gentils should observe the Law of Moses</hi> (<abbr>v</abbr>. 5.) wherupon <hi>the Apostles and Elders assembled to consider of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> (<abbr>v</abbr>. 6.) and it was examined by them with a great deal of care and diligence, as we may learn from those words <hi>Cum autem magna conqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitio fieret.</hi> 
               <abbr>v</abbr>. 7.</p>
            <p n="160">160. There is no dispute, but that S. Paul and S.
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:108855:151"/>
Barnabas and every single Apostle had sufficient Authoritie to end all Controversies that arose a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong their Converts, becaus of their perpetual assistance by the H. Ghost in the exercise of their Functions, and that this Authoritie being made evidently Credible by the manie Miracles which they wrought among them, there lay an obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation on their hearers to give an entire assent to all they preached without any more ado. For which reason we must say, that these believing Jews and Antiochian Christians sinned in not res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting satisfied with what S. Paul and S. Barnabas had said against the Doctrin which caused so great a disturbance, as may be gathered from <abbr>v</abbr>. 24. where the Council sais, that these Jews had <hi>subverted the souls of the Antiochians,</hi> not onely by the unquietnesse of mind which they raised in them by <hi>such things as they had not been commanded to teach,</hi> but likewise by the unsetlednesse and depravation of their Faith, as we may learn from <abbr>v</abbr>. 32. where Iude and Silas are said to have u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed manie discourses to <hi>strengthen</hi> and confirme them in it. And besides the assistance of the H. Ghost which was common to all the Apostles in the discharge of their duties, these unsetled Christians found a special Motive in S. Paul, why they ought to have laid aside all their scruples, becaus the Non-necessitie of Circumcision had been revealed by our Lord to him in expresse terms, which had not been done to the other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:108855:152"/>
as may be seen above <hi>chap.</hi> 1. N. 80. &amp; <hi>seq.</hi> whither I refer the reader for a more full in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the matter in hand. And question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse S. Paul did not forbear to acquaint them, as he did the Galatians afterwards (<hi>cap.</hi> 1. <abbr>v</abbr>. 12) on the same occasion, that he had not <hi>received his Gospel from man, nor learned it but by Revelation from Iesus Christ.</hi> But notwithstanding that the Authoritie of each single Apostle was thus secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and in particular that of S. Paul, yet seing it met with an opposition about a Doctrin wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of their whole Colledge could not pretend an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate deliverie from our Saviour in expresse terms, it was judged by them more fitting to be exercised in a General Assemblie of them together with the Elders, since it was desired, that the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of the Faith might suffer no prejudice by the difference there was in the ways whereby the Apostles came to the knowledge of it. Nay it was judged more fitting to be thus exercised by the H. Ghost himselfe, becaus S. Paul ad <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. sais, that <hi>he went up to Herusalem with Barnabas</hi> in persuance of a <hi>Revelation</hi> which he had to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. Which passage is held by manie Fathers to relate to the journey which he made to Hierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem about the question of Circumcision.</p>
            <p n="161">161. The Jews were very fond of their Law which had God for it's Author, and which had been recommended to them by manie great and Supernatural wonders. They had had of old times
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:108855:152"/>
manie repeated assurances of God's care over them, as long as they were observant of it. They had a tender veneration for Abraham their Illus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious Progenitor, from whom they had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Command of Circumcision, as likewise for Moses the great Favorit of God, who deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered them their Law. They saw that Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion was called by God <hi>Gen.</hi> 16. <hi>an everlasting Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> and knew that all the Holie Prophets and Saints from the times of Abraham and Moses li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the profession of this Practice, and that our Lord himselfe was circumcised and observed to the last the Law of Moses; nay they knew our Lord's Declaration in the Ghospel <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. that <hi>he come not to destroy the Law, but to fulfill it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="162">162. All which Arguments were of strange force with these Converts, who were not as yet weaned from their devotion to the <hi>Letre,</hi> and might seem to conclude as strongly the necessitie of Circumcision after the Messia, as any conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences could prove the contrarie which were drawn by the Apostles from the Doctrin of the Messia. It was therefore requisit, that there should be some condescension to their weaknesse, as wel as to the desires of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tils, and that they should be heard, and their Plea throughly considered. And this course seems to have been the rather taken, becaus the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the Jews in this Point, and after such a manner (which was the most solemne and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:108855:153"/>
they could possibly desire as Christians) would render the conversion of the Gentils more easie, and their Faith more secure, seing a misunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of the Jewish Converts with the Apos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, or Apostolique Missioners, would either caus scandal among the Gentils, and so hinder their embracing the Faith of Christ; or else cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt their Faith, in case they did believe, as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to the Syrians, Cicilians &amp;c. <abbr>v</abbr>. 23. For so manie plausible Arguments as the Jews might frame in favour of Circumcision out of the Old Testament wherof they had been the keepers and preservers; together with the example and the aforesaid Declaration of our Saviour, were likely to work strongly on new beginners, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving attained to the knowledge of the true God, would be apt to believe all he said in a literal sense, for fear they should disbelieve him in any thing, or omit any thing that was necessarily required for the enjoyment of him, unlesse the nullitie and unconclusivenesse of those Arguments were shown in such a manner as was able to master a Jewish obstinacie. Wherefore seing the Gentils desired that those Arguments might be examined in a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council, a General Council was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly granted them; whereby both Jews and Gentils might rest satisfied.</p>
            <p n="163">163. When we read of the <hi>great enquirie</hi> that was made, we ought not to judge, that there were any of the Apostles who favoured the Jews, and
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:108855:153"/>
opposed their Brethren in their behalfe, but that the dissatisfied Jews and Pharisees them selves were allowed to dispute, and to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage their Arguments in their own persons. For of the five Apostles who are known to have been present in the Council, the judgment of those four who are mentioned by S. Luke in the <hi>Acts</hi> are clearly against the necessitie of Circumcision; and we may safely conclude; that S. John who is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by S. Paul <hi>loc. cit.</hi> and the other Apostles, if any more of them were present, were of the same mind too. For after the Vision which S. Peter had at Joppe wherin he first learned it to be lawfull to preach to the Gentils, and the descent of the H. Ghost upon Cornelius the Gentil and his familie, the other Apostles had convincing grounds to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Circumcision was not necessarie to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation (as we shall see below); and we may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume that their <hi>Spirit,</hi> after they had heard an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this Vision, <hi>bore witnesse to the Spirit</hi> which spoke by S. Peter, this having been an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion wherin S. Peter <hi>confirmed his Brethren.</hi> S. Peter learned likewise in that Vision, that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Jews might freely converse with the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tils, and that they were not tied to that choice of meats which was prescribed by the Law of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, from whence the Apostles had no lesse evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent grounds to gather the abrogation of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision, supposing we will allow them to have been acquainted with that truth which S. Paul
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:108855:154"/>
delivers to the Galatians <hi>cap.</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> viz that <hi>he that circumcises himselfe is obliged to the observance of the whole Law,</hi> which is that which S. Peter means; when he calls Circumcision <hi>a yoke which neither the Iews nor their Forefathers were able to bear.</hi> For it is a plain case, that if Circumcision was an obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to observe <hi>the whole Law,</hi> that the nature of it was changed, and it's necessitie taken away, when God had forbidden the observance of <hi>the whole Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="164">164. And we have all the reason in the world to conclude, that not onely the Apostles, but the Elders also were possessed with the same Truth after the aforesaid Vision, as wel becaus of the conformitie which they ought to have to the Apos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles Faith, as also becaus when they were assembled together with them in council, they all unanimous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared to the Antiochians that they <hi>had not commanded</hi> the Jews to teach the necessitie of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision. Which were's ought to be carefully weighed. For they must be understood so, as to signifie that none of the Council, whether they were Apostles, or Elders had at any time taught by themselves, or <hi>commanded</hi> any others to teach the necessitie of this Doctrin. For the Antiochi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans knew wel enough, that the Council as such could not <hi>command</hi> any one to preach this Doctrin to them, before it was assembled. It was 18. years after our Saviour's Ascension into Heaven, and 7: years after the separation of the Apostles
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:108855:154"/>
for the Conversion of Nations before the conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this Council, in which time there had been manie great conversions wrought among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tils, whom if we should suppose to have been circumcised by the Apostles, or Elders as a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie dutie of their Religion, or to have been taught the necessitie of this Sacrament, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil could neither truly nor sincerely have written to the Antiochians, that they had never <hi>comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</hi> the preaching of this Doctrin to them; becaus those who are in Authoritie do in a moral sense <hi>command</hi> the performance of those things, which they practice as a necessarie part of their dutie and obligation, when their subjects are bound in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science to follow their example, as the Faithfull were to follow the Apostles and Elders in all things that were practised by them as a necessarie means of salvation. And if neither the Apostles, nor El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders had before this Council practiced this Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin as a part of Christianitie, or <hi>commanded</hi> it to be taught, what other construction can we put upon this manner of procedure, but that they did not believe Circumcision to be necessarie to salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
            <p n="165">165. I hold it for certain, that the Clergie in general after S. Peter's Vision at Joppe believed the abrogation of this Sacrament, and that they never administred it to any Gentils whom they had converted as a necessarie part of their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; nay that they possessed them with the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:108855:155"/>
truth, as often as there was an occasion for it as they did also such Jews whom they found to be wel disposed for the receiving of it, as appears from the Scripture's saying, that <hi>certain of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Pharisees judged it necessarie, that the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tils should be circumcised,</hi> which is an argument that all of them were not of the same judgment. But yet I do not think that they ever preached this Doctrin as freely and universally among the Iews, as they did the other parts of the Christian Faith till after the calling of this Council, becaus of their weaknesse and obduracie. Neither did they do it then neither till after some years, that they were grown stronger in spirit, as appears from S. Paul's circumcising of Timothie <note n="*" place="bottom">Chap. <hi>16.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>becaus of the Iews in those parts who all knew that his Father was a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til;</hi> as likewise from the advice which S. James gave to S. Paul with the concurrence of all the the Elders at Hierusalem who were assembled on this occasion viz that he should <note n="*" place="bottom">Chap. <hi>21.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>purisie himselfe in the Temple according to the prescript of the Law, for that there were manie thousands of believing Iews who continued zealous for the Law, and were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended that he had ordered the Iews who dwelt among the Gentils not to circumcise their children, and that by this means they would all know, that what they had heard of him was all false, and that he himselfe kept the Law.</hi> Which shows, that there was a connivence towards the Jews, or rather that there was an indulgent condescension to their weaknesse,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:108855:155"/>
and a Dispensation (for such we ought to esteem the advice of S. James) to continue in the practice of the Law, which of it selfe was not evil but of God's own Institution, but not that there was any Dispensation not to believe the inutilitie of Circumcision and other Legal performances, which having been at first revealed to S. Peter, and afterwards defined, and declared in a General Council of Apostles and Elders, reached every Member of the Church whether Jew or Gentil, as soon as it was duly proposed to their belief by their Ecclesiastical Superiours, which was not as yet done generally sowards the Jews but onely towards the Gentils. Neither did the Council declare the Jews, or all the Faithfull to be free from the observance of the Law, but onely the Gentils about whose Cause they were assembled, altho it was very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie for every one who was wel instructed in the Faith, to gather a General exemption of all Christians from the observance of the Law from those discourses which the Council held against Circumcision, and the Declaration which they made in favour of the Gentils.</p>
            <p n="166">166. S. Paul's <hi>purifyng himselfe</hi> in the Temple was an evident proof for the Jews, that they might without sin practice the Law of Moses, but it was no warrant for them to believe, that the practice of the Law was necessarie to salvation, this being a Doctrin which they were to learne by word of mouth and preaching, and not by actions. For
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:108855:156"/>
how could they be certain, that an action which might be done for different motives, supposed any one motive in particular, unlesse the doer of it discovered to them which it was? They might lawfully conclude thus: <hi>Paul purifies himselfe: Therefore he holds it lawful to follow the Law of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;</hi> but their discourse failed, if they argued thus: <hi>Paul purifies himselfe: therefore he acknowledges an obligation in conscience to follow the Law of Moses,</hi> which was a Doctrin onely tollerated among the Jews, and permitted by the Apostles, since it could not be remedied without the danger of their total defection from Christ. And this was the reason, why S. James found out an occasion whereby they might deceive themselves about S. Paul's judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, till such time as they were better disposed to embrace it when it should be made known to them, as judging it much better for them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continue in their ignorance of a truth, which in all likelyhood they would not have accepted at that time, altho it had been as formally propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to their belief as it had been to the Gentils.</p>
            <p n="167">167. Seing the Apostles called this Council by an inspiration of the H. Ghost, the number of the Fathers who assembled therin, was likewise ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by the H. Ghost for a sufficient Court and <hi>Tribunal.</hi> The Church was yet in it's infancie, and the number of Pastors but few in respect of what they are now, and the presence of manie of those few was necessarie among their Flocks, and
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:108855:156"/>
therefore we ought not to expect any great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of them to the Council. However consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering this infancie of the Church we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently affirme of this Council, that it was as General as any that has been held from that time to this, becaus of the presence of sive Apostles therin who were the principal Teachers of the Church, and the glorious Patriarchs from whom descend the multitude of Governours who are in the Church at present. We have no pressing grounds from Antiquitie to believe, that there were any more than five of them present, viz Peter, Paul, Iames, Barnabie, and Iohn, as we find <hi>ad Gal. Cap.</hi> 2. <abbr>v</abbr>. 9. and there can be given a good account how they came to be there. As for James, he was in the Citie where he was Bishop; Peter came thither becaus of his banishment out of Rome by Claudius together with all others of his Countrie; Paul and Barnabas were preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Faith to the Antiochians, and were brought thither by the dispute which arose in that Citie about Circumcision; and Ephesus where John was Bishop, lay not so far off but that he might be sent for from thence upon a much shorter war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning than the other Apostles who are not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and of whom it is certain, that they were departed for their respective Provinces some years before the assembling of this Council. We may adde to these five Apostles a good appearance of Elders, of whom we have evident grounds to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:108855:157"/>
that they exceeded by far the number of the Apostles. For S. Paul, as we find <hi>ad Gal.</hi> 2. brought Titus along with him from Antioch together with <hi>some others</hi> as it is said in this <hi>Chap.</hi> 
               <abbr>v</abbr>. 2. and we read <abbr>v</abbr>. 22. that <hi>Iudas</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> carried the Acts of the Council to Antioch. Here we have at least five alreadie, and it is a hard case if among our Lord's 70. Disciples, and others who after his Ascension had been ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and qualified by the Apostles call to fit in Council there remained not at Hieru salem (which was the seat of an Apostle, and the chief Citie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Jews) enough to make their number more than five thrice told, especially considering that when <hi>S.</hi> James advised S. Paul to <hi>purifie</hi> himselfe, it is said that <hi>all the Elders</hi> assembled on this occasion, which denotes a considerable number of them, and this at a time when there was no Council held. <hi>Iudas</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise called <hi>Principal men among the Brethren</hi> 
               <abbr>v</abbr>. 22. that is, among the Elders, which shows, that there were a great manie Elders at Hierusalem whom they excelled in Guifts. Besides, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles were always attended by some one or more of the Elders to be witnesses of their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Associates in their labours. So that if we allow but one Elder for each Apostle their number will be equal; and since it is incredible, that there were not at Hierusalem before the coming of Peter, Paul, Iohn, and Barnabie manie more
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:108855:157"/>
Elders than the Associates of S. James, their number must have been much greater than that of the Apostles. Neither is it at all likely, that the Iews and Antiochians would have appealed from the Apostles to a lesser number of Elders than there were Apostles.</p>
            <p n="168">168. S. Peter as the first Apostle declared his judgment first in the matter after there had been a <hi>great enquirie made,</hi> and disputed against the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie of Circumcision from two Heads. The first was <abbr>v</abbr>. 8. and 9. becaus <hi>God had given the H. Ghost to the Gentils even as he had done to the Iews, and made no distinction between them, purifying their hearts by Faith.</hi> The giving of the H. Ghost is the greatest perfection of a Christian during this pilgrimage on Earth. He is the <hi>Comforter</hi> who sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports the Church under all he pressures she lies under, and the <hi>principal spirit</hi> which is to secure and confirme to her all other Blessings which she has received from our Lord. He is the <hi>seal</hi> of her Redemption, and the <hi>Pledge</hi> of her salvation. He discovered his presence in the Faithfull in the first beginnings of Christanitie by manie visible effects which were above nature, as by Prophecie, the Guift of Tongues, and working of Miracles, as also by a notorious and evident change of life and manners, as by humilitie, patience, fervour of Spirit, contempt of all sensible delights, and a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement desire of promoting the glorie of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Iesus, notwithstanding all the impediments
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:108855:158"/>
they met withal through the opposition of the world, and the devil. From all which Marks and Signs which S. Peter observed in the converted Gentils, he concluded, that they were as perfect Christians as those of the Circumcision who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed the Faith, and if they were perfect Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, that they stood in no need of Circumcision. If he had preached Moses to them, and the H. Ghost had descended on them upon their belief of his Law, they would have stood in need of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision: but seing he preached Christ unto them, and the H. Ghost had descended on them upon their belief of his Gospel, and <hi>purified their hearts</hi> by means therof, he inferred, that they stood in no need of Circumcision, but of Baptisme which was part of the Gospel which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved.</p>
            <p n="169">169. His 2. Head was from the Libertie of Spirit which Christ had given to his followers. <hi>Why tempt ye God,</hi> sais he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

His Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments caus Love, becaus they cause Grace; and if they caus Love, they caus Libertie. The Love of God is the contempt of all earthly things; and no man is a slave to the things of this world, who knows how to contemne them. The Love of God is an adhaesion to an infinit Goodnesse; and
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:108855:158"/>
no man can be a slave under such a state, becaus it is a state of the greatest Happinesse. The Law of Moses on the contrarie was a state of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>laverie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus it subjected the minds of men to the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of Creatures as of days, and months, and Ceremonies whose whole Essence consisted in the signification of Blessings which they could not give. The Sacraments which it enjoyned with the greatest rigour did not caus Love, becaus they did not caus Grace; and as they did not caus Love, so they did not caus Happinesse by weaning the affections of men from the painfull and hurtful persuit of the goods of this life. And what is a state of unhappinesse, but a state of Bondage? The observance of such things as do not caus, nor suppose the Love of him by whom they are commanded, lays on us an obligation to obey without any reward to our Obedience, which is meer slaverie. And this was the case of the Jews as to the Precept of Circumcision, which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> in them Justice and the Love of God, nor by consequence supposed any such Love in God towards them, as inclined him to reward the observance of it with the joys of Heaven, but at most to make them a recompence here in this world by Temporal Blessings. For seing the Justice which was wrought in Circumcision was not effected by this Sacrament, but by the Faith of the receivers or givers of it, it was in it selfe a <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

their salvation; wheras the contrarie happens in Baptisme, which causes that Justice which it signifies, and as it causes Justice, so it causes Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, happinesse, and glorie. Prom these Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations S. Peter concluded, that seing the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Christ's Law was a state of Libertie, as no one doubted but it was; and seing the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of Circumcision and the Law of Moses was incompatible with this Libertie, it followed that Circumcision could not be necessarie to salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p n="170">170. Next after Peter followed the judgment of Paul and Barnabas, who formed their discourse from <hi>the manie Miracles and wonders which God had wrought among the Gentils by them.</hi> When God works Miracles in defence of a Doctrin, he so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly engages his Veracitie for the truth of the same. Miracles have their signification as wel as words; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> seing no Power but that of God can do things above nature, it is onely God who speaks that language which is conveyed into our hearts by their means. These Blessed men instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Gentils, and reconciled them to Christ without Circumcision, nay they taught them that Circumcision was not necessarie to salvation, and yet God assisted them all along, and gained the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit by the Miracles which he wrought by them: fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence they concluded, that Circumcision was not necessarie to salvation; otherwise God would never have declared the Non-necessitie of it by so
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:108855:159"/>
manie Miracles, when they preached this Doctrin together with the other parts of the Christian Faith.</p>
            <p n="171">171. In the last place which is upon record there comes the Judgment of James, who proves the Non-necessitie of Circumcision first from <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon, who hath declared, that God at the first did visit the Gentils, to take out of them a People for his name.</hi> 2. from <hi>Amos chap.</hi> 9 where it is said, that God would <hi>build again the Tabernacle of David ... that the residue of men might seek after the Lord, and all the Gentils upon whom his name is called</hi> Since the debate of the Council was not whether the Faith should be preached to the Gentils, but whether they ought to be circumcised, the Apos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle must be said to understand by the word <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tils</hi> in these passages all those who professed not the Jewish Religion. For in case it signified all those who were not of the seed of Abraham, these passages were as capable of proving the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie of Circumcision as the Non-necessitie of it, and it would have been as easie to prove, that God would <hi>build again the Tabernacle of David</hi> out of those who were not of the seed of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, but who professed his Faith and followed his Law, as it was to prove, that he would <hi>build</hi> it out of those who did not follow his Law. S. James concludes from these passages, that if God would <hi>take out of the Gentils a People for his name,</hi> and that <hi>his name should be called upon them,</hi> and
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:108855:160"/>
they should <hi>seek after him,</hi> that Circumcision could not be necessarie to their salvation. For if it were, it would be necessarie for them to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse the Jewish Religion, and it would not be true, that God would <hi>take out of them a People for his name,</hi> and that his <hi>name should be called upon them,</hi> and that they should <hi>seek after him,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus they would not be Gentils, but Jews as professing to follow the Law of Moses.</p>
            <p n="172">172. Thus the Fathers of the Council gave in their reasons why they judged Circumcision un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessarie to the salvation of the Gentils, which as soon as they had all done, they proceeded to one common resolution in the matter, which was conceived in these terms <abbr>v</abbr>. 28. <hi>It seems good to the H. Ghost, and to us to lay upon the Gentils no greater burthen than these necessarie things, that they abstain from meats offered to Idols, and from bloud, and from things strangled, and from fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from which if they keep themselves, they shall do wel.</hi> In which sentence we may observe the divine Prudence of these Fathers, who seing they could not gratisie the Jews in obliging the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tils to observe Circumcision, yet they complied so far with them, as to command the Gentils under mortal sin to abstain from eating such things as gave them the greatest scandal, til they were advanced in Spirit, altho this were a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter innocent in it selfe, and agreable to the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Christians. Which example shows the great
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:108855:160"/>
Authoritie which General Councils have in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Disciplin, since God himselfe declared to S. Peter at Ioppe, that the avoiding of these Mosaical uncleannesses was not by his Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a necessarie obligation in the Law of Grace, when he said to him, <hi>Do not thou call that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> (or unclean) <hi>which God has made clean.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="173">173. It deserves to be taken notice of, that these discourses of the Apostles were such as might have suited with any of the Elders for any special Authoritie which they seem to carrie in outward appearance. The reason whereof is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus they waved for that time to influence and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the Elders judgments by putting them in mind of our Lord's Promises of <hi>teaching them all Truth</hi> by means of the <hi>Comforting Spirit,</hi> and that they had alreadie received from him a decision of the matter that lay before them, to the end the common resolution which should be taken therin, might come forth with the greater evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of freedom, seing the Elders were not sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited to side with them out of respect to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolique Dignitie, but from the merits of the Caus, which should appear in the conviction that arose in them from such Arguments whose strength consisted not in an extrinsecal Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. A particular Revelation of the H. Ghost to the Apostles was without dispute the very thing wherof the Antiochians doubted, and that which made them desire a common decision of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:108855:161"/>
and Elders: for which reason the Apos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles forbore to presse their special visitations by the H. Ghost, as not judging it expedient to move the Council with such Arguments, as could not prevail with the Antiochians to rest satisfied without a Council. Indeed S. Peter sais, <hi>why tempt ye God to put a yoke upon the neck of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> &amp;c. Which words import a reprehension, but this reprehension was not directed to the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in Council, who could not sin by obeying the Apostles orders in being present and consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting therin, but to the unbelieving Iews, and Pharisees, and Antiochians, who whould not lay aside their scruples without the Council's Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition. (And here by the way we may gather, that S. Peter makes this Council as such to be the Organ of the H. Ghost, seing he sais, that the Jews and Antiochians <hi>tempted God</hi> by desiring the assembling of it and their wranglings in it, that is, they provoked him by their obstinacie and obduracie to continue the painful yoke of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision upon the <hi>necks of the Disciples</hi> by a countermand in Council, which he had been pleased to free them from by the commands which he had been graciously pleased to signifie to the Apostles.) He likewise hints at the Vision which he had at Ioppe, when he told the Fathers that they <hi>knew,</hi> that is, that he had formerly acquainted them, how <hi>God a good while ago had pitched upon him, that the Gentils by his mouth should hear the
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:108855:161"/>
word of the Gospel.</hi> Which words (since there was no dispute in the Council about the lawfulnesse of preaching to the Gentils) are mentioned one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to introduce the Argument, which he framed from the descent of the H. Ghost upon Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius the Gentil, and his Familie. The Vision was particular to him, and therefore he did no more than mention it, but the operations of the H. Ghost upon the Gentils were notoriously known to manie others besides himselfe; for which reason he might judge it as a proper evidence to be produced against the Iews, and Antiochians. S. Paul's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding was just after the same manner too. For he might have told the Fathers, that <hi>he had not lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> that <hi>Gospel from men, but by Revelation from Iesus Christ</hi> which he had preached to the Antiochians, as he writ to the Galatians on the same occasion Cap. 1. <abbr>v</abbr>. 12. And if he had done so, he would have found as manie believers as there were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in the Council. He might have declared his sentiments in such vehement terms as we find in the aforesaid Epistle; and if he had done so, no one could have blamed him for the same. But the satisfaction of the Iews and Antiochians engaged him and his Brethren in the milder way, and made them deliver their judgments in such a plain manner, that no one can perceive by their speech, that they had any Superioritie and Jurisdiction o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Elders.</p>
            <p n="174">174. Having thus shown upon what occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:108855:162"/>
the Gentils required the assembling of this Council, as likewise the Motives which prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the Apostles to grant it, together with the manner of their discoursing and reasoning therin, I shall now prove this Council to have been the Church Representative, or the <hi>Visible Tribunal</hi> of the Catholique Church of that time in the same sense, as we affirme it of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Councils which have been held in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ages of the Church.</p>
            <p n="175">175. J know of nothing of moment that may be pretended against this Assertion, unlesse it be that the Infallibilitie of this Council ought to be ascribed to the presence of the Apostles therin, who were preserved from errour by a special as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance of the H. Ghost, and that seing the same assistance of the H. Ghost does not attend the Bishops who succeed them in the goverment of the Church, no Council of Bishops can be the <hi>Visible Tribunal</hi> of the Church so as to oblige all the Faithfull to an observance of their Decrees. The vanitie of which pretence shall appear in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Considerations.</p>
            <p n="176">176. 1. Since the Antiochians appealed for the resolution of their doubt from the Apostles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone to a Council of Apostles and Elders together, it is a plain case that they appealed from one Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie with which they would not acquiesce to another Authoritie from which they were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to receive satisfaction. And seing S. Paul
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:108855:162"/>
with the other Apostles consented to the calling of this Council, it is plain likewise, that they acknowledged that this Council had Authoritie to give them the satisfaction which they desired. The question is, whether we are to place this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie in the Apostles onely whose judgments in Council the Elders were obliged to follow; or else in the Elders also, who must be said to have been as lawful Judges in the Controversie as the Apostles themselves? If the first be said, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Authoritie of this Council seems to afford no efficacious Argument to prove the Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of General Councils since the Apostles times, becaus the Infallibilitie of this Council being no other than that of the Apostles it seemsto fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that the Infallibilitie of all General Councils died together with the Apostles. But if the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond be said, then the Infallibilitie of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil is not taken meerly from the Infallibilitie of the Apostles, but from the assistance of the H. Ghost which was given to the Elders as wel as to the Apostles. From whence this Council wil be a good Precedent for the Infallibilitie of all General Councils which have succeeded in the Church since, who are held for the <hi>Visible Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal</hi> of all debates arising among Christians con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Faith, Moralitie, or Disciplin, becaus of the assistance which they receive from the H. Ghost to frame their Conclusions. And in case the H. Ghost had not instituted, nor the Apostles
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:108855:163"/>
owned such an Authoritie as this in the Council, I see not how it could serve the use for which is was designed, or how it could be called with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out rashnesse, and presumption in the Apostles.</p>
            <p n="177">177. It could not serve the use for which it was designed. For the Antiochians who appealed from the Apostles to a Council of Apostles and Elders together, could not receive any other grounds to believe the Non-necessitie of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision than what they had before, if the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the Council was the Authoritie of the Apostles assembled in Council, and not the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the Elders who were assembled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with them. For a common Declaration of the Apostles in Council signified no more in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to their satisfaction in this matter, than their judgments out of Council, which S. Paul would not fail to acquaint them with among the manie Arguments which he used to convince them. And in case they would have been contented therwith, they needed onely to have demanded it without the concurrence of the Elders. But this was not the thing which they desired, but a common Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult of the Apostles and Elders together, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they understood, that the Elders should be joint Judges as wel as joint Consultors; for if the Apostles were onely to be Judges, they knew before hand what would be the end of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultation. They did not onely desire, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles should hear what the Elders could say in
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:108855:163"/>
case, but likewise that the Elders should hear what the Apostles could say about it. For when manie consult about a matter, the natural mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it is, that they hear one another's reasons for or against it. Neither can we put any other construction on what is said <abbr>v</abbr>. 6. <hi>that the Apostles and Elders assembled to consider of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> And in case they desired no more, than that the Apostles should hear what the Elders could say for or against the Necessitie of Circumcision, that they might be the better able to give their judgments about it, yet it suited not with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolical Character to grant this request, as we shall see.</p>
            <p n="178">178. The Council could not be called with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out rashnesse and presumption, unlesse the Elders were to be Judges therin, and assisted by the H. Ghost as wel as the Apostles. For these latter ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been constituted by our Saviour for the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign and Universal Governours, Pastors, and Teachers of his Church, and being secured by the H. Ghost from any possibilitie of erring in the discharge of their Functions, the Elders at Hierusalem and every where else were as much obliged to give credit to what they preached as the Antiochians or any others. How then could they suffer any thing to be questioned which they had learned of the H. Ghost? Or how could they submit the H. Ghost, who spoke by their mouths, to the judgment and discourses of their fallible
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:108855:164"/>
Brethren? They could receive no such Power and Authoritie as this from that <hi>Spirit of Truth.</hi> They had an unquestionable and Divine Assurance, that Circumcision was not necessarie to salvation, and this Assurance ought to have been the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the Churche's Faith about this Doctrin, and not the approbation and recommendation of it by a companie of fallible Elders. S. Paul sais, that he <hi>learned it not from men, but by Revelation from Iesus Christ;</hi> S. Peter gathered it (as we have seen) from his Vision at Ioppe; S. Barnabie preached it, and we may confidently say, that the other Apostles did the same; and God attested the truth of it by manie great and stupendous Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. Wherefore if this Doctrin was not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently proposed to the belief of the Antiochians, what better grounds could they have to believe any other parts of Christianitie? And if the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles had not not an infallible Assurance of the Truth, when as Teachers they actually performed the Functions of the Apostolique Dignitie, when is the time that we shall say, that they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly assisted by the H. Ghost? How then could they, or durst they at the request of the Antiochians consent to have this matter sifted by the Elders in Council, if the whole Bodie of them were fallible therin? Could a Doctrin want the approbation of their fallible judgments which men sinned by disbelieving before their judgments were made known in Council,</p>
            <p n="179">
               <pb n="311" facs="tcp:108855:164"/>
179. For these reasons we may boldly say, that when S. Paul, and the other Apostles admitted of the Antiochians Appeal from them to a General Council of them together with the Elders, they admitted of their Appeal from the H. Ghost who spoke by them to the same H. Ghost, who would likewise speak by the Elders, as wel as by them in a General Council. And this they questionlesse did by God's special Providence, who would have the Apostles themselves to Authorize by this memorable example the Power of General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, which was to be received by the Church after their deceas as an effectual remedie against Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations in Faith. We have here no base compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, nor faithlesse condescension, no rash sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of the H. Ghost to the approbation of fallible men, no confirmation of the Truth by any other than Divine means, nor any thing that misbecame the Apostolique Dignitie, since it was God's pleasure that their <note n="*" place="bottom">1. <hi>ad Cor.

               <hi>Spirits should be subject to the</hi> Spirits of their Brethren the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, who were <hi>Prophets</hi> as wel as themselves in a General Council, and that the Infallibilitie of the Faith should be made manifest by the same way that it became Infallible. This was not to call the Faith into question, nor to show the least doubt of it's truth, but to implore H. Ghost, that he would pleas to remove the incredulitie of the Syrians by making known the second time
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:108855:165"/>
that Doctrin, which they had firmly believed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his first Revelation.</p>
            <p n="180">180. 2. the Letre which the Council directed to the Antiochians, and wherin they sent them the Decision of their doubt, bore the name of the Elders as wel as of the Apostles, which we ought not to understand as tho the Elders name was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted therin onely by way of salutation, or as witnesses and approvers of the Apostles Act, as we find S. Timothie's and S. Sylvanus's names placed together with S. Paul's in some of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles, and as the names of the Lay Jews and Antiochians are inserted in this Letre of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, in case they are inserted herin (I say in case they are inserted herin, becaus in the Vulgat edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it is said <hi>Apostoli &amp; seniores Fratres</hi> without the Copulative &amp; between <hi>seniores</hi> and <hi>Fratres,</hi> where <hi>Fratres</hi> is to be put by <hi>Apposition</hi> to <hi>Senio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi> by which means the said Brethren are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded); but that it was their proper Act, and by consequence that they had as Judges a Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive and definitive Vote in making the Decree that was sent therin, as is evident out of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre it selfe. <hi>We the Apostles and Elders,</hi> sais the Letre, <hi>being assembled with one accord send you Paul and Barnabas</hi> Apostles, and <hi>Iudas and Silas</hi> Elders (two of each rank of the Judges who have made up the Council, which you have desired) to informe you how we have taken Cognizance of your affair, and how <hi>It seems good to the H.
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:108855:165"/>
Ghost and to us</hi> &amp;c. <hi>It seems good to us,</hi> that is, we judge through the diligent enquiries which we have made into this matter, and through the weight of the Arguments and discourses which have been held therupon, after having heard with patience all that the Opponents have been able to produce in defence of their Opinions. <hi>It does</hi> not <hi>seem good</hi> onely <hi>to us</hi> Apostles, but to us <hi>Apostles and Elders who are assembled together with one accord. It seems good to the H. Ghost,</hi> that is, <hi>the H. Ghost</hi> (whom our Saviour has promised to <hi>teach us all Truth</hi>) approves and ratifies the truth of our judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by the cooperation of his Grace with our endeavours. <hi>It does</hi> not <hi>seem good to the H. Ghost</hi> to approve onely, and to ratifie the truth of our judgments who are Apostles, but likewise to ratifie the truth of the Elders judgments through the cooperation of his grace with our common endeavours. The Apostles and Elders when they were <hi>assembled with one accord</hi> made onely one Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and seing that <hi>seemed good to the H. Ghost</hi> which seemed good to this Bodie, that <hi>seemed good to the H. Ghost</hi> which was decreed by this Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, as it was composed of Elders, no lesse than as it was composed of Apostles. And if these words of the Councils Letre <hi>it seems good to the H. Ghost and to us &amp;c.</hi> signifie an Authoritative Decree, as no bodie doubts but they do, we ought to derive the Authoritie of it from the Elders as wel as from the Apostles, and to ascribe the Infallibilitie of
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:108855:166"/>
it as wel to the one as to the other.</p>
            <p n="181">181. 3. When S. Paul is recorded <hi>Ch.</hi> 16. <abbr>v</abbr> 4 to have gone through the Cities and Churches, commanding them to <hi>observe the Doctrins which were decreed by the Apostles and Elders who were as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled at Hierusalem,</hi> shall we say, that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to observe the Decrees of those who had no Power to command them? Or that he made use of the Elders name to reenforce the Authoritie of the Apostles? This would have been a great errour in such a wise Governour as S. Paul was. For what understanding Magistrate will ever pretend to put an end to a rebellion, by comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the rebels in the name, and by the Authoritie of their fellow subjects to lay down the arms which they have taken up against him? And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides a failure in prudence it would have been more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over a means of endangering the Faith, if those Decrees were onely the Apostles Act, by giving the Faithfull an occasion to believe, that the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislative Power was lodged in the Elders in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, as wel as in the Apostles. There can be no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable grounds to put any other construction on this proceeding of S. Paul, but that he gave the Cities, and Churches through which he passed a new Motive of continuing in the right Faith, which they had never had before, inasmuch as these Decrees were not issued forth by the Apos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, who were the standing Governours of the
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:108855:166"/>
Church, but by the joint and united Power of them together with the Elders. Which Power was extraordinarie, and peculiar to them as they were Members of the Council; for the Apostles out of Council had a Power independent of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and the Elders by themselves had no Power to oblige the whole Church to an observance of their Decrees. I make no doubt, but that such Doctrins as we find delivered in Scripture rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Authoritie of the Church, as <hi>Tel the Church, Whoever will not hear the Church, let him be to thee as an Heathen</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The gates of hel shall not prevail against the Church,</hi> and S. Paul's Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin that <hi>the Church is the ground aud Pillar of truth</hi> gave to the Antiochians an unwarrantable occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of appealing from the Apostles. For how great soever the Authoritie of any single Apostle, or of their whole Colledge might seem to them, yet the united Authoritie of the Apostles and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in a Council was held by them as greater and more venerable, as being the Representatives of the whole Church, to whom the Promises of our Saviour's perpetual assistance to the end of the world were made, and from whom there was no Appeal. Which consideration prevailed with these new beginners to demand a Council, which they ought not to have done, becaus it was a great indignitie offered to his Divine Majestie, to require him to declare a second time, what he had sufficiently proposed to their belief before by
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:108855:167"/>
the Apostles.</p>
            <p n="182">182. Thus the Apostles themselves have left us a precedent for General Councils, and to the end the Dr. may have full satisfaction herin, I shall strengthen all that I have hitherto said on this subject with a very forcible consideration, which is this, that seing we find the Promises which our Saviour made to the whole Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church to have been performed in this Council, we ought to say, that this Council was the whole Catholique Teaching Church, or the whole Bodie of Church-governours, which cannot be said becaus every individual Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Church was there present, but onely becaus this Council Represented all those who were absent. And truly in case this be not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted we must say, that our Saviour promised particular Churches, (such as Provincial Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils are) to <hi>teach them all truth to the end of the world,</hi> becaus we find that he has made this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise good to a particular Bodie of Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours. For if this Council was not the whole Church Representative, it was onely a part of the Catholique Teaching Church and by consequence if our Saviour performed his promise of <hi>teaching</hi> the Governours and Teachers of <hi>his Church all truth</hi> by the assistance which he gave to this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, he made not this Promise to the whole Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Teaching Church, but to a part of it. Wherefore I shall leave it to the Drs, choice to
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:108855:167"/>
take which of these two extremes he pleases, either to grant that our Saviour taught the whole Catholique Teaching Church when he taught this Council, whereby he must confesse a Church Representative; or else that he taught onely a part of the Teaching Church, whereby his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises must be held to have been made to a part of the Catholique Church, and not to the whole Bodie.</p>
            <p n="183">183. He may say to this, that the assistance which our Saviour gave to this Council was the performance of the Promises which he specially made to the Apostles, who were the <hi>Church vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,</hi> as being appointed by him for the Rule of Faith which all Christians ought to follow.</p>
            <p n="184">184. I Answer, that our Saviour performed the personal Promises which he made to the Apos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of teaching them all truth, before the assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of this Council, as is manifest in S. Peter, and S. Paul, and S. Barnabie, who had an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible assurance of the Non-necessitie of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision before this Council was held. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides this the very Acts of the Council (as we have seen) clearly confute this pretence, becaus the Definitive Decree that was made therin, was an effect of the assistance which our Saviour gave to the Elders as wel as to the Apostles, seing it was said by them all alike <hi>It seems good to the H. Ghost and to us</hi> &amp;c. The Apostles out of Council were the <hi>Church Virtual</hi> in consequence of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:108855:168"/>
which was particularly made to them, and all persons were obliged to acquiesce with their judgments without seeking after any other secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of their belief of any Doctrin which they preached, than their Authoritie. But when they were assembled together with the Elders in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, there was a suspension of the exercise of this Prerogative so far, that altho the Elders were not permitted to mistrust the Apostles Faith, yet they might sift and examin it with as much nicenesse as tho they did mistrust it, before they gave it a publique approbation by a common De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree in in it's favour. Which custom has conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in the Church ever since the Apostles times, when upon the appearance of Heresies in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to the known Faith of the Church, as it happened in the case of Arianisme, the Fathers who have assembled in General Councils to take Cognizance of the Doctrin in Controversie, have examined, and enquired into it with the utmost rigour, altho at the same time that they made these enquiries, the evidence of Tradition and the Universal practice of the Catholique Church have recommended it so firmly to their belief, that they judged it to be a sin of infidelitie to doubt of the truth of it. The Apostles acted not in the Council as Superiour Governours who were Infallible in vertue of their Apostleship, but jointly as Brethren and Collegues with the Elders, who were to receive a confirmation of
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:108855:168"/>
the controverted Doctrin from the H. Ghost through their own endeavours, and not from the Apostles alone. Nay the Apostles heard the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses which the Elders made to the Point, no lesse than the Elders hearkened to them; neither was the Faith of the Apostles ratified without more ado becaus it was theirs, but was subjected to the trial of Arguments drawn from Scripture, Christian Principles, and reason, and to the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of a new declaration, and this new decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration was proposed by the concurring votes of the Apostles and Elders together.</p>
            <p n="185">185. Altho the Apostles might have insisted on their Authoritie, yet they could not lay any commands on the Elders to confirme their Faith without making an enquirie into the grounds of it, becaus this would have been inconsistent with that libertie of discourse which is necessarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired among those who are assembled to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult together, and to <hi>consider</hi> of any <hi>matter</hi> that is laid before them. And in case the Elders had declared against the necessitie of Circumcision on no other account than becaus of the Authoritie of the Apostles, and this too at their command, their Declaration would have amounted to no more than a bare profession of their Faith, and not to an Authoritative Decree which would have contented the Jews and Antiochians; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could they have said, <hi>It seems good to the H. Ghost and to us</hi> &amp;c. but onely <hi>It seems good to us
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:108855:169"/>
it seems good to the H. Ghost, and to the Apostles,</hi> which any Layman might have said as wel as the Elders in Council. Such a judgment as is formed by men's own industrie and endeavours through the assis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the H. Ghost (as when the connexion which the controverted Doctrin has with Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or Christian Principles, is gathered and concluded on) is necessarie to qualifie the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Authoritie of a Council. For which reason the Authoritie of the Apostles writings is a sufficient ground for any General Council to proceed upon since the Apostles times in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of an errour, becaus the meaning of the Scripture is proved by the sifting of Tradition, by comparing one place with another, and by the connexion it has with other revealed Truths. All which is performed by endeavours and industrie, as by consequences, conferences, studie, medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, reading and the like. So that when they are come to a final aggreement in the matter, they may truly say, <hi>It seems good to the H Ghost and to us</hi> &amp;c. which the Elders in this Council could not have said, if at the command of the Apos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, or out of pure respect to them, they had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved and confirmed their Faith, and not acted as Judges of it by such a conviction as arose in them from Arguments, which did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend meerly on the Apostles Authoritie and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</p>
            <p n="186">186. The <hi>Church Virtual</hi> and the <hi>Church Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentative</hi>
               <pb n="321" facs="tcp:108855:169"/>
differ in this, that individual persons may be the <hi>Church Virtual</hi> as the Apostles were, but the <hi>Church Representative</hi> is necessarily a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. The Priviledge which the Apostles had of being the <hi>Church Virtual</hi> was personal, and not to descend on any of their Successors at least in the whole Latitude wherin they enjoyed it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Promises which were made them under this Character were to last no longer than their lives: wheras the Priviledge of being the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Governours, and Representers of the Church was to be continued on to their Successors. And therefore the Promises that were made them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der these considerations might be communicated by them during their life time, as they were to the Elders, and to be in force as long as the world endures. Our Lord might, if he had pleased, have made the Apostles the onely Representatives of the Catholique Church for terme of life, but then their regulations and orders ought to have proceeded always from the common consent of them all being assembled together, which we do not find to have been their practice. And it was morally impossible for them to take this course after their departure from Hierusalem towards the Conversion of Countries far distant from one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, without a great hindrance to their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings. And yet we may reasonably conclude, that there wanted not manic occasions of consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting together, as they did in this Council about
<pb facs="tcp:108855:170"/>
Circumcision. Which is a convincing Argument, that each single Apostle was the <hi>Church Virtual,</hi> or a General Council in equivalence, as being sufficiently assisted by our Lord in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of their dutie for the resolution of all doubts, that might arise among their Converts concerning any Doctrin that had not been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely delivered to them, but to be deduced from Principles which they had expressely received. And as that Argument proves them to have been the <hi>Church Virtual,</hi> so their holding of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil together with the Elders shows, that they alone were not necessarily the <hi>Church Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="187">187. These Observations upon the Council at Hierusalem undermine a great part of the Drs. Discourse, and afford us a readie answer to all the Objections which he makes against General Councils. If he say, that <hi>the whole Church is nothing else but the whole multitude of individual Christians,</hi> the H. Ghost assures us <abbr>v</abbr>. 22. that this Council of Pastors was <hi>the whole Church,</hi> from whence I infer, that Bishops and Pastors belong to the Notion and Definition of the Church. If he say, that General Councils are not the Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives of the Church, the contrarie appears from this Council wherin five Apostles and a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent nnmber of Elders Represented the whole Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church in the Apostles time. If he tel us, that the Power which particular Bishops have
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:108855:170"/>
over their respective Flocks ought not to be controlled by any Superiour Authoritie such as we ascribe to General Councils, we find at present, that every particular Bishop in the Apostle's time was obliged to follow the Decrees of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, not onely in vertue of the obedience which they owed to the Apostles, but likewise in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Obedience which they owed to the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and not onely in matters of Faith, but in matters of Disciplin too. If he tel us, that the Governours and Teachers of the Church whether they are taken singly, or all together, are fallible in the proposal of matters of Faith; we see here, that a Council wherin the major part of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers had no Promise of Infallibilitie made them any more than any Pastors of the Church of these days, became Infallible by a particular assistance of the H. Ghost. If he say, that our Saviour's Promises to the Church do not principally, and in a special manner belong to the Governours and Pastors of the same, but to <hi>the whole Companie of the Faithful;</hi> the contrarie is evident out of this Council wherin the Promises of our Lord's as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance were immediately performed to the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the Church, by whom the fruit and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of them was to be imparted to all the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full throughout the world. Lastly, if he say, that the Catholique Church has no Authoritie, nor <hi>Visible Tribunal;</hi> the H. Ghost gives him the lie, from whom we learn that the Council at
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:108855:171"/>
Hierusalem had Authoritie, and was a <hi>Visible Tribunal</hi> of the Catholique Church of those times. And if the Catholique Church at that time had a <hi>Visible Tribunal,</hi> what grounds can there be to imagin, that the Catholique Church of succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding times has had none? We are not bound to believe this upon any Protestant Writer's bare word and surmise; for what proof can there be against a truth so wel defended by Scripture, and Tradition? God is as Faithful to his Church now as he was in the Apostle's time, becaus he is the same God now as he was then. And if the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises which he made to his Church, that <hi>the Gates of hel should not prevail against it,</hi> and that he would <hi>teach it all Truth</hi> were performed then in a General Council why are they not to be performed so now? And if the performance of these Promises made the Council at Hierusalem Infallible in their Decrees, why should not the performance of the same Promises make other General Councils Infallible in like manner? And if the Faithfull of those days were bound under damnation to lay aside all scruples, and to submit to the Decrees of the Church which was Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented by that Council, why should it be lawful for the Christians of these days or of any times since the Apostles to set at naught the Definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Church, which has been Represented by other General Councils since?</p>
            <p n="188">188. If Dr. Sherlock grant, that the Promises
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:108855:171"/>
of our Saviour to his Church are as much in force now as they were in the Apostles days, we ought in all reason to expect, that our Lord should afford her the same Infallible assistance now as he did then, and not onely that he should give her the same Infallible assistance, but that he should give it to her after the same way too, that is, in General Councils and Assemblies of the Church, as often as occasions require. And if he will not allow of this inference, let him demonstrate, that our Saviour's Promises to his Church ought to be understood in a different sense now from what they were taken in in the Apostles days; and then let him demonstrate, what this different sense is which they ought to be taken in. I say, that till he can produce these demonstrations, the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of our Saviour's Promises (of which we have an unquestionable evidence) sufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare their meaning to us, and this consequence ought to passe for an undeniable Truth, <hi>Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour has performed the Promises which he made his Church of preserving her from errour, by the Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible ass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>stance which he gave to the Pastors of it being assembled in a General Council. Therefore be will performe the same Promises after the same manner till the end of the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="189">189. It is a vain thing to think, that our Saviour performs his Promise of <hi>teaching his Church all truth</hi> by means of each one's private reason; for if this were so, seing the Catholique Church in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant

way is composed of several sorts of Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians who differ in Faith and Doctrin, they must consequently hold, that when our Saviour <hi>teaches her all Truth,</hi> he teaches her dowright contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions by means of each one's private reason whereby they persuade themselves, that their res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pective Faiths and Doctrins are true, and the very same that he taught his Apostles. See the grounds of this Discourse more fully handled above, <hi>N.</hi> 49. &amp; <hi>seq. Chap.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p n="190">190. It may be objected 1. against this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course upon the Council at Hierusalem, that the Elders were no more than Priests, which shows this Council not to have been a <hi>Visible Tribunal</hi> of the Catholique Church in our sense, becaus we maintain Bishops alone to have the Right of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Definitive and Decisive Vote in matters of Faith. From whence it follows, that the Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Authoritie of this Council must be derived from the Apostles exclusively to the Elders, which can afford no efficacious Argument to prove the Infallibilitie of any General Council since the Apostles deceas.</p>
            <p n="191">191. I answer, that altho it be our Doctrin, that Bishops alone have the Right of giving a Definitive vote in matters of Faith according to the evident and perpetual Tradition of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church, which has always adjudged it to them as the Successors of the Apostles exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively to Priests: yet it is no Doctrin of ours, that
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:108855:172"/>
this Right and power cannot be communicated by them to other Churchmen who are not Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, as they find a reasonable occasion for it, as is manifest out of the Florentine, Lateran, and Tridentin Councils, wherin Cardinals, Abbots, and the Generals of Religious Orders had Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitive Votes, altho they were not Bishops. Which practice receives a very good defence from this Precedent of the Elders, and whatever further Arguments can be brought to make it good, will equally prove the lawfulnesse, and validitie of it as wel in the one case as the other. To judge De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitively in matters of Faith is an Act of the Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Jurisdiction, which may be committed in sundrie cases to the management of those who are not of the Episcopal Order, and whenever we find it thus conferred by an unquestionable Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, we ought to say that the persons to whom it is given, are Bishops as far as the extent of it will go as much as if they enjoyed the Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Order. For which reason we must hold, that the Cardinals, Abbots, and General Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours of Religious Orders after their admittance by the Bishops to vote Decisively in the aforesaid General Councils, were as much Bishops for what relates to the lawfulnesse, and validitie of this Power of voting as those from whom they received it. Now we may discourse after the same manner in the case of the Elders, who without dispute were for the greatest part of them no more
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:108855:173"/>
than Priests, if we speak of their Orders; and neverthelesse seing the necessitie of the Church, and the fewnesse of Bishops in those earlie times had obliged the Apostles to give them a Power to act and vote in the Council as as tho they were Bishops, we ought to consider them as raised to a higher degree than that of meer Priests, becaus of this branch of the Episcopal Jurisdiction, which is the thing that does all in General Councils, and not the Power of the Episcopal Order. By which means the Promises which our Saviour made to the Bishops of preserving them from errour in their common deliberations about matters of Faith, appertained to the Elders as wel as to the Apostles. And by consequence the Council of Hierusalem was a <hi>Visible Tribunal</hi> of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church in the same sense that we affirme it of the General Councils which have been held since the Apostles time, seing the Infallibilitie of it is not derived purely from the Infallibilitie of the Apostles, but likewise from the special assis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance which the H. Ghost gave to the Elders as wel as to them, as I have shown at large.</p>
            <p n="192">192. It may be objected 2. against General Councils out of S. Cyprian (as he is quoted, and translated by this Author in his <hi>Vindic. of some Prot. Princ. p.</hi> 19.) in his Preface to his Council of Carthage, where we find him speaking thus to the Fathers, that <hi>they were met freely to declare their Opinions</hi> about the matter (the rebaptizing
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:108855:173"/>
               <hi>of those who had been baptized by Heretiques),</hi> judging no man, nor denying Communion to any man, if he dissent; for neither d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ompel his Collegues to a necessitie of obeying, since every Bishop being free, and in his own power, has his ownfree choice, and can neither be judged by another, nor judge another; but let us all expect the judgment of our Lord Iesus Christ, who alone has power both to advance us to the Government of the Church, and to judge of our government.</p>
            <p n="193">193. I answer, that if these words are to be taken as they lie, they afford very good grounds to reject the Authoritie of General Councils. But there is no necessitie for us to take them in this rigour; for if S. Cyprian had held it absolutely true, that <hi>no Bishop can be judged by another,</hi> how could he advise S. Stephen B. of Rome to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate, and depose Marcianus Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Arles for being a Novatian? Was not he a <hi>Bishop,</hi> and was not he sentenced, and <hi>judged</hi> at his instance? Can any one think, that S. Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian took himselfe for a <hi>Tyrant,</hi> when he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured this wolfe to be drove from among the Flock of Christ? Or that he thought himselfe to do an injust thing in being an instrument of <hi>compelling him to a necessitie of obeying?</hi> Or that he thought it an encroachment upon the preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of Christ for S. Stephen to <hi>judge of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment?</hi> How easily might Marcianus have told
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:108855:174"/>
him, that <hi>he was free, and in his own power, and had his free choice, and that he would expect the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Iesus Christ, who alone had power to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance him to the goverment of the Church, and to judge of his goverment?</hi> And in case he had made this Plea, I do not see how S. Cyprian could have refused to accept it for good, seing it was nothing else but his own Doctrin, if he held it to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely true, that <hi>no Bishop can judge another,</hi> and that <hi>Christ alone has power to judge of their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="194">194. This proceeding of S. Cyprian towards Marcianus evidently shows, that the aforesaid Passage ought not to be understood in all the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour as the words sound. And therefore nothing can be inferred from thence which makes against General Councils, becaus the power of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating Heretiques and Schismatiques infers all the Authoritie which we ascribe to General Councils, inasmuch as the power of excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating and <hi>judging</hi> Schismatiques supposes, that there is in the Bishops and Pastors of the Church an irresistible power of commanding in all things appertaining to the edification of our Lord's Bodie; and the power of excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating and <hi>judging</hi> Heretiques supposes an Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible power of declaring what the true Faith is. For the better understanding of which truth the Reader may turn over to §. 22. <hi>N.</hi> 138. &amp; <hi>seq. chap.</hi> 2. where I have shown at large, that
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:108855:174"/>
Bishops and Pastors can receive no power from Christ to excommunicate any person for matters of Faith, if they are not infallibly certain that their own Faith is true, by which I do not mean, that every Bishop is personally infallible in all he teaches, but onely that they are infallible as long as they follow the Definitions of General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils in such matters as are defined, or the indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable and known Faith of the Church Diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive in such things as are not defined, by which latter means it was that S. Cyprian was infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie certain, that the Doctrin for which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured Marcianus to be deposed, was contrarie to the Christian Faith. If the Dr. think fit to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that Bishops have power to excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and <hi>judge</hi> their Collegues in cases of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie and Schisme, he is obliged as much as we to explicate this passage of S. Cyprian, which as soon as he has done, he'l not think it worth his while to alledge it against General Councils. For the power of excommunicating and <hi>judging</hi> Heretical and Schismatical Bishops is obnoxious to the main exceptions which are brought against General Councils, becaus it imports a power of <hi>imposing Laws and Rules on Bishops without their consent,</hi> which he sais <hi>ubi supra p.</hi> 25. is an <hi>usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation upon the Episcopal Authoritie,</hi> and moreover excludes them from any power of <hi>judging</hi> and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in their own Caus, which is urged as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>answerable exception against the Council of Trent,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:108855:175"/>
becaus Protestants were not permitted to sit as judges therin of the Heresies wherof they were accused.</p>
            <p n="195">195. If the Dr. tel me 1. that Marcianus was a <hi>notorious Heretique and Schismatique,</hi> and that he grants in his aforesaid <hi>Vindicat. p.</hi> 26. that such Bishops may be cast out of the Church and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed; I answer, that altho Bishops are never so <hi>notorious Heretiques and Schismatiques,</hi> yet seing they are to be censured by Bishops for their He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie and Schisme, they must necessarily have Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops for their <hi>judges.</hi> And then let him show, how this Negative Proposition of S. Cyprian can be absolutely true, that <hi>no Bishop can be judged by another, nor judge another.</hi> But by the way what is it he means here by a <hi>notorious Heretique?</hi> For asmuch as J have been able to learn out of him, he means one who contradicts <hi>some plain and ack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowledged Article of the Christian Faith</hi> (see his <hi>Vindicat p.</hi> 30.) which is such a Notion of <hi>a notorious Heretique,</hi> as no one can desire a better to prove Protestants to be all <hi>notorious Heretiques,</hi> seing they professe to follow those Doctrins which the first Reformers broached against the known Faith of the Visible Church of the time wherin they lived. Why should the Doctrin of Marcia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus be a <hi>notorious Heresie,</hi> becaus it contradicted the <hi>acknowledged</hi> Faith of the Church of his time, and the singularities of Protestants and the first Reformers be no <hi>notorious Heresies,</hi> altho they
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:108855:175"/>
contradicted the <hi>acknowledged</hi> Faith of the Church of their time? Either let both of them be said to be <hi>notorious Heretiques</hi> or neither, seing they are both of them cast and sentenced as such by the Church of their respective times. If he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver grant any to be <hi>notorious Heretiques</hi> whilst <hi>there is a dispute whether they be Heretiques or no,</hi> nor any thing to be a <hi>notorious Heresie</hi> whilst <hi>there is any Controversie whether it be an Heresie or no,</hi> he will make it impossible that there ever should be any <hi>notorious Heretiques,</hi> or <hi>notorious Heresies;</hi> for to be sure all Heretiques and their followers will dispute hard to prove the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin which they denie to be no <hi>plain Article of the Christian Faith,</hi> and their Novelties to be no Heresies (and so questionlesse Marcianus did with his Novatians), whose <hi>Controversies</hi> and brawls ought to be reckoned of no moment to invalidate the unanimous judgment of the Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church by whom they are condemned, whose Authoritie alone makes them <hi>notorious Heretiques,</hi> and their singularities <hi>notorious Heresies.</hi> Indeed if the Visible Church <hi>dispute,</hi> and be not resolved whether a Doctrin be Heresie or no, I know of no bodie who sais that any such controverted Point is a <hi>notorious Heresie,</hi> or a notorious truth. But if the <hi>dispute</hi> be between the Visible Church and those who have departed from her (as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in the case of Marcian and the first Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,) it is evident that such controverted Points
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:108855:176"/>
as are held in opposition to the known Faith of the Church, are to be accounted <hi>notorious Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,</hi> unlesse we destroy the present supposition, which is that the <hi>denial of some plain and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged Article of the Christian Faith</hi> is a <hi>notorious Heresie.</hi> Let this Author give a good reason if he can, why the denial of any Doctrin which was held by the Church in Marcian's time should be the <hi>denial of a plain and acknowledged Article of the Christian Faith,</hi> and yet that the denial of so manie Doctrins as the first Reformers rejected of the Church of their times, should be no <hi>denial of so manie plain and acknowledged Articles of the Christian Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="196">196. If he tel me 2. out of his Vindicat. <hi>p.</hi> 26 that the Power which Bishops have of deposing Heretical Bishops does not proceed from a <hi>Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Iurisdiction</hi> which they have <hi>over each other,</hi> but from the <hi>obligation which all Bishops have as far as they can, to see that no part of the Christian Church be corrupted with Heresies;</hi> I answer, that our Saviour cannot lay an <hi>obligation</hi> on one man to punish another man's crimes without giving him a <hi>Superiour Iurisdiction</hi> over him, becaus this <hi>obligation</hi> essentially supposes a Command, and a Command from our Saviour to punish another's crimes is most <hi>formally</hi> the giving of a <hi>Superiour Iurisdiction</hi> to this purpose. Which general Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin as it proves that Bishops have a <hi>Superiour Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction</hi> over all Heretiques whom they are <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged</hi>
               <pb n="335" facs="tcp:108855:176"/>
by our Saviour's Command to censure, so it shows that they have a special <hi>Superiour Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction</hi> over Bishops <hi>considered as Bishops,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus of the special punishment of Deposition which they are <hi>obliged</hi> to inflict upon them, which being the deprivation of an Office and Jurisdiction which they have immediately received from Christ, necessarily supposes a special Command from him to take it from them, (for who else can give them this Power?) And this Command is most <hi>formally</hi> a special <hi>Superiour Iurisdiction</hi> which they have over them <hi>considered as Bishops</hi> in cases of Heresie. And thus the <hi>obligation which all Bishops have to see that the Church be not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted with Heresie</hi> is so far from impairing the <hi>Superiour Iurisdiction</hi> of one Bishop over another, that it evidently infers it, which is no ill step to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Authoritie of General Councils. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all let the Power of Bishops to depose Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops proceed from what caus this Author pleases, yet seing he grants that Bishops have Power to depose one another in certain cases, it follows that they have Power to <hi>judge</hi> one another in certain cases, and then, as I said above, let him show how this Negative Doctrin of S. Cyprian can be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely true, that <hi>no Bishop can be judged by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, nor judge another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="197">197. The True occasion and meaning of S. Cyprian's words is as follows. He was unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily engaged with his Affrican Bishops in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:108855:177"/>
of the Doctrin of rebaptizing those who had been baptized by Hereticks, which seemed to him very clear for such reasons as are to be found in his Epistles to Januarius, Quintus, Pompeius, and Jubaianus; and he entertained the better opinion of it, becaus Aggrippinus one of his Predecessors in the See of Carthage had em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced it, and confirmed it in a Council. And besides this, Firmilian Bishop of Caesarea to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with a great manie others of Cappadocia, Cilicia, Galatia, and other Eastern Countries were as zealous for it as himselfe. However by reason he found a great opposition from his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legues in other parts, and particularly from the Church of Rome under Stephen, and generally from the whole Church of Italie, he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing on the one side to confide so much in his own judgment as to think that he could not possibly be mistaken, and on the other side he was too great a lover of truth not to take all necessarie Precautions for the securitie of a Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin which he held for such. He therefore as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan called a Council of the Bishops of his Province to consult <hi>freely</hi> upon the Matter, that in case he were abetted by the concurrence of their Votes, the Doctrin which he esteemed true might receive the publique recommendation of their whole Province. But he took special care herin, that their Declaration in it's favour should not be accompanied with any Ecclesiastical Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:108855:177"/>
on the Contraveners of it, or that any one should be <hi>denied Communion if he dissented,</hi> or the worse looked upon, or esteemed to do an ill thing by the rest of his Collegues for any such <hi>dissent,</hi> or that the contrarie Doctrin should be pronounced He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical or erroneous in Faith (all which is sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified when he sais <hi>judging no man</hi>), as holding it unreasonable that a Provincial Council, which is no more than a part of the Catholique Teaching Church, should prescribe Laws to be observed by their whole Bodie. He took himselfe with his Affrican Bishops to have Authoritie enough to passe what judgment they thought best in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that was not undoubtedly known to be either true or false, as he held this Doctrin of Rebap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tization was not; and seing he could not denie, but that the other Bishops of the Church had the same power to give in their judgments con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it, he thought it no lesse than <hi>Tyrannie</hi> to go about to <hi>compel them to a necessitie of obeying,</hi> and therefore he left both the truth of his and his Council's judgment together with the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of those who stood in opposition to them, to the Sovereign Cognizance of <hi>Christ Iesus who alone had the power to judge</hi> which partie was in the right; till such time as the difference should be determined in a General Assemblie of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the whole Church, as it afterwards was in the Council of Nice. It was this considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which made him say to the Fathers <hi>for neither
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:108855:178"/>
doth any of us constitute himselfe Bishop of Bishops,</hi> by which he meant, that none of them preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to take from their Collegues throughout the world that Right which he owned they had of chusing which side they pleased about the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin in debate, and that they confessed themselves to have no power over them in this case, but that it was vested in a General Council of the Bishops of the whole Church, who were by Christ's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution in all matters relating to the Faith <hi>Bishops of Bishops</hi> and Teachers of Teachers.</p>
            <p n="198">198. This explication of S. Cyprian's words is nothing else in effect, but what S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustin delivers in his Book <hi>de Baptis. contr.

Cyprian depended on the strength of his own Arguments, and how he came not to be moved with the contrarie Custom that was alledged against him, viz becaus it was not mado out to him (<hi>nondum asserta),</hi> by which we are not to understand, that he held it lawful to prefer our own private reasons before the undoubted Tradition of the Church, but onely that he was not satisfied of the Universalitie of this Custom, by reason Firmilian had informed him (with what truth I know not), that they had a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie Custom in their parts of the East. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the point in dispute being a matter of a mixed nature partly Doctrinal, and partly of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplin and that Negative too, he might have been
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:108855:178"/>
induced to believe that the Custom was a culpable Omission, becaus the belief of it's lawfulnesse seemed to want an Universal approbation, inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the great opposition which so manie fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Bishops who were zealous for the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Unitie, made against it, might persuade him, that it was no Apostolical Tradition. <hi>Quiae tunc non extiterant,</hi> sais S.

Cyprian's words to be exactly accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to S. Augustin's mind, and therefore there is no fear that they can make any thing against the Authoritie of General Councils; seing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides their consent with the Church in S. Augus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin's time, they may be as easily reconciled to the language of the Catholique Church of these times wherin we live. For we hold with S. Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian, that Bishops have a Right to chuse that Opinion which they shall think most probable about any Doctrin that is controverted, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted between Catholique and Catholique, and that they have no power to <hi>judge one another</hi> in such cases, or to <hi>denie one another the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on if he dissent,</hi> or to <hi>compel one another to a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie of obeying,</hi> but that each one's conscience after a due examination of the matter is his own supreme Guide under Christ, who <hi>alone has the power of judging</hi> their proceedings herin. And if any of them out of a General Council go about to make their private consciences in such cases <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> necessarie Rule which their other Collegues ought to follow, and interiourly assent to under for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture of their mystical union with Christ and his Church, they properly make themselves <hi>ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical Bishops of Bishops</hi> in such matters wherin no man has a Right to play the Bishop. We hold likewise, that they may assemble in Provincial
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:108855:180"/>
Councils, and take such disputes into conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration according as they find just and reasonable motives to do so, and that they may establish ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in such a Declaration concerning the debated points as in their judgments may seem to draw nearest to the truth; but we hold likewise, that when the <hi>agreeing Authoritie of the universal Church has declared in a Plenarie and Catholique Council of the whole world</hi> what the Faithfull ought to believe in such points, Bishops then lose their <hi>libertie of judgment,</hi> and must submit their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences and judgments to such Declarations, as S.

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> S. Augustin represents it to be; I answer, that if it was not the same, it ought to have been the same, and that it will be a strange attempt in any one who pretends to be of S. Augustin's Faith to quote S. Cyprian in such a sense as he has suppressed as unsafe, or erroneous. For my part I am fully satisfied, that S. Augustin spoke as he thought in his interpretation of S. Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an; for the words will naturally bear his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and on the other side without such limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations as he has given them, Bishops necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lose their power of judging their Collegues
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:108855:181"/>
when they fall into Heresie and Schisme, as we have seen. I could have produced out of S. Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian himselfe the grounds of this interpretation, were it not that I feared the swelling of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in hand, which is alreadie grown to a greater bulk than I designed at first. And if S. Augustin spoke as he thought, we cannot desire a better Authoritie than his, who was a man most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionably holie and learned, and throughly versed in the affairs of the Affrican Churches, and particularly in S. Cyprian's case. What I have here said shall suffice for the examination of this passage, which I have the rather undertaken, becaus I find it to be the ground-work of Dr. Sherlock's whole Treatise of his <hi>Vindication of some Prot.

               </gap> that <hi>their bare authoritie never put an end to any Dispute any further than they were backed by the Imperial Power; which is an Argument that they did not believe in those days such Councils to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, or to be the supreme Tribunals of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="202">202. I answer, that if this discourse be good in Dr. Sherlock against the Authoritie of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councils, it cannot be unsuccesseful in us when we turn it against the H. Scripture's being the onely Judge of Controversies, for <hi>the bare Authoritie of these sacred Books never put an end to
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:108855:181"/>
any Dispute, any further than they were backed by the temporal Power, which is an Argument, that they did not believe in those days the H. Scriptures to be the onely Iudge of Controversies.</hi> Thus his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous zele against General Councils has trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported him so far as to destroy the Authoritie of the H. Scriptures, which he has substituted in their place to determin disputes in Religion.</p>
            <p n="203">203. I say therefore, that the Anathemas which the Catholique Fathers annexed to their Decrees are a better Argument to prove, that they believed General Councils to be Infallible, than the perverse disobedience of Heretiques is to show that there was no such belief in the Church. For with what conscience could they <note n="*" place="bottom">1. <hi>ad Cor. cap.</hi> 5.</note> 
               <hi>deliver up to Satan</hi> all those who would not <hi>believe as they did,</hi> unlesse they had an Infallible assurance that their own belief was true? This is a Power which they could not receive from Christ, as I have shown above. Besides, true Christians ought to learn what they are to believe about General Councils from Catholiques who submitted to them, and not from Heretiques who made no account of them. And therefore he ought to have proved, that in former Ages men were members of the Visible Church altho they refused to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiesce with the Decrees of General Councils, before he can weaken their Authoritie. And when he has made this out, I will confesse that he has said something to the purpose against General
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:108855:182"/>
Councils, and not til then. Where lies the force of this con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>equence, <hi>The Arians,</hi> for example, <hi>did not give over their contention after they were condemned by the Council of Nice. Therefore Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques did not believe the Council of Nice to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible?</hi> I say where lies the force of this conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence? And yet this is the onely thing that can stand the Doctor in any stead. For we have nothing to do with the Arians belief of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the Council of Nice; neither can any one esteem them for fit examples to follow, who holds them for Heretiques, and aliens from God. It is an easie thing to imagin, that those who departed against all reason from the known and peaceble profession of the Faith of the Church, might he carried by the like passion to denie the Authoritie of the same. For one sin seldom comes alone, and <hi>one Abysse calls on another. Psalm.</hi> 41.</p>
            <p n="204">204. Besides, if the discourse be of the Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, it was possible for them to admit of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of General Councils at the same time that they rejected the Council of Nice, becaus they might think this Council not to be a truly General one for want of some conditions which they judged necessarie, as perhaps becaus they held matters not to have been carried therin freely, and that their caus had been discussed with too much precipitation, as the Greek Church at this day which acknowledges the Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of General Councils no lesse than Catholiques,
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:108855:182"/>
does however refuse to acquiesce with the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of Florence, altho they were present at it and confirmed it's Decrees, becaus of some frivolous exceptions which their pride and faction have suggested to them against it since that time. A small colour will serve the turn when men are obstinately bent to act unreasonably. It is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the restlesse endeavours which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians used to procure a Council that might speak their sense, that they attributed a greater power to Councils than Protestants will allow them to have, or at least that they thought by this means to work the whole Church to an admis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of their belief, which is an Argument that the Church of those times held the Authoritie of Councils for sacred. Neither is it material that their Heresie never ceased till it was suppressed by the Imperial Power, from whence we can onely conclude, that they were brought to a confession of the truth more through fear of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment than the love of God, as most men are to an amendment of their lives. Our Lord instituted General Councils as a means of putting an end to Disputes, but so as to leave to Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques the free use of their wills. The Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that are made therin are a sufficient ground for Peace, if they will accept it; but if they will rather chuse to continue in their singulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the fault is not in the Authoritie of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, but in their own depraved minds. After their
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:108855:183"/>
caus is heard and judged there is no room left for a reasonable Dispute, and if they will dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute against reason, it is becaus they have the power of doing good or evil, and not becaus God would not have them do onely what is good by obeying the Council If this Objection prove any thing against the Infallibilitie of General Councils, it will prove in like manner that the Council of Apostles and Elders which assembled at Hierusalem was not Infallible, becaus their Authoritie did not put a total end to the Dispute about the necessitie of Circumcision, as it ought to have done, and there remained manie obstinate persons who persisted in their errour, as tho there never had been any Declaration against it by the Apostles and Elders. Those who were pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Onely I observe, that no Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute can passe without his Censure. When we say that the Church has been allways visible, our meaning is, that there has been a succession of Pastors and People visibly continued in all Age<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> since Christ, whose Faith has been accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with many Marks and vehement Presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of truth, which are no where else to he found amongst Christians, and whereby it has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways distinguished from Heretical and Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Congregations. We affirme likewise, that whatever Church is thus qualified is the very Church which our Saviour and his Apostles es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tablished in the beginning. Now supposing we make out this perpetual visibilitie in behalfe of
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:108855:184"/>
the Roman Church, as we pretend to do, the <hi>Protestant Caus</hi> must necessarily suffer very much, altho our Lord had instituted no <hi>Visible Tribunal</hi> for the manifestation of Heresies. For seing Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants do not pretend, that their Religion as such, and as it is Reformed was professed for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral hundred years before the Reformation, we may reasonably infer, that it never was preached by our Saviour and his Apostles, becaus the Church of Rome which is supposed to have been visible in all Ages, holds a contrarie belief to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of their tenets. The very opposition of that Church in this Hypothesis ought to passe for a just prejudice against any Doctrin, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of it for a sufficient Proposal of any matter of Faith, as the Non-necessitie of Circumcision which S. Paul confirmed with manie Miracles, was sufficiently proposed to the Antiochians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Visible Tribunal</hi> of the Church assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at Hierusalem.</p>

            <p n="207">207. Replie. The perpetual visibilitie of the Church of Rome is too great an advantage to be absolutely granted, and too evident to be abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely denied.

               <hi>§, 32. Ib. Having said that</hi> while there are any men who visibly professe Christianitie, there will be a visible Church, <hi>he immediately subjoins,</hi> and what then? What then? Why then you must hear the Church; then you must submit to the Authoritie of the Church, then you must believe as the Church believes, and receive your Faith from the Decrees and Definitions of the Church. But pray why so? Has every visible Church this Authoritie? No; but the Catholique Church has. Suppose that; but how shall I speak with the Catholique Church which is disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed over all the world, and is nothing else but the whole number of Christians all the world over? Now it seems impossible for me to speak with all the Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians in the world, and to know what their belief is in all matters of Controversie; and tho the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church is visible, and part of it be in England, and part in Holland, and part in France <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet no man can see it all together, nor speak with all the Christians in the world together; and therefore tho the Catholique Church be visible, it cannot determin any one Controversie, unlesse there be some visible.

And one would think by his way of reasoning, that he would have passed it over in silence here too, had he not thought himselfe cock-sure of catching our Saviour tripping in his Veracitie. Our Saviour commands us to <hi>hear</hi> the Visible Church by which the Dr. gives us leave to suppose the Catholique Church, and having supposed thus much he very manfully undertakes to prove the impossibilitie of <hi>hearing</hi> it. For in the first place he tels us, that the Catholique Church is <hi>nothing else but the whole number of Christians all the worldover,</hi> from whence he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, that no man can hear it by it selfe, becaus <hi>no one can see it all together, nor speak with all the Christians in the world together.</hi> And in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place, he sais, as we have seen, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues to affirme at present <hi>p</hi> 47. that <hi>the Catholique Church neither has nor can have any visible Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> by whom it may be Represented, and which may declare it's judgment about any controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Doctrin. So that seing the Catholique Church according to his Notion of it cannot be <hi>heard</hi> immediately by it selfe, nor by means of a <hi>Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> that may Represent it, and seing he knows of no other way whereby it is to be <hi>heard,</hi> it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily follows, that we cannot <hi>heart</hi> it at all;
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:108855:185"/>
And then let him make out, how an Infinit Vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie and Justice can command us under pain of damnation to <hi>hear</hi> that which it is impossible for us to <hi>hear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="209">209. He would show himselfe a much better Christian than he does at present, if he would discourse upon the Text in the following man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.

Now I cannot possibly conceive, how we can performe this Command, unlesse <hi>the Church</hi> may he <hi>heard</hi> either by it selfe, or by a <hi>Visible Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal</hi> that may Represent it, both which ways seem to me impracticable. For I am of the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that the Catholique Church is <hi>nothing else but the whole number of Christians all the world over,</hi> which evidently shows an impossibilitie for it to be <hi>heard</hi> by it selfe, becaus <hi>we cannot see it all together, nor speak with all the Christians in the world together.</hi> I am likewise of the opinion, that the Catholique Church can have no <hi>visible Tribunal,</hi> becaus it is <hi>the whole multitude of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans considered as a multitude; and a multitude as a multitude can never be Represented by any thing but it selfe, there can be formal, nor virtual mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, but the whole entire number;</hi> from whence

As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, when the Papists charge us with Schisme for renouncing the Authoritie of their Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie, we can easily answer, that Schisme is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from the Church, which Protestants have not done by departing from the Obedience of Church-Governours, who are not the Church, nor belong to it's Definition. If they charge us with Heresie for disbelieving manie Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trins which have been declared by the <hi>Visible Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal</hi> of the Church, we as easily answer, that the Church has no <hi>Visible Tribunal</hi> by whom it may be Represented. And after this manner we have a readie answer always at hand to most of
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:108855:186"/>
their accusations against us relating to the Church. All which are mightie advantages, if they could be made good without the forfeiture of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anitie, which I do not see how it can be done. For seing Christ commands us in expresse terms to <hi>hear the Church</hi> under pain of being Heathens, what does he else in effect but tel us that the Church may be <hi>heard?</hi> And if it may be <hi>heard,</hi> what advantage can it be to the Protestant Caus to clear them of Heresie and Schisme, which the Papists brand them withal, by such a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Catholique Church as makes it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to be <hi>heard?</hi> Is not this a falsification of our Saviour's words? And what can a falsification of his words be but a renouncing of Christianitie? These things considered it will be much safer for my soul, and lesse prejudicial to the Caus I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, to give over the pretence of this Notion of the Church, which is apparently singular as it is handled by me, and for which I cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce any one Text of Scripture to recommend it to the belief of a reflecting man with any tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable degree of certaintie, nor much lesse any Text that favours it halfe so plainly as this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of our Saviour favours the possibilitie of <hi>hearing the Church.</hi> Wherefore let <hi>Wranglings</hi> continue as they have hitherto done, and let Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants defend themselves as wel as they can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Pretences of the Church of Rome.</hi> It will be much better for them to be thus employed, and to bear with patience the exulting Ecchos of

            <p n="210">210. But how are we to <hi>hear the Church</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the intervals of General Councils, when any disputes arise about Religion?</p>
            <p n="211">211. I answer, that in this case the Faithful are to have recourse to their Spiritual Guides, and Pastors, and especially to the Bishops of the Diocese where they live, from whom they are to learn what they are to believe, as wel those things that have been declared, as those things that have never been declared in General Councils. And whoever hears them <hi>hears the Church,</hi> becaus they are essential to the Church, and are the Catholique Church <hi>inadaequate</hi> as being parts of the Catholique <hi>Teaching</hi> Church by whose direction and spirit they proceed in the government of souls. If the Disputes that arise be about a Point which is favoured by the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Tradition and belief of the Church, and their Pastors tel them so much, they are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:108855:187"/>
to abquiesce and to lay aside their scruples, and if notwithstanding this admonition they will break off Communion, and herd together in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate Conventicles, they become formal Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiques, and rebels after their Bishops have thundred out an Excommunication against them, and are to be accounted no better than <hi>Heathens</hi> as long as they continue in that state. And if the Disputes be about such Doctrins as are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther clear in Scripture, nor Tradition, nor the Definitions of any General Council, if they stand in contempt of their Bishops Authoritie and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures after they have taken Cognizance of the case, and commanded them to keep the Peace and Unitie of the Church, they ought to be held for <hi>Heathens</hi> here too, not becaus they are bound to follow the judgment of their Bishops in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure matters supposing they have made it known, seing they have no power to obtrude it to their belief; but becaus they Schismatically rend, and tear the Bodie of Christ in defence of their sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities, and will not hear their Pastors who command and exhort them to the contrarie. Such doubting consciences as these would stand in no need of General councils for their satisfaction, if they had more humilitie; for then they would consider this persistance in their doubts as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per effect of spiritual pride, and that it is the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Pastors to take care that nothing be imposed uponthem but what is sound Doctrin, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch

            <p n="219">219. Replie. There is no difference at all
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:108855:189"/>
which we ought to know best, who are best ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with our own Faith. We acknowledge the B. of Rome to be Christ's Vicarious Head of the Church on no other account than becaus we acknowledge him for the Supreme Pastor of it. He is the Vicarious Head of the Church inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as he is the universal Governour of it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Christ, and he is the Supreme Pastor of it for no other reason. The Dr. tels us <hi>p.</hi> 50. that Christ is not <hi>meerly a Head of Goverment, but of union.</hi> Suppose we admit of this distinction; Then, I hope, as he is a <hi>Head of Goverment,</hi> he may have a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car; for we do not pretend that he has any as he is Head of Mystical <hi>union.</hi> We do not own the Pope for Christ's Vicarious Mystical Head, or say, that he is our spiritual <hi>Husband</hi> and <hi>Spous</hi> as we affirme it of Christ, which Priviledge is essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially annexed to Christ's person, and is incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable to any other, as may be gathered from what I have said above concerning the Notion of our Mystical Union to him, wherof our Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the B. of Rome is onely a Condition. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can our Doctrin afford him any grounds to fasten this scandal on us, unlesse the Doctrin which he delivers <hi>p.</hi> 35. about particular Bishops and Pastors being Christ's Vicars, or Vicarious Heads over particular Churches may give us the like ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage against him. For if this title may be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to particular Bishops without any <hi>injurie to Christ,</hi> which way can it be a <hi>great injurie to Christ</hi>
               <pb n="362" facs="tcp:108855:190"/>
to affirme the same of the B. of Rome over the whole Church? Every particular Church is Christ's Mystical Bodie as much as the whole Church, and if the nature of Christ Mystical Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die be not repugnant to a Vicar over a particular Church, it may as amicably subsist with a Vicar over the whole Church.

            <p n="220">220.

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> Argument against these sidings and factions, that one said he was of Paul, another of Apollos, a third of Cephas or Peter, had not been good; for at least those who were united to Peter were in the right: but</hi>
               <pb n="363" facs="tcp:108855:190"/>
S. Paul knew of no other Head of unitie but onely Christ, becaus the Gospel-covenant unites us to no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Head; and therefore those who said they were of Peter, which is the case of the Church of Rome at this day, were as great Schismatiques as those who said they were of Paul.</p>
            <p n="221">221. I answer, that whatever was the true reason of this Schisme, nothing can be concluded from hence to our prejudice. For if we be so foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish as to suppose, that their Dispute was about the Head of the Church, we must say that this happened, either becaus some of them would have had <hi>Christ</hi> to be the Mystical Head of the Church, and others would have <hi>Paul, Apollos,</hi> or <hi>Cephas</hi> to be it; or else becaus they could not aggree who was Head of the Church as it was a Visible Bodie. If the Dispute were about the Mystical Head of the Church, those onely were in the right who said that they <hi>were of Christ,</hi> and we blame the others who said that <hi>Paul, Apollos,</hi> or <hi>Cephas</hi> were it as much as S. Paul himselfe does. But if the Dispute were about the Head of the Church as it is a Visible Bodie, none of them all were in the right, no not those who said that <hi>Christ,</hi> or <hi>Peter</hi> were it. For, as we have seen, <hi>Christ</hi> who is invisible cannot make his Church visibly One; and altho <hi>Peter</hi> were visible, yet he could not make the Church visibly One neither in such a way as Christ ordained it should be One, if the Faithfull were to be united to him without
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:108855:191"/>
any obligation of being united to any other Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. For seing our immediate Pastors govern us by the Authoritie which they have received from Christ, we cannot cast off our Obedience and Union with them under pretence of being u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited to S. Peter's Successors, becaus this is to <hi>divide Christ</hi> by separating our selves from the Authoritie which he has set over us: neither can we refuse Communion with any Pastors of God's Church, becaus he has established no more than One Communion. It is in this sense that we ought to understand S. Paul when he sais on the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent occasion 1. <hi>ad Cor.</hi> 3. <hi>I have planted, Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los watered; now he that planteth and he that wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth are one.</hi> Whoever departs from his immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Pastors, or refuses to communicate with such as are not his immediate Pastors, but who are however Members of Christ's Bodie, <hi>divides Christ</hi> by breaking asunder those ligaments and bonds of Unitie which Christ has appointed, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho he pretend to be never so much in Union with S. Peter's Successors. And this was the case of the Corinthians, (in the present Hypothesis) who did wel in saying they <hi>were of Peter,</hi> but ill in say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they were not of <hi>Paul,</hi> nor of <hi>Apollos;</hi> and they were as much in the wrong who said they <hi>were of Peter,</hi> and not of <hi>Paul</hi> nor <hi>Apollos,</hi> as those who said they <hi>were of Paul and Apollos,</hi> and not of <hi>Peter;</hi> becaus if <hi>Christ be divided,</hi> and a separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made in his Bodie, it is not material whether

this separation be made by breaking with <hi>Peter,</hi> and cleaving to <hi>Paul,</hi> or by breaking with <hi>Paul</hi> and cleaving to <hi>Peter,</hi> seing the mischief lies in <hi>dividing Christ</hi> by dividing his Bodie, which way soever this happens, or whence soever it has it's beginning.</p>

He has no reason to take it in ill part, if I suppose, that the ground which induces him to believe that the Church will be visible to the end of the world, is not becaus he judges, that it has sufficient strength from pure nature to preserve it selfe in the state of it's Original Visibilitie. For this is downright Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granisme, seing the Catholique Church has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways held with S.

neither is it possible for us to have them, unlesse he look upon us with eys of mercie. Our natures are the same with those of Infidels, and the onely difference between us is, becaus God has given to us a value for his Son, which he has not given to them. So long as we are strengthned by God, we judge Christianitie to be <hi>Wisdom,</hi> but when through our offences he withdraws his assistance from us, we as easily believe it to be <hi>Follie</hi> as they. It is not in the natural power of Christians to resist all such remptations as may sollicit them to forsake their Faith, nor to bear up against the most violent persecutions that may discourage them from the visible profession of it. If the Church after it's first establishment had not been preserved by God in a state of Visibilitie, it would most certainly have fallen from it long before now, considering the manie furious assaults it has sustained from the world, the flesh, and the devil; and seing these enemies, at least the two last of them (and Scripture assures us, that the world will be so too before the end of time) are as restlesse now as they have been in former Ages, we ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the continuance of the Church till the end of the world in that state must be by the same means that have supported it to this day. And seing the bestowing of these means supposes a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree in God to this purpose, we ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the preservation of the Church in a erpetual state of Visibilitie is an effect of this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,

There is no other reason, why the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Church requires to be Indefectible but becaus God has decreed that it should be so, and seing he has decreed that it shall be always ways Visible as wel as Indefectible, the Nature of its Indefectibilitie must be owned to require a perpetual Visibilitie, as much as the Nature of the Church requires Indefectibilitie. And it is as great a contradiction to say, that the Church shall be always Visible in vertue of God's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, and to allow it a possibilitie of becoming In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible, as it is to say, that God's Decrees have an infallible connexion with their Objects, and yet that it is possible for them to be frustrated.

            <p n="234">234. I say that the Drs. Notion of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lik Church is contrarie to Scripture, becaus it grounds a possibilitie that it may become Invisible.

<pb n="376" facs="tcp:108855:197"/>
which Christianspay their Pastors, than it does in their profession of Faith. And therefore all those Texts alsowhich prove the Indefectibilitie of the Church prove in like ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner it's <hi>perpetual Visibilitie;</hi> becaus if the Church is to continue to the end of the world, there must be Bishops who are to their to govern, and People who shall be subject to them to the end of the world, which is the same thing as to say that the Church shal be Visible to the end of the world. I think the grounds of this Discourse sufficiently wel laid in those places which I have cited, and shal therefore adde onely the following <hi>Dilemma</hi> to it. Either <hi>the Visibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Church which,</hi> he sais, <hi>is plainly taught in Scripture</hi> is according to Scripture to continue to the end of the world; or else it is to ceas in some Age, or Ages before the end of the world.

Supposing he will stand to what he has said, that <hi>there always has been, and always will be a true Visible Church to end of the world,</hi> it follows, that the Indefectible Church will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways Visible; and seing Visibilitie is one Markof of the Indefectible Church, we may justly pretend, that the Roman Church carries an evident presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it's being the Indefectible Church which the Reformed Churches have not, becaus it has been always Visible, wheras we can point out the time when the others made their first appearance in the world, which was accompanied with too manie odious circumstances to be easily forgotten. And if we take the Visibilitie of the Roman Church, so as to include all it's Motives of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibilitie whereby it is distinguished from Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques and Schismatiques, and all others who are not of it's Communion, and yet passe under the denomination of Christians, it does not onely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford an evident presumption of it's being the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defectible

Church above the Reformed Churches, but likewise above all other Christians in the world, amongst whom perhaps there may be some Sees which can make out a succession of Pastors from the Apostles time as wel as the Roman Church. But if he will contend, that the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectible Church may be sometimes invisible, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the incoherence of this Doctrin with the aforesaid concession, he must seek after some better Principle whereon to build this Assertion, than becaus <hi>the Catholique Church subsists onely in single and individual Christians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 54. p. 57. 2. He undertakes to show the weaknesse of that Argument, which <hi>proves the Church to be Infallible, becaus it is Indefectible.</hi> And the reason why he disallows of this Argument is, becaus <hi>the Indefectibilitie of the Church, as we have alreadie heard, does not necessarily prove, that there shall be any one Visible Organized Church which shall not fail; for the Church does not fail while there are any true Christians in the world ..... and therefore if Indefectibilitie proves Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, it proves onely that there shall be some private Infallible Christians, not that there is any Visible In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Church;</hi> From whence the consequence is clear, that since we denie, that the Infallibilitie of the Church subsists in <hi>private Christians,</hi> we ought to denie that the Church is Infallible.</p>
            <p n="239">239. Replie. Whether the Church be said to subsist in private Christians, or in a Visible Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganized
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:108855:200"/>
Bodie, or Bodies of Christians, we ought to say, that it is Infallible by the same means whereby it is Indefectible. And feing it is Indefectible, becaus of God's Decree that it shall never ceas to be a Church, we ought to say, that it is Infallible in vertue of the same Decree too. For if it shall never ceas to be a Church, it shall never erre so grievously as to ceas to be a Church, and if you grant that it shall never erre so grievously as to ceas to be a Church, you grant the substance of all the In fallibilitie which we teach.</p>
            <p n="240">240. No, say you, Catholiques signifie by the Infallibilitie of the Church an impossibilitie for it to erre so grievously as to ceas to be a Church, which is a different thing from saying, that it never shall erre so grievously as to ceas to be a Church.</p>
            <p n="241">241. I answer, that when we say that the Church can never erre so grievously as to ceas to be a Church, we mean that God has essicaciously decreed, that it shall never erre after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. And I suppose that the Doctor will think better on it before he blame us for saying, that there is an impossibilitie for God's Decrees to be frustrated. What does he mean else, when he sais that the Church shall never fail nor ceas, but that God has decreed, that it shall never fail nor ceas? And if God has decreed, that it shall never fail nor ceas, sure he will never dare to say, that there is a possibilitie for it to fail, which
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:108855:200"/>
evidently follows, if there be a possibilitie for it to erre so grievously as to ceas to be a Church.</p>
            <p n="242">242. Now as to the Reason why he disal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows of this Argument, I answer, that hitherto we have <hi>heard</hi> nothing that can make it good besides his false Notion of the Catholique Church which I have often rejected. For seing the <hi>abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant satisfaction he has that there always has been, and always will be a true Visible Church to the end of the world</hi> necessarily supposes a Divine Decree to this purpose, it follows, that the Church in vertue of this Decree is to be Visible as long as it continues, and if it is to be Visible as long as it continues, it is to be Organized as long as it continues. And since, as we have seen, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defectibilitie of the Church proves it's Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, if the Indefectible Church shall be always Visible and Organized, it follows, that there shall be always a Visible, Organized, and Infallible Church to the end of the world.</p>
            <p>§. <hi>55.</hi> P. <hi>58.</hi> When our Saviour sais that the Gates of Hel shal not prevail against his Church, we may consider it either as a Promise, or a Prophecie, or both, that there shall be always some sound and Orthodox believers in the world .... Now I hope Christ can make good such a Promise (it we consider it as a Promise) without bestowing Infallibilitie upon any Christians, for men may be Orthodox without being Infallible. And if we consider it as a Prophecie, I hope Christ can foretel things which have no neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:108855:201"/>
Causes, and then he can foretel, that there shall never want true believers, tho it is possible there might be none; that all Christians shall not erre tho they are all fallible and therefore may erre.</p>
            <p n="243">243. Replie. There is no special difficultie at present which is not common to all those, who hold the compatibilitie of the Divine Prescience and Grace with Free Will, as is manifest in the Apostles, who were in the judgment of all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans as Infallible as we believe the Church to be, and therefore the Dr. must provide a solution for his own Argument, which will make him not to require one from us,</p>
            <p n="244">244. However, to the end he may not think himselfe flighted, I say that the aforesaid words of our Saviour are both a Promise, and a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie. They are a Promise, becaus they are a declaration of the efficacious assistance, which he will give to his Church towards it's continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the end of the world; and they are a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie, becaus they signifie, that the Church shall and will make use of the assistance which he promised to give it. Now Christ cannot make this Promise good to his Church without mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it Infallible, becaus it is impossible for the Church to e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>re so long as it is efficaciously as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted by him. Neither can we have any other Notion of the Infallibi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>tie of the Apostles, than an impossibilitie for them to erre, becaus they were to be always efficaciously assisted by our
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:108855:201"/>
Lord. This Promise which was made in time supposed his Eternal Decree to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and seing it is absolutely impossible for God to fail of any thing which he has decreed, it must needs be impossible for the Church to erre in Faith, becaus the continuance of it in the right Faith was the thing which God decreed, and which he declared by this Promise. And from hence it is plain, that if the aforesaid words are considered as a Prophecie, they foretel the same Infallibilitie of the Church which was caused by them as they they were a Promise, becaus they foretel the efficaciousnesse of the assistance which was decreed to be given to it in all Ages for it's preservation from any damnable errour. They suppose the Decree of preserving the Church from auy damnable errour, and therefore as the Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of the Church is lawfully inferred from that Decree, so likewise is it inferred from these words as they are a Prophecie.</p>
            <p n="245">245. You'l say, that the Faith of the Church is a voluntarie Act, and therefore it is possible for the Church to fall from it notwithstanding this Promise, and Prophecie of our Saviour.</p>
            <p n="246">246. I answer, that the Faith of the Apostles was a voluntarie Act. But what then? Will the Dr. say, that it was possible for them to fall from the true Faith, notwithstanding that we suppose the Promises, and Prophecies of our Saviour to the contrarie? This would be a very readie way
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:108855:202"/>
to introduce infidelitie into the world: for what should hinder a possibilitie of a reasonable doubt concerning the truth of Christianitie, if it be owned for a certain Principle, that those by whom it was first preached might possibly be deceived in the truth of it, even supposing the Promise and Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of our Saviour that they should not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived? We must say therefore, that altho the Faith of the Church has no <hi>necessarie Causes,</hi> yet when we suppose that the perpetual truth of it is foretold by our Saviour, it is necessarie that it should be, as Christ has foreseen and foretold that it shall be; from whence we cannot infer, that the Church has no freedom of will, but onely that it is necessarie, that the free exercise of it's Will in cooperating with the Divine Grace and assistance, should be performed in time in the same manner as it was foreseen from all Eternitie. Which necessitie signifies the necessitie of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie in the Divine Prescience, and not an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent necessitie of acting on the Churche's part. So that supposing Christ foresees, and has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, that there <hi>never shall want true believers,</hi> it is impossible that there should be none; and supposing he foresees, and has decreed, that <hi>all Christians shall not erre,</hi> it is impossible that <hi>all Christians can erre.</hi> And if there shall be some Christians who <hi>cannot erre,</hi> it follows, that there shall be some Christians who shall be Infallible. And if there shall be some Christians who shall
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:108855:202"/>
be Infallible through the assistances which they shall receive from our Lord to preserve them from errour, this Author can have no reason to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with our Doctrin about the Infallibilitie of the Catholique Church, the true notion whereof is <hi>An impossibilitie of erring in matters of Faith by means of such assistances as our Lord has decreed his Church, and which he foresees, and has decreed that she will and shall make good use of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="247">247. But do we say, that all those are Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, whom God foresees, and has decreed that they will and shall believe aright?</p>
            <p n="248">248. I answer, that every individual Christian is Infallible, so long as he cooperates with that Grace which God has decreed him towards his believing aright, and by consequence that <hi>men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be Orthodox without being Infallible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="249">249. You'l say, that if this be so, it follows that every individual Christian is as Infallible as the Apostles.</p>
            <p n="250">250. I answer, that if the comparison fall upon the certaintie of Faith, it is very true that every individual Christian is as Infallible in his Faith as the Apostles were; but if it fall upon the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal of Faith, and it's Indefectibilitie, there is a great deal of difference between the Infallibilitie of the one and the other. For the Infallibilitie of the Apostles was derived to them from the H. Ghost who was the immediate Proposer of their Faith, and whose perpetual assistance was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to them during life, not onely for refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:108855:203"/>
their memories as to those truths which they had heard of our Saviour in expresse terms, but also for enlightning their understandings, that they might not erre about other Doctrins which they had not expressely received, when they were to be deduced from Principles that were of Faith. Wheras the Infallibilitie of indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual Christians is onely on supposition than they <hi>hear the Church,</hi> which derives it's Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie in declaring matters of Faith immediately from the H. Ghost as the Apostles did, and has the like promises of his perpetual assistance as they had. Tradition is her Memorie whereby she calls to mind what our Saviour <hi>said</hi> in the beginning, and General Councils are the School wherin our Lord <hi>teaches</hi> her <hi>all</hi> such <hi>truths</hi> as had never been expressely delivered to her before. We find no such Promise as this made to individual Christians, that they shall be Infallible in their iudgments when a Doctrin is drawn from Principles of Faith, or that they shall not totally fall from the Faith, as manie large Provinces have done: but the Apostles had such a Promise made them, and so has the Church too.

This is all that Protestants can mean, when they say that the Catholique Church cannot erre in Fundamentals, not that there is any Visible Societie of Christians which is infallible in it's Definitions of Fundamental Doctrins, but that the Catholique Church, or the whole number of Christians shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver erre fundamentally, that is, that there shall be always some true and Orthodox believers in the Church.</p>
            <p n="251">251. Replie. The Dr. is sensible of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience which accrues to his Caus by so am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple an acknowledgment as the Churche's being Infallible in Fundamental Doctrins, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he thinks it expedient to dwindle it into this expression, that <hi>there shall be always some true and Orthodox believers in the Church.</hi> But this will not do his businesse. For seing he cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, but that Christ has promised his Apostles to be <hi>with them to the end of the world,</hi> I hope he will grant, that he will efficaciously assist their Successors in the discharge of their duties to the end of the world. And if he grant this, he must needs grant that the Church is to consist of a Governing and a Governed part. And if he grant this, he must needs grant that there will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways an Organized Church in the world, which signifies something more than that <hi>there shall be always some true and Orthodox Believers,</hi> who are
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:108855:204"/>
               <hi>concealed,</hi> as he sais <hi>p.</hi> 57. and <hi>unknown</hi> to one another. And if he grant this, he must needs grant that this Indefectible Organized Church will be Visible, since <hi>the Visibilitie of the Church</hi> (which consists in it's Organization) <hi>is plainly taught in Scripture,</hi> by which, as I said lately we are to understand it's perpetual Visibilitie. And if he grant that this Visible Organized Church <hi>shall never erre Fundamentally,</hi> he must needs grant that this will happen through the efficacie of the grace which God has decreed her to this purpose. And if he grant this, he must needs grant, that this Visible Organized Church shall be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, becaus it is impossible for it to erre in Faith, if God has decreed it an efficacious Grace to preserve it from errour. So that his <hi>some true and Orthodox believers</hi> amount to an Infallible, Visible, Organized Church, which if he grant to be accompanied with Motives of Credibilitie, it will look so extremely like the Catholique Church wherof S. Peter's Successor is the Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Head, that we may safely conclude it will be the same.</p>

We want here to know by what name these <hi>private Christians</hi> were called, where they lived, what Doctrins they held, whether they were <hi>concealed and unknown</hi> to one another; and if they were unknown to one another, how they came to be known to the Dr.? We must have a satisfactorie answer given to these and a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie other Queries of this nature, before we can withdraw our charge of a <hi>new and upstart Church</hi> wherwith we brand Protestants. For a meer pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibilitie of such <hi>private Christians</hi> (altho it could be made out) is not sufficient to remove the Absurditie, which does not proceed becaus it is impossible there should be any such Christians, but becaus it is highly unreasonable to judge that there were any such. But enough has been said about the vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

of the Visible Church <hi>in all Ages,</hi> which he dares not say; but in case the opposition of those who have condemned our Faith has been censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Visible Church of their times (as it most certainly has been) it is an Argument, that we ought to esteem their opposition for an Innovation, and not such Doctrins as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected. I see not why Luther's Reformation should receive any advantage by his not being the first Heretique who has condemned some Doctrins of the Church of Rome, and yet that the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Socinus and other Heretiques (whom this Author seems to condemne at present with the Catholique Church) should not receive the like benefit from the opposition which the Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and other such like revolters made against the Divinitie of the Son of God, and other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionable Articles of the Christian Faith. For it was no more lawful for those antient Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists who favoured Luther, to renounce the known Faith of the Church of their times than it was for Arius; and if Arius was wicked for so doing, so were those Separatists who favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Luther. And what he sais in behalfe of the Protestant Reformation, that there were some <hi>private Christians who preserved themselves in a great measure from the corruptions of the Roman Church,</hi> and <hi>were the seeds of the Reformation,</hi> may as wel he applied by the Socinians in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of their Reformation, who may likewise
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:108855:205"/>
replie, in case we call them <hi>a new and upstart Church</hi> as we do Protestants, that there was <hi>no failure of the Church tho it were obscured and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed</hi> before the time of Socinus, and that <hi>we may as wel say, that it is a new Sun that rises every mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, not that which sets at night, as make a new Church of old and Primitive Christianitie</hi> (Aria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme &amp;c.) <hi>the profession of which was never lost, altho the Professors of it were not so visible.</hi> Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes may passe for good Arguments among those who are destitute of good reasons, but me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks he might have given us other similitudes, than such as make the Protestant Caus as odious as that of Arians and Socinians.</p>
            <p n="254">254. Having thus taken a particular view of all the most remarkable passages in the Drs. Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course which may give offence to Christian ears, I shall conclude my considerations theron, by submitting them to the Censure of the same Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique and Roman Church which I have defended, and of every Bishop and Pastor within it's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and in particular to the judgment of my more immediate Superiours with whose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent I have at last sent them abroad into the world.</p>
