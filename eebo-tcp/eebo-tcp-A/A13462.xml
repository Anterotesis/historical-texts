            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p> I haue seen often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
men offring to snuff
acandle, haue against their
wils put it cleane out; and
an vnskilfull Chirurgian taking a
<pb facs="tcp:3399:4"/>
small greene wound in hand, hath
brought it to an olde Vlcer. I would
be loath, for my part, to imitate either
of these examples; for my intent is,
confession of the wrong I did you:
&amp; an endeauor to make amends. I do
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>fesse that I did you wrong in print,
in my book of my Trauels, &amp; now in
print I doe make you a publike satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
For, I protest to God, that
I haue heard so much good report of
you, that I am double sorry that I was
so mistaken, and that I haue beene so
long time before I haue printed my
recantation. It was your Tapsters
<pb facs="tcp:3399:4"/>
want of wit, and my want of discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that was the grounds of my too
much credulity and temerity. For
his part, I wish him no more harme,
but that chalke may bee his best pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
Thunder may sowre his Hogs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads,
Rats may gnaw out his spig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots
at midnight, &amp; himselfe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
his wit to the keeping of a foole
while he liues; And your hostlers, for
gaping so greedily like gudgeons vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me, I pray that they may euery day
mourne in litter and horsdung. But
these are but Iests by the way, for as
many as knowes you, haue told mee,
<pb facs="tcp:3399:5"/>
that if you had beene at home, my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainement
had been better: if it had
beene so, it had beene more then you
owed mee; and more then I at that
time could haue requited: but I would
haue stretched my wit vpon the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Inuention, in the praise of
Innes and Inkeepers; I would haue
put the forgetfull world in minde of
the good seruice that <hi>Rahab</hi> the Inne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper
did at <hi>Iericho,</hi> in hiding and
preseruing the spies that were sent by
<hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Ioshua;</hi> I would haue made
the obliuious logger-headed Age re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
that the Redeemer of the
<pb facs="tcp:3399:5"/>
World did grace an Inne with his
blessed birth: What place then but an
Inne was the High Court of Heauen
and Earth, the residence and lodging
of the Immortall King, of neuer en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Eternity? This and more I would
haue done, but what is past cannot be
recalled, and it is too late to put old o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittings
to new Committings. And
so my noble and thrice worthy hoste
of hostes, I omit not to commit you
and yours to the protection of the
Lord of Hostes, desiring you to take
this merry Pamphlet in good part,
