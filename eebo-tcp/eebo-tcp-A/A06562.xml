            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

of this mater: ye ſhall fyrſte vnderſtande
that Marcus Craſſus was ſenre to the

¶And the manly man Iulius

of Lombardy / diſcending downe by hygh
Alpyes / &amp; auaylyng downe by the large

daye whan Iulius and Caſſybelan met
in the folde: this foreſayd Caſſybelane
had a famous and a paſſyng manly man

mortall ſwerde neuer ceaſed to ſle and
oppreſſe the proude Romane knyghtes / 
ſo farforth that they fledde and eſchewed
his ſwerde as the deth. <g ref="char:leaf">❧</g> For as he
wente there was no reſyſtence. And
<pb facs="tcp:26094:5"/>
this contynued ſo longe that the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes

alas whan he was weried of fyght: it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell
caſually of Fortune whiche is ay con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trary

conſtreyned by Cezar to paye for his tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age

¶And in the ſygne of this conqueſte and

Capys a worthy man and of great auc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torite:
and the fyrſte founder and begyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynger
of the countrey of Capwey / and
named after him. And lyke as the letters
in Greke ſpecified it befell. ¶And the
ſeconde prodigy that befel tofore the deth
<pb facs="tcp:26094:20"/>
of Cezar: was this. <g ref="char:leaf">❧</g> Vpon the ſame
nyght tofore: that he was ſlayne on the

of Iupiter: And fell downe vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the right
hande of his god. ¶Another maruey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous

his wyfe named Caliphurna: a lytell to
fore the deth of her lorde Iulius: had a

<g ref="char:leaf">❧</g> Of whiche noyſe ſhe beynge ſore
afrayde i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her ſlepe / and of feminine drede
full ſore ſyghed in her herte: as ſhe that

ment. ¶Alſo as Vnycent in his hyſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
bokes maketh me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cion: An hundred
dayes before his pyteous murder: in the
large market place of Rome / where as
<pb facs="tcp:26094:20"/>
the ſtature and the great ymage of Cezar
ſtode vpon an hyghe pyller of ſtone: the
name of Cezar graue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with letters of gold
aboue his heed: whan the wether and the
attempre ayre was moſt clere and ſtyll / 
with a ſodeyne ſtroke of the fyry leuen / 
the fyrſte lettre of his name .C. was ſmy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ten
away. Declaryng by this pronoſtical
ſygne that lyke as this lettre .C. in nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre
betokeneth an hundreth: and was
alſo moſt craftely wroght and grauen as
for the chefe capitall letter of his name / 
to ſhewe openly that the raſyng away of
this letter by vyolence of the fyry leuen:
that he that was heed of all the erthe / 
within the ſpace of a hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dreth dayes next
enſuynge: ſhulde be vengeably murdred
in Rome. ¶Alſo the ſame day of his
murder: as he wente moſte ryally in his
Imperiall araye towarde the Conſyſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
a poore man named Tongilius toke
hym lettres of all the purpoſed co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſpiracy
by the Senate vpon his deth. But for he
was neglygent to rede the lettres and to
vncloſe them: the vengeable murder was
execute vpon hym. ¶By whiche exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
let no man be ſlowe nor neglygente
to rede his letters / leſt after for his necli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
it may tourne him to great damage
<pb facs="tcp:26094:21"/>
whiche after may nat lyghtly be recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
☞ And the chefe cauſe and worker
of this murder: was Brutus Craſſus / 
aſſocied vnto him two hundred and ſixty
of the Senate: all hauyng Bodkyns in
theyr ſleues. <g ref="char:leaf">❧</g> And as it is in ſtory re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred:
He had foure and twenty deedly
woundes as he ſat in the Capytoly.
And as ſayeth myne auctoure / he neuer
in all his ſmarte: made nouther crye nor
no noyſe / excepte onely a lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>table and
a dolorous ſyghe lyke a man that with
ſodeyne ſorowe were afrayed. ¶So
that touchynge the vengeable maner of
his pyteous murder: I may conclude
with hym that was Floure of Poetes in
our Englyſſhe tonge / and the fyrſte that
euer enlumyned our language with flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res
of Rethoryque and of Eloquence. <g ref="char:leaf">❧</g>
