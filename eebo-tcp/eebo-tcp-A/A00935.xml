            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>For they (wiselie no doubt) foresawe, and preciselie noted this as a warranted principle, that the liberall sciences stood no lesse in neede of the fauorable patronage of Great men for their supportation and maintenance: than the strategemes and noble actes of Great men, of the liberall sciences, for the reuiuing of their renowme, and the continuing of their remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.</p>

            <p>The example of which aged writers, and the vsuall manner of our moderne Polygraphers, both strangers-borne, &amp; home-bread, as heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore I haue bene induced, so presentlie I am persuaded to folowe, for two alowable reasons.</p>
            <p>First, because the hypothesis or argument of this Booke, is generallie appliable to euerie pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate person, and will (I hope) requite the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell of the vnderstanding Reader, with reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable profit and aduantage.</p>
            <p>Secondlie, for that your Worship hath the common name and report to be indued with sundrie singular gifts of minde, as vtterance of foraigne tongues, varietie of knowledge in the Artes of greatest difficultie, iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in affaires of policie: beside the gifts of bodie and fortune, which if I might deseruedlie decipher (though I spake the truth, yet should I incurre suspicion of Gnatonisme) time would first faile me, before I could make an end.</p>
            <p>But aboue all, (which is the foundation of my hope and confidence) for that your Worship is so noblie minded, as with rare courtesie to fauour and incline vnto such as professe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues

                  <p n="3">3 Which speach of the Prophet hath this meaning, that the waie wherein men take pleasure and delight, is the waie of wantonnes, sensualitie, and lasciuiousnes: the waie of all vncleanes, vanitie, and wickednes: the waie wherein flesh and bloud triumpheth, and repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth perfect happines: the waie which God hateth and abhorreth,

This waie of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes is the Lords waie, it is the holie waie, wherein the Iewes in Esaies time, and in them we and our posterities after vs, are

These two waies, manie hundred yeares past, were signified and set foorth by a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Philosopher, in a letter of the crosse rowe, namelie Y, wherein we may sée, with what wisedome that heathen man weighed the waies of worldlings, cutting his letter in two parts, the one toward

This Christ, the expresse image of his father, noted these two waies, no doubt to singular purpose, when he gaue vs this lesson worthie the learning, saieng: Enter in at the narowe waie: for wide is the waie, and broade is the gate that leadeth to destruction, and manie they be that walke in it: but narowe is the waie, and streight is the gate that leadeth to life, and few they be that go in at it, because it is the foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>path to felicitie.</p>

                  <p n="9">9 We reade in the Gospell, that Iesus Christ walking vpon the sea, was supposed and thought of his disciples to be a spirit: for the resolution whereof, Peter among the rest required to come vnto him vpon the water, which being granted, he lept out of the ship, and walked on the waues toward Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus: but a mightie winde arising,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:2430:40"/>
Peter was afraide, and began to sinke? Why was this? euen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he wanted the walking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staffe, which euerie one that would go in the waie of the Lord, ought to hold in their hand, and that is faith. For had not Christ stretched out his hand, and supported him, he had perished, had he had a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand liues.</p>
                  <p n="10">10 Christ passing vpon a time betwéene Samaria and Galile, opened the waie of his father vnto ten lepers. Among these ten, there was one Samaritane, who onlie and alone, notwithstanding the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit which they receiued was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, had this walking staffe, whereby he kept his féete right in the way of the Lord. For the other nine, as soone as they were cured, forgat themselues, and returned not to giue thankes vnto him, by whose helpe they were healed. Such lepers there are among vs not a few, who from the crowne of the head, to the sole of the foote,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:2430:40"/>
haue no sound place, but all intec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, lothsome, and filthie, that is, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uergrowne with sinne, in so much, that there is no part of their soule, but it is attainted. If among this great and infinite number, one Samaritane might be found, some signe it were, that the graces of God are not powred vpon vs in waste, neither his benefites ill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed.</p>
                  <p n="11">11 But it is so far vnlike, that anie of vs should be a Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane, that we shew and proue our selues rather to be Gadarens, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whome the common prouerbe is iustlie verefied, that it is no ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting of pearles before swine. It is now twentie and odde yeares, since we haue had among vs the iewell of Gods word, than the which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more pretious, vnto the which anie thing compared, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth méere mucke, by the which anie thing tried, is found lighter than vanitie. This word, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing it be the trumpet, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:2430:41"/>
we are called into the waie of the Lord, and continuallie moued to treade the footepath to felicitie, is contemned, neglected, and despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, the preachers of the same de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rided, the prophaners thereof pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, the professers of it abused, the suppressers thereof maintei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, so that it is no maruell though the waie of the Lord be so little, naie, nothing at all in comparison, frequented or vsed, séeing the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie meanes whereby we are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and lead therevnto, is so care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leslie reiected.</p>
                  <p n="12">12 Among manie that were hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of their infirmities, deliuered of diuels, and restored to their right wits, we reade of thrée wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, namelie, Marie Magdalen, Ioanna, and Susanna: these (saith the holie text) ministred vnto Christ of their substance, thereby acknowledging the benefits which they had receiued, and declaring in like maner, by their perceiuerance and knowledge of God, that they
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:2430:41"/>
were in the waie of the Lord. Is it not a shame that women, which are the weaker vessels, should put vs in minde what we ought to do? That which they receiued, was temporall, it was corporall, it was transitorie, and yet they shewed themselues thankefull: we haue had at Gods hands the riches of his truth, which are spirituall, and euerlasting, subiect to no change, vnder no alteration, &amp; yet we haue not the grace to glorifie and praise God, as we ought, for the same: naie rather, we loath the truth, we surfet of it, such fulnes we haue thereof: we are wearie of hearing it taught, we prefer vanities, yea, diuelish vanities before it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we bewraie our hellish inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and manifestlie proue how far wide we wander out of the Lords waie, and leaue the foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>path to fclicitie we knowe not in what corner.</p>
                  <p n="13">13 To passe through this waie, we must be content to carrie the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:2430:42"/>
crosse, euen the crosse of Christ, I meane afflictions and persecutions for his holie name sake: otherwise we shall not bée thought woorthie followers of him. We must renou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce our selues, we must forsake friends and kindred, we must cast awaie wicked mammon, we must refuse no tribulation, no torment, no losse, no damage, no wrong, no iniurie, no anguish, no not death it selfe, were it neuer so terrible. For if the merchant man for lucres sake, and increase of commoditie, aduentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth life and goods vpon the sea, enduring all tempests that arise, and suffering euen the woorst lucke that maie light vpon him, with a contented mind, in hope to obteine the fruite and profit of his trauell: if the husbandman repineth not to tarie the time of the yeare, after his painful plowing, his diligent sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and other his necessarie la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, with sweating browes, and bedewed lims susteined, &amp; then ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth into his barnes the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:2430:42"/>
crop of his ground: shall we thinke much to suffer for Christs sake, for the truths sake, for safe conscience sake, for our souls sake, temporall paines, and momentanie troubles: knowing that these are preparatiues to life euerlasting, &amp; that we can not walke in Gods waie, vnlesse we yeeld our neckes to beare his yoke?</p>
                  <p n="14">14 Fondlie plaid Nichodemus, that great lawier and ruler among the Iewes, his part, in comming to seeke the waie of the Lord by night. For hée preferring his worldlie reputation and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, before the knowledge of Gods kingdome, and being asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be seene in the day time, to haue recourfe vnto so contemned a person as Christ, prooued himselfe to be as he was, euen a louer of himselfe, a popular fellowe, that is, such a one as esteemed more of his worship and credit, than of the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of truth. Wherein he declared his infancie and grosse ignorance
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:2430:43"/>
touching regeneration: his great learning, knowledge, and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in other points naught auai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. Thus weé seé, that for one furtherance and help to leade vs to the waie of the Lord, and to bring vs to the footepath of felicitie, there are twentie: yea, and twice twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie hinderances and lets, which lie like blockes, ouer which there is no leaping, vnlesse the Lord put vnder his hand, and lift vs ouer them.</p>
                  <p n="15">15 Now therefore, for somuch as there is but one waie vnto life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting, but manie waies vnto death and condemnation: requisite it is, that we which are placed in this world, as in a wildernesse, and haue a pilgrimage to walke, should first and principallie haue, as they saie, an eie to the maine chance, that is, should haue a singular regard to the safetie of our soules: the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiousnesse wherof Christ commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vnto vs, when he said, what will it profit a man to gaine all the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:2430:43"/>
world, and to lose his soule? Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning indeéd thereby, that all the pompe, the riches, the treasure, the pleasure, and whatsoeuer belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to this life, are nothing coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teruailable or equiualent to the soule, the excellencie whereof, if there were none other proofe to confirme it, is sufficientlie set forth by the rich ransome that was paid for it, to redeéme it out of captiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and thraldome: I meane the pretious bloud of Iesus Christ.</p>
                  <p n="16">16 Setting aside therfore all by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies which leade vnto death, it standeth vs vpon, if we tender our saluation, to seéke the waie of the Lord whiles it may be found. The maner how, is declared before at large, euen by denieng our selues, and forsaking the world, with whom whosoeuer doth acquaint himselfe, vnpossible it is that heé should once set foote in the waie of the Lord. For the waies of the Lord are good and righteous alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither, as saith the Psalmewriter:
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:2430:44"/>
the whole world is set vpon mischiefe and villanie, saith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle. So that betwene the waies of the Lord, and the waies of the world there is no affinitie, no like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, no equalitie: naie, there is a flat opposition and contrarietie.</p>
                  <p n="17">17 Is it possible that the lambe and the woolfe, the spider and the flie, the falcon and the feasant, the hound and the hare, the peacocke and the snake, the cat and the mouse, the owle and the nightin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale, the iuie and the oke, the vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treé and the colewort, or what else is of contrarie inclination, should agreé together, &amp; the one not spoile the other? The waies of the Lord, &amp; the waies of the world, are much more at variance. For fire being hot and drie, is not a greater eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie vnto water that is cold and moist: life being sensible, quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and pleasant, is not a more mortal foe vnto death, that is sens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, ouglie, and dreadfull: blacke being darke and dim, is not more
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:2430:44"/>
contrarie vnto white, that is light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some and bright: Christ being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection it selfe, is not more contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie vnto Antichrist the child of perdition: heauen aboue, is not more vnlike to hell belowe: final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie the triumphs of celestiall Sion, are not more differing from the torments of the infernall lake: than the waies of the Lord; which are pure and cleane, and the waies of the world, which are filthie and lothsome.</p>
                  <p n="18">18 We seé that euerie thing coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth a place to liue in agreéable to their nature. The fish in the riuer, the beast in the medowe, the bird in the aire, the worme in the earth. Experience teacheth vs no lesse, and reason proueth it to be true. Wherevpon it is recorded in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of memorie, that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamander, and the Hydra, two mortall enimies, and creatures of contrarie qualitie, encountring vpon the land, did so wound one another, that they were well nigh
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:2430:45"/>
destroied. The Salamander, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to recouer himselfe, left off fighting, and flew into the fire, which restored vnto him his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer strength: the Hydra séeing this, retired in like maner, and lept into the water, where he recouered all the force that he had lost: and thus they both, by betaking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to their naturall places, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued their liues, which otherwise had béene in hazard.</p>
                  <p n="19">19 These creatures, and diuerse other, maie teach vs wit. For sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that we haue no continuing citie here, but looke for one to come: is it not our partes to direct our steps thitherward, considering that we are not like vnto beasts, birds, fishes, worines, serpents, or anie vnreasonable thing: but immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, like our maker, whose image we beare about vs? It were van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage for vs to meditate herevpon, and to haue our minds aboue, not raking like dunghill cocks for a barlie corne in mucke: but like

Pretious, because it is the incense which we are commanded to burne vnto the Lord in the san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuarie of our harts: pretious I saie, because thereby we obteine at the hands of God, whatsoeuer tendeth to the good estate of the soule: and yet once againe pretious, because the Lord God, at the ascending thereof vp into heauen, stretcheth foorth his bountifull hand, and largelie bestoweth vpon vs what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer is beneficiall for our mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall bodies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:2430:49"/>Profitable, because it procureth vnto vs the ministration of all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner commodities behoofull for this life. For it is the onlie instrument, which we are commanded by Christ in the Gospell to vse, if we stand in neede of anie thing, either temporall or spirituall, during our pilgrimage in this life, as the verie words of our sauiour seeme to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port in this sense, saieng: Whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ye aske of the father in my name, it shall be giuen you.

                  <p>Now, who is so ignorant, but knoweth, that the asking, which Christ meaneth, is praier. For to aske of God, is not to aske after the maner of men, with a kind of carnal and corruptible affection, the end where of is to staie the force of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence, or desire, and the obtei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of that which is required: but it is an inward, secret, heauenlie,</p>

He doth not punish me as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate, to my condemnation: but he correcteth me as a child, to my saluation. I am the worke of his hands, he created me, and made me of nothing: to the honour of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe did he make me, and therefore I hope he will not destroie his owne workemanship, though it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth in his will and pleasure, to dispose all things as séemeth best to his diuine Maiestie.</p>

                     <p>Why then should I hang downe my head, as though confusion were the portion of mine inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance? To them that loue God, all things turne to good.

For he that determineth to erect and build a dwelling house, beginneth not at the roofe, but at the foundation: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, as it were a preposterous kinde of attempt, so all the world would iudge it fond &amp; ridiculous.</p>
                  <p>Againe, we see, and experience
<pb facs="tcp:2430:96"/>
teacheth no lesse, that the expertst and valiantst Captaine that euer fought in field, was not a perfect warriour borne, though peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture there was in him some vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment inclination to martiall poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and prowesse, but first he had his slender beginnings, and simple trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings vp, fit and conuenient for the nature of his age, which trainings vp in militarie knowledge, &amp; war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like actiuitie continued, the learner becommeth more skilfull and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious, and at last, by frequenting the field, and envring himselfe to trials of valiantnes, proueth a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing souldier.</p>
                  <p>Euen so we, whome nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede hath adorned with a goodlie likenes, with amiablenes of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and with apt proportion of bodie, but yet thrust out into the world with polluted soules, if we be desirous to please God, and not to offend man, we must endeuour our selues to leade a life agreeable to the written word of the Lord. The
<pb facs="tcp:2430:96"/>
waies and meanes to atteine here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto, do stand vpon certaine prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, or positions, whereof some being affirmatiue, and some nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, dooe iointlie teach vs what we ought to followe, and what to es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chue.</p>
                  <p>These principles or rules leading vs to the knowledge and practise of a godlie and vpright life, I haue thought good to call <hi>The Schoole of skill.</hi> For, as to neglect the due ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation of such precepts, and vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlie to contemne the vse of so wholesome counsels, is a manifest reason and argument of follie: so, to esteeme of them, as of acceptable treasures, and to order the course of life, according to their prescription and platforme, is an euident signe and token of good skill.</p>
                  <p>Now the Schoolemaister, whose Schoole I entitle this to be, is such a one indeede, as being taught by the holie Ghost from aboue, hath had the vse and practise of a godlie and blamelesse life: the commoditie
<pb facs="tcp:2430:97"/>
whereof, and incomparable sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse issuing from thence, when he had tasted, and sawe that the end of the same was the reward of eternall life, he pitied the miserable state of men walking in blindnesse, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and destruction: and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke them, or rather instruct and teach them knowledge, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they might amend their inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate trade of life, he professed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe a teacher in this Schoole, to the end that others, as well as he, might perceiue what aduantage a well disposed life affordeth.</p>
                  <p>This Schoolemaister we must pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suppose to be such a one, whose hart the finger of the Lord had touched, and into whose vnderstanding the sunne of sanctification had shined. He was not one that walked in car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall libertie, neither in the concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence of the eie, neither in the vanitie of the mind, for then should there be a repugnancie and dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion betweene his conuersation and profession, which ought to agree
<pb facs="tcp:2430:97"/>
like musicall concords. Take him therefore to be such a one, as being renewed in the spirit of the inner man, is able to teach, to instruct, to rebuke, and to informe, that the man of God might be made perfect in all righteousnesse. But now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering into this Schoole of Skill, let vs like good scholers with full pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose (Gods grace being our gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour) to profit and go forward in that we professe, learne by hart our A, B, C, in this Schoole, and according to our les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons frame the course of our life.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E see that Bees being a sociable creature, that is, apt for companie, flee together in swarmes, and assembled vnder one hiue, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the dutie wherevnto they are ordeined, namelie, to make Honie. The benefite of this labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and diligent creature is so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie, that such as haue knowne and tasted by due proofe and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience the fruite of their trauell, and the sweetenesse of their worke, will be hardlie persuaded to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the fostering of them, for feare of losing so singular commodities as they do yeeld.</p>
                  <p>Euen so this swarme of Bees, which I, not by the sound of a ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen, but by the painefulnesse of my pen, haue gathered together out of
<pb facs="tcp:2430:110"/>
the pleasant garden of Gods most holie word, where I found them scattered heere and there among the fragrant flowres, and sweete beds of wholesome hearbes, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king most comfortable Honie, and offering thee a tast thereof, are not lightlie to be esteemed, considering that the issue and euent of their trauell, well ordered and vsed, is so beneficiall, as nothing more, if anie thing like.</p>
                  <p>For their Honie hath this vertue, that to such as eate it, and digest it throughlie, it giueth a regenerated mind, a sanctified soule, a circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed hart, a mortified bodie, and all good things that man can imagine or deuise: of which spirituall gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, who so hath once possession, his conscience will tell him what it is to taste, to sucke, to eate, and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughlie to digest Honie made by such a swarme of Bees. These Bees followe one another orderlie and decentlie, without desire of first or highest place: out of one garden
<pb facs="tcp:2430:110"/>
they gathered it, in one hiue they made it, and for all godlie disposed peoples feeding heere they leaue it in their Honicombes.</p>
                  <p>There is none that hauing wit, will finde fault with water of the cleerest fountaine, with floure of the finest wheate, with a garment of the costliest silke, with a ring of the purest golde, with a iewell of the highest price. For it is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man to couet the verie best things, yea, and to obteine them, if they may be gotten for anie monie. Heere thou hast a swarme of Bees, making most excellent Honie, sweete, pleasant, and whoalsome. It differeth from ordinarie Honie, because the Bees that made it, are extraordinarie, and the flowers whereout they suckt it, grew in no common garden: it is offered vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee gratis, no gaine looked for, but onelie thy good will in recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing it, and thy diligence in vsing it. Make much therefore of these Bees, and open thy mouth wide,
<pb facs="tcp:2430:111" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that thy throte swallowing their sweete Honie, may distribute the same to all thine inward partes, and that the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and inward man may be refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>

Herevpon, some couet this game, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thersome that: and euerie man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede what maketh most for his contentment. Which kind of recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations and refreshings, men are not forbidden in Gods word to vse, so that the feare of his diuine maiestie preuent them in all their actions: and that they abuse not those bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites of recreation to a licentious and wanton libertie.</p>
                  <p>Verie necessarie it is, that consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration be had of the state of the bodie, which cannot alwaies en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure labour, but that now and then it must be refreshed, not onlie with
<pb facs="tcp:2430:127"/>
some intermission &amp; ceassing from trauell, but also with some kind of exercise coupled with delectation and pleasure, whereby not onelie the bodie, and euerie member thereof, is comforted, but the mind also, and the faculties or powers of the same iollilie quickened.</p>
                  <p>Such care taken for the bodie, which is earthlie and corruptible, should teach vs (I thinke) a point of wit, which we want, touching the regard wherewith we ought to be moued for the good estate of the mind or soule, which is heauenlie and immortall. For how much the minde is more pretious than the bodie, so much the more, wisedome would, it should be esteemed: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise we shall seeme to preferre the shell before the kernell, the barke before the pith, the shadowe before the substance, yea, most absurdlie, we shall refuse wheate for chaffe, pure gold for drosse, cleere wine for dregs, and in conclusion repent our want of grace.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:2430:127"/>It were behoofull therefore for vs, first and principallie to see to our mind, which is chiefest part of our essence and being, that the same, after some serious studie and contemplation, desiring to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshed, be not fed with fond fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, fables, dotages, imaginations, dreames, &amp; I cannot tell what idle and vnfruitefull discourses, which kindle the affections, and set the flesh a gogge: but rather with holie exercises, and godlie meditations, such as are and may be prouided for the purpose, to reuiue the spirit, and quicken the new man, if the partie be gratiouslie affected.</p>
                  <p>Thou hast heere therefore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented vnto thine hand (good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) a plant of pleasure, bearing fourteene seuerall flowers, called by the name of holie Hymnes and spirituall Songs, to reade at thy leasure for thy recreation, and not so much for thy recreation, as for thy profit: which I haue put partlie in rythme, and partlie in prose, for
<pb facs="tcp:2430:128"/>
the satisfaction of sundrie Readers desires, some beeing addicted to this, and some delighted in that kind of writing. I would to God it were in me to frame my wit to the will of the well disposed in all points. I haue done what I could, the Lord knoweth what I would: his name be praised for all, whose glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to seeke and set foorth, I beseech him giue vs all grace, so shall the faithfull reioice and clap their hands, but shame shall fall vpon the reprobat, &amp; force them to hang downe their heads.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S the benefits of God are manifold, or rather infinite, bestowed vpon man, from the time of his creation, euen so ought the fruites of his obedience &amp; thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse to be aboundant and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull. For, if a man hauing diuers good friends, but some more bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall than othersome, sheweth himselfe most officious and duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to them, of whome he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued most commoditie: by how much the greater reason ought we so to behaue our selues in all kinde of holie seruice towards God, who hath heaped vpon vs more bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, than the tongue of anie man can vtter, or his memorie conteine?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:2430:144"/>We see that all things are created by God, all things nourished by him, all things increased by him, all things multiplied by him, and all things preserued by him, for the vse of man, vnto whose gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he hath committed them, put him in full possession, and giuen him a lordlie title ouer them, to vse and dispose at his pleasure: requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring at his hands for this singular bountifulnesse, nothing but an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding hart, a renewed mind, and religious lips, which might tell abroade the great goodnes of so lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a God, and stir vp others to magnifie his name.</p>
                  <p>And although we ought to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God at all times, according to the continued course of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion and kindnesse shewed vnto vs, from the daie of our birth, vntill this present houre, sundrie and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie waies, as well in clothing vs, as also in nourishing and feeding vs, besides other inuisible graces, which not appearing to the world,
