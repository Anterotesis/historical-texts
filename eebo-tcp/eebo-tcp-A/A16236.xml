         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eing aduertised by diuers of my good
friends, how fauorably it hath pleased
the Gentlemen, both of the Court and
Country, and specially the Gentlemen
of the Innes of Court, to accept of my
poore Pamphlets, entituled <hi>Blundeuiles Exercises;</hi>
yea, and that many haue earnestly studied the same,
because they plainly teach the first Principles, as well
of Geographie as of Astronomie: I thought I could
not shew my selfe any way more thankfull vnto them,
than by setting forth the Theoriques of the Planets,
vvhich I haue collected, partly out of <hi>Ptolomey,</hi> and
partly out of <hi>Purbachius,</hi> and of his Commentator
<hi>Reinholdus,</hi> also out of <hi>Copernicus,</hi> but most out of
<hi>Mestelyn,</hi> whom I haue cheefely followed, because his
method and order of writing greatly contenteth my
humor. I haue also in many things followed <hi>Maginus,</hi>
a later vvriter, vvho came not vnto my hands, before
that I had almost ended the first part of my booke,
neither should I haue had him at all, if my good friend
M. Doctor <hi>Browne,</hi> one of the ordinarie Physicians
to her Maiestie, had not gotten him for me, with which
<pb facs="tcp:17994:4"/>
good Doctor I haue had in times past at Norwiche
many learned conferences, and haue receiued at his
hands many good documents, whom I take to be so
vniuersally learned in all manner of good and liberall
Sciences, as any other that I know in these daies: and
besides his great learning, I know him to be very wise
and honest, which two vertues I wish to raigne in all
learned men, because they be the greatest ornaments
that belong to learning. I haue deuided this my
booke into two parts, whereof the first part treateth
of the diuers motions of the Planets; and the second
part, of their Passions; and that so plainely, and vvith
such facilitie, as I hope that euery man of a meane ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie
may vnderstand the same. For I thought good
to collect out of the foresaid Authors no more but
that vvhich onely was meet and fit for that purpose,
praying all those that be learned, hereafter to adde to
this my booke any necessarie thing, that I through
age and vvant of cleare sight, haue negligently omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
And so I leaue to trouble you, praying you

                     <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ith euery art hath his proper tearmes,
without the knowledge whereof, no art
is easily learned: Minding therefore
here to treat of the Theoriques of the
Planets, I thinke it best first to set down
all the tearmes together with the true
significations thereof: which tearmes, though they bee
manifold, yet they may be all reduced into seuen. For
whatsoeuer tearme it bee, it signifieth either a point, a
centre, a line, a circle, a semicircle, a portion of a circle
otherwise called an arche, or an orbe, called in Latine
<hi>Orbis,</hi> which is as much to say, as a round hoope or
sphere, hauing breadth and thickenesse, and sometime
it is taken for a circle. And you see here, that I make a
difference betwixt a point and a centre; for though eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
centre is a point, yet euery point is not a centre. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
I make a difference betwixt a circle and an orbe;
for though they bee like, in that they both haue round
shape, yet they differ, in that the orbe hath both breadth
and thickenesse, and the circle hath neither. But before I
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:17994:5"/>
define the tearmes belonging to the Theorique of anie
Planet, I thinke it best, according to the method and
order vsed by <hi>Michaell Mestlyn,</hi> to set downe foure
principall intentions, meet to bee vsed in describing the
Theorique of euerie Planet: of which foure intentions,</p>
                  <p>1. The first is to shew of how many particular orbes
euery Theorique consisteth.</p>
                  <p>2. The second is to shew towards what part such orbes
are moued, and in what time they make their reuoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and also vpon what centres or poles they make their
regular mouings.</p>
                  <p>3. The third intention, is plainely to describe all such
points, lines, arches, semicircles, and such like things as
are needfull to be knowne for the calculating of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uings
of any Planet.</p>
                  <p>4. The fourth intention, is to shew how much lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
euery Planet (hauing latitude) hath: for euery Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net
hath latitude, more or lesse, the Sunne onely excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
which hath no latitude, because he neuer departeth
from the Eclipticke line, with whose Theorique I mind
here first to deale.</p>

easie than all the rest.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, as well for that he excelleth in dignitie all
the other Planets, as also for that the mouing of all the
other Planets dependeth vpon his mouing: which vnles
it be known, none of the others can be throughly known.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, for that the mouings &amp; reuolutions of all the
rest of the Planets are counted by his yearly reuolutions.</p>

the centre of the excentrique marked with B. though in

you may perceiue by the third figure next following: in
which figure the Sun being in his excentrique, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
about the centre B. is said to be equall, for whilst he
descendeth from F. to H. on the left hand of the figure,
he maketh the arch of his excentrique to be F. H. and
the angle to be F. B. H. vpon his owne centre B. which
is an obtuse or blunt angle: but vpon the centre A. he
maketh a lesser angle, which is F. A. H. for that is a right
angle; and so by this meanes the angle F. B. H. should
be equall to the angle F. A. H. that is to say, the greater
to the lesser, which is vnpossible. Wherefore the angles
made vpon A. the centre of the world, are not equall to
the angles made vpon the centre of the equall mouing,
marked with B. and therefore the mouing of the Sunne
about the centre of the world, appeareth to be vnequall,
sometime slower and sometime swifter, according to
the vnequal arches of the excentrique, subtending equal
angles in the centre of the world.</p>

and that the other orbe called the excentor of the excen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,

the Sunne was in his Auge, according to the line A. F.

from the centre of the earth 1190 semidiameters of the

point opposit to the Auge, he was then distant from the
centre of the earth, according to the line A. G. set down
in the said third figure, 1094 semidiameters of the earth.
But when the excentricitie is least, as it is in this our age,

And you haue to note, that one semidiameter of the

the line of the true moouing, and the line of the
meane mouing of the Sunne, marked in the third figure
with the letters I. K. and this arch doth make with the
centre of the world the angle K. A. I. equall to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
A. H. B: Which angle the line of the true mouing
together, with the line drawne from the centre of the
excentrique to the centre of the Sunne, dooth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend.
And you haue to note, that when the Sunne
is either in his Auge, or in the opposite point thereof,
then there is no such arch at all, by reason that the two
foresaid lines of the true and meane moouing doe at
that time meet and concurre in one, making one selfe
line, but the said arch is greatest when the Sun is in his
meane longitude, hereafter defined. When the Sunne
therefore descendeth from his Auge towards the point
opposite of the Auge, this arch to shew his true place,
taketh away the equacion from the meane moouing.
But when the Sunne ascendeth from the opposit point
towards the Auge, then this arch addeth so much to the
meane mouing.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore sith this arch doth encrease towards the
meane longitude, and going againe from thence, is
deminished; it falleth out, that the moouing of the Sun,
which is equall in his owne excentrique, appeareth in
the centre of the world to be vnequall, and to be most
slow, the Sunne being in his Auge: and the more that
he descendeth from thence, his moouing waxeth by
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:17994:14"/>
little and little the swifter. But it is equall to the meane
mouing, when the Sunne is in the meane longitude, but
if he be in the point opposite to the Auge, then his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
is most swift, and it obserueth the same course,
though by a contrarie way, that is, by decreasing, whilst
the Sun ascendeth from the opposit point of the Auge
towards the Auge.</p>

                     <head>What call you the meane longitude?</head>
                     <p>THe meane longitude may be taken two manner of
wayes.</p>
                     <p>For first the point of the orbe excentrique, in which
his equacion is greatest, is called the meane longitude,
of which points there bee in the excentrique, two: and
that meane longitude is bounded in the third figure with
the right line A. H. K. which line maketh right angles
with the line of the Auge in the centre A. and in that
place is found the angle A. H. B. or the arch marked
in the said figure with the letters I. K. on the left hand
of the figure, which is the equacion in the greatest ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centricitie
of the Sunne, and that is two degrees, <hi rend="sup">i323</hi>· <hi rend="sup">ii24</hi>·
but in the least excentricitie the equacion is no more
than one degree, <hi rend="sup">i55</hi>· <hi rend="sup">ii41</hi>·</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the meane longitude is a point of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centrique,
in which the Sunne or any other Planet hath
a meane distance from the centre of the world, that is
to say, it is in the middest betwixt the greatest and least
distance. For this word longitude is generally taken for
the distance of any Planet from the earth, which distance
is greatest, when the Planet is in his Auge, and is least
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:17994:14"/>
when he is in the opposite point of the Auge: so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
the meane longitude is taken for that distance
which exceedeth the least so much as it is exceeded of
the greatest, and is equall to the semidiameter of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centrique.</p>

which fourth Intention, in this Theorique onely hath no
place, for the Sunne neuer swarueth one jot from the
Eclipticke line, and therefore that line is called the way
of the Sunne, by which line all the latitudes and
wanderings of the other Planets are to be
measured and examined. And thus

                     <head>What followeth of this inequalitie of the excentrique?</head>
                     <p>TWo things. First, sith that the Astronomers by of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
obseruation haue found, that the orbe excentrick
or centre of the Epicicle dooth equally turne about the
centre of the world, it must needs follow, that the moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
of the said excentrique is vnequall, as well about his
owne centre, as about any other point, cleane contrarie
to that which hath been said touching the moouing of
the excentrique, or deferent of the Sunne. Secondly, the
mouing of this excentrique is swifter, when the centre
of the epicicle is in the vpper part, nigh vnto the Auge;
for a greater portion thereof doth belong to the equall
arches of the Zodiake, when shee is nigh to the Auge,
than when she is nigh to the opposit point of the Auge.
Which things doe plainely appeare in the third and last
figure belonging to the Theorique of the Sunne before
described. In which figure suppose the letters F. H. G.
to represent the excentrique of the Moone, whose moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
because it is equall about the centre A. must needs
be vnequall about the centre B. Moreouer, because the
medieties or halfes of the Zodiake, deuided by the right
line E. A. H. K. are turned about in equall time, so as the greater portion of the excentrique is answerable to
the vpper halfe, &amp; the lesser portion to the nether halfe,
it easily appeareth, that the centre of the Epicicle ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
in his mouing a greater bent or bowt vpward, and
a lesser downeward, that is to say, it goeth faster being in
the vpper halfe, than when it is in the nether halfe.</p>

                     <head>What conclusions are to be gathered out of this Inequalitie
of the Epicicle?</head>
                     <p>THese foure here following.</p>
                     <p>1 First, for so much as it is found by obseruation,
that the motion of the meane Auge of the Epicicle,
marked with the letter M. is regular and equall, going
euery day 13 degrees and almost <hi rend="sup">i4</hi>· it must needs follow
that the motion of the other two points, that is, the true
Auge of the Epicicle, marked with the letter V. and the
touch point marked with P. is irregular and vnequall,
because the meane Auge of the Epicicle is a vagarant
point, so called, because it keepeth not alwaies one cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
place in the Epicicle, and yet is the beginning of
the motion of the Epicicle.</p>
                     <p>2 Secondly, if the centre of the Epicicle be in the
Auge or opposit Auge of the excentrique, then these
three points, that is, the Touch-point, the true Auge, and
the meane Auge of the Epicicle be all one, that is to say,
doe concurre or meet all in one selfe line. But if the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre
of the Epicicle be out of any of the said points, <hi>viz.</hi>
out of the Auge or opposite Auge of the excentrique,
then they are so seperated, as the true Auge of the Epici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
marked with the letter V. is in the middest betwixt
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:17994:20"/>
the meane Auge, marked with M, and the Touch-point
marked with P, because the centre of the world is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
in the middest betwixt the centre of the excen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trique
and the point C, which point C in the little cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
is opposite to the centre of the said excentrique,
marked with B. And the greatest distance of these points
is beneath the meane longitudes of the Excentrique.
What those meane longitudes are, shall bee declared
hereafter.</p>
                     <p>3 Thirdly, in that halfe of the excentrique, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendeth
from the Auge of the said excentrique vnto
the opposite Auge of the same, the two Auges of the
Epicicle, both true and meane, marked with the letters
V and M, doe goe before the Touch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>point, in respect of
the motion of the Epicicle, which is contrarie to the
succession of the signes. But in respect of the motion of
the excentrique, which is alwayes according to the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of the signes, the two points M and V doe follow
the Touch-point P, as you may easily perceiue by the
former figure last set downe: for the centre of the Epici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
being in the Auge of the excentrique, marked with
D, or in the opposite Auge of the same, marked with
G, the three foresaid points are all joyned together in
one selfe line. But when the Epicicle descendeth from
D to E, then P V and M are seperated, and P goeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
V and M: and the letter V being the true Auge of
the Epicicle, is in the middest betwixt P and M. And
such digression or seperation is encrased by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
vntill the centre of the Epicicle doe come to the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
F, for from thence they begin againe to approch and
to grow nigher together, vntill they fall into the point
G, whereas they joyne againe, and are all one. But the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:17994:21"/>
contrarie happeneth when those points are in the other
ascending halfe of the excentrique, for then M and V
doe goe before P, proceeding according to the succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the signes.</p>
                     <p>4 Fourthly, the mouing of the Epicicle is swifter in
the vpper part of the excentrique, than in the nether part
thereof, for there the meane Auge of the Epicicle pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth
contrarie to the succession of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ignes, that is
to say, towards that part into the which the Epicicle is
moued: but the contrarie happeneth in the lower part of
the excentrique. And you haue to note, that the Touch-point
P is the measure of the digression or seperation of
both the Auges of the Epicicle, as well true as meane,
because the Touch-point doth at no time wander from
his place but remaineth immoouable.</p>
                     <p>The demonstration of this fourth conclusion is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
set foorth in the former second figure of the Moone,
whereby you may perceiue, that when the Epicicle is
come to the letter H, nigh vnto the meane longitude of
the Excentrique, whereas the distance of the foresaid
points M V and P is alwayes greatest; then immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
both the Auges, M and V, begin againe to approch
vnto the Touch-point P, wherefore M proceedeth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
P, contrarie to the succession of the signes, vntill
it meeteth with P in the Auge of the excentrique, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
with the letter D. And from thence M departeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
from P, contrarie to the succession of the signes,
vntill it arriueth to the other meane longitude of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centrique,
whereas it is furthest distant from P. And by
reason that the Epicicle is also moued into that part, it
falleth out, that the two moouings meeting in one selfe
part, the mouing of the Moone in the Epicicle, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:17994:21"/>
the Epicicle it selfe by following the wandering
meane Auge, is swifter in his gate. But contrariwise, in
the nether part of the excentrique, from the place nigh
vnto F (whereas the distance of M P is greatest) vnto
the other place of the greatest distance of the said points
nigh vnto H, the meane Auge of the Epicicle is moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
according to the succession of the signs: and there,
according to the quantitie of his moouing, it taketh
so much away from the swiftnesse of the Epicicle, as
thereby the Epicicle in that place is much more slower
in his gate.</p>

of the world, marked with the letter T, about which is
a little circle described by the centre of the excentrique
of the Moone, by turning round about the centre of the
world, which centre of the excentrique is marked with
the letter S, and the opposite point to that, is marked
with the letter V, and the circumference of the said lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
circle is deuided into nine equall parts, marked with
Arithmeticall figures, as 1. 2. 3. and so forth to nine, to
shew the place of the centre of the excentrique, marked
with S, in euery aspect. For the centre of the Moones
Epicicle being in conjunction with the Sunne, the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre
S is found to be in the vpper point of the little cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
marked with the figure 1, and being in the first Sex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
aspect, the centre S is in the point marked with the
figure 2, and so proceedeth from point to point, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the order of the nine aspects, before set downe.</p>

                     <p>SVppose therefore the Conjunction of the Sun and
Moone to be vnder the letter A. wherfore you must
place in one selfe line both the Auge of the excen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trique,
marked with the letter X, and also the centre of
the Epicicle, marked with the letter Y, right vnder the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
A. And because the centre of the Epicicle dooth
mooue towards the left hand, according to the successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the signes, and that the Auge of the Moone doth
moue towards the right hand, contrary to the succession
of the signes, you must bring the centre Y to the letter
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:17994:24"/>
B, for there will his place be within foure dayes next af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Conjunction, and there hauing staied the centre
Y, turn the Auge X towards the right hand, euen to the
letter M, &amp; stay it there, so shall you find the midde bodie
of the Sun, who then followeth the Moone, to be in the
middest betwixt the two letters B and M, right ouer the
Sextile aspect; and at that time the Moon is said to be in
a Sextile aspect to the Sunne, for then she is nigh to the
meane longitudes, signified here in this figure by a white
right line, alwayes crossing the line of the Auges (which
is also white) in the centre of the world with right an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles,
and the shape of the Moones light is then horned,
like a sycle, called in Greeke <hi>Minoides,</hi> and in Latine
<hi>Falcata.</hi> But at the seuenth day after the Conjunction,
her light will encrease somewhat more, wherefore by
turning the centre Y to the letter C, and the Auge X to
the letter N, you shall find the centre of the Sunne to
be in the very midst betwixt those two letters, right ouer
the Quadrat aspect, and the Moon to be right in the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posit
Auge, and thereby to be in a Quadrat aspect to the
Sunne, at which time the shape of her light is said to be
halfed, which may be called the halfe Moone, in Greeke
<hi>Diochotomos,</hi> and in Latine <hi>Dimidia</hi> or <hi>Dimidiata.</hi> But
the eleuenth day after the Conjunction, she will seeme
round bodied, though not at the full: wherfore you must
bring the centre Y to the letter D, and the Auge X to
the letter O, so shall you find the centre of the Sunne to
be in the middest betwixt those two letters, right ouer
the marke of the Trine aspect; for then the Moone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
againe in the mean longitude, is said to be in a Trine
aspect to the Sunne, and the shape of her light is round
like a bowle, and may be called the whole Moon, though

                     <p>But the nineteenth day of her age the centre Y will
be in the letter F, and the Auge X in the letter H, and
then the Moon is the third time in the mean longitude,
and then she is againe in a Trine aspect to the Sunne, as
she was before at the eleuenth of her age. And when
the Moone is two and twentie dayes old, then the centre
Y shall bee in G, and the Auge X in Q, and then the
Moone shall be again in a Quadrat aspect to the Sunne,
as she was before when she was seuen dayes old. And
when she is sixe and twentie dayes old, then the centre
Y shall bee in H, and the Auge X in R, and then the
Moone being the fourth time in the meane longitude,
shall be in a Sextile aspect, as she was before, being but
foure dayes old. And when she shall be thirtie dayes old,
then the centre Y and the Auge X shall meet together

vpon the centre M, making six equall spaces, euery space
containing 10 minutes, so as there be in all 60 minutes,
which are called the proportionall minutes; the vse
whereof, and whereto they serue, we shall shew here by
and by. Moreouer, there be foure little circles, signifying
the Epicicle of the Moone, euery one hauing his centre
placed vpon the excentrique, marked with the foure let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
H I K L. And the letters B C set downe in foure
sundry places vpon the Zodiake, right against euery one
of the Epicicles, doe signifie the arch of the Zodiake,
which is called the equacion of the Epicicle, which arch
is contained betwixt the line M B, passing through the
very centre of the Epicicle to the Zodiake, and the line
M C passing through the middest of the Moone, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
with the letter F, betwixt which letter F and the letter
D (set downe in euery Epicicle) is contayned an arch of
the Epicicle, whereof the arch of the Zodiake B C is
said to be the equacion. And the foure letters H I K L
before mentioned, doe not only signifie the centre of the
Epicicle, but also certain other points in the excentrique
to shew the encrease and decrease of the equacion of
the Epicicle. For the point H standing aboue, signifieth
the Auge of the excentrique, in which point whenso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
the centre of the Epicicle is found to be, then the

when the centre of the Epicicle is in the point I, then
the equacion is somewhat greater: and when it is in the

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:17994:33"/>
the more distant from the Auge of the Excentrique,
the greater is the equacion. But when the centre of
the Epicicle is in the opposit Auge of the Excentrique,
marked with the letter K, then the equacion is greatest
of all, containing 7 degrees, <hi rend="sup">i40</hi>· and the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt

because the diameter of the Auge of the Excentrique,
marked in this figure with the letters M H, dooth farre
exceed in length the diameter of the opposite Auge of
the Excentrique, marked with the letters M K, as you
may easily trie with your Compas, by applying the shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test

excesse or ouerplus whereof is deuided as you see into
six equall spaces or sections, euery one containing tenne
minutes, through which sections the seuen circles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
mentioned, doe passe, making in all sixtie minutes;
which sixtie minutes are not only set downe in the right
line of the Auges of the Excentrique, but also in each
halfe of the circumference of the said Excentrique,
proceeding on both sides downeward from the Auge
vnto the opposit Auge of the Excentrique: and these
sixtie proportionall minutes were inuented to know
thereby how much the equacion of the Epicicle dooth
encrease or decrease, according as the centre of the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cicle
is more or lesse distant from the Auge of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centrique.
For if you suppose the centre of the Epicicle
to be in the point I, then like as the diameter M I is
lesser or shorter than the diameter M H, by twentie of
the said minutes, so the equacion of the Epicicle mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
vpon the Zodiake with B C, is greater than the
equacion of the Epicicle, beeing in H, by twentie such
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:17994:33"/>
minutes: which excesse is marked with the letters A C
vpon the Zodiake. Againe, when the centre of the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cicle
is in the point L, then as the diameter M L is lesser
than the diameter M H by <hi rend="sup">i40</hi>· so is the equacion of the
Epicicle, marked with B C, greater than the equacion of
the Epicicle, being in H, by <hi rend="sup">i40</hi>· which excesse is also
marked on the Zodiake with the letters A C. And to
speake breefely, the further that the centre of the Epici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
is distant from the Auge H, the shorter is the diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
or right line drawne from the centre M to the centre
of the Epicicle, and thereby the equacion of the Epici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
is the greater. Now though these proportionall mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes
may be described another way, that is, by deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the ouerplus or excesse, whereby the arch of the

diuersitie of euery equacion, in what place soeuer of the

haue to note, that the head of the Dragon hath two
motions or mouings, the one meane and the other true.
His meane mouing is an arch of the Zodiake, extending

well on the right hand as on the left hand of the figure,
for the right line C H M dooth point to the meane
Auge of the Epicicle, marked with the letter M on both
sides of the figure, and the right line A H V doth point
to the true Auge of the Epicicle, marked likewise on
both sides of the figure with the letter V, and the right

both sides of the figure with the letter P, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
in the middest betwixt the meane and true Auge
of the Epicicle, being out of the line of the Auges. Now

                  <div type="section">
                     <head>What conclusions doe follow vpon this Inequalitie of the
Epicicle?</head>
                     <p>1. THese foure: First, the moouing of the Planet to
any other point in the circumference of the Epici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
than to the meane Auge of the Epicicle and to the
opposit Auge, is vnequall.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="74" facs="tcp:17994:41"/>2. Secondly, when the centre of the Epicicle is either
in the Auge or opposit Auge of the Excentrique, then
the three points, that is, the mean Auge, the true Auge,
and the Touch-points are all vnited, and doe meet in one
selfe line: but beeing out of the line of the Auge, they
are so seuered, as the Touch-point is in the middest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the meane and true Auge of the Epicicle, because
that the centre of the Excentrique is in the middest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the centre of the Equant, and the centre of the
Eclipticke.</p>
                     <p>3. Thirdly, in the descending halfe of the excentrique
from the Auge towards the opposit Auge thereof, that
is from D to E, the meane Auge of the Epicicle, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
with M, goeth before the Touch-point, marked with
P, according to the succession of the signes; and the true
Auge of the Epicicle followeth the said Touch-point,
according to the succession of the signes. But in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ascending halfe of the Excentrique, the true Auge
of the Epicicle beeing out of the line of the Auges of
the Excentrique, alwayes enclineth from the Touch-point
towards the Auge of the Excentrique, and the
meane Auge of the Epicicle enclineth towards the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posit
Auge of the Excentrique.</p>
                     <p>4. Fourthly, in the vpper part of the Excentrique the
mouing of the Planet is swifter than in the lower part of
the Excentrique, because that the meane Auge of the
Epicicle goeth in the vpper part of the Excentrique, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the succession of the signes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>. But in the other
nether halfe of the Excentrique, the moouing of the
Planet is slower, going there contrarie to the succession
of the signe.</p>

the three superior Planets.
<figure/>
                     </head>
                     <p>THis figure as you see consisteth of two seuerall cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
wherof the lesser circle which standeth aboue,
signifieth the Epicicle, carrying the Planet, whose
centre is marked with the letter B. And the greater circle
beneath, is the deferent of the Sunne. In each of which
circles are set downe the caracters of the fiue Aspects,
whereof in both circles, that of the Conjunction is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
aboue, and that of the Opposition beneath: and on
each hand on both sides are placed the caracters of the
other three aspects, that is, the Sextile, the Quadrat, and
the Trine aspect. The letters set downe on both sides of
either circle, doe serue to shew the points of moouing,
as well of the Sunne in his deferent, as of the Planet in
his Epicicle: for when the Sunne by his meane mouing
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:17994:42"/>
is in the point C of his deferent, and the Planet in the
meane Auge of his Epicicle, marked with D, then are
both their meane mouings joined in one selfe line, and
so be in a Conjunction. And as the Sun departing from
thence to the point E, set downe on the left hand of his
deferent, hath gone a sixt part of his deferent, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
is in the first Sextile aspect: so the Planet departing
from the meane Auge of his Epicicle, and comming to
the point F, hath gone also a sixt part of his Epicicle,
and is thereby in the first Sextile aspect: and when the
Sunne commeth to the point G, and the Planet to the
point H, then they are both in a Quadrat aspect: and
when the Sunne commeth to the point I, and the Planet
to the point K, then are they both in a Trine aspect: and
when the Sunne is in the point L, and the Planet in the
point M, then they are just opposit one to another, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
both in one selfe line: and in departing from thence,
they obserue like order in going through the other halfe
of their circles, vntill they come againe to be in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction,
as the letters N P R on the right hand, being
the halfe of the Sunnes deferent, and the letters O Q
S on the right hand, being the halfe of the Epicicle, do
shew.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="section">
                     <head>Of this harmonie doe follow three conclusions.</head>
                     <p>1. FIrst one period of the Epicicle is justly accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
in so much time as passeth betwixt two Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions
of the Sunne and of the Planet.</p>
                     <p>2. Secondly, looke how many degrees the Sunne by
his meane mouing is distant from the meane moouing
of the Planet, so much doth the Planet depart from the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:17994:43"/>
meane Auge of his Epicicle. And therefore the meane
mouing of the centre of the Epicicle, and the meane
mouing of the Planet in his Epicicle, being joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
are equall to the meane mouing of the Sunne.</p>
                     <p>3. Thirdly, of this way may be gathered, that the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cicle
and the Excentrique as touching their swiftnesse
and slownesse of gate in making their periodicall reuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions,
are cleane contrary one to another, for in those
places whereas the mouing of the Excentrique is slow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
there the mouing of the Epicicle is swiftest, and yet
their mouings being all joyned together, are equall to
the mouing of the Sunne.</p>

                     <p>BEfore I define what they be, it shall not be amisse

and the followers of <hi>Alphonsus,</hi> in counting or mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring
the equacions of the Epicicle of the Moone, or
of the argument (as they tearme it) they haue regard
onely to the excesse of the longer and shorter diameter
of the Auges of the Excentrique, which excesse they
call the diuersitie of the diameter; which is plainely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
before in the sixt figure belonging to the Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rique
of the Moone, and therefore resort thereunto,
that you may the better beare it in mind. But in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Planets they make two excesses, whereof they call
the one the excesse of the longer longitude, and the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:17994:47"/>
other the excesse of the nigher longitude. The excesse
of the longer longitude, is an arch of the Zodiake, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the equacion of the Epicicle, when the centre ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
is in any of the two meane longitudes, marked in the
Excentrique on the right hand with the letter H, and
on the left hand with the letter F: for then the foresaid
arch of the Zodiake is greater than that which sheweth
the equacion of the Epicicle, his centre being in the
Auge of the Excentrique, marked with E. But when the
centre of the Epicicle is in the opposit Auge of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centrique,
then the foresaid arch of the Zodiake which
is right against the meane longitude, marked with H, is
lesser than the arch of the Zodiake, which representeth
the equacion of the Epicicle, his centre being in the
said opposit Auge of the Excentrique, and therefore is
called the excesse of the nigher longitude. And of these
two excesses doe rise two sorts of proportionall minutes,
that is, the longer and the nigher. All which things you
shall better vnderstand, by helpe of the last fourth Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure:
in which figure the arch marked with the letters Q
R S on the right hand of the said figure is the arch of
the Zodiake, representing the equacion of the Epicicle
when his centre is in the point H, signifying the meane

letters S T on the right hand do shew, so as in this figure
the letters R S on the right hand doe shew the excesse
of the longer longitude, and the letters S T on the same
hand doe shew the excesse of the nigher longitude: of
which two excesses doe spring the two kinds of propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall
minutes before mentioned, which doe serue to
shew how much euery equacion of the Epicicle is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
or lesser than another, when the centre of the Epici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
is in any other place of the Excentrique, and is clean
out of the Auge or opposit Auge, and also out of the
meane longitude of the Excentrique. And as in the sixt
figure of the Moone the equacions of the Epicicle in
euery place of the Excentrique (his centre being neither
in the Auge nor in the opposite Auge of the Excen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trique)
is knowne by the proportionall minutes, for that
as well the excesse of the longest, as the excesse of the
shortest diameter of the Auges of the Excentrique is
each of them there diuided into sixtie minutes: so here
likewise the said proportionall minutes are found out by
deuiding the difference or ouerplus that is betwixt the
diameter of the meane longitude, and the longest dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter
of the Auge of the Excentrique into 60 minutes;
and also by deuiding into 60 minutes the ouerplus or
difference that is betwixt the diameter of the meane lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude
and the shortest diameter of the Auges of the
Excentrique, as you may plainely perceiue by the last
fourth figure, wherein as the line A E signifying the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
diameter of the Auges of the Excentrique, exceedeth
in length the diameter of the meane longitude, marked
on the right hand with A H, and on the left hand with
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:17994:48"/>
A F, by a third part and somewhat more (which excesse

or ouerplus, whereby the diameter A H or A F
exceedeth the shorter diameter of the Auges of the
Excentrique, marked with the letters A G, is also deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
into 60 minutes; of which the first <hi rend="sup">i60</hi>· are called the
longer proportionall minutes, and the last <hi rend="sup">i60</hi>· are called
the nigher proportional minutes, because they are nigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

                     <p>And according as any other right line drawne from
A the centre of the world to the centre of the Epicicle,
being in any other place of the Excentrique, out of the
Auge or opposit Auge of the Excentrique, or out of the
mean longitudes, is longer or shorter; so doth the equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
of the Epicicle encrease or decrease: For as by sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
the centre of the Epicicle to be in the point K of
the Excentrique, you shall find the right line A K to be
longer than the line A H by 40 minutes; euen so the
equacion of the Epicicle in K, marked with Q S, is les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
than the equacion of the Epicicle in the point H,
marked also with Q S, by 40 of such minutes, as the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
arch R S, signifying the excesse of the longer longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
doth containe 60 minutes. Likewise, as the line A
L is shorter than the line A H by 40 minutes, euen so
the equacion of the Epicicle, marked with Q S (his
centre beeing in L) is greater than the equacion of
the said Epicicle, marked also with Q S, his centre
beeing in the point H, by 40 of such minutes, as the
arch S T, signifying the nigher longitude, dooth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
60 minutes. And remember here, that in seeking
in this figure to know the length of the line A K by the
minutes, you must put the firme foot of your Compas
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:17994:49"/>
in the centre A, and the moouable foot in the point L,
and so to draw the moouable foot from thence to the
line A H Q, vpon which line the numbers of the 60
proportionall minutes are set downe: and to know the
length of the line A L, you must fit your Compasses to
A L, and then draw the mouable foot to the line A G
Q, vpon which line are also set downe the 60 proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall
minutes, in like manner as they are vpon the line
A H Q, sauing that in the line A H Q the said 60 mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes
are to be counted from H towards Q, and in the
line A G Q they proceed vpward from Q to G, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as the inferior halfe circles doe shew. And after
this manner you must deale, to know the length of any
other line drawne from the centre A to any other point
of the Excentrique, whereinto the centre of the Epici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
chaunceth to fall; considering alwayes whether such
line be either longer or shorter than the line A H, pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
through the point of the meane longitude, to the
intent you may know thereby how to applie the length
of euery line to the right number of the proportionall
minutes belonging to the same. But you haue to note,
that neither <hi>Copernicus</hi> nor the Prutenicall tables doe
make any more kinds of excesses or proportionall mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes,

                     <p>THe latitude of the Moone is simple, hauing onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to the distance of her Excentrique or Deferent,
from the Eclipticke line; whose greatest distance from
thence, either toward the North or South, is but fiue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
as hath been said before, by reason that the poles
of her Excentrique are distant from the poles of the

the three vpper Planets is to be considered two manner
of waies: First, according to the distance of any of their
excentriques from the Eclipticke: and secondly, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the distance of any of their Epicicles from the
Excentrique thereof, which two kinds of latitude <hi>Purba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius</hi>
describeth the first in this manner: The first (sayth
he) chaunceth by reason that the plane or superficies of
the Excentrique of the Planet declineth from the plane
of the Eclipticke in two parts opposit, the greatest di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of such declination remaining alwaies invariable
like as in the Moone, and yet the two Nodes or Interse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
that is to say, the node ascendent and descendent,
otherwise called the head and taile of the Dragon, are
not moued contrary to the succession of the signes (as in
the Moone) but according to the mouing of the eighth
sphere, so as the Auges of the deferents of those Nodes
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:17994:50"/>
do describe on the North side, paralell circumferences
that be equally distant from the Eclipticke: and though
such Auges be alwaies septentrionall, yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
those Auges be not in all the three planets the very
points or limits of the greatest latitude of their deferents
from the Eclipticke; yea that falleth out only in Mars,
the Auge of whose excentrique doth most decline from
the Eclipticke to the North; but in Saturne the point or
limit of his greatest latitude goeth before the Auge of
his excentrique, contrary to the succession of the signes,
and is distant from his Auge 50 degrees; and in Iupiter
such point goeth after the Auge of his excentrique ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the succession of the signs, and is distant from

the poles of the Eclipticke. And vpon the point C is
drawn another circle, signifying the plane or superficies
of the excentrique, marked in the vpper part with the
letters A B E, enclining as you see towards the plane
of the Eclipticke. And because the two planes, that is,
the plane of the Excentrique &amp; the plane of the Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke
doe crosse or cut one another in the very centre of
the world, marked with D; and because the Auges of
the three Planets are all distant from the Eclipticke to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the North; therefore the centres of their Excen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triques
must needs be also Northerly, and out of the
centre of the Eclipticke: so as the centre of the Excen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trique
for Saturne, is to be found in the line A D, and for
Mars, in the line B D, and for Iupiter, in the line E D.
And the Auge of Saturne is marked with A, and that of
Mars with B, and that of Iupiter with E. Moreouer, the
right line, marked with the letters B F C G H, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senteth
the plane of the greatest circle, passing as well
through the poles of the Eclipticke, as also through that
right line, which passing through the centre of the world
is erected with right angles vpon the plane of the excen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trique:
For this plane of the greatest circle doth deuide
the arches, as well of the Excentrick, as also of the Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke,
two manner of wayes: which arches are distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
in this figure by the two vsuall caracters, signifying
the two nodes, otherwise called the head and taile of the
Dragon: and either of the two distances, F B, or G H,
sheweth the greatest declination of the two planes, And
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:17994:51"/>
finally, the point B is the limit of the North latitude, and
G the limit of the South latitude of any of the three
Planets. Thus you may perceiue, that the Auge of the
Excentrique of Mars is alwayes in the North limit, and
his opposite Auge in the South limit, but the Auge
of Iupiters Excentrique, marked in the former Figure
with E, goeth before the North limit B, that is to say, the
centre of Iupiters Epicicle commeth to the Auge of his
Excentrique, before that it arriueth to the North limit.
And finally, the Auge of Saturne his Excentrique,
marked in the said figure with A, followeth after the
North limit, so as the centre of his Epicicle arriueth to
the North limit, before it commeth to the Auge of his
Excentrique. And the followers of <hi>Alphonsus</hi> do make
the Node ascendent of Mars to be at this day in the six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
degree of Taurus, and his Node descendent to
be in the sixteenth degree of Scorpio: and the Node as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent
of Iupiter to bee in the 14 degree of Cancer,
and his Node descendent to be in the 14 degree of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricorne,
and his North limit to be in the 14 degree of
Libra. And the Node ascendent of Saturne to be in the
24 degree of Cancer, and his Node descendent to be in
the 24 degree of Capricorne, because his North limit is
in the 24 degree of Libra, so as there is no great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betwixt Saturne and Iupiter, touching their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits.
And partly hereby, and partly by that which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
hereafter, it shall manifestly appeare that Saturne
whilest he passeth through the one halfe of the Zodiake,
counting from the 24 degree of Cancer vnto the 24 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Capricorne, he hath alwaies North latitude;
and whilest he passeth through the other halfe of the
Zodiake, he hath alwaies South latitude. Wherefore
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:17994:52"/>
considering that he maketh his whole reuolution in thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
yeares, he hath continually during the space of 15
yeares North latitude, and during the other 15 yeares
South latitude: and the like is to be judged of Iupiter and
Mars, according to the time of their entire reuolutions;
for Iupiter maketh his reuolution in 12 yeares, and Mars
in 2 yeares.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Mestlyn</hi> following <hi>Copernicus,</hi> setteth down the
places of the North limit and Node ascendent of euery
one of the three vpper Planets in this manner, that is to

each one doth occupie in the Zodiake such degree and
minutes as is opposit to the place of the North limit, and
of the node ascendent of euery one of the said Planets
before set downe. And <hi>Mestlyn</hi> sayth, That as the greatest
latitude of the Moone either North or South from the

the Ecliptique, marked with the letters C E. Then vpon
the centre F is drawn another circle, signifying the plane
of the Excentrique, marked with the letters G H I K,
passing through the poles of the Excentrique, marked
with the letters M O, and also through the North limit,
marked with L, and through the South limit, marked
with N; and the two little circles placed vpon the Excen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trique,
each of them signifieth the Epicicle. And you
haue to note, that the plane of the motion of the said
Excentrique is signified here by the right line, marked
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:17994:53"/>
with the letters L F N, which cutteth the Eclipticke in
the centre A; so as when the centre of the Epicicle is in
L, it hath then his greatest North latitude, likewise being
in N, it hath his greatest South latitude: and by this Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
you may perceiue, that the one pole of the Excen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trique
is more distant from the pole of the Eclipticke
than the other, for O is more distant from K, than H
from M. The signification of the rest of the letters wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the Epicicles are marked, shall be declared hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
In the meane time we will speake first of the latitude,
called the Inclination of the Epicicle, in Greeke <hi>En<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which causeth the diameter of the Auges of the Epici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
to decline on both sides of the plane of the Excen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trique,
that is to say, as well inwardly as outwardly, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
and forme following: for when the centre of the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cicle
is in any of the two Nodes, the diameter of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
doth not decline at all either from the Excentrique
orfrom the plane of the Eclipticke, because then it fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
just into their mutuall fection. But when the centre
of the Epicicle departeth from any of the Nodes, then
in the vpper halfe of the Excentrique, containing the
Auge of the Epicicle, the foresaid diameter of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
declineth inwardly from the Excentrique towards
the plane of the Eclipticke, and yet arriueth not to the
same. But when the centre of the Epicicle is in the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
halfe of the Excentrique, containing the opposit
Auge of the Epicicle, the diameter of the Auges decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
outwardly from the Excentrick towards the Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke,
and yet arriueth not to the same. And the greatest
declination of this diameter is when the centre of the
Epicicle is in any of the limits; and yet such declination
is no where so great, as that being out of the Nodes, it
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:17994:53"/>
can reach vnto the Eclipticke: and this declination ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
his reuolution vpon the diameter of the mean lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitudes.
The most part of which things you may see
plainely set foorth in the sixt figure before described, in
which both the Epicicles are marked with the letters P
Q R, whereof P signifieth in either of the Epicicles the
Auge, and R signifieth the opposit Auge of the Epici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
and the arch P Q signifieth the greatest Inclination
of the diameter of those Auges to the Excentrique. So
as when the centre of the Epicicle is in the North limit
marked with L, the foresaid Auge P declineth inwardly
from the plane of the Excentrique towards the Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke,
and R the opposit Auge fleeth outwardly from
the Eclipticke. But when the centre of the Epicicle is in
the South limit, marked with N, then the Auge P being
on the other side of the Excentrique, declineth againe
towards the Eclipticke, and R the opposit Auge occupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the opposit place to P. And you haue to vnderstand,
that the greatest declination here signified by the arch P

<hi rend="sup">i30°</hi> and for ♂ 2 degrees, <hi rend="sup">i15°</hi> And to the intent that you

                     <p>IN this figure vpon the centre F, signifying the centre
of the world, is drawne a great circle, which signifieth
the whole sphere of the Planet, whose poles are mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
with D E, whereof D is the North pole, and E the
South pole. And within this circle are drawne two other
oblique circles of shape, ovale; whereof the outermost
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:17994:54"/>
marked with the letters A B C, signifieth the Ecliptick:
and the inward circle signifieth the Excentrique, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
are placed foure Epicicles, the highest whereof hath
his centre marked with G, signifying here the North li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit;
and the centre of the lowest Epicicle is marked with
N, signifying the South limit; and the centre of the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cicle
on your right hand is marked with M, signifying
the Node ascendent; and the centre of the Epicicle on
your left hand is marked with O, signifying the Node
descendent. Moreouer, euery Epicicle is crossed with
two diameters, whereof that which is marked with H K,
doth signifie in euery Epicicle the line of the Auges of
the Epicicle, that is to say, H the Auge, and K the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit
Auge; and the other diameter marked with I L, signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
the line of the meane longitudes. Wherfore when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
the centre of the Epicicle is in the Node ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
marked with M, then there is no Inclination of the
diameter of the Auges, because it falleth into the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Intersection, as well of the Excentrique as of the
Eclipticke: but the more that the diameter of the Auges
departeth from thence towards the North limit, the
more it falleth vpon the line of the meane longitudes,
marked with I L, insomuch, as when it arriueth to the
North limit, marked with G, the inclination then is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test,
and the line of the Auge falleth directly and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicularly
vpon the line of the meane longitudes, and
from thence the inclination decreaseth, vntil the diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the Auges arriueth to the Node descendent, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
with O, in which point it hath againe no declination.
But departing from thence towards N, the inclination
of this diameter goeth vnto the other side of the Excen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trique.
For as the Auge of the Epicicle passing first from
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:17994:55"/>

Excentrique towards E the South pole: euen so depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
from O, and passing through N to M, it declineth
towards D the North pole: and so the Auge H is found
againe to encline to the Eclipticke: and K the opposite
Auge to flee from the same vntill it hath his greatest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination,
which is in the point N, and from thence it

as well within as without the plane of the Excen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trique,
sauing that when the centre of the Epicicle is in
any of the limits, for then this diameter falleth just and

the said diameter turneth outwardly, that is, on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
of both the said planes. What the Occidentall and
Orientall halfe is, hath beene described before in the
third Intention. And note, that the greatest reflexion
of this diameter chanceth when the centre of the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cicle
is in any of the Nodes, which greatest reflexion for
Saturne, is 2 degrees, <hi rend="sup">i30°</hi> and for Iupiter one degree, <hi rend="sup">i30°</hi>
and for Mars one degree, <hi rend="sup">i0°</hi> And this greatest reflexion
is like vnto the greatest obliquitie or latitude of the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:17994:55"/>
Excentrique from the Eclipticke, as is before set downe.
Moreouer, you haue to note, that as in the former kind
of latitude, called Inclination, the diameter of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of the Epicicle maketh his reuolution vpon the dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter
of the meane longitudes; so in this second kind of
latitude called Reflexion, the diameter of the mean lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitudes
maketh his reuolution vpon the diameter of the
Auges. And for the better vnderstanding of that which
hath been said here touching the reflexion of the dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter
of the meane longitudes, marke well the former
seuenth figure, in which you may see, that when the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre
of the Epicicle is in the North limit, marked with G,
the diameter of the meane longitudes, marked with I L,
lieth full vpon the plane of the Excentrique, without
any reflexion. But when the centre departeth from
thence, then the Occidentall halfe of the said diameter,
contained betwixt the centre and the letter L, bendeth
inwardly towards the South pole, and this Occidentall
halfe still remaineth within the Eclipticke and within the
Excentrique, vntill the centre of the Epicicle falleth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Node descendent, marked with O, in which place
the said diameter hath his greatest reflexion, and euen
there is vnited to the plane of the Eclipticke. And the
centre of the Epicicle departing from thence the said
Occidentall halfe, remaining out of the Eclipticke and
out of the Excentrique, approcheth againe to the plane
of the Excentrique, and is vnited to the same in the
point N: but in the other Orientall halfe it happeneth
cleane contrarie.</p>

                  <div type="section">

                     <head>What conclusions doe follow vpon these two kinds of lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes,
called the Inclination and Reflexion.</head>
                     <p>1. THese seuen here following: for first, whensoeuer
the centre of the Epicicle is in any of the Nodes,
then the whole plane of the Epicicle falleth into the
plane of the Eclipticke, for then the diameter of the
Auges of the Epicicle is also there, hauing no Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
at all. And then there is also the diameter of the
meane longitudes of the Epicicle, whose obliquite from
the Excentrique, is alwaies so much as is the obliquite of
the Excentrique from the Eclipticke. But the Epicicle
is neuer vnited to the plane of the Excentrique, because
neither of the foresaid diameters doe decline both at
once from the plane of the Excentrique.</p>
                     <p>2. Secondly, the centre of the Epicicle being in any
of the Nodes, the axletree of the Epicicle standeth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicularly
vpon the axletree of the Eclipticke, from
which it is then equally distant. But it is not equally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
to the axletree of the Excentrique.</p>
                     <p>3. Thirdly, hereof may be gathered, that the planes
of the Excentriques and of the Epicicles doe cut one
another alwaies in a diuers diameter, for in the two nodes
such section is made vpon the diameter of the Auges,
but in the two limits such section is made vpon the dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter
of the meane longitudes: and in all other meane
places betwixt the said nodes and limits, such section
chanceth somtime in one place, &amp; somtime in another.</p>
                     <p>4. Fourthly, the line of the mutuall section, whereas
the Epicicle and the Excentrique doe cut one another,
doth wander through the plane of the Epicicle in such
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:17994:56"/>
sort, as the one halfe of the Epicicle looking vp towards
the North limit, declineth from the plane of the Excen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trique
towards the South. And the other halfe appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
nigher to the South limit, declineth from the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centrique
towards the North, as you may plainely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
by the former seuenth figure, in which, that halfe of
the Epicicle which looketh towards the North limit,
marked with G, is the vpper halfe of the Epicicle, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
with the letters L H I: but when that halfe commeth
vnto the Node descendent, marked with O, then it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Occidentall halfe, marked with the letters K L H:
and when it is come to the South limit, marked with N,
then it is called the inferior or nether halfe, marked with
the letters I K L: But when that halfe arriueth to the
Node ascendent, marked with M, then it is called the
Orientall halfe, and is marked with the letters H I K. And
the other halfe of the Epicicle declining from the plane
of the Excentrique towards the North pole, looketh to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the South limit.</p>
                     <p>5. Fifthly, when the Planet is in the vpper halfe of
the Epicicle, in which the Auge is, then he alwaies wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
betwixt the Eclipticke and the Excentrique: but
when he is in the nether halfe, he goeth cleane without
them both.</p>
                     <p>6. Sixtly, the diameter of the Auge being in the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
halfe of the Epicicle, and out of the Nodes, decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
towards the Eclipticke, and being againe in the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
halfe, departeth from the Eclipticke towards that
part whereunto the Excentrique declineth. Hereof it
must needs follow, that the Planet whilest he is in the
Orientall halfe, encreaseth his latitude, and in the Occi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall
halfe deminisheth the same, but yet so, as his lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:17994:57"/>
from the Node ascendent to the Node descendent,
is alwaies Northerly, and from thence to the node ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
it is alwaies Southerly.</p>

                     <head>The seuenth Conclusion.</head>
                     <p>THe diameter of the meane longitudes, and the dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter
of the mutuall sections of the Epicicle and of
the Excentrique, are alwaies in a manner equally distant
to the diameter of the section of the Excentrique and of
the Eclipticke, and thereby are equally distant also, in a
manner to the Eclipticke it selfe. I say here in a manner,
because that neither of the foresaid diameters being out
of the limits or nodes, are justly equally distant from the
Eclipticke, yet the difference is so small, as it is scant sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
and therefore may be taken for one simple latitude,
whereby the plane of the Epicicle, which in the Nodes
is vnited to the Eclipticke, maketh the diameter, which
is paralell to the line drawne through both the limits to
decline vpon that diameter, which is a paralell to a right
line drawne through both the Nodes, which the former
seuenth figure plainly sheweth: for when the Epicicle is
either in M or in O, then the diameter of Inclination,
marked with I L, is paralell to the line G F N, drawne
through the two limits, and also through the centre F.
But when the Epicicle is in G or N, then the diameter
H K, looking vpward, is all one with the line G F N.
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:17994:58"/>
Againe, the Epicicle being in M and O, such declinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is made vpon the ouerthwart diameter H K, which
then is all one with the line drawne through the Nodes,
marked with the letters O F M: but the Epicicle being
in G or N, the same Inclination is made vpon the dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter
I L, being paralell to the line O F M, so as in the
meane places that are betwixt the limits and the Nodes,
the enclining diameter looketh vpward, and that dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter
whereupon the Inclination is made, is alwayes
transverse or ouerthwart. From hence the Astronomers
doe calculate the latitudes of these three Planets, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
regard onely to the position or placing of the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cicles
in the two limits, and by the proportionall mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes
doe find out the equacion in euery other place or
position, according as the said Position is more

Moone, and the other like to an Oyster shell or Cockle
shell: all which things, whereto they serue and what they
signifie, shall be here declared by helpe of the letters

therein contained: for the double, round, and greatest
circle being deuided into twelue equall parts, marked
with Arithmeticall figures, signifieth the circle Equant,
whose Auge is marked aboue with the letter A, and his
opposit Auge being beneath, is marked with the letter B,
and the line A B is the line of the Auges, which passeth
through these three centres, that is, the centre of the
world marked with the letter C, the centre of the Equant
marked with the letter D, and the centre of the little mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
circle marked with the letter E, which little circle is
made by the turning of the centre of the Excentrique a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the centre E, and therefore when the centre of the
Excentrique commeth to the very top of the little circle,
marked with the letter F, then is his excentricitie three
times as much as is the excentricitie of the equant, which
lieth betwixt D and C, for <hi>Ptolomey</hi> found the right line
D C to be equall vnto the semidiameter of the said little
circle. But when the centre of the Excentrique falleth
downe from F to D, his excentricitie is least of all, and
there the Excentrique is also vnited to the Equant it self,
and the Auge also of the Excentrique falleth into the
line A B: but if the centre of the Excentrique doth fall
from that line into any other part of the circumference
of the said little circle, then his Auge doth wander either
into the West part going contrarie to the succession of
the signes, or els into the East part, going according to
the succession of the signes; as suppose the centre of the
Excentrique to be in the point marked with P in the litle
middle circle on the right hand, then his Auge will be in
G, and his opposit Auge in L: and if his centre be in O,
then his Auge shall be in I, and his opposit Auge in M:
and if his centre be in R, then his Auge will be in S, and
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:17994:65"/>
his opposit Auge in T: but if his centre be in V, then his
Auge will be in X, and his opposit Auge in Y: so likewise
if his centre be in Z, his Auge will be in <hi>a,</hi> and his oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit
Auge in <hi>d:</hi> and if his centre be in C, then his Auge
will be in B, and his opposit Auge in E. And the outer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
bounds of the wanderings of the Auges are the
two letters G and I: and the bounds of the wanderings
of the opposit Auges are the two letters L and M, which
bounds doe limit these foure angles, that is, G C A, I
C A, L C B, and M C B. To euery one of which
angles in the circular concentrique dooth answere one

for breuitie I here omit. You haue also to note, that the
foresaid Auge describeth the vpper circle, made in a
manner like a halfe Moone, marked with the letters N S
G X A B I <hi>a:</hi> and the opposit Auge describeth the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
circle, made like an Oyster shell, marked with the
letters Q T L Y B <hi>e</hi> M <hi>d,</hi> and vpon the long Ovale
circle are placed two little circles, of each hand one, sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying
the Epicicle of Mercurie, whose centres are mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
with the letters K and H: for the centre of his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cicle
describeth the said Ovale figure, but not altogether
like vnto the Ovale figure of the Moon, as shall be shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
hereafter. In the meane time you haue to note, that
when the centre of the Excentrique is in the top of the
little circle, marked with F, then the Epicicle is furthest
distant from the earth, because he is then in the Auge.
But when the Epicicle is come downe in the Ovale
figure vnto the point H, and the centre of the Excen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trique
is also come downe in the little circle vnto the
point P, hauing made a third part of that circle, euen as
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:17994:66"/>
the Epicicle hath made a third part of the Equant, then
the Epicicle is nighest vnto the earth. But when the
centre of the Excentrique is come downe to the point
D, and the Epicicle is come to the opposit Auge, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
with B, then he is more distant from the earth, than
when he was in the point H, the demonstration where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
I here omit: and the Epicicle beeing come to the
opposit Auge, hath then passed through the whole ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centor
of the Excentrique, and hath made one period,
and doth the like in the other halfe: whereby you may
gather first, that the centre of the Epicicle in making
one period dooth passe twice through the excentor of
the Excentrique: secondly, that the said centre of the
Epicicle in making one reuolution, is but once in the
Auge of the Excentrique, at which time he is most di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
from the earth. But being in the very opposit Auge,
he is not so nigh vnto the earth, as when he is in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
two points before mentioned, each of which points
is distant 120 degrees from the Auge of the Equant, and
in those points is nearest to the earth. Thirdly, that the
centre of the Epicicle, by these manifold motions, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribeth
the said Ovale figure, which notwithstanding is
not like in many respects vnto the Ovale figure of the
Moone; how and wherefore, we come now to shew.</p>

in these things following.</head>
                     <p>FOr looke how much the Excentrique of either Planet
dooth proceed according to the succession of the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:17994:66"/>
signes, that is to say, the Excentrique of the Moone from
the line of the mean mouing of the Sun, and the Excen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trique
of Mercurie from the line of the meane Auge; so
much doe the orbes of vnequall thickenesse reuert con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
to the succession of the signes, that is to say, the
two deferents carrying the Auge of the Moone, and the
excentor of the Excentrique of Mercurie doe make like
circuits as well to the foresaid lines, as to their opposit
parts. Secondly, the centre of either of their Excen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triques
by the going backward of the said orbes, descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth
about the centres of the same orbes a little circle.
Thirdly, whilest the Excentrique maketh one period to
the foresaid lines, the centre of the Epicicle of either
Planet goeth twice about the foresaid orbes. Wherfore
it followeth of necessitie, that the Epicicle in euery reuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
is twice nighest, and twice furthest off from the
centre of the little circle: and by this meanes, the Epici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of either Planet in making one period describeth
with his centre the figure Ovale. Thus much touching
their likenesse or agreement in describing the figure
Ovale of either Planet. Now we will shew you wherein
they disagree in making the figure Ovale. The centre of
the little circle in the sphere of the Moone, is also the
centre of the world; but in the sphere of Mercurie al that
little circle is excentricall, because that in Mercurie it is
described by an orbe which is excentricall, and in the
sphere of the Moone it is described by those orbs, which
in some respect are concentricall. Wherefore the Auge
of the Moone dooth wander equally throughout the
whole Zodiake: but the Auge of Mercurie is turned
and wrythed on each side of his meane Auge: and by
his turning and wandering, now on this side, and now on
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:17994:67"/>
that side, both the Auge and also the opposit Auge doe
each of them make a figure that wrieth in and out, and
that which the Auge maketh, is marked in the former
figure with the letters N S G X A <hi>b</hi> I <hi>a,</hi> almost like
to a halfe Moone; and that which the opposit Auge ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth,
is marked with these letters, Q T L Y B <hi>e</hi> M <hi>d,</hi>
much like to an Oyster shell, as hath beene said before.
Whereof it followeth, that the Auge of the Moone is
onely moued contrarie to the succession of the signes.
But the Auges of Mercurie doth sometime proceed by
a reciprocke mouing according to the succession of the
signes. Moreouer, the excentricitie of the Moone in a
whole period is neuer changed, but abideth alwaies one
and the same: but the excentricitie of Mercurie is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
changed. Againe, the Moone in euery her reuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
falleth twice into the Auge, and twice into the
opposit Auge, by meanes whereof she is twice furthest
from the earth, and twice nighest to the same; and the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
of those distances is a just quarter of a circle one
from another, which is 90 degrees. But Mercurie falleth
neither into the Auge nor opposit Auge but once only,
and he is furthest distant from the earth when he is in
the Auge. But he is nighest to the earth twice (not when
he is in the opposit Auge) but in two places, each of
them being distant on either side from the Auge the
third part of a circle, which is 120 degrees. Finally,
the Epicicle of the Moone describeth a figure, more
like to a figure Lenticular, than to a figure Ovale. And
the Epicicle of Mercurie describeth a figure more Ovale
than otherwise, the cause whereof is, for that the centre
of the Moones Equant (about which her Excentrique
maketh his regular motion) is also the centre of the little
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:17994:67"/>
circle. But the centre of Mercuries Equant is resident in
the lowest part of the said little circle, notwithstanding
each figure is commonly called an Ovale figure.</p>

the reuolution of Mercurie agreeth most exactly with

adde, that the excentor of the Excentrique of Mercurie,
maketh his reuolution together with the Excentrique of
the Sunne, not simply, but in hauing respect to the mean

the meane Auge is on both sides most distant from the

But if the centre of the Epicicle be in the nether halfe,
then the Auge of Venus declineth towards the South,
and the opposit Auge towards the North: but in Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curie
it is cleane contrarie, and the greatest declination
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:17994:71"/>
is when the centre of the Epicicle is either in the Auge
or opposit Auge of the Excentrique.</p>

manner, as that halfe of the Excentrique, into which
the Epicicle at any time entreth, doth by and by begin to
decline into the said North part for Venus, and into the
South part for Mercurie: and this Inclination of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centriques,
causeth that the North latitudes of Venus be

with her wings spread open, containeth three se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall
planes of orbes, cutting one another in the
diameter of the world, which passeth through the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre
of the world, marked here with A: which three planes
doe represent no more but one onely plane, that is, the
Excentrique of Venus or of Mercurie, to shew the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse
positions or placings of the said Excentrique, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by the latitude of their inclination. And ye haue to
vnderstand, that the middlemost of these three planes or
orbes, marked with the letters L K M T, and containing
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:17994:72"/>
therein foure Epicicles, doth signifie, that the Excen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trique
being in either of the two points K or T, is vnited
to the Eclipticke: but the other two planes, whereof the
first hauing the line of the Auge drawne through the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
of the greatest declination, marked with the letters
B C, and the second plane hauing a line marked with
Q P, dooth signifie the declination of the Excentrique
from the Epicicle. Moreouer, in this figure the two
planes B C, and Q P, hard by the mutuall section which
is nigh vnto K and T, are cut off, not for that such orbes
are to be cut off indeed; but that by this means the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cicles
being in K or T, might be the better seene in the
middlemost plane, marked with the letters L K M T. You
see also, that in this figure the circumference of euery
one of the foure Epicicles is marked with these four let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
G H F I, but yet placed in diuerse order, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the diuers mouing of the Epicicle. And you haue
to note, that when the centre of any of those Epicicles
is in the Node ascendent, marked with K, then the plane
of the Excentrique, whose diameter by passing through
the Auge L, and the opposit Auge M, is the line L A M,
wholly vnited to the Eclipticke, hauing no declination
at all, whereby the axletree of the said plane, marked with
N O, hangeth perpendicularly vpon the plane of the
Eclipticke. But when the centre of the Epicicle ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
from the Node K towards the Auge of the Excen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trique,
marked with B, then the vpper part of the Excen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trique
dooth by and by decline from the Eclipticke to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the North for Venus, and towards the South for
Mercurie; as when the centre of the Epicicle is in the
Auge B, for then the diameter B A C, or rather the
whole vpper halfe of the Excentrique is found to be on
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:17994:72"/>
this side of the Eclipticke, and the inferiour part of the
Excentrique to be beyond the Eclipticke, and the axle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree
of the Excentrique is then the line D E. But when
the centre of the Epicicle is come downe to the Node
descendent, marked with T, then the plane of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centrique
is vnited again to the Eclipticke, and the right
line L A M is againe the diameter of the Auge. But
when the Epicicle is once passed the Node descendent,
marked with T, then the vpper part of the Excentrique
which was before on this side of the Eclipticke, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
now to decline beyond the Eclipticke, wherefore
the lower part of the Excentrique beginneth now to
haue the same declination which the vpper part had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that is to say, towards the North for Venus, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the South for Mercurie. And therefore the centre
of the Epicicle being in the opposit Auge, marked with
P, the position of the Excentrique is the line P A Q,
and the axletree thereof, is the line R S. It appeareth
therefore, when the centre of the Epicicle is in any of the
Nodes, either K or T, that then the Excentrique is vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the Eclipticke. But if the centre of the Epicicle be
out of those Nodes, then as well towards the Auge B, as
towards the opposit Auge P, the Excentrique hath the
like latitude as before, that is, North latitude for Venus,
and South latitude for Mercurie. And therefore the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre
of the Epicicle doth not goe beyond the Eclipticke,
either towards C or Q.</p>

from the plane of the Excentrique, in such sort as
followeth: for when the centre of the Epicicle is in any

Auge of the Excentrique, marked in the former figure
with B P, then the diameter of the Auges haue no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
at all, because it falleth just into the plane of
the Excentrique; but the declination thereof is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test,
when the centre of the Epicicle is in any of the two
Nodes, yet with such difference, as the inclination of
this diameter, or rather of the one halfe of the plane of
the Epicicle being made in the descending halfe of the
Excentrique, is for Venus Northward, and for Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
Southward: but in the ascending halfe of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centrique,
the halfe of this diameter for Venus is South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and for Mercurie Northward. And this declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is made vpon the diameter of the meane longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes,
which the former figure dooth plainely shew:
for the Epicicle being in B or P, which are the two li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits,
the declination of the diameter of the Auges is
nothing at all. But the centre of the Epicicle being in
T, which is the Node descendent, the vpper part of
this diameter, marked with T G, declineth from the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:17994:73"/>
plane of the Excentrique Northward for Venus, and
Southward for Mercurie: but the lower halfe, marked
with T F, enclineth contrariwise, that is to say, South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
for Venus, and Northward for Mercurie. And
because that the declination is greatest when the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cicle
is in any of the Nodes, then the aforesaid diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
beginneth againe to approch vnto the plane of the
Excentrique, and in the limit P is vnited againe to the
plane of the Excentrique, and from thence the vpper
part of the said diameter declineth beyond the plane of
the Excentrique to the other side, and the inferior part
to this side. Wherefore the Auge of the Epicicle, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
with G, being in the point K, which before was
for Venus Northward, is now Southward, and for Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curie
cleane contrarie. The greatest angle of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
of the plane of the Epicicle vnto the Excen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trique,
is demonstrated by <hi>Ptolomey</hi> and <hi>Copernicus,</hi> to

                     <head>Now shew in what manner the other diameter, passing
through the meane longitudes of the Epicicle, maketh
his declination?</head>
                     <p>THis kind of declination of the Epicicle, is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
called the reflection, in Greeke <hi>Loxosis,</hi> because it
maketh the diameter of the meane longitudes to reflect
on both sides from the plane of the Excentrique in such
manner as followeth: for while the centre of the Epici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
is in any of the Nodes, which is distant a just quarter
of the Zodiake from the Auge or opposit Auge, then
the reflection of this diameter is nothing at all, because
then it falleth wholly into the plane of the Excentrique;
but such reflection is greatest, when the centre of the
Epicicle is in any of the limits, or in the Auge or oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit
Auge. And yet with such difference, as the reflection
of the halfe of this diameter, called the Orientall halfe
of the Epicicle, may be in the vpper halfe of the Excen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trique,
Northward for Venus, and Southward for Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curie.
But in the lower halfe of the Excentrique, the said
Orientall halfe of the Epicicle reflecteth for Venus to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the South, and for Mercurie towards the North.
And this reflection is made vpon the diameter of the
Auges, all which things the former figure dooth plainely
shew. For when the centre of the Epicicle is in K or T,
which be the two Nodes, then the diameter of the mean
longitudes, marked with H I, hath no reflection at all,
but lieth whole vpon the plane of the Excentrique, as
you may see in the Node ascendent, marked with K: but
in the vpper part of the Excentrique towards the Auge,
when the centre of the Epicicle is in the Auge B, then
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:17994:74"/>
the Orientall halfe of the diameter H I, marked in the
highest Epicicle of this figure with the letters H B, or
els the Orientall halfe of the said highest Epicicle, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
with the letters G H F, doth reflect from the plane
of the Excentrique for Venus Northward, and for Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curie
Southward. But the Occidentall halfe of the said
diameter, marked with B I, or that halfe of the Epicicle
marked with F I G, doth reflect cleane contrarie, that
is to say, for Venus towards the South, and for Mercurie
towards the North. And when the reflection is greatest,
then this diameter approcheth the Eclipticke, and falleth
into the same in the point T, that is to say, in the Node
descendent. And departing from thence downeward
towards the limit P, the said halfe of the diameter refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth
on the other side beyond the Eclipticke, and then
the Occidentall halfe succeedeth, which as when it was
in the vpper part of the Excentrique, was for Venus
South, and for Mercurie North: so now by going from
T to P, and so to K, it is made for Venus Northward,
and for Mercurie Southward. And the greatest angle of
the reflection of this diameter vnto the Excentrique, is
demonstrated to be for Venus 3 degrees, <hi rend="sup">i30</hi>· &amp; for Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curie
7 degrees: and to these doe agree at the centre of
the world the latitudes for Venus to be 2 degrees, <hi rend="sup">i30</hi>· and
as much for Mercurie. Notwithstanding, because Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curie
hath a greater excentricitie, this angle in the Auge
of the Excentrique, hath to the centre of the world two
degrees, <hi rend="sup">ii15</hi>· and in the opposite Auge of the said Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centrique,
it hath 2 degrees, <hi rend="sup">ii45</hi>·</p>

                     <head>What conclusions are to be gathered of the inclinations and
reflections of the Epicicles?</head>
                     <p>1. THese here following: First, the plane of the Epici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
is neuer vnited with the plane of the Excen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trique
or of the Eclipticke, by reason of the continuall
inclinations of the one or of the other diameter. And
therefore the axletree of the Epicicle is neuer perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
to any of those planes.</p>
                     <p>2. Secondly, the declinations of the diameter of the
Auges, and of the meane longitudes of the Epicicle of
these two Planets, that is to say, of Venus and Mercurie,
are contrarie to the declinations of the three vpper Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,
for there the declinations of the diameters of the
Auges are greatest in the limits, &amp; nothing in the nodes,
but the declinations of the said diameters in these two
Planets are greatest in the nodes, and nothing in the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits.
Againe, the reflections in the three vpper Planets
are greatest in the nodes, and nothing in the limits, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
in these two Planets the reflections are greatest in the
limits, and nothing in the nodes.</p>
                     <p>3. Thirdly, the planes of the Excentriques and Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cicles
of these two Planets doe cut one another in diuers
diameters: for in the nodes such section is made in the
diameter of the meane longitudes, but in the limits the
same section is made in the diameter of the Auges; and
in the meane places such section chanceth sometime in
one place, and sometime in another, betwixt the said di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameters:
but the said section in the three vpper Planets,
obserueth contrarie order, as hath been said before.</p>
                     <p>4. Fourthly, the line of the mutuall section of the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cicle
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:17994:75"/>
and of the Excentrique doth wander through the
plane of the Epicicle in such sort, as the one halfe of the
said plane departeth from the plane of the Excentrique
for Venus towards the North, and for Mercurie towards
the South: so the other halfe of the said plane declineth
cleane contrarie, that is to say, for Venus towards the
South, and for Mercurie towards the North: but in the
three vpper Planets such line of mutuall section obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
a contrarie order. By these conclusions it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest,
that the latitude of Mercurie and Venus hath three
variations, the first by reason of the moouable obliquitie
of the Excentrique: the second by reason of the moua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
declinations of the Epicicle: and the third by reason
of the moouable reflections of the said Epicicle. All
which things you may the more easily perceiue by the
former figure, for the Epicicle being in the Node ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
marked with K, the diameter of the meane longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes,
marked with H I, is in the very plane of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centrique:
but the diameter of the Auges of the said
Epicicle, marked with FG, hath then greatest declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
so as the whole nether halfe of the said Epicicle,
marked with the letters H F I, looking towards the
Node descendent, is for Venus Northward, and for Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curie
Southward. And the vpper halfe of the said Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cicle,
marked with the letters I G H, being partly hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
from our sight, by reason that it is vnder the Excen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trique,
is for Venus Southerly, and for Mercurie Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly:
and the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ameter of the section, marked with H I,
is aparalell to the line of the Auge of the Excentrique,
which line is marked with these letters, L A M, whereof
L signifieth the Auge, and M the opposit Auge of the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:17994:76"/>
Excentrique, and A the centre of the world: so in the
other Node, marked with T, the selfesame diameter H I
is in the meane longitudes, but there the vpper halfe of
the Epicicle, marked with the leters I G H, looking to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the same part as before, is then for Venus towards
the North, and for Mercurie towards the South. But the
lower halfe of the Epicicle, marked with the letters H F I,
(whereof some part is now againe hidden and couered
as it were with the plane of the Excentrique) is for Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
towards the South, and for Mercurie towards the
North. The like and the same dooth chance when the
centre of the Epicicle is either in the Auge B, or the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posit
Auge P; for in those places the diameters of the
Auges, marked with F G, hauing no declination, the
Epicicles are diuided, and the diameters H I haue their
greatest reflection: and yet after the same manner as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that is, when the East halfe is in B, and the West
halfe in P, which letters doe signifie as well the two li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits,
that is, B the North limit, and P the South limit, as
the two Auges; for here againe the one halfe of the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cicle
is wholly to be seene, in which whilest it goeth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Node descendent, Venus is Northward, and
Mercurie Southward. But the other halfe of the Epici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
(which the plane of the Excentrique dooth partly

as the line of the true mouing of the centre of the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cicle
maketh, in proceeding forward according to the
succession of the signes, for then the Planet for a while
seemeth to stand still, and not to be mooued from his
place, and thereof is said to be stationarie, like to any of
the fixed starres. And you haue to vnderstand, that these
diuersities of motions vnder the Zodiake proceedeth of
the mouing of the Epicicle, which in his vpper part car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth
the Planet according to the succession of the signs,
and in his nether part carrieth the same contrarie to the
succession of the signes, called his retrogradation. In
which inferior or nether part of the Epicicle are the two
points of station. But for the better vnderstanding of
that which hath been said touching the direction, retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gradation,

But you haue to note, that though the two points of sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

Auge, as from the Auge of the Epicicle, yet such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
is not alwaies of like qualitie, neither is the arch
of their progression, nor the arch of their retrogradati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
alwaies of one bignesse, but do alter and that for four
causes: First, for that the Epicicle through the moouing
of his Excentrique is sometime nigher and sometime
further off from the centre of the earth: for the nigher
that the epicicle is to the earth, the more are the stational
points distant from the true opposit Auge of the Epici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
in all the fiue Planets, sauing in Mercurie. The second
cause may be the diuerse magnitude of the Epicicle, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
compared to his Excentrick, for the stationall points
of a greater Epicicle do approch nigher vnto the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit
Auge, than the stationall points of a lesser Epicicle
doe. The third cause is the periodicall slownesse or swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the Epicicle, being compared to the periodicall
mouing of his Excentrique, for the slower reuolution of
the Epicicle maketh the stationall points to be nigher to
the opposit Auge of the Epicicle, and therby as well the
arch of progression as of retrogradation doe encrease
and decrease. Fourthly, the diuersities of their excentri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities
may cause the stationall points to alter in their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
from the opposit Auge of the Epicicle.</p>

of the dexter aspect is contrarie to the succession
of the signes, looking backward from Aries towards Pis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
Aquarius, Capricornus, and so forth to the last point
of Taurus. As for example, if one Planet be in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

those two Planets do looke one to another with a sinister
Sextile aspect. But if the one Planet be in Aries, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,

another with a dexter Sextile aspect, as you may see by

                     <p>THey are said to be meane, when the two lines of both
their meane mouings doe meet in one selfe point of
the Zodiake, and doe make one selfe line. And they
are said to bee true, when the two lines of their true
moouings doe meet and make both one selfe line in
one selfe degree of the Zodiake, and their Oppositions
are either meane or true, according as the said lines
doe meet in the opposit points of the Zodiake. And
the true Conjunctions of the said two lights are said
to bee true, sometime according to longitude onely,
as when the foresaid true lines doe meet in one selfe
point onely according to longitude: for the Moone
doth oftentimes wander from the Eclipticke line, and
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:17994:82"/>
therefore though the line of her true mouing doe meet
with the line of the Sunnes true moouing in one selfe
point vnder the Zodiake (the Moone hauing then lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude)
yet that is according to longitude only: but if those
two lines doe meet when the Moone hath no latitude,
but is right vnder the Eclipticke line, then such Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
is both according to latitude, and also according
to longitude, which is called a Corporall or Eclipticall
Conjunction. And the like is to be said of their true Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions,
when the said lines doe meet in like manner in
the opposit points of the Zodiake. Moreouer, you haue
to note, that the true Conjunctions may differ from the
meane Conjunctions by reason of time, for sometime
the one may go before or after the other, and sometime
meet both at one instant. They may meet both at one
instant two manner of waies: First, when the Sunne or
Moon are in the Auge or opposit Auge of their Excen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triques,
or when the one is in the Auge, and the other in
the opposit Auge, for then the foresaid lines of their
meane and true mouings are all one. Secondly, they doe
meet at one instant, when the equacions of their argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are equall and of like qualitie, which is to bee
knowne by the Prutenicall tables. But the true Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
and Oppositions doe goe before the mean Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions
or Oppositions, when at the time of the mean
Conjunction and Opposition the place of the Sunne is

                     <p>THe Planets are said to be encreased in light, when af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that any of them hath been in Conjunction with
the Sunne, either the Sunne departeth from that Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,
or the Planet departeth from the Sunne, vntill it be
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:17994:83"/>
at his furthest distance from the Sunne. And it is said
to bee deminished in light, when after such furthest
distance either the Planet approcheth to the Sunne,
or the Sunne to the Planet. And it is said to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bust,
when the Planet is hidden vnder the beames of
the Sunne, so as it cannot yeeld his light, as is before
said. Secondly, all starres are said to be Orientall or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutine,
when they rise before the Sunne; and they are
said to bee Occidentall, when they goe downe after
the Sunne; and yet with some difference as <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
sayth: for the three vpper Planets (that is to say)
Saturne, Iupiter, and Mars, are said to bee Orientall,
Matutine, and to goe before the Sunne from the time
of their being in Conjunction with the Sunne, vntill
they come to be in Opposition to the Sunne, as well
when they are seene, as not seene: and this happeneth
whilest any of those three Planets descendeth from the
Auge of his Epicicle through the meane longitudes
vnto the opposit Auge of the said Epicicle: but the two
inferior Planets, that is, Venus and Mercurie, are said to
be Orientall, Matutine, and to goe before the Sun, when
either of them ascendeth from the opposit Auge of his
Epicicle vnto the Auge of the said Epicicle, which you
may euidently see by the first figure of this second book.
But as for the Moone, she is said to be Orientall, Matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,
and to goe before the Sunne, during the time of
her wane or decrease. Againe, the three vpper Planets
are said to be Occidentall, Vespertine, and to follow the
Sunne from their being in Opposition with the Sunne,
vntill they come againe to be in Conjunction with the
Sunne; which chanceth whilest any of them is carried
from the opposite Auge of the Epicicle through the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:17994:83"/>
meane longitudes, vnto the Auge of the same Epicicle.
But Venus and Mercurie are said to be Occidentall, Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertine,
and to follow the Sunne, whilest either of them
descendeth from the Auge of their Epicicle vnto the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posit
Auge of the same. But as for the Moone, shee is
said to be Occidentall, Vespertine, and to follow the Sun
all the time that she is in her encrease. Now you haue to
vnderstand, that the rising and going downe of the fixed
starres, as well Matutine as Vespertine, is twofold, that is,
true and apparent. The Matutine rising is said to be true,
when the starre riseth together with the Sunne in one
selfe point of the Eclipticke, and at one selfe instant, at
which time the star remaineth hidden vnder the beames
of the Sunne: but such Matutine rising is said to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent,
when the starre hauing been hidden a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
with the beames of the Sunne, doth get out from
thence, so as in the morning it may bee seene, which
chanceth when the Sunne goeth from the starre. Again,
the Vespertine rising is said to be true, when the starre is
right opposite in any part of the Eclipticke to the
Sunne, at the time of his going downe, and is so much
eleuated aboue the Horizon, as after the euening twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
it may be seene: but such Vespertine rising is said
to be apparent, when the starre in the euening after Sun
setting, dooth shine, and beginneth to appeare in the
West. Now the Matutine going downe of any starre is
said to be true, when the starre goeth downe at such time
as the Sunne riseth, and is in the opposit point of the
Eclipticke, to the Sunne. But the Matutine going
downe is said to be apparent, when the starre at the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of the Sunne (which a little before night haue been
seene) is now hidden vnder the beames of the Sunne.
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:17994:84"/>
Moreouer, the Vespertine going downe of any starre is
said to be true, when it goeth downe together with the
Sunne at one selfe instant. And such Vespertine going
downe is said to be apparent, when the starre at the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
downe of the Sunne is hidden, which a little before
might haue been seene, and so continueth hidden vntill
the morning, vntill it may get from vnder the beames of
the Sunne.</p>
                     <p>Out of this difference of rising and going downe of
the Planets may be gathered these 6 rules here folowing.</p>
                     <p>1. First, that the three vpper Planets, the Moone, and
also the fixed starres are subject to the true rising &amp; set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
as well Matutine as Vespertine; but neither the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
rising Vespertine, nor the apparent setting Matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
doe belong to any of them, but only to the Moone,
which notwithstanding suffereth neither the apparent ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
Matutine, nor the apparent rising Vespertine.</p>
                     <p>2. Secondly, though Venus and Mercurie be subject
to the apparent rising and setting, as well Matutine as
Vespertine, yet they cannot haue the true Matutine set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
or the true Vespertine rising.</p>
                     <p>3. Thirdly, of all the fixed starres and of the three vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Planets, their true rising and setting Matutine, are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their apparent rising and setting Matutine: but their
true Vespertine rising and setting are after their apparent
rising and setting.</p>
                     <p>4. Fourthly, in the two inferior Planets, that is, Venus
and Mercurie, their apparent Matutine and Vespertine
rising are after their true Matutine and Vespertine set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting;
but their apparent Matutine and Vespertine setting
are before their true Matutine and Vespertine rising.</p>
                     <p>5. Fiftly, the apparent Matutine rising of the Moone
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:17994:84"/>
doth follow her true Matutine rising, and contrarie her
apparent Matutine setting, doth go before her true Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutine
setting.</p>
                     <p>6. Sixtly, it is meet that there bee some distance of
space betwixt any starre and the Sunne, whereby they
should either appeare to bee out of the beames of the
Sunne, or else to be hidden vnder the Sunne.</p>
                     <p>And this distance is not of like quantitie in euery
starre, but varieth according to the greatnesse or little<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the starre, for the greater and more lightsome
that the starre is, the lesser time it staies vnder the beams
of the Sunne. And the limits of the quantitie of distance
that do belong to euery starre, as well to the fixed starres
as to the Planets, are to be found in a great circle, passing
both through the bodie of the Sunne, and also through
the pole of the Horizon. For to euery limit the Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomers
doe appoint his proper arch of quantitie, called
of them the arch of vision.</p>

                  <div type="section">
                     <head>Define what that arch is.</head>
                     <p>THe Arch of Vision, is that portion of the Verticall
circle that is comprehended betwixt the Horizon
and the Sunne, at such time as the starre first beginneth
to appeare, or els ceaseth to bee seene: which arches of
vision in fixed starres are greater or lesser, according to
the magnitude of the said starres, for to those starres,
that be of the first bignesse, they make the arch of vision
to containe 12 degrees, and to those of the second big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
13 degrees, and to those of the third bignesse 14
degrees, and to those of the fourth bignesse 15 degrees,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:17994:85"/>
and to those of the fift bignesse, 16 degrees, and to those
of the sixt bignesse 17 degrees, and to the least fixed stars
of all, they appoint 18 degrees, which 18 degrees is the
beginning as well of the day light in the morning, as of
the twilight in the euening: for when the Sunne is depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from the Horizon 18 degrees, either vpward or
downeward, it beginneth to waxe day light in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
or twilight in the euening. Now as touching the
quantitie of the said arch of vision belonging to euery
one of the fiue Planets, they appoint to Saturne 11 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
to Iupiter 10 degrees, to Mars 11 degrees, ½. to
Venus 5 degrees, and to Mercurie 10 degrees: so as by

<figure/>
                     </head>
                     <p>THis figure as you see consisteth of two whole cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
being of like greatnesse, and also it containeth
the portion of a great circle. The whole circle,
marked with G E C, signifieth the Horizon, whose
pole or Zenith is marked with the letter A: and the other
whole circle, marked with the letters F E D, signifieth
the Eclipticke, whose pole is marked with the letter B:
and the letter D sheweth the place of the Sunne, being
hidden beneath the Horizon. And imagine the place of
the starre his appearing or departing to be in C, in the
very Horizon it selfe. Now the portion of the great cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
drawne through the Verticall point of the Horizon,
and also through the bodie of the Sunne, is marked with
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:17994:86"/>
the letters A C D. And the arch C D is the arch of
vision. But now you haue to vnderstand, that the Moone
obserueth not like law or order of hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> appearing, after
that she hath been in Conjunction with the Sunne. For
though the auncient Astronomers, as <hi>Theon, Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drinus,
Alfraganius, Albategnus,</hi> and others, doe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
to her arch of vision twelue degrees of the Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall,
yet that is not alwaies certaine, but sometime
more, and sometime lesse, sith the Moone doth shew her
selfe sometime sooner and sometime later after her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
with the Sunne, and that for three causes or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects,
first by reason of the inclination of the Zodiake to
the Horizon, for whilest she is in the ascending halfe of
the Zodiake, which is from the beginning of Capricorn
to the end of Gemini, which is the halfe of long discen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
she appeareth sooner aboue the Horizon, than
when she is in the other halfe of short discension, which
is from Cancer to Capricorne, because the Moone go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
downe later and not before that the Sunne be deeply
hidden vnder the Horizon, making thereby a greater
twilight. The second cause is the latitude of the Moone
from the Ecliptick, for the more North latitude she hath,
the more slowly she goeth downe, and therby is the soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
seene, and specially to those that dwell betwixt the
Tropicke of Cancer, and the circle Artique. The third
cause is the swiftnesse of her true mouing, for in her swift
mouing she is sooner seene than in her slow moouing.
And when all those three causes do concurre, it is possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that she may bee seene the selfesame day that the
change is, albeit that seldome chanceth, and that onely
in those places, whose latitude is very farre Northerne.
But if two of the foresaid causes doe concurre, then she
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:17994:86"/>
may be seene the next day after her Conjunction with
the Sunne: if there be no more but one cause, then she
is commonly seene the third day after the change. But if
she be in the descending halfe of the Zodiake, and haue
therewith South latitude, and is slow of gate, there may
passe foure daies before she appeareth. Here also it is
meet to speake of the diuersitie of her shape, according
as she is distant from the Sunne, as well in her increase
as decrease: for during her increase, shee followeth the
Sunne, and turneth her hornes from the Sunne towards
the East, and her lightsome part to the Sunne, and riseth
aboue the Horizon immediatly after the Sunne is set.
But during her decrease, which is from the full vnto the
change, she goeth before the Sunne, and turneth her
hornes towards the West, and riseth in the morning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Sunne. And as for the diuers names which she
hath both in Greeke and Latine, according to hir diuers
aspects to the Sunne, are plainly set down before in a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
made by <hi>Reinholdus,</hi> which table immediatly follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

because I thinke it superfluous to repeat it againe
here. Notwithstanding loe here the figure which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly

well in her encrease as decrease.</p>

THis figure as you see is made like a Quadrant: the
nether right line whereof, commonly called the
Base, signifieth the Horizon, and the perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
right line falling vpon the same, and making there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
a right angle, is the axletree of the Horizon: and
the said right angle, marked with the letter A, signifieth
the centre of the earth, whose halfe globe, made like a
halfe circle, is drawne vpon the said centre, and the short
line, marked with the letters A B, signifieth the semidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameter
of the earth, &amp; the letter F signifieth the Zenith,
from which F to G is drawn the arch of the Quadrant,
signifying here the Verticall circle. And you haue to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:17994:88"/>
that the right line that is drawn from A throgh
the bodie of the Moone, marked with the letter C vnto
the point D, set downe in the arch of the Quadrant or
Verticall circle, sheweth the true place of the Moone:
and the right line drawne from B, through the bodie of
the Moone vnto the point of the foresaid arch, marked
with E, sheweth the apparent place of the Moone visible
to our sight from the vpper face of the earth: and the
little arch contained betwixt D and E, is the Parallax
or diuersitie of Aspects. And you haue to note, that
the apparent or visible place of the Moone is alwayes
lower in the heauen, than her true place, vnlesse the
Moone doe chance to be in the right line of the Zenith,
for then there is no Parallax at all, because both the lines
and places do concurre and meet in one, as the two lines
A B and B F doe shew, making both one selfe line: and
the further that the Moone is distant from the earth, the
lesser is the Parallax, and the nigher that shee is to the
earth, the greater Parallax she hath. But the true quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of her Parallax in euery place is to be learned by the

Astronomers doe make the Parallax of the Moone to
be threefold, that is, first simple, then according to lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude,
and thirdly according to latitude. For if you haue
onely respect to the Verticall circle, then it is said to be

compared together.</head>
                     <p>TO doe this, it is first necessarie to know what the 90
degree of the Moon is, which is a point in the Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke,
deuiding that semicircle of the Eclipticke, which is
aboue the Horizon, into two equall Quadrants, and is in
the very middest of the said semicircle betwixt East and
West: and this point is readily found by helpe of a cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiall
globe, in manner and forme following. For first ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
set the globe at our latitude, which is 52, suppose
the Moone to be in the first point of Taurus: here if you
bring that point to the mouable Meridian, you shal find,
that the 17 of Leo then riseth aboue the Horizon, and
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:17994:90"/>
that the 17 of Aquarius goeth downe beneath the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon,
which is the one halfe of the Eclipticke; of which
halfe, by counting 90 degrees from the East point, that
is, from the 17 of Leo, and so forward, you shall find,
that the 17 of Taurus is the middle point or 90 degree,
and the same to be nigher to the South than to the East.
Now how to compare together the two foresaid Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxes,
these fiue rules following doe shew.</p>
                     <p>1. First, if the Moon be in the 90 degree of the Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke
aboue the Horizon, then there is no Parallax of
longitude, but only of latitude.</p>
                     <p>2. Secondly, when the Eclipticke passeth through the
Zenith, there is no Parallax of latitude, but onely of
longitude.</p>
                     <p>3. Thirdly, when the Eclipticke passeth not through
the Zenith, the two foresaid Parallaxes shall be differing
one from another, and shall not fall one into another.</p>
                     <p>4. Fourthly, to those that haue more latitude than 30
degrees, the Moone alwaies appeareth more to the
South, because her Parallaxes doe alwaies fall more
Southerly.</p>
                     <p>5. Fiftly, the Moone from her rising vntill she come
to the 90 degree, appeareth more Eastward: but from
the 90 degree to her setting, she appeareth more West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
as the globe plainely sheweth.</p>

                     <p>YOu shall know this by obseruing the hornes of the
Moon, for if both the tips of the horns of the Moon
doe rightly hang one ouer another by a perpendicular

line, then the Moone is in the 90 degree of the Ecliptick
aboue the Horizon: but if the vpper horne doe more
encline to the East than the nether horne doth, then the
Moone is short of the 90 degree. But if the vpper horn
be more to the West, then the Moone is past the 90
degree.</p>
                     <p>And here I end with the description of the Parallax,
and all the kinds thereof: minding now to treat of the

of their light from the sight of vs that dwell here vpon
the earth: but first wee will treat of the Eclipse of the
Moone, and shew how and when it chanceth. The Moon
hauing no light of it selfe, but onely from the Sunne, is
neuer eclipsed, but when the earth is betwixt her and the
Sunne, which cannot chance, but when the Moone is at
the full, and diametrally opposit to the Sunne: and also
when such Opposition is either in the head or taile of the
Dragon, or somewhat nigh therunto, which are nothing
els but two sections of two circles, that is, the Eclipticke
and the deferent of the Moone, cutting one another in
two opposite points, otherwise called the two Nodes,
which are before described in the Theorique of the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:17994:91"/>
Moone, and are also plainely declared in the first part of
my sphere, chap. 15. But for so much as there be many
other needfull things to be knowne touching those two
Eclipses, I mind here to treat thereof more at large.</p>
                     <p>And first of the Eclipse of the Moone, shewing first
the causes why her eclipse is not alwaies after one maner.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, what shape the shaddow of the earth hath
at the time of her Eclipse, and how many kinds of shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes
there be.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, how many waies she may be said to be eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
either totally or in part.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, which be the bounds, within which she be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the full, may be eclipsed.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly, how many points or digits she may be eclipsed.</p>
                     <p>Sixtly, what things are to be considered touching the
durance or continuance of her Eclipse, &amp; how they are
defined. And lastly, at what part the Moone beginneth
to bee eclipsed, and from what part her light is to her
againe restored.</p>
                     <p>The causes why the Eclipse of the Moone is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
after one maner, but variable as well in magnitude
as in continuance, are these foure here following.</p>
                     <p>1. The first cause is the vnequall latitude of the Moon,
for sometime her latitude is very little or nothing at all,
and then is her eclipse greater in magnitude, and longer
in continuance: and sometime her latitude is so great,
that she commeth but a very little within the shaddow
of the earth, and thereby looseth but a small portion of
her light: and sometimes she commeth not within the
compasse of the shaddow of the earth at all, and so she is
not eclipsed. For this is a generall rule, that when the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of the Moone, at the time of the true Opposition
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:17994:92"/>
of the Moone and Sunne is lesser than the summe of the
two semidiameters, that is, of the shaddow and of the
Moones bodie, being added together, there will be an
Eclipse of the Moone. And the greater and more that
the excesse of those two semidiameters of the Moon and
of the shaddow is than her latitude, the greater and lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
will the Eclipse be. And if the summe of those two
semidiameters bee just equall vnto the latitude of the
Moone, then she shall onely touch the shaddow, and so
passe without any Eclipse.</p>
                     <p>2. The second cause of the change or variable shape
of the eclipse of the Moone, is the vnequall thickenesse
of the shaddow of the earth: for the higher that the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of the earth ariseth, the more narrow it groweth, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
with a sharpe point, because the bodie of the Sun
is greater than the bodie of the earth, and therefore the
shaddow cannot be of any other shape than Conicall:
for there be three kinds of shaddowes, that is, Conicall,
Cylindricall, and Calathoidall. The shaddow Conicall
is that which endeth with a sharpe point. The Cylindri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
is of like bignesse euerywhere, like a round pillar.
And the Calathoidall shadow, the further it extendeth,
the greater it is, like a cup or bowle, that is narrow at the
bottome and broad at the brim; of which shape that
shaddow taketh his name, for <hi>Calathos</hi> in Greeke is as
much to say as a cup: as these three figures doe plainely
shew.</p>

<figure/>
                     </head>
                     <p>ANd it is to be noted, that when the Moone is in the
lower part of her Epicicle neare vnto the opposite
Auge thereof, her Eclipse continueth longer than it
doth when she is neer vnto the Auge of her said Epicicle.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="178" facs="tcp:17994:93"/>3. The third cause is the variable thickenesse of the
shaddow which the earth yeeldeth, according as the Sun
is either in the Auge or opposit Auge of his Excentrick,
as you may easily perceiue by this figure following, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
of three circles and certaine right lines.</p>
                     <p>
                        <figure/>
IN which figure, each one of
the two vpper circles signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the bodie of the Sunne:
and the little circle made halfe
blacke, signifieth the bodie of
the earth. Suppose then the
point C in the vpper circle to
signifie the centre of the Sunnes
bodie, being in his Auge: and
the point F in the second circle
to be the centre of his body, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the opposit Auge of his
Excentrique: and suppose the
letters H G to be the diameter
of the earth: and the letter I to
be the centre of the earth. Here
you see, that when the Sunne is
in C, the shaddow extendeth
further with his sharpe point,
than when the Sunne is in F;
for then the foresaid shaddow
endeth at the point L, and so
the shaddow is shorter and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower.
For if the outermost lines
A G, and B H, touching the
earth, be drawne out in length,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:17994:93"/>
they will meet in the point K, making the shaddow to be
G H K, whose axletree is the middle line I K, determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the letters C I K. But if the two right lines D G
and E H be drawne out, they will meet in the point L,
so as the axletree of the shaddow shall be I L, which is
shorter than the axletree I K: and therefore the Moone
being in the beginning of her Eclipse in the point M,
and hauing to passe to N, findeth the shaddow to bee
thicker when the Sunne is in the Auge of his Excen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trique,
than when he is in the opposit Auge thereof, and
thereby the Eclipse of the Moone is then both greater,
and continueth longer. To know the exact quantitie of
such shaddow at any time is to be learned by the Prut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall
tables.</p>
                     <p>4. The fourth cause of the varietie of her Eclipses is
her vnequall mouing in her true motion, either swift or
slow, for when she is in her swift motion, the continuance
of her Eclipse must needs be shorter than when she is in
her slow motion. And to know her hourely motion, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
meane or true, is to be found by the Prutenicall
tables.</p>
                     <p>But now though her Eclipse be thus variable, as you
see, yet such varietie may be brought into two cheefe
heads, that is, when she is said to be totally, or partly, eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;
whereof we come now to speake.</p>
                     <p>The totall Eclipse of the Moone is twofold, that is, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
without any continuance of time, or els with some
continuance of time. In the former, so soone as she hath
lost her whole light, she presently beginneth to recouer
the same again: but in the latter, she being wholly eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
the same continueth some quantitie of time. The
first way chanceth when the latitude of the Moone and
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:17994:94"/>
the semidiameter of her bodie being both added toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the summe thereof is equall vnto the semidiameter
of the earth, as this figure plainely sheweth.</p>

for the letters B D doe represent the semidiameter of
the shaddow of the earth, when the Moone is eclipsed:
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:17994:94"/>
and B K sheweth the latitude of the Moone from the
Eclipticke, which Eclipticke is marked with the letters A
C. Now K D signifieth the semidiameter of the Moons
bodie, and the letter I sheweth the centre of her bodie
in the beginning of her Eclipse, and the letter H the
centre of her body at the end of her Eclipse. And the
right line I K H signifieth the way of the Moon during
the time of her Eclipse. Here for so much as the two se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midiameters
D K, and K B, being both added toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
are equall vnto B D, which is the semidiameter of

when she is wholly eclipsed, and the same continueth

Thus much touching the Totall Ecllipse of the Moone,
now we will speake of the Partiall Eclipse of the Moone.
The Partiall Eclipse is when some part of the Moone is
darkened, and not the whole: and of this Partiall Eclipse
there are three sorts. The first is, when halfe of the
Moones diameter is darkened, and the other halfe kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth
still her light, which happeneth when the latitude of
the Moone is equall vnto the semidiameter of the shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow

                     <p>THe limits are most certainely knowne by the lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of the Moone at the time of her true opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

the Moone by the Prutenicall tables, or otherwise, to be
more than the summe of the semidiameters of the shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow

will be no Eclipse at that full, but if the latitude of the
Moone be lesse than the summe of the two said semidia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meters
added together, you may be sure, that the Moon
will be eclipsed at her full: so that the tearmes or bounds
of the Eclipses are knowne by comparing the latitude
of the Moone with the summe of the foresaid two semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diameters
being added together. The least summe of
which two semidiameters, that is to say, of the Moone
and of the shaddow of the earth is <hi rend="sup">i53</hi>· <hi rend="sup">ii53</hi>· which is, when

greatnesse of her Eclipses is vsually reckoned by digits,

                     <p>THe continuance of the Eclipse is that space of time
which she spendeth in going from the very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Eclipse to the middest of the same, whereas
she is most darkened. And these fiue things are woont
therin to be considered, that is, the minutes of Incidence,
the minutes of the halfe continuance, the time of Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
the time of halfe continuance, and the halfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
it selfe.</p>
                     <p>1. And first you haue to note, that the minutes of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidence
are accounted in partiall Eclipses after one way,
and in totall Eclipses with continuance another way: for
in partiall Eclipses &amp; also in totall Eclipses without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance,
the minutes of Incidence are said to be the arch
of the Moones way which she maketh in her mouing of
longitude from the beginning of her Eclipse to the midst
thereof, where she is fully darkened, as appeareth by the
third, fourth, and fift figures of partiall Eclipses before set
down: in all which, the point L signifieth the place of the
Moone at the beginning of her Eclipse, and the point D
the place of the Moon at the middle of her Eclipse. Now
the arch of her way from L to D, is called the minutes of
Incidence, for so long her light decreaseth by little and
little, vntill so much be taken away, as can be in any of
those partiall Eclipses. But if the Eclipse be totall, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any continuance, as in the first figure, then the way of
her motion in going from the point I vnto the point K,
where she is wholly darkened, is called the scruples of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidence.
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:17994:99"/>
But if the totall Eclipse haue any continuance,
then the minutes or scruples of Incidence are that porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Ecliptick, throgh which the Moon goeth from
the very beginning of her Eclipse, vntill the time that she
be wholly eclipsed, as in the second &amp; last figures the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
I signifieth the point, in which the Moon is at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of her Eclipse, and M the point in which she is
fully darkened: and the arch I M is called the minutes or
scruples of Incidence, and these minutes in the end of the
Eclipse are called minutes of repletion, as in the third,
fourth, and fift figures, the arch of the Moons way, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
D M, or K H in the first figure, or L H in the second
and last figures, doe shew: which minutes of repletion are
reckoned from the very time of the beginning of her
clearing vnto the time that she hath fully recouered her
whole light: and the minutes or scruples of repletion are
equall to the minutes or scruples of Incidence.</p>
                     <p>2. The second thing which is considered in accounting
of the continuance of Eclipses, is the scruples of halfe
continuance, which is nothing els but the arch which the
Moone maketh in going from the Sunne, from the time
of her whole darkenesse vnto the very middle of the
Eclipse: from which middle Eclipse, the Moone going
still forward vntill she begin againe to recouer her light,
the said arch is called the scruples of Emersion, as in the
second and last figures the arch M D doth shew, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
M representeth the place in which shee looseth her
whole light, vntill she come to the point D, which signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
her place when she is in the middle of her Eclipse,
or in her diametrall Opposition to the Sunne. And this
is called the scruples of halfe continuance: but the arch
of her motion from D to L, where she beginneth again
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:17994:100"/>
to receiue her light, is called the minutes of Emersion,
and these minutes of Emersion are equall vnto the scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of halfe continuance, as the scruples of Repletion
were equall vnto the minutes of Incidence.</p>
                     <p>3. The third thing to be considered in accounting the
Eclipse of the Moon, is the time of Incidence: which is
nothing els but the very time which the Moon spendeth
in going of the minutes of Incidence, or the time of Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
is that portion of time which the Moon spendeth
in mouing from the beginning of the Eclipse vnto the
point where she is most darkened (if the Eclipse be parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all)
as in the third, fourth, and fift figures, the time which
the Moone spendeth in her mouing from the point L,
where she beginneth to bee eclipsed vnto the point D,
where her darkenesse is greatest, is called the time of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidence.
Likewise if the Eclipse be totall, the time which
shee spendeth in moouing from the beginning of the
Eclipse, vnto the point in which she is wholly obscured,
as in the first figure the time which she spendeth vnto her
mouing from the point I vnto the point K, so the time
which she spendeth in going from I to D, in the second
and last figures is called the time of Incidence.</p>
                     <p>4. The fourth thing to be considered, is the time of
halfe continuance, which is that quantitie of time which
the Moone spendeth in her moouing from the point in
which she looseth her whole light, vnto the point of the
middle Eclipse, as in the second and last figures the time
which she spendeth in going from the point M to the
point D, is called the time of halfe continuance. And
the time which she spendeth in her mouing from D to
L, in the said second and last figures is called the time of
her Emersion: which time is equall vnto the time of
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:17994:100"/>
halfe continuance, sauing that the variable motion of
the Moone beeing swifter in the one than in the other,
may make a little difference, which in so short a time
cannot be sensible. And in like manner, the time of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion
is equall vnto the time of Incidence, vnlesse the
varietie of her motion doe make a little vnsensible dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.</p>
                     <p>5. The last thing that is to be considered in the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
of the Eclipse, is the half time of durance, which
is nothing els but the time which the Moone spendeth
in going from the point in which she began to be eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
vnto the point of the middle Eclipse: and this time
is equall to the time of Incidence in Partiall Eclipses, as
in the third, fourth, and fifth figures, the time which she
spendeth in going from L to D, is the time of halfe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance:
and likewise the time which she spendeth in her
mouing from I to K in the first figure, is the time of
halfe durance: but if the Eclipse be totall with continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
then is the time of halfe durance equall vnto the
time of Incidence, and also to the time of halfe continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
being both added together.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, you haue to note, that the Eclipse of
the Moone dooth alwayes begin on the East side of her
bodie (I call that the East side which is towards the East)
for sith that her motion is from West to East, and that
very swift, in respect of the Sunne or of the shaddow of
the earth, it must needs follow, that the East side of her
bodie first toucheth the shaddow in the beginning of
her Eclipse, and so continueth her mouing through the
said shaddow, leauing the same behind her on the West
side of her bodie. And although that this be true in all
Eclipses of the Moone, yet in partiall Eclipses, if the lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:17994:101"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> if the Moone be North, then is the South part of
her bodie darkened, but if her latitude be South, then is
the North part of her bodie darkened. And note, that
whensoeuer any Eclipse doth happen the said Eclipse
may be seene of all them, aboue whose Horizon she is
in the time of her Eclipse, and that at one selfe instant or
moment of time, be it the beginning, middle, or ending
of any such Eclipse: but it is not so in the Eclipse of the
Sunne, neither can any other of the Planers be eclipsed
or darkened by the shaddow of the earth, because the
same shaddow reacheth not so high as any of the three
higher Planets are: and as for Venus and Mercurie, their
place is alwaies so nigh vnto the place of the Sunne, as
they cannot be eclipsed at any time.</p>
                     <p>Thus much touching the Eclipse of the Moone, and
now I will speake of the Eclipse of the Sunne.</p>

                     <p>THe Eclipse of the Sunne is nothing but the darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
or depriuing of his light from our sight, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by the interposition of the bodie of the Moon
betwixt the bodie of the Sunne and the bodie of the
earth: and this Eclipse neuer happeneth but when the
Moone and the Sunne are in a visible Conjunction. For
you haue to note, that there be three kinds of Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
that is, meane, true and visible, or apparent to our
sight. What the meane and true Conjunction is, hath
been before defined: and it is called a visible Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
when a right line being drawn from our eye or sight,
passeth through the centre of the Moone vnto the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre
of the Sunne, whereby the said two Planets appeare

                        </gap>,
that is to say, in one selfe point of the Eclipticke. For
although that the centre of the Moone bee betwixt the
centre of the Sunne and the centre of the earth at euery
true Conjunction, and also neere to any of the Nodes,
yet perhaps it shall appeare no Eclipse to our sight, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the two Planets be not in a visible Conjunction,
as haue been demonstrated before, when we did speake
of the Parallax, whereupon cheefely dependeth the
knowledge of the Eclipses: neither can the body of the
Moone, being farre lesser than the earth, possibly shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
at any time all the earth: and the body of the Sun
is farre bigger than either of them both, by reason
whereof, the Eclipse of the Sunne may chance to one
part of the earth, and not to another: neither can any
Eclipse of the Sunne or Moone chance, but when those
two Planets are either in the head or taile of the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,

both greater and lesser, and of certain right lines:
in which figure, the highest circle signifieth the
bodie of the Sunne, whose centre is marked with the
letter P: and the middle lesser circle beneath that, made
most part blacke, signifieth the bodie of the Moon eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
whose centre is marked with the letter C, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameter
thereof is marked with the letters L K: and the
lowest lesser circle representeth the bodie of the earth,

two circles, the one is called the deferent of the Moon,
and the other the Eclipticke. Now what the right lines
doe signifie, the letters doe shew: for the two outermost
right lines, F H, and G I, doe signifie the outermost
beames of the Sunne, which doe fall vpon the earth: but
the two inner lines F L, and G K, do signifie the beames
of the Sunne which do fall vpon the Moone: which two

<pb n="198" facs="tcp:17994:103"/>
that those people which haue their dwelling betwixt D

those that dwell betwixt E and I, or betwixt D and H, do

THis figure as you see consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth
of three circles and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
right lines: of which circles,
the highest and greatest represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
the body of the Sunne, whose
centre is marked with P: and the
middle little circle, made almost
all blacke, signifieth the body of
the Moone, whose centre is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
with the letter C, and her se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midiameter
with C B, and her
whole diameter with L K, and the
small vpper portion of her bodie,
made white, is that which is ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened
by the Sunne, all the rest of
her bodie beeing darkened. The
third and lowest circle being grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

the body of the earth, whose
centre is marked with A, and the
semidiameter thereof with A E.
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:17994:103"/>
Now as touching the signification of the right lines, the
letters thereto belonging doe shew: for the outermost
lines marked with Q K, and O L, doe signifie the outer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
beames of the Sunne that doe fall vpon the bodie
of the Moone, concurring or meeting in the point I, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closing
the Conicall shaddow of the Moone, marked
with the letters L K I, the axletree of which Conicall
shaddow is the middle line C I, for to those that dwell
vpon the earth vnder the point I, the Sunne is totally
eclipsed, and to those that dwell vnder the point N, he
is partly eclipsed, and partly not, and to those that dwell
betwixt N and H, he is not eclipsed at all. Againe, the
Moone is not alwaies right vnder the Eclipticke line, as
the Sunne is, and therefore her shaddow at the time of
the Eclipse cannot point to the centre of the earth, as it
doth when she is in either of the two Nodes: but some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
Northward and sometime Southward from the
centre of the earth, according as her latitude is either
Northerly or Southerly: so likewise her said shaddow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
euery true Conjunction will point Eastward, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a true Conjunction Westward.</p>
                     <p>And further you haue to note, that the true and visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Conjunctions doe neuer happen together, except
the true Conjunction of the Sunne and Moone chance
to be in the 90 degree, which what it is, is before decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
for in the 90 degree there is no Parallax at all. But in
all other places, the true and visible places doe differ, and
the visible Conjunction is before the true Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
if the said true Conjunction be in the East part of
the Zodiake, that is, betwixt the Sunne rising and the 90
degree. But if the true Conjunction be in the West part
of the Zodiake, that is, betwixt the 90 degree and the
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:17994:104"/>
Sunne setting, then the true Conjunction is before the
visible Conjunction. And generally, the further that the
true Conjunction is from the 90 degree, the greater is
the difference betwixt the true Conjunction and the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Conjunction, which things are before fully decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
whereas I speake of the Parallax, and by help of the

                     <head>Of the varietie of the Solar Eclipses, and why they be not

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>de as in
time of continuance.</head>
                     <p>OF this varietie there be foure causes.</p>
                     <p>1. First, the vnequall apparent latitude of the
Moone: for the greater that the latitude of the Moon is,
the lesser and shorter is the Eclipse of the Sunne: but the
lesser that her latitude is, the greater and longer is the
Eclipse of the Sunne. For this is a generall true rule,
that if the apparent latitude of the Moone at the time
of the visible Conjunction be greater than the summe
of the two semidiameters of the Sun and of the Moone,
being both added together, then the Sunne shall not be
eclipsed at the visible Conjunction: but if the apparent
latitude of the Moone be lesse than the summe of the
two said semidiameters, being added together, then shal
the Sunne be eclipsed at that visible Conjunction: and
the greater that the difference betwixt the summe of the
two semidiameters, and the Moones latitude is, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is the Eclipse of the Sunne.</p>
                     <p>2. The second cause of the varieties of the Eclipse of
the Sunne, is the vnequall distance as well of the Sunne
as of the Moone, from the earth: for the changing of
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:17994:104"/>
their distances from the earth, maketh the diameters of
their bodies to appeare greater or lesser. For the neerer
that they approch to the earth, the greater do their dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meters
appeare vnto vs: for when the Sunne is in the
Auge of his Excentrique, and therewith in his greatest
excentricitie, the semidiameter of his shaddow is <hi rend="sup">i15°</hi> 
                        <hi rend="sup">ii40°</hi>
But if he be in his greatest excentricitie, and in the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posit
Auge of his Excentrique, then his semidiameter is
<hi rend="sup">i17°</hi> 
                        <hi rend="sup">ii2°</hi> which is greater than it was before by <hi rend="sup">i1°</hi> 
                        <hi rend="sup">ii22</hi>· And if
the Sunne be in his least excentricitie (as it is almost in
these our dayes) and also in his Auge, then his semidia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter
is <hi rend="sup">i15°</hi> 
                        <hi rend="sup">ii49°</hi> but being in the opposit Auge of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centrique,
then his semidiameters is <hi rend="sup">ii16</hi>· <hi rend="sup">i2°</hi> which is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than it was before by <hi rend="sup">i1°</hi> 
                        <hi rend="sup">ii3°</hi> Likewise, when the Moone
is in her Auge, whether it bee at her Conjunction with
the Sunne, or at her Opposition to the Sunne, her semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diameter
is but <hi rend="sup">i15°</hi> 
                        <hi rend="sup">ii0°</hi> but being in her opposit Auge, her
semidiameter will be <hi rend="sup">i17°</hi> 
                        <hi rend="sup">ii49°</hi> which is greater than it was
before by <hi rend="sup">i2°</hi> 
                        <hi rend="sup">ii49°</hi> whereby it happeneth, that sometime
the whole bodie of the Sunne seemeth to be darkened,
and at other times but some part of his bodie, and that
either at some side thereof, or els in the very middest of
his bodie, and then there appeareth round about him a
narrow bright circle, which we commonly call a bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough,
all the other part in the midst of his body being
darkened.</p>
                     <p>3. The third cause of the varietie of the Solar Eclipses,
is the twofold inequalitie of the Moones motion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the first dependeth vpon the motion of her Epicicle,
whereby she is sometimes swift, and sometimes slow of
ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e. And the second inequalitie of her motion happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
by reason of her Parallax, which maketh her moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:17994:105"/>
to appeare variable euery houre, and thereby her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
motion is also sometime swift &amp; sometimes slow.
And it happeneth, that not onely the time of the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
of the Eclipse altereth, but also the time of Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
is made to be vnequall vnto the time of repletion.</p>
                     <p>4. The fourth cause of the inequalitie of the Sunnes
Eclipses, is the small quantitie of the body of the Moon,
in respect of the Sunne, or of the Earth, and the small
distance of the Moone from the Earth: for by these two
meanes neither can the Solar Eclipses appeare of a like
bignesse in all places in which they may be seene, neither
yet can the said Eclipses be seene at one time in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the earth, as was shewed before. Lastly, by these two
meanes it happeneth that the Eclipse of the Sunne ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
not at one selfe time in diuers places, and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth
sooner to them which dwell Westward, than to
those which dwel Eastward, in such sort, as the said Eclipse
of the Sunne will be ended in one place before it begin
in another. And thus much touching the causes of the
varietie of the Eclipses of the Sunne.</p>

                     <p>ANd now that you know the seuerall kinds of Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
it will not be hard to judge which of them will
happen at the time of any Eclipse of the Sunne, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
if you know the bounds or limits within which the
Eclipse of the Sunne must needs be before hee can bee
eclipsed: which bounds cannot bee better determined,
than by the apparent latitude of the Moone; for if the
said latitude be more than the two semidiameters of the
Sunne and of the Moone being both added together, it
is impossible that the Sunne should be eclipsed at that
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:17994:107"/>
Conjunction: but if the apparent latitude be lesse than
the said two semidiameters, then may the Sun be eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed:
and the least summe of the two semidiameters of
the Sunne and Moone that can be (which is when both
the Sunne and Moone are in the Auges of their orbes,
and the Sunne in his greatest excentricitie) is <hi rend="sup">i30</hi>. <hi rend="sup">ii40</hi>. and
the greatest summe of the said two semidiameters that
can be, is but <hi rend="sup">i34</hi>. <hi rend="sup">ii1</hi>. from hence you may gather these
three rules here following.</p>
                     <p>1. First, if the apparent latitude of the Moone at the
time of the visible Conjunction be lesse than <hi rend="sup">i30</hi>. <hi rend="sup">ii40</hi>. it
cannot be but that the Sunne must be eclipsed.</p>
                     <p>2. Secondly, if the apparent latitude of the Moone at
the time of the visible Conjunction be more than <hi rend="sup">i30</hi>.
<hi rend="sup">ii40</hi>. and lesse than <hi rend="sup">i34</hi>. <hi rend="sup">ii31</hi>. it may bee that the Sunne shall
be eclipsed in some part at the time of the visible Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction.</p>
                     <p>3. Thirdly, if the apparent latitude of the Moone be
more than <hi rend="sup">i34</hi>. <hi rend="sup">ii51</hi>. the Sun cannot loose any of his light.
But <hi>Ptolomey</hi> determineth the said bounds of the Solar
Eclipses by the distance of the Moone from either of
the two Nodes: for if the Moon be distant from either of
the Nodes 20 degrees, <hi rend="sup">i40</hi>. towards the North, or 11 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
<hi rend="sup">i20</hi>. towards the South at the time of the meane
Conjunction, then it may fall out that the Sunne shall
be eclipsed: but if she be further distant from the said
Nodes at the time of the meane Conjunction, then can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
the Sunne be eclipsed. And note, that <hi>Ptolomey</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
the North bounds bigger than the Southerne
bounds, because of the Parallax. And this distance from
the Nodes may be reckoned either according to the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
or contrarie to the succession of the signes.</p>

                     <p>AS the Eclipticall digits of the Moone were 12, so

exceed 12 digits and 15 minutes: for the greatest appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
semidiameter of the Moon is but <hi rend="sup">i17</hi>. <hi rend="sup">ii49</hi>. and the least
apparent semidiameter of the Sunne is <hi rend="sup">i15</hi>. <hi rend="sup">ii40</hi>. which two
semidiameters if you adde together, the summe will be
<hi rend="sup">i33</hi>. <hi rend="sup">ii29</hi>. Then hauing doubled the least semidiameter of

by the rule of proportion, if <hi rend="sup">i31</hi>. <hi rend="sup">ii20</hi>. be equall to 12 digits,
to what or how much shall <hi rend="sup">i33</hi>. <hi rend="sup">ii29</hi>. be equall? so shal you
find the fourth proportionall number to be very neare
12 digits and 50 minutes: and this is the greatest number
of Eclipticall digits that any Eclipse of the Sunne can
haue. And this may happen when the Sunne is in the
Auge of his Excentrique, and in his greatest excentrici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:
and the Moone in her opposit Auge, and therewith
insuch places as are situated within the compasse of the
Moones shaddow, the diameter of which shaddow may

his Excentrique, and therewith in his least excentricitie,
the number of the Eclipticall digits can be no more but
11 degrees, and 15 minutes, so as the Sunne will appear
to haue lost his light in the very midst; and round about
that Eclipse will appeare a little circle as it were three

                     <p>IN accounting the continuance of the Eclipse of the
Sunne, the Astronomers doe only obserue two things.</p>
                     <p>1. The first is the scruples of Incidence, which are
nothing els but the way or arch of the circle of the
Moones deferent, in which she goeth from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Eclipse vnto the middle of the same: which
in the three last figures is signified by the line E F.</p>
                     <p>2. The second thing which they vsually obserue, is
the time of Incidence, which is nothing els but the
quantitie of time which the Moone spendeth whilest she
is in going of the said minutes of Incidence: both which
two things you shall easily find, as also the minutes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion,
by the 63 precept of the Prutenicall tables. And
as the Eclipse of the Moone doth begin on the East side
of her bodie and endeth on the West side thereof, euen
so the Eclipse of the Sunne beginneth on the West side
of his bodie, and endeth on the East; which happeneth
by the motion of the Moone, which motion is from
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:17994:109"/>
West to East: and if the Eclipse of the Sun be partiall,
and the apparent latitude of the Moone be North, then
is the North side of the Sunne eclipsed, and the South
side retaineth still his light: but if her apparent latitude
be South, then is the South side of the Sunne darkened,
and the North side keepeth still his light. And this is a
generall obseruation, that no Eclipse of the Sun is vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall
(except that which was against nature at the death
of Christ) but alwaies perticular, that is, it may be seene
in some few places, but not in all places of the world:
neither doth it begin or end in all places at one selfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
neither dooth it appeare in all places of one selfe
bignesse, or of one shape, but in one place is totall, and
in another place at the same time Partiall, and in other
places againe there appeareth no Eclipse at all. The cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses

                     <head>The Methodicall doctrine of the Eclipses, set downe by
Reinoldus in his Commentarie vpon Purbachius.</head>
                     <p>FIrst <hi>Ptolomey</hi> found out the true latitude of the
Moone, and deuided the same from her apparent
latitude, as he teacheth in the 12 chapter of his fift
booke: for in the Eclipses of the Moone it is very neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie
to haue knowledge both of her true latitude, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
of her apparent latitude, for the Eclipse of the Sunne
without hauing knowledge of her apparent latitude, and
of her Parallaxes, can neuer be well foreknowne: and by
this he did not only judge of other things, but also by a
Geometricall way found, that the greatest distance of
the Moon from the earth, she being either at the change
or at the full, did contain 64 semidiameters of the earth,
and one sixt part. Moreouer, by other obseruations hee
did know the proportions of the semidiameters, as well
of the Moones excentrique, and of her Epicicle, as also
of her excentricitie. Then by other obseruations hee
sought out the quantities of the apparent diameters of
the Sunne, of the Moone, and of the shaddow, as well at
the new Moone, as at the full, in manner and forme fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing:
for first by the helpe of an instrument, hauing a
Diopter, he found the Sunne and Moone to be in one
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:17994:110"/>
selfe angle when shee was most distant from the earth.
Then he attributed to the Moone two Eclipses, in the
one whereof, when her latitude was <hi rend="sup">i48</hi>. <hi rend="sup">ii30</hi>. the shaddow
darkened one quarter of her diameter: and in the other
Eclipse, the shaddow darkened the one halfe of her dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter,
when as her latitude was <hi rend="sup">i40</hi>. <hi rend="sup">ii40</hi>. and in either of
the Eclipses the Moone was very nigh to the height of
her Epicicle. Hereof it manifestly appeared, that a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the Moones diameter, when she was most distant
from the earth, contained in heauen according to our as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
<hi rend="sup">i57</hi>. <hi rend="sup">ii0</hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>. which being reckoned foure times, doe shew
that the diameter of the Moone was at that time <hi rend="sup">i31</hi>. <hi rend="sup">ii20</hi>.
whereunto the obserued diameter of the Sunne was then
equall: and the semidiameter of the shaddow in the later
Eclipse did appeare to be <hi rend="sup">i40</hi>. <hi rend="sup">ii40</hi>. for the centre of the
Moones body did then touch the outermost brim of the
shaddow. Hereby it likewise appeareth, that the diameter
of the shaddow hath such proportion to the diameter of
the Moones body, as 13 hath to 5, and keepeth the selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same
proportion in all other Eclipses of the Moone: and
though it most manifestly appeareth by this, that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameter
of the shadow doth exceed in greatnesse the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameter
of the Moone, yet it followeth not by &amp; by ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
that the Moone is lesser than the earth. Now therfore
<hi>Ptolomey</hi> by comparing according to the doctrine of
plaine triangles, the semidiameters of the Moone and of
the shadow together with the distance of the said Moon,
being measured by the semidiameters of the earth, hee
found the semidiameter of the Moone only to containe
<hi rend="sup">i17</hi>. <hi rend="sup">ii•3</hi>. and the semidiameter of the shaddow to contain
<hi rend="sup">i45</hi>. and <hi rend="sup">ii38</hi>. such like minutes, I say, as the semidiameter
of the earth hath 60. And therefore it appeareth hereby,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:17994:110"/>
that either of the semidiameters, that is, of the Moon, or
of the shaddow, is lesse than the semidiameter of the
earth: for the semidiameter of the earth is almost in like
proportion to the semidiameter of the shaddow, as 4 is
to 3, and being compared to the semidiameter of the
Moone, it is almost in such proportion, as 17 is to 5:
whereof it followeth necessarily, that the shaddow of the
earth is Conicall, that is, round, growing to a sharpe
point, and therefore the Sunne must needs be greater
than the earth. Neither could any right judgement haue
been made touching the quantities of the said three bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
that is, the Sunne, the Moone, and the earth, vnlesse
that the Parallaxes of the Moone had first shewed the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the Moone from the earth, the said distance
being measured by the semidiameters of the earth. For
if you suppose the distance betwixt the Moone and the
earth to be 48 semidiameters of the earth, you shall find
that the semidiameter of the shaddow will be altogether
equall to the semidiameter of the earth, and so the shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
shall be Cylindricall, that is to say, in all parts round
like a pillar. And if you suppose the said distance of the
Moone from the earth to be greater, as to be 170 semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diameters
of the earth, then the semidiameter of the
shaddow (the Moone being in <hi>Transit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>
                        </hi>) will contain two
semidiameters of the earth, and so the shaddow shall be
Calathoidall, that is to say, like a cup or top, extending
together with his length in breadth and widenesse more
and more infinitely. All which three shapes of shaddows
are before plainely set forth in their figures. By this <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomey</hi>
doth proue, that the distance of the Sun from the
centre of the earth, containeth 1270 semidiameters of
the earth, and that the semidiameter of the Suns bodie
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:17994:111"/>
containeth fiue such semidiameters and a halfe, as the
earth hath, and that the diameter of the Sun to the dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter
of the earth is in such proportion as is 11 to 2. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
he proueth the axletree of the shaddow to contain
268 such semidiameters as the earth hath. Wherefore
according to the opinion of <hi>Ptol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>mey,</hi> the excentricitie
of the Sunne should containe 48 semidiameters of the
earth, and almost one fourth part. Now by knowing the
diameters of the three bodies, it is easie to find out their
proportions: for by the last proposition of <hi>Euclide</hi> his
twelfth booke, looke what proportion is betwixt the dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meters
of any two spheres, the same proportion beeing
tripled, is the proportion betwixt the said two spheres.
And therefore because the diameter of the Sunne is to
the diameter of the earth in like proportion, as 11 is to 2,
the same proportion being tripled, shall be 1331 to 8, so
as the body of the Sunne doth containe the body of the
earth 166 times and almost one halfe. In like maner you
shall find the bodie of the Moone to be almost the 40
part of the body of the earth: for the diameter of the
earth to the diameter of the Moon is in such proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as is 17 to 5, so as the body of the earth containeth
the body of the Moone almost 40 times, as was said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
And the body of the Sunne containeth the bodie
of the Moone almost 6600 times. The proportions of
which three bodies are these numbers here following,
that is to say, for the Sunne 6539203, and for
the Earth 39304, and for the

                     <p>THe first mouable is the greatest or highest heauen,
which carieth all the inferior heauens round about
from East to West in 24 houres. The concaue su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies
whereof is imagined to be traced with certaine
circles, whereof some be greater and some lesser.</p>
                     <p>2. The greater circles cheefely seruing for our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
are these, the Aequinoctiall, the Eclipticke, and the
two Colures, the one called the Colure of the Equino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xes,
and the other the Colure of the Solstices.</p>
                     <p>3. The Aequinoctiall is a great circle supposed to be
in the convex superficies of the first mouable, deuiding
the same superficies into two equall parts, the poles of
which circle are the poles of the world, vpon which poles
the said first mouable continually mooueth, making his
reuolution in 24 houres.</p>
                     <p>4. The Eclipticke of the first mouable is also a great
circle, deuiding the superficies thereof into two equall
parts, &amp; cutteth the Aequinoctiall in two opposit points,
which points are called the Equinoxes, one of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
called the Vernall Equinox, and the other the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumnall
Equinox: and the poles of this Eclipticke are
alwaies distant from the poles of the world 23 degrees,
<hi rend="sup">i40</hi>· and doe neuer alter. And this Eclipticke is called the
meane Eclipticke.</p>
                     <p>5. The Colure of the Equinoxes, is a great circle
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:17994:112"/>
passing through the two Equinoxes, and the two poles
of the world.</p>
                     <p>6. The Colure of the Solstices, is also a great circle
deuiding the superficies of the first moouable into two
equall parts, and is drawne both through the poles of
the world, and also through the poles of the meane
Eclipticke.</p>

                     <p>THe tenth Heauen is a great Orbe next vnto the
first mouable, hauing contrarie motion to the first
moouable, that is, from West to East vpon the
poles of the Eclipticke of the first moouable or meane
Eclipticke, and maketh his reuolution in 3434 Aegyptian
yeares, and 10 daies.</p>
                     <p>2. In this heauen are imagined to be described such
like greater circles, as are before described in the first
mouable: for the Aequinoctiall of this heauen and the
two Colures are in one selfe plaine, right vnder the Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctiall
and Colures of the first moouable: but the
Eclipticke of this heauen is mouable, by reason of the
vnstabilitie of the poles of the Eclipticke of the said
tenth sphere: for the better vnderstanding of which vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stabilitie,
<hi>Maginus</hi> setteth downe this figure.

                        <figure/>
                     </p>
                     <p>In which, imagine the letter A to be the pole of the
meane Eclipticke of the first moouable, and also the
pole of the tenth heauen, about which pole the tenth
sphere maketh his reuolution in 3434 Aegyptian yeares,
and 10 daies. And vpon the point A imagine also a
lesser circle to be drawne, whose semidiameter is A B,
containing in length <hi rend="sup">i•</hi>° and imagine the same lesser cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
to be the circle B D F, in the circumference where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
suppose the centre of another lesser circle equall to
that, to be placed in the point D, and let the semidiame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the said second lesser circle be D E, containing in
length <hi rend="sup">i6</hi>· the centre of which second circle, <hi>viz.</hi> D, you
must suppose neuer to change his place, but to mooue
about the pole A, as the tenth heauen mooueth about
the same pole A. And so likewise suppose the second lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
circle A H E to be fastened to the first, so as the said
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:17994:113"/>
second circle hath no other motion but that which the
centre D hath, and imagine the right perpendicular line
C G to be part of the Solisticiall colure of the first mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uable;
which Colure the circumference of the second
little circle A H E will cut in some one point or other,
as in the point H, the place of which intersection where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
that happeneth vpon the line C G, is the pole of
the Eclipticke of the tenth heauen, whose pole doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
alter his place, and therefore the place of the
Eclipticke of the said tenth heauen, must needs alter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sometimes farre from the meane Eclipticke, and
sometimes neare vnto it, and sometimes vnited there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.
But the greatest distance that can be betwixt the
two Ecliptickes, is <hi rend="sup">i12</hi>· according to the greatest distance
which is betwixt the poles of the Eclipticke, &amp; the poles
of the first moouable: for the poles of the Eclipticke of
the tenth heauen can neuer exceed <hi rend="sup">i12</hi>· and the Ecliptick
of this tenth heauen is called the true Eclipticke, whose
poles doe differ from the poles of the meane Eclipticke
<hi rend="sup">i12</hi>· as haue been said before.</p>
                     <p>3. And such distance is called the equacion of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquitie
of the Eclipticke, which the former figure doth
plainely demonstrate: for the letter A is supposed to be
the pole of the meane Eclipticke, and H the pole of the
true Eclipticke: and this equacion of the obliquitie is to
be found in the 16 Cannon of the Prutenicall tables, by
helpe of which equacion or Prosthapherisis, you may
find at any time the obliquitie of the true Eclipticke, as
is taught in the 13 precept of the said tables. But now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the said Prosthapherisis cannot bee found but by
the Anomalia of the obliquitie, you are to know first
what that Anomalia is, which the foresaid figure dooth
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:17994:114"/>
also shew. In which figure, you must suppose the right
line A E to be the diameter of the second lesser circle,
the one end whereof is alwaies fixed in the point A: and
the other end marked with E, by the motion of the tenth
heauen, describeth the great circle C E G.</p>
                     <p>4. And this circle is called the circle of Anomalia of
the obliquitie of the true Eclipticke.</p>
                     <p>5. And the arch or portion of this circle, marked
with the letters C E, is the Anomalia of the obliquitie
of the true Eclipticke: the motion of which Anomalia
you shall find at any time by the Prutenicall tables in the
14 Cannon vnder the title <hi>Anomalia Aequinoctiorum</hi> in

                     <p>In this sphere are imagined certaine circles both

but the greater circles whereof we shall haue most
vse, are these, that is, the Eclipticke and the Aequinoctiall.</p>
                     <p>2. The Eclipticke of this ninth sphere is alwaies in
the plane of the Eclipticke of the tenth sphere, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
doth not differ from the true Eclipticke, because it
neuer swarueth from the same: but the Aequinoctiall

line of this ninth sphere is mouable, according as the
two Aequinoctiall points in which it crosseth the true
Eclipticke, are moouable, being caried both backward

the Aequinoctiall points of the tenth heauen, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
againe are remooued from the said true Aequino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiall

                     <p>The motion of which Aequinoctiall points, and also

this figure here following.
<figure/>
                     </p>
                     <p>IN which, the point A signifieth the Vernall Aequino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiall
point, as well of the tenth heauen, as of the first

Aequinox, in which point one of the poles of the

<pb n="222" facs="tcp:17994:115"/>
is in the opposit point, which is the true Autumnall Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctiall

of the second little circle wil crosse the true Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke
K G in some one point or other, as in the point E,
which point of Intersection, wheresoeuer it happeneth
to be, is the place of the Vernall Aequinoctiall point of
the ninth sphere: which Vernall Aequinoctiall point we
will henceforth call the meane Equinox, as the point A
is the true Equinox. So that hereby you may perceiue,
that the meane Equinox is nothing els but that point

the Eclipticke line of the said ninth sphere or true
Eclipticke.</p>
                     <p>3. The Prosthapheresis of the Equinox is the distance
which is betwixt the true and meane Equinox, as is the

                     <head type="sub">Of the eight Heauen.</head>
                     <p>1. THe eight Heauen is situated vnder the ninth Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
and moueth from West to East contrarie to
the motion of the first moouable, vpon the poles of the
true Eclipticke, making his reuolution in 25816 Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
yeares, and dependeth wholly vpon the meane
Equinox.</p>
                     <p>2. In this sphere are imagined also an Aequinoctiall and
an Ecliptick line: and the Ecliptick line of this Heauen is
alwaies in the same plane with the Ecliptick of the 9 and
10 Heauens, and swarueth not from the true Ecliptick at
all. But the Aequinoctiall points of this sphere do moue
from the true Equinoxes, sometimes forward, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:17994:116"/>
times backward, euen as the meane Equinox of the
ninth sphere moueth.</p>
                     <p>3. This sphere is apparent to the eye, by reason of the
multitude of starres which are therein: the moouing of
all which starres, and all other the inferior lights, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
or reckoned from the first starre of the Rams
horne, as from a visible beginning, although the same be
vnstable, by reason of the changeable moouing of the
Precession of the meane Vernall Equinox.</p>
                     <p>4. The Precession of the Equinox is a portion of the
true Ecliptick, comprehended betwixt two great circles,
whereof the one passeth through the first starre of the
Rams horne, and the other through the Equinox; which
if it be the true Equinox, then the arch of the Eclipticke,
comprehended betwixt the two said circles, is called the
true Precession: but if it passe through the meane Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nox,

                        <pb n="225" facs="tcp:17994:116"/>As for example, suppose in this figure the line K G to be
the true Eclipticke, and I F to be the Aequinoctiall of
the first moouable, crossing one another in the point A,
which representeth the true Equinox, vnto which point
when the Sunne commeth, it is Equinox throughout all
the world: and suppose M to be the first star of the Rams
horn, through which a right perpendicular line passeth,
signifying a great circle drawne through the first starre
of the Rams horne, &amp; also through the poles of the true
Eclipticke: and suppose L H to be another great circle
drawne through the true Aequinoctiall point A, and
through the poles of the true Eclipticke, so shall M A
be the true Precession of the Vernall Equinox. In like
manner suppose the line D E to bee another great cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
passing through the point E, signifying the meane
Equinox, and also through the poles of the true Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke,
so as the arch of the true Eclipticke, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
betwixt M and E, is the meane Precession
of the vernall Equinox. And this meane Precession is
readily found by the 14 Cannon, as the 8 Precept tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth,
and the title thereof in the said 14 Cannon, is
<hi>Praecessionis Aequinoctiorum.</hi> But the true Precession is
to be found by helpe of the Prosthapheresis, which was
defined in the third definition of the third chapter.</p>
                     <p>And although that there be many other circles both
great and little, which the Astronomers vse, as the circles
of Positions, Azimuths, and many others, yet will I only
speake of such circles, arches, and points in the Heauen
as are belonging to our present purpose (because I haue

comprehended betwixt the true Vernall Equinox,
and the circle of latitude of the said starre or point.</p>
                     <p>6. The circle of latitude is a great circle passing

the centre of the starre and the true Eclipticke, is called
the latitude of the starre.</p>

which is furthest distant from the centre of the
world, marked with the letter 1. But the opposit Auge is
that point in the superficies of the said Excentrique,
which is nearest vnto the centre of the world, marked
with the letter R.</p>
                        <p>4. The place of each point is shewed by a right line

Eclipticke, proceeding from the first starre of the Rams

                        <p>7. The orbe Excentrique, is an orbe of one equall
thicknesse, compassing the centre of the world, in which

a point in the middle of the Excentrique, from which all
right lines that are drawn vnto the concauitie of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centrique,

                        <p>9. The distance betwixt which centre and the centre
of the world is called the excentricitie of the Excen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trique:
and the distance betwixt the two said centres, that

                        <p>10. The circle Equant is a circle described vpon the
point C in the plane of the Excentrique, in regard of
the centre wherof, the motion as well of the Excentrique
as of the Epicicle, is regular and equall. And this circle
is sometimes called the circle of equalitie, sometimes
the Equator, and other times the Excentricall Equator,
the distance of the centre whereof is from the centre of
the Excentrique 3 degree, <hi rend="sup">i25</hi>· and from the centre of

doe vse to reckon the fame vpon the Eclipticke,
by imposing a line to be drawne from the centre of the

arch of the Ecliptick, beginning at the line of the Auge,
and so proceeding according to the succession of the
signes, vntill at end at the line of the meane moouing, as
in the foresaid figure the line A F is the line of the Auge,
and A G is the line of the meane moouing. Now the
arch of the Eclipticke, which is comprehended betwixt
the two lines, A F, and A G, that is to say, the arch F

as in the foresaid figure the right line A E L is called
the line of the true motion of the Epicicle.</p>

                        <p>17. The true motion of the longitude of the Epicicle
is an arch of the Eclipticke, beginning at the first starre
of the Rams horne, and endeth at the true place of the
centre of the Epicicle, as in the foresaid figure, the arch
from the Rams horne, marked with a little starre in the
Eclipticke of the eight sphere, to L, is called the true

                        <p>18. The Prosthapheresis or Equacion of the centre,
is the difference betwixt the meane Anomalia and the
coequated Anomalia of the Excentrique, or the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betwixt the equall mouing and the true moouing
of longitude. As the arch L G is called the equacion

The finding of which Equacion is taught in the 34

                        <p>19. The two points in which the Prosthapheresis of
the Excentrique is greatest, are called the meane longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of the Excentrique: and these two points are shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by a right line perpendicularly drawne vpon the line

distance betwixt the centre of the world and the centre
of the Excentrique, as in the former figure, in which the

the line A F with right angles, and is produced as

two points of the circumference of the Excentrique,

in which meane longitudes the centre of the

                        <p>20. The meane Auge of the Epicicle is a point in the
circumference of the Epicicle, which is furthest distant
from the centre of the circle Equant: and this point is
found by drawing a right line from the centre of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
Equant vnto the circumference of the Epicicle,
through the centre of the said Epicicle, as in the former

of the Epicicle to be in the point H.</p>
                        <p>21. The true Auge of the Epicicle is a point in the
circumference of the Epicicle, which is furthest distant
from the centre of the world, and is found by drawing a
right line from the centre of the world vnto the centre of
the Epicicle, and produced vnto the circumference ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,

                        <p>22. The Touch point is a point in the circumference
of the Epicicle, which is furthest distant from the centre

drawn from the centre of the Excentrique vnto the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre

Epicicle, beginning at the meane Auge of the Epicicle,
and ending at the place of the Planet in the Epicicle:
and this arch is alwaies reckoned, according as the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net

the Anomalia of commutation, and is otherwise called
of some the meane Anomalia of the orbe or Epicicle,
and of others the meane argument: the finding of the
Anomalia of Commutation is taught in the 8 Precept,

                        <p>25. The Prosthapheresis or equacion of the centre in

betwixt the meane and true Auge of the Epici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle:
as in the former figure the point K is the true Auge,
and the point H is the meane Auge of the Epicicle, the
distance betwixt which two Auges is the arch K N H,
and that is the equacion of the centre in the Epicicle: and
this equacion is alwaies equall vnto the equacion of the
centre, before defined in the 18 definition of this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
Only this rule is generally to be obserued, that if the
Prosthapheresis were added in the coequating of the
Anomalia of the Excentrique, the same Prosthapheresis
must be subtracted in the coequating of the Anomalia
of Commutation: and so againe if it bee subtracted in
the former, then it must be added in the latter.</p>
                        <p>26. The line of the true motion of the Planet is a

The greatest equacion that Saturne can haue, when the

the said centre is in the point G, that is, in the opposit
Auge of the Excentrique. Now if you take the arch of
the Eclipticke O L, which is the equacion of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
when the Epicicle is in the Auge of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centrique
out of the arch O L (which is the equacion of
the Argument) when the Epicicle is in the opposit Auge,
the remainer wil be the arch P L, which remaineris called
the excesse of the equacion of the Argument. The fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

of the 19 Cannon in the Colume, whose title is <hi>Excessus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>30. The proportionall minutes are the 60 parts of the
excesse, by helpe whereof the equacions of the Epicicle,
being not in the Auge, nor in the opposit Auge of the

figure the arch P L, which is the excesse, is supposed to
be deuided into 60 equall parts, by helpe of which diuisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the proportionall minutes are found in what place of
the Excentrique soeuer the epicicle is placed. As suppose
the true place thereof to be in the point F, in which situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of the Epicicle, the arch O L is the equacion of
the Argument, which equacion is greater than it was
when the Epicicle was in the point E, and the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betwixt these two equacions is the arch I L.
Now if you suppose the arch P L to bee deuided into
60 equall parts, looke how many of those parts the arch
I L doth containe, so many proportionall minutes are
belonging to the equacion of the argument of the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cicle,
when the place of the said Epicicle is in the point
F. The finding of these proportionall minutes is taught
in the 34 Precept, and are set downe in the 19 Cannon

or subtracted vnto the true mouing of the Epicicle, and
the summe of such addition or the remainer of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction

Eclipticke of the eight Heauen, the centre whereof is
marked with the letter A, which signifieth the centre of
the world. Next vnto this Eclipticke is one of the defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
of the meane Auge signified by the outermost
blacke orbe, the centre of whose convex superficies is
the point A, and the centre of his concaue superficies is
the point B, the other deferent of the said meane Auge
is the lesser broad blacke circle, the centre of whose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vex

orbes are two shaddowed orbes, which are the deferents
of the Sunnes Excentrique: and the convex superficies
of the outermost of these two shaddowed orbes, as also
the concaue superficies of the lower of them haue for
their centre the point B, and the concaue superficies of
the higher and convex superficies of the lower haue the
point C for their centre. Betwixt which two orbes is the
Excentrique of the Sunne, which Excentrique is signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the broad white circle: in the middle of which
white circle is drawne a circle, in which the centre of the
Sunne is continually moued: and the centre of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centrique

motion is described the little circle in the middle of the
figure, the centre of which circle is the point B.</p>
                        <p>1. The deferents of the meane Auge of the Sunne
are two orbes of vnequall thicknesse, being in some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
concentricall with the Eclipticke, and in another
respect excentricall: for the convex superficies of the

<pb n="244" facs="tcp:17994:126"/>
for their centre the centre of the world, marked with A:
but the concaue superficies of the higher, and convex

axes and poles of the true Eclipticke, and their Diurnall
motion is <hi rend="sup">iii•</hi>° <hi rend="sup">iiii12</hi>· and their yearely motion is <hi rend="sup">ii25</hi>· <hi rend="sup">iii33</hi>· <hi rend="sup">iiii12</hi>·
and do make one entire reuolution in 50717 Aegyptian
yeares: and these two orbes doe only serue to carry the
meane Auge of the Excentrique.</p>
                        <p>2. The meane Auge of the Excentrique is that point
in the deferent of the Excentrique, which is furthest di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
from the centre of the world. As for example, the
point G in the former figure signifieth the meane Auge
of the Excentrique.</p>
                        <p>3. And this point is alwaies determined in the Zodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ake
by a right line, drawne from the centre of the world
through the centre of the little circle, marked with B,
vnto the Eclipticke line, and the line so drawne, is called
the line of the meane Auge, as the line A B G, which is
called the line of the meane Auge.</p>
                        <p>4. But the motion of the meane Auge is an arch of
the Eclipticke, beginning at the first starre of the Rams
horne, and ending at the line of the meane Auge, as in
the said figure the arch * G is the motion of the meane
Auge: but if the said arch begin at the Aequinoctiall,
whether the same be meane or true, then is the said mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
called the motion of the mean Equinox, extending
from the mean Equinox or from the true Equinox vnto
the foresaid line of the meane Auge, the finding of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of which motions is shewed in the 16 Precept.</p>
                        <p>5. The deferents of the Excentrique, which some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:17994:126"/>
are called the orbes of the Anomalia of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centricitie,
are the two shaddowed orbes which do carry
the orbe Excentrique. And these two orbes haue their
proper motion also from East to West, making their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolution
once in 3434 Aegyptian yeares, and 10 dayes,
and their daily motion is <hi rend="sup">ii1</hi>· <hi rend="sup">iii2</hi>· <hi rend="sup">iiii2</hi>· and their yearly moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is <hi rend="sup">i6</hi>· <hi rend="sup">ii17</hi>· <hi rend="sup">iii24</hi>· <hi rend="sup">iiii9</hi>· And those deferents are moued vpon
the centre of the little circle (which centre is marked
with the letter B, and is distant from the centre of the
world 2 degrees, <hi rend="sup">i1•</hi>° such degrees as the length of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midiameter
of the Excentrique containeth 60 degrees)
and their proper axletree is paralell vnto the axletree of
the Eclipticke, and passeth through the centre of the said
little circle, as the next figure following sheweth. And the,
motion of these orbes doth begin at the line of the mean
Auge before defined in the third definition of this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
And it is called the Anomalia or Argument of the
Auge, and of the excentricitie of the Sunne. By the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of which Orbes the centre of the Excentrique is
imagined to describe a little circle aboue the centre of
the world, whereby the excentricitie of the Sunne chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
euery day.</p>
                        <p>6. The excentricitie of the Sunne is the distance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the centre of the world and the centre of the Suns
Excentrique: and this is threefold, greatest, least, or
meane.</p>
                        <p>7. The greatest excentricitie of the Sunne is when the
centre of the Excentrique is in the Auge of the little
circle, <hi>viz.</hi> in the point C, and the quantitie of this grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
excentricitie, is 2 degrees, <hi rend="sup">i3•</hi>° <hi rend="sup">ii7</hi>· such like degrees as
the semidiameter of the Excentrique containeth 60 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
or the quantitie of the said greatest excentricitie
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:17994:127"/>
is 41700, when the semidiameter of the Excentrique is
1000000.</p>
                        <p>8. The least excentricitie is when the centre of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centrique
is in the opposit Auge of the little circle, and
then the distance betwixt the centre of the earth and the
centre of the Excentrique, is 1 degree, <hi rend="sup">i55</hi>· <hi rend="sup">ii53</hi>· supposing
the semidiameter of the Excentrique to be deuided into
60 equall parts, but if the said semidiameter be deuided
into 1000000, then the said least excentricitie will be
32190.</p>
                        <p>9. The meane excentricitie is when the centre of the
Excentrique is in the middle distance betwixt the Auge
and opposit Auge of the little circle, and then the said
excentricitie is 0 degrees, <hi rend="sup">i34</hi>. <hi rend="sup">ii14</hi>. such parts as the semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diameter
of the Excentrique containeth 60. But if the
said semidiameter bee supposed to bee deuided into
1000000 parts, then the said mean excentricitie is 9510.
And the semidiameter of that little circle containeth 0
degrees, <hi rend="sup">i17</hi>·. <hi rend="sup">ii7</hi>·</p>
                        <p>10. The Anomalia of the Auge and excentricitie,
which is also called the centre of the Sunne, is an arch
in the concaue superficies of the outermost deferent of
the meane Auge, which arch is comprehended betwixt
the line of the meane Auge, and a right line drawn from
the centre of the little circle through the mouable cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre

the said outermost orbe. Or thus, the centre of the Sun
is an arch of the little circle, beginning at the Auge of
said little circle, and ending at the mouable centre of the
Excentrique. As for example.</p>

                        <p>11. The meane Auge of the orbes of the Anomalia
of the excentricitie, is that point in the concave superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of the highest deferent of the Excentrique, which
is furthest distant from the centre of the little circle, and
is pointed out by a right line drawne from the centre of
the said little circle, through the mouable centre of the
Excentrique. As in this second figure, in which the
point B is the centre of the little circle, and C is the
centre of the Excentrique, through which point C if you
draw a right line from A vnto the concauitie of the
highest deferent of the Excentrique, as vnto the point

this is the daily distance betwixt the two meane Auges,

Anomalia of the excentricitie.</p>
                        <p>12. The orbe Excentrique is an orbe in the Theorique
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:17994:128"/>
of the Sunne, in which the body of the Sunne is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
caried about. This orbe is placed betwixt the two
orbes, which are the deferents of the Excentrique, and
mooueth from West to East vpon his owne moouable
centre (which centre is mouable, by reason of the moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

Excentrique) and the axletree which is also mouable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the motion of the centre of the Excentrique
in the circumference of the said litle circle. And the dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
motion of this orbe from the meane Auge of the
orbes of the Anomalia of the excentricitie is <hi rend="sup">i59</hi>· <hi rend="sup">ii9</hi>· <hi rend="sup">iii•3</hi>·
<hi rend="sup">iiii24</hi>· and maketh his entire reuolution in 365 dayes, 3

For the Sunne returneth to the said point or

                        <p>13. The line of the true place of the Sunne is a right
line drawne from the centre of the world through the
centre of the Sunne vnto the Eclipticke: and the point
in the Eclipticke in which the said line endeth, is the true
place of the Sunne. As in the former second figure, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the centre of the Sunne to be in the point M of the
Excentrique, and hauing drawne a line from A to M,
and so forth vnto the Eclipticke in the point R, the said
line A R is called the line of the true place of the Sunne,
and the point R is said to be the true place of the Sunne
in the Eclipticke.</p>
                        <p>14. The yearely Anomalia of the Sunne, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
called the meane Argument of the Sunne, is an arch
of the Excentrique, which is comprehended betwixt the
line of the meane Auge of the Excentrique, and the line
of the true place of the Sunne. As in the foresaid second
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:17994:129"/>
figure the arch L M is called the yearely Anomalia of
the Sunne.</p>
                        <p>Or thus, The yearely Anomalia of the Sunne is the
excesse or difference, whereby the daily motion of the
Sun from the mean Auge of the orbes of the Anomalia
of the excentricitie, exceedeth the daily distance betwixt
the meane Auge of the Excentrique, and the meane
Auge of the orbes of the Anomalia: and this Anoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia

two Auges, which is <hi rend="sup">ii1•</hi>° <hi rend="sup">iii6</hi>· <hi rend="sup">iiii14</hi>· (as was shewed in the 11

the daily motion of the Excentrique from the meane

(as was shewed before in the 12 definition:) the remainer
of which subtraction will be <hi rend="sup">i59</hi>· <hi rend="sup">ii8</hi>· <hi rend="sup">iii7</hi>· <hi rend="sup">iiii10</hi>· And although
that this Anomalia doth belong properly vnto the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centrique:
yet notwithstanding the said Anomalia is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
supposed to be in the Eclipticke, by imagining a line
to bee drawne from the centre of the world vnto the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipticke,
in such order as that the said line may be para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lell
vnto another line which is drawne from the centre of
the Excentrique vnto the place or centre of the Sun: and
the line so drawn, may be called the line of the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
motion of the Sun. As in the foresaid second figure let
a right line be drawn from C to M, then vnto the same
line draw another paralell right line from the centre A,
and produce the same vnto the Eclipticke in the point
N; so shall the arch of the Eclipticke, which is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
betwixt the points E and N, bee the yearely
Anomalia or meane Argument of the Sunne in the Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diake.
The finding of which Anomalia for any time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,

which the said right line doth end, is the place of the true
Auge of the Excentrique in the Eclipticke: and the said
right line is called the line of the true Auge of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centrique:
as in the foresaid second figure the point A
signifying the centre of the world, and the point C the
centre of the Excentrique, in the superficies of which
Excentrique the point D is furthest distant from the
centre A, and therefore the point D is the true Auge of
the Excentrique: and the right line A C D is called the
line of the true Auge of the Excentrique: and the point
K in the Eclipticke, in which the said line endeth, is the
place of the true Auge in the Eclipticke, the finding
whereof is taught in the 16 Precept.</p>
                        <p>16. The motion of the true Auge of the Excentrique
is an arch of the Eclipticke, beginning at some princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
point in the Eclipticke, and ending at the line of the
true Auge of the Excentrique: which principall point
if it be the first starre of the Rams horne, then is the
said motion called the moouing of the true Auge from
the first starre of Aries: and if the said motion or arch
doth begin at the true Equinox, then is the said motion
called the moouing of the true Auge from the true E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinox.</p>
                        <p>17. The equacion of the centre is an arch of the
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:17994:130"/>
Eclipticke, which is comprehended betwixt the meane
Auge of the outer blacke orbes, and the true Auge of
the Excentrique, as in the foresaid second figure of this
Chapter, the arch K G in the Eclipticke is called the
equacion of the centre: and this equacion neuer excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
7 degrees, <hi rend="sup">i23</hi>· <hi rend="sup">ii36</hi>· the manner of the finding of
which equacion is shewed in the 15 Precept, by helpe of

                        </p>
                        <p>18. The true Argument of the Sunne, which is also
called the equated yearely Anomalia, is an arch of the
Ecliptick, which is contained betwixt the line of the true
Auge of the Excentrique, and the line of the Imaginarie
motion of the Sunne. As in the foresaid second figure
the line A K is the line of the true Auge of the Excen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trique,
and the place of the said true Auge in the Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke
is the point K. Likewise the line A N is the line of
the Imaginarie motion of the Sunne. Now the arch of
the Eclipticke, which is contained betwixt the 2 points
K and N, is called the true Argument or equated Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Sunne. For the difference betwixt the mean
and true Arguments of the Sunne, is also the difference
which is betwixt the meane and true Auge of the Excen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trique,
which difference is called the equacion of the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre
before defined in the 17 definition of this Chapter.
The manner of equating the Argument, is taught in
the 15 Precept.</p>
                        <p>19. The equall simple mouing of the Sunne is an arch
of the Ecliptick, beginning at the first starre of the Rams
horne, and ending at the line of the Imaginarie motion
(which line we call hereafter the line of the meane moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
of the Sunne) as in the foresaid second figure of this
Chapter, the arch * N is the equall simple moouing of
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:17994:130"/>
the Sunne: The quantitie of which simple moouing is
<hi rend="sup">i59</hi>· <hi rend="sup">ii8</hi>· <hi rend="sup">iii1•</hi>° <hi rend="sup">iiii22</hi>· euery day, and according to this motion the
Sunne maketh one entire reuolution in 365 dayes, 6
houres, <hi rend="sup">i9</hi>· <hi rend="sup">ii39</hi>·</p>
                        <p>20. The equall compound mouing of the Sunne is
an arch of the Eclipticke, beginning at the meane ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Equinox, and ending at the line of the meane moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
of the Sunne. Whereby it appeareth, that if the
meane Precession of the Equinox be added vnto the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
simple motion of the Sunne, the summe of that
addition will be the compound motion of the Sun. And
the daily compound motion is <hi rend="sup">i••</hi>° <hi rend="sup">ii8</hi>· <hi rend="sup">iii19</hi>· <hi rend="sup">iiii13</hi>· whereby the
Sunne according to the equall compound motion ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
his reuolution in 365 dayes, 5 houres, <hi rend="sup">i49</hi>· <hi rend="sup">ii16</hi>· The
manner of finding of these two equall motions of the
Sun, that is to say, the simple and compound moouing,
is taught in the 8 Precept, by helpe of the 13 and 14
Cannons.</p>
                        <p>21. The true motion of the Sunne is an arch of the
Eclipticke, beginning at the first star of the Rams horne,
and ending at the true place of the Sunne: and then is
the said true motion called the true mouing of the Sun
vnder the 8 sphere. But sometimes the said arch of true
motion is supposed to begin at the true Vernall Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nox,
and then it is called the true motion of the Sunne
vnder the first mouable.</p>
                        <p>22. The proportionall minutes are the 60 parts wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the equacions of the Argument doe encrease or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease,
according as the excentricitie of the Sun encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
or decreaseth. The finding of which proportionall
minutes is taught in the fifteenth Precept, and are set
downe in the seuenteenth Cannon in the Collum, whose
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:17994:131"/>
title is <hi>Scrupula Proportionalia.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>23. The equacion of the Argument or yearely Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sthapheresis
is an arch of the Eclipticke, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
betwixt the line of the meane moouing and
the line of the true mouing of the Sun. And this equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
of the Argument is nothing, when the Sunne is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the Auge or in the opposit Auge of the Excen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trique,
and is alwaies greatest in the meane longitudes
of the Sunne: which meane longitudes are pointed out
in the circumference of the Excentrique, by a right line
drawne perpendicularly vpon the line of the true Auge
through the centre of the world. As in the foresaid se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
figure of this Chapter, the line A D is the line of
the true Auge of the Excentrique, which another line
crosseth with right angles in the point A, which perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular
line is the line T V, and beeing produced vnto
the Excentrique, sheweth the points T and V to be the
points of meane longitudes. And the greatest equacion
of the Argument that can be, which is when the centre
of the Excentrique is in the Auge of the little circle, is
two degrees, <hi rend="sup">i23</hi>· <hi rend="sup">ii24</hi>· and that is when the Sun is distant
from the true Auge or from the Auge of the Excen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trique
93 degrees. But when the centre of the Excen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trique
is in the opposit Auge of the said little circle, then
is the greatest equacion of the Argument no more but
1 degree, <hi rend="sup">i50</hi>· <hi rend="sup">ii41</hi>· and that is when the distance of the
Sunne from the true Auge, is 92 degrees. And this equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
is called in the tables, The equacion of the orbe: the
finding whereof is taught in the 15 Precept, by helpe of
the 17 Cannon, in the Collum whose title is <hi>Orbis.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>24. The true argument of the Sunne, is the distance of
the Sunne from the true Auge of his Excentrique.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="255" facs="tcp:17994:131"/>25. The excesse or diuersitie of the diameter, is an
arch of the Eclipticke, whereby the equacion of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
(the centre of the Excentrique being in the
Auge of the little circle) exceedeth the equacion of the
argument, when the centre of the Excentrique is in the
opposit Auge of the little circle. The true argument of
the Sunne being of one selfe quantitie in each position
of the centre of the Excentrique in the circumference
of the little circle. For the equacions of the argument
doe decrease continually, so long as the centre of the
Excentrique is descending from the Auge of the little
circle, vntill it come to the opposit Auge of the said litle
circle, and from thence do begin againe to encrease, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
the centre of the Excentrique returneth again vnto
the Auge of the little circle. The finding of which Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
is taught in the 15 Precept, and is set downe in the
17 Cannon in that Colume, whose title is <hi>Excessus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>26. The coequated and true equacion, which is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
called the absolute equacion of the orbe, is an arch
compounded of the true equacion of the argument,
and of the excesse, proportionable vnto the proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
minutes.</p>

                     <p>This Heauen hath foure orbes, as the Heauen of the

Excentrique, or the deferent of the Epicicle, and the
Epicicle it selfe, in the circumference whereof the Planet
is alwayes carried. And because I haue defined the said
orbes in the fift Chapter, I thinke them needlesse to be
here againe repeated: and therefore I referre you to that
Chapter: For the Orbes of Venus doe not differ from
the Orbes of Saturne in shape and position, but onely in
the quantitie of their motions.</p>
                     <p>The deferents of the Auge and opposit Auge in the
Heauen of Venus do continue without any motion, and
the place of her Auge, which is in the Eclipticke of the
eight Heauen, is alwaies 48 degrees, <hi rend="sup">i21</hi>· reckoning from
the first starre of the Rams horne: and the opposit Auge
is alwaies 3 Sex. 48 degrees, <hi rend="sup">i21</hi>· from the first starre of
the Rams horne, accounting the said distance according
to the succession of the signes. The Excentrique of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
mooueth according to the succession of the signes
vpon his proper centre, which is differing from the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre

are moouable, sometimes approching neare vnto the
poles of the Eclipticke, and at other times are further off.
Howbeit this Excentrique maketh one entire reuoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
beginning at the first starre of the Rams horn in 365
dayes, 6 houres, <hi rend="sup">i9</hi>· <hi rend="sup">ii39</hi>· so as the moouing of this orbe is
equall vnto the simple equall mouing of the Sunne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
defined in the 19 definition of the 8 Chapter. And
therefore the line of the meane moouing of the centre
of Venus her Epicicle, is alwaies in the same place of the
Zodiake, in which the line of the meane mouing of the
Sunne is: so as in seeking for the meane mouing of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus

<pb n="257" facs="tcp:17994:132"/>

true motion of the longitude of the Epicicle (which is
defined in the 17 definition of the 7 Chapter) the remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
will be the true centre or the equated Anomalia of
the Excentrique, which is defined in the 16 definition of
the 7 Chapter.</p>
                     <p>The Epicicle of Venus hath also his proper motion
in the Excentrique, whereby it swarueth from the plane

                     <p>The semidiameter of the Epicicle is 43 degrees, <hi rend="sup">i10</hi>·
such like degrees, as the semidiameter of the Excen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trique
containeth 60 degrees. And because that the line
of the meane moouing of her centre is all one with the
line of the meane moouing of the Sunne, it may easily
appeare, that the starre or Planet will be twice conjoined
with the Sunne in one reuolution of her Epicicle, that is
to say, once in the Auge, and once in the opposit Auge
of the Epicicle. But if she be neither in the Auge nor in
the opposit Auge of the Epicicle, then in her ascending
from the opposit Auge of her Epicicle vnto the Auge
thereof she goeth before the Sunne, and is our morning

                        <p>The Excentrique hath his proper motion vpon his

                        <p>As for the true Auge of the Excentrique, the same is
found as was shewed, in the 15 definition of the 8 Chap.</p>
                        <p>The Epicicle of Mercurie hath his proper motion
vpon his mouable axletree, and the daily motion therof
is 3 degrees, <hi rend="sup">i6</hi>· <hi rend="sup">ii24</hi>· <hi rend="sup">iii14</hi>· <hi rend="sup">iiii5</hi>· <hi rend="sup">v36</hi>· and maketh one entire reuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
in 115 dayes, 21 houres, <hi rend="sup">i3</hi>· <hi rend="sup">ii26</hi>· <hi rend="sup">iii54</hi>· and the semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diameter
of the Epicicle is 22 degrees, <hi rend="sup">i30</hi>· such degrees
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:17994:135"/>
as the semidiameter of the Excentrique containeth 60,
like as was said before of Venus: For since the motion of
his longitude is alwaies equall vnto the equall simple
mouing of the Sunne, it cannot be but that this Planet
must be alwaies neare vnto the Sunne; sometimes going
before the same, and then it may be seene in the morning
before the Sunne riseth; and sometimes it followeth the
Sun, and then it may be seene in the euening.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, the greatest equacion of the Argument of
Mercurie, when the centre of his Epicicle is in the Auge
of his Excentrique (the Planet being then distant from
the Auge of the Epicicle 109 degrees) is 19 degrees, <hi rend="sup">i3</hi>· <hi rend="sup">ii6</hi>·
But if he be distant 114 degrees from the Auge of his
Epicicle, and that the centre of the Epicicle be in the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posit
Auge of the Excentrique, then is the greatest
equacion of his argument 23 degrees, <hi rend="sup">i•1</hi>· <hi rend="sup">ii35</hi>·</p>
                        <p>Now, as for the points, lines, and arches belonging to
the calculating of the Motions of Mercurie, because they
doe not differ from those which we haue shewed in the 5
Chapter, I therefore referre you to that Chapter: and as
for the particular equacions, you shal find them set down
in the 23 Cannon of the Prutenicall Tables.</p>

                           <pb n="265" facs="tcp:17994:136"/>IN the former figure, the two outermost circles do sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
the two Eclipticks, as in the Heauen of Mercurie.
Next vnto them is another white circle, in which are
set the caracters of the head and taile of the Dragon, sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying
the deferent of the Nodes, and in the middle
thereof is the circumference of a circle, in which the
two Nodes doe continually moue. Next vnto that is a
great broad and blacke orbe, signifying the deferent of
the Epicicles: in which orbe is a shadowed circle, which
representeth the first Epicicle, whose centre is marked
with the letter E: and vpon the perpendicular line C
B are placed two other little circles, one aboue, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

with the letter F, and these two little circles beeing
white within, doe signifie the second Epicicles. And in
the circumference of either of them is set the caracter
of the Moone. The point A signifieth the centre of
the world, the point B signifieth the Auge of the first
Epicicle, and the point C is the opposit Auge of the said
first Epicicle.</p>
                        <p>1. The deferent of the Nodes is an orbe in the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orique
of the Moone, in which the Nodes doe continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
moue, marked in the former figure with the head
and taile of the Dragon, describing the middle circle
of the said orbe. This orbe is concentricall, that is, hath
one selfe centre with the Zodiake: and the motion of
this orbe is regular and equall in respect of the centre
of the earth, vpon the axletree and poles of the Zodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ake,
contrarie to the succession of the signes, and the
daily motion thereof is <hi rend="sup">i3</hi>· <hi rend="sup">ii10</hi>· <hi rend="sup">iii47</hi>· and in one yeare

motion, he carrieth the other orbes round about with
him.</p>
                        <p>2. The deferent of the Epicicles is the foresaid blacke
Orbe in the Theorique of the Moone, in which the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picicles
of the Moone are carried continually about.
And this blacke orbe hath his owne proper motion,
which is according to the succession of the signes, and
is regular in respect of the centre of the world, marked
with the letter A, and mooueth vpon his owne axletree,
which cutteth the axletree of the Eclipticke in the point
A, the centre of the world, and the poles thereof are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
no more but fiue degrees from the Eclipticke:
whereby it happeneth, that the plane of this Orbe
cutteth the plane of the Eclipticke in two points, which

the centre A; and this circle crosseth the Eclipticke in
two opposit points, that is to say, in the point F and E,
called the Nodes, the one of which is called the head of
the Dragon, marked with this caracter <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                           </gap>. Vnto either of which two Nodes when the Moon
commeth, then she is in the Eclipticke, and in her moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
from either of the said two Nodes shee goeth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and further from the Eclipticke, vntill she come to
one of the 2 limits of her latitude either North or South.</p>
                        <p>3. Whereof her North limit is marked in this figure with
the letter B, and her South limit with the letter l, either
of which limits is neuer more distant from the Ecliptick
than fiue degrees, but from the Nodes each limit is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
90 degrees.</p>
                        <p>4. And hereby you may gather, that the two Nodes
are nothing els but two points, in which the plane of the
deferent of the Epicicles dooth crosse the plane of the
Eclipticke. And the one of these Nodes is called the
ascending Node or head of the Dragon, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is called the descending Node or the taile of the
Dragon.</p>
                        <p>5. The head of the Dragon is that Node, vnto which
when the Moon commeth, she beginneth to go North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
from the Eclipticke: and that Node is marked with
this caracter <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>.</p>
                        <p>6. The taile of the Dragon is that Node, vnto which
when the Moone commeth, she beginneth to go South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
from the Ecliptick, which Node is marked with this
caracter <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>.</p>
                        <p>7. The line of the mean or true mouing of the Nodes
is a line drawne from the centre of the world vnto any
of the said Nodes: as in the former figure the line A F
signifieth the line of the mouing of the head of the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,
and the line A E signifieth the line of the mouing
of the taile of the Dragon.</p>
                        <p>8. The meane mouing of the Nodes is an arch of the
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:17994:138"/>
Eclipticke, beginning at the first star of the Rams home
or at the first true Vernall Equinox, and endeth at the
line of the mouing of the Node, so as the said arch bee
reckoned contrarie to the succession of the signes.</p>
                        <p>9. The true moouing of the Nodes is an arch of the
Eclipticke, beginning at the first starre of the Rams horn,
if the same be reckoned in the Eclipticke of the eight
Heauen, or at the true Vernall Equinox, if the same bee
reckoned in the Eclipticke of the first mouable, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
at the line of the mouing of the Node, so as the said
arch be numbered according to the succession of the
signes.</p>
                        <p>10. The line of the meane mouing of the Moone is a
line drawne from the centre of the world through the
centre of the first Epicicle, and so forth vnto the Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke.
As for example, in the first figure the right line A
E B is the line of the meane mouing of the Moone.</p>
                        <p>11. The place of the centre of the first Epicicle in the
Eclipticke, is that point in which the line of the meane
mouing of the Moone falleth in the Eclipticke. As in the
said first figure the point B in the Eclipticke is the place
of the centre of the first Epicicle.</p>
                        <p>12. The meane simple moouing of the Moones lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude,
is an arch of the Eclipticke, beginning at the first
starre of the Rams horne, and ending at the place of the
centre of the first Epicicle. As in the said first figure the
arch * H K is called the mean, equall, or simple mouing
of the Moones longitude: and the daily mouing of this
simple longitude is 13 degrees, <hi rend="sup">i10</hi>· <hi rend="sup">ii34</hi>· <hi rend="sup">iii53</hi>· and according
vnto this motion the Moone maketh her reuolution in
27 dayes, 7 houres, <hi rend="sup">i43</hi>· <hi rend="sup">ii7</hi>· for in this time shee returneth
vnto the first starre of the Rams horne, and this is called
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:17994:139"/>
the Periodicall moneth. As in the first figure the arch
* H K is the equall simple mouing of the longitude of
the Moone.</p>
                        <p>13. But if the said motion dooth begin at the meane
place of the Sunne, that is, at the line of the meane mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
of the Sunne, then is it called the equall or meane
longitude of the Moone from the Sunne, and then the
daily motion is 12 degrees <hi rend="sup">i11</hi>· <hi rend="sup">ii26</hi>· <hi rend="sup">iii41</hi>· and according vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this, the Moone maketh her reuolution in 29 dayes,
12 houres, <hi rend="sup">i44</hi>· <hi rend="sup">ii3</hi>· and the time of this reuolution is called
the Synodicall moneth. So as if you subtract the equall
simple moouing of the Sunne out of the equall simple
moouing of the Moones longitude, the remainer will
shew the meane longitude of the Moone from the
Sunne. As in the said first figure suppose the arch * H to
be the equall simple mouing of the Sunne, and the arch
* H K to be the equall simple moouing of the Moones
longitude. Now if you subtract * H out of * H K, the
remainer will be H K, and that is the meane longitude
of the Moone from the Sunne. And the finding of this
at any time giuen, is taught in the 8 Precept, by helpe of
the 13 and 14 Cannons, in the Collume whose title is
<hi>Longitudo media à Sole.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>14. And againe, sometimes the meane moouing of
the centre of the first Epicicle or of the Moone, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
to begin at the North limit, and then is it called
by <hi>Ptolomey</hi> and <hi>Copernicus</hi> the mean motion of the lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of the Moone; because that after the same be corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
it sheweth the true latitude of the Moon: &amp; the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of this motion at any time is to be found in such or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
as is shewed in the 8 Precept, by help of the 13 and 14
Cannons in the Colume, whose title is <hi>Latitudinis Lunae.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="271" facs="tcp:17994:139"/>15. But <hi>Alphonsus</hi> and his followers make the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the said motion to be at the head of the Dragon,
and is called by them the Argument of the latitude of
the Moone, and the daily motion of the Moons latitude
is 13 degrees, <hi rend="sup">i1•</hi>° <hi rend="sup">ii45</hi>· <hi rend="sup">iii•9</hi>· and according vnto this moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
she maketh her reuolution in 27 dayes, 5 houres, <hi rend="sup">i5</hi>·
<hi rend="sup">ii36</hi>· And the Argument of the Moones latitude is to be
sound at any time giuen, by adding of 90 degrees vnto
the mean motion of her latitude: the manner of the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
whereof was shewed in the 14 definition of this
Chapter.</p>
                        <p>16. And you haue to note, that according to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the deferent of the Epicicle, the centre of the
Epicicle is imagined to describe a circle in the middle of
the said deferent: which circle is called the circle of the
mouing of the centre; and this circle is signified in the
first figure by the white circle in the middle of the blacke
deferent of the Epicicle, described by the centre of the
first Epicicle.</p>
                        <p>17. The first Epicicle is an orbe in the Theorique of
the Moone, which continually carieth about the second
Epicicle of the Moone. This orbe hath his owne proper
motion about his owne poles and axletree, which axle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree
is perpendicular vnto the plane of the deferent of
the Epicicle, and is paralell vnto the said axletree of the
said deferent: wherby it commeth to passe, that the plane
of this first Epicicle is alwaies in the plane of his deferent.
And the motion of this Epicicle is contrary to the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of the signes, and the daily motion thereof is 13
degrees, <hi rend="sup">i3</hi>· <hi rend="sup">ii53</hi>· <hi rend="sup">iii56</hi>· and maketh one entire reuolution in
27 dayes and 13 houres almost: and the semidiameter of
this Epicicle is 6 degrees, <hi rend="sup">i35</hi>· whereof the semidiameter
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:17994:140"/>
of the mouing of his centre containeth 60.</p>
                        <p>18. The Auge of the first Epicicle is a point in the
superficies thereof, which is furthest distant from the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre
of the earth. And the opposit Auge is that point
which is nearest vnto the centre of the earth. And the
Auge and opposit Auge is determined by a right line
drawne from the centre of the earth vnto the circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of the said first Epicicle, through the centre of the
same. As in the first figure the point B is the Auge of the
first Epicicle, and the point C the opposit Auge thereof.</p>
                        <p>19. The meane Anomalia of the Epicicle, which is
otherwise called the meane Argument, is an arch of the
first Epicicle, containing the distance betwixt the centre
of the second Epicicle, and the Auge of the first Epici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.
And this is determined by a right line drawne from
the centre of the first Epicicle vnto the centre of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Epicicle, as this figure next following sheweth.</p>

                        <p>IN which figure, the outermost circle representeth the
Eclipticke, and the lesser circle within that is a circle
which the centre of the first Epicicle is imagined to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe.
The semidiameter whereof is the line A E, and
the point E signifieth the centre of the first Epicicle,
whose semidiameter is the line E B, and the point B is
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:17994:141"/>
the Auge, and the point C the opposit Auge thereof:
the point F signifieth the centre of the second Epicicle,
and the arch B F is the meane Anomalia of the Moon:
and this is called <hi>Anomalia motus</hi> in the Prutenicall ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
the finding whereof is taught in the 8 Precept by
helpe of the 13 and 14 Cannons, in the Colume, whose
title is <hi>Anomalia Lunae.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>20. The first Epicicle is imagined to be deuided into
two parts, whereof the one part is called the higher or
vpper part, and the other is called the lower part of the
Epicicle. And these two parts are shewed by two right
lines, drawne from the centre of the world, marked with
A, so as they touch the said first Epicicle on both sides.
As in this present figure the two lines, A L and A M
are drawne from the centre A, and doe touch the first
Epicicle in the points L and M: and that part of the
Epicicle, which is aboue the points L and M, marked
with the letters L B F M, is the higher part, but the other
part, <hi>viz.</hi> L C M, is the lower part of the Epicicle.</p>
                        <p>21. And the two points L and M are the Touch-points
of the first Epicicle.</p>
                        <p>22. The second Epicicle is an Orbe in the Theorique
of the Moone, in the circumference whereof the bodie
of the Moone is alwaies carried about.</p>
                        <p>The plane of this Epicicle is alwaies in the plane of
the first, and the axletree thereof is perpendicular vnto
the plane of the first Epicicle, and therfore the axletrees
of the two Epicicles and of the deferent of the first Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cicle,
are paralels one to another.</p>
                        <p>And the mouing of this second Epicicle is contrarie
vnto the moouing of the first Epicicle: and the motion
hereof beginneth at the Auge of the second Epicicle.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="275" facs="tcp:17994:141"/>23. The Auge of the second Epicicle is that point in
the circumference of the said second Epicicle, which is
nearest vnto the centre of the first Epicicle: and the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posit
Auge thereof is furthest from the centre of the said
Epicicle: for these Auges haue respect to the centre of
the first Epicicle, and not to the centre of the earth.</p>
                        <p>24. The Anomalia of the Excentrique, which some
call the centre of the Moone, is an arch of the second
Epicicle, beginning at the Auge of the said second Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cicle,
and ending at the body of the Moone. As in the
third figure of this Chapter the point R signifieth the
Auge of the second Epicicle, and the place of the Moon
is signified by her proper caracter in the circumference
thereof, and the arch of the said little circle, contained
betwixt R and the caracter of the Moone, is called the
Anomalia of the Excentrique, or centre of the Moone.
And this Anomalia is called in the Prutenicall Tables
<hi>Longitudo Duplicata,</hi> or the double longitude of the
Moone from the Sunne: and the simple longitude was
defined before in the 13 definition of this Chapter.</p>
                        <p>And it is called the doubled longitude, because that
the motion of the Moone in the second Epicicle is dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
vnto the motion of the centre of the first Epicicle,
from the line of the meane moouing of the Sunne. For
according vnto this motion the Moone maketh her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolution
in 14 dayes, 18 houres, <hi rend="sup">i22</hi>· <hi rend="sup">ii1</hi>· and her daily mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is 24 degrees, <hi rend="sup">i22</hi>· <hi rend="sup">ii53</hi>· <hi rend="sup">iii23</hi>· and is found in the Prute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall
tables, by doubling the meane longitude of the
Moone from the Sunne.</p>
                        <p>25. The line of the true Anomalia of the Moone is a
right line drawne from the centre of the first Epicicle vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the body of the Moone. As in the third figure of this
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:17994:142"/>
Chapter the right line E G, and the caracter of the
Moone is called the line of the true Anomalia, because
it is drawne from the centre of the first Epicicle, which is
marked with the letter E, vnto the body of the Moone,
marked with the caracter of the Moone.</p>
                        <p>26. The true Anomalia of the Moone, which the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonsines</hi>
doe call the true Argument, is an arch of the
first Epicicle, contained betwixt the Auge of the said first
Epicicle, and the line of the true Anomalia. As in the
said third figure the arch B G is called the true or equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Anomalia, or the true Argument of the Moone.</p>
                        <p>27. The equacion of the centre, which in the Prute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall
tables is called the equacion of the second Epici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
is an arch of the first Epicicle, whereby the true
and meane Anomalias do differ the one from the other.
As in the said third figure the arch B G is the true Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of Moone, and the arch B F is the mean Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malia
or Argument of the Moone, or of the Epicicle, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
in the 19 definition of this Chapter: the difference
betwixt these two arches, is the little arch G F, and this
difference, is called the Prosthapheresis of the centre.
The finding whereof by the Prutenicall tables, is taught
in the 24 Precept, by helpe of the 18 Cannon, in that
Collum whose title is <hi>Secundi Epicycli.</hi> And this equaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is to be added or subtracted from the mean Anoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,
as is shewed in the said 24 Precept, to the end that the
true Argument or Anomalia may bee had. And the
greatest equacion that can be, is 12 degrees, <hi rend="sup">i26</hi>· <hi rend="sup">ii57</hi>· which
then happeneth, when the Moone is in either of the
Touch-points of the second Epicicle: which Touch-points
are determined by two right lines drawne from
the centre of the first Epicicle: and touching the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:17994:142"/>
of the second Epicicle, on each side thereof.</p>
                        <p>28. The line of the true motion of the Moon is a right
line drawn from the centre of the world, throgh the body
of the Moon vnto the Ecliptick, &amp; the point in the Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke,
where that line endeth, is the true place of the
Moone: as in the third figure the line A G T signifieth
the line of her true mouing, and the point T is the true
place of the Moone.</p>
                        <p>29. The true or apparent motion of the Moone is an
arch of the Eclipticke, beginning at some knowne place
of the Eclipticke, and ending a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> the true place of the
Moone: which arch dooth begin either at the first starre
of the Rams horne, or at the Vernall Equinox, either
meane or true, or els at the line of the meane place of
the Sunne. As in the said third figure the arch * T is the
apparent or true moouing of the Moone from the first
starre of the Rams horne.</p>
                        <p>30. The equacion of the first Epicicle is an arch of the
Eclipticke, contained betwixt the line of the meane mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
of the Moone, and the line of her true mouing. As
for example, in the third figure of this Chapter the line
A V is the line of the meane mouing of the Moon, and
the line A T is the line of her true mouing, and the arch
of the Eclipticke, contained betwixt these two lines, that
is to say, the arch T V, is called the equacion of the first
Epicicle, or the equacion of the Argument. And the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of this equacion at any time giuen, is taught in the
24 Precept, by helpe of the 18 Cannon, in the Collum,
whose title is <hi>Primi Epicycli.</hi> But because this equacion
doth varie, and is sometimes greater and sometimes les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser,
therefore the absolute and perfect equacion is to be
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:17994:143"/>
found by the proportionall minutes, and the excesse,
which were defined before in the 29 definition of the fift
Chapter, and therefore I need not here again to define
the same, but onely to tell you, that the proportionall
minutes are to be found in the 18 Cannon, in the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum,
whose title is <hi>Scrupula Proportionalia:</hi> and the
excesse is to be found in the said 18 Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,
in the Colume, whose title is
<hi>Excessus.</hi>

and necessarie Instruments for Sea-men,

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>F which two Instruments, the one
serueth to find out the declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Needle vnder any

being once had, then the other
Instrument sheweth the latitude
of that place, hauing such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination.
But because the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
of Latitude consisteth of two parts, that is to
say, of an immoouable part, which I call the Mater,
hauing therein a Quadrant, containing the 90 degrees
of Latitude, and also a Spirall line: and the other
part is moouable, containing a Quadrant, deuided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
90 degrees, which are the degrees of declination,
and also an Index, with a Fiduciall line, shewing the
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:17994:146"/>
Latitude: I mind first here to set downe the making
of the Instrument of Latitude, because it requireth a
number of circles, to find out thereby the Spirall line,
contained in the Mater of the said instrument of Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
the order whereof is here plainely set downe, as
well by this figure demonstratiue, hereto annexed, as by
this my description of the same.</p>
                  <p>The Figure.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="281" facs="tcp:17994:146"/>FIrst draw a circle vpon a peece of smooth pastbord,
so great, as the whole diameter thereof may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
in length at the least seuen or eight inches, and
marke the centre of that circle with the letter C: and by
drawing two crosse diameters, marked with the letters
I F and K E, passing through the said centre, and cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
one another in the same with right angles, you shall
thereby deuide the whole circle into foure Quadrants or
quarters. And remember, that of the two crosse diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
the perpendicular, marked with I F, must be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
in such sufficient length, as may serue to such pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
as is hereafter shewed, as from I to H, so as this
perpendicular line is marked with foure letters, that is,
F C I H, and the other crosse or ouerthwart diameter
is marked with three letters, <hi>viz.</hi> K C E. That done, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide
the nether quarter of the said circle on the right
hand, marked with the letters F E, into 90 degrees,
proceeding from fiue to fiue, till you come to 90, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the same Quadrant with the letters F C E, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to account from F to E, which is the arch of the
said Quadrant, which I will call from henceforth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
Quadrant, by helpe whereof you haue to deuide as
well the middle Quadrant, marked with L N, as the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardmost
Quadrant, marked with M H, as the Figure
sheweth. And the two last Quadrants doe containe each
of them 19 circular lines of diuision, making 18 spaces,
euery space containing fiue degrees, and are to be drawn
in such order as followeth.</p>
                  <p>First, you haue to draw a right line paralell to C E<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
beginning at F, and so proceeding forward towards your
right hand in some sufficient length, for the longer, the
better to serue your purpose. Then take with your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pas
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:17994:147"/>
the distance betwixt C and F, and applie that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
to the said right paralell line, by putting the one
foot of your Compas in F, and the other at the end of
that distance, marking that point with the letter L: then
by setting the firme foot of your Compas in C, and by
extending the other foot to L, draw a portion of a circle
somwhat more than a Quadrant, towards your left hand,
and marke the end of that arch with the letter N, which
arch is to be deuided into 90 equall parts or degrees, by
helpe of 19 circular lines of diuision, to bee drawne as
followeth.</p>
                  <p>First set the firme foot of your Compas in F, and
with the other foot, extended to the centre C, draw a
circle from C to L, and that shall be the first circle of
diuision, shewing that the point L is the first point from
whence you haue to account the 90 degrees of the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
Quadrant, proceeding vpward by fiue and fiue, vntill
you come to 90.</p>
                  <p>Then to draw the rest of the circles of diuision, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the said middle Quadrant, you haue no more
to doe but to remoue the firme foot of your Compas to
euery fift degree of the first and inner Quadrant, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
to extend the other foot to the centre C, so shall
you justly deuide the arch of the middle Quadrant into
90 degrees. Now to draw the arch of the outwardmost
Quadrant, marked with M H, you must doe thus. First
take with your Compas the distance betwixt the letter L
and the centre C, and applie that distance to the quarter
of the first whole circle on the left hand, marked with the
letters F K, which you shall find to be all one, then by set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the one foot of your Compas in F, and by exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the other foot to the end of that distance vpon the
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:17994:147"/>
right paralell line before drawn, and marked with the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
F L, marke that point or end of distance with the
letter M, as you see in the foresaid Figure. Then set the
firme foot of your Compas in the centre C, and by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
the other foot to the point M, draw a portion of
a circle somewhat more than a Quadrant, towards your
left hand, and marke the end thereof with the letter H,
which shall be the arch of the outwardmost Quadrant,
and must be deuided into 90 equall parts or degrees, by
helpe of 19 circles of diuision to be drawne as followeth.</p>
                  <p>First, by setting the firme foot of your Compas in F,
and the other in K, draw a circle from K to M, from
which point you must begin to account the 90 degrees
of that arch, and so to proceed towards your left hand
from 5 to 5 vntill you come to 90, which diuision is to be
made by remoouing the firme foot of your Compas to
euery fift point of diuision, contained in the arch of the
first inner Quadrant, marked with the letters F E, exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
alwayes the other mouable foot to the letter K, and
so to draw al the circles of diuision belonging to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardmost
Quadrant? That done, you haue to draw the
Spirall line, which cannot bee rightly done, vntill you
haue deuided euery one of the circles of diuision, belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
to the outwardmost Quadrant, each one into 90
parts or degrees, beginning your account at euery fift de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of the arch of the same outwardmost Quadrant,
and so to proceed from 5 to 5, vntill you come to the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
K, whereas the 90 degree of euery such circle endeth.</p>
                  <div type="section">
                     <head>How to draw the Spirall line.</head>
                     <p>You see that in the foresaid Figure the Spirall line be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:17994:148"/>
at the point L, and endeth at the centre of the
first whole circle, marked with C, as the first circle of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision,
belonging to the middle Quadrant, drawne from
C to L, doth plainely shew.</p>
                     <p>But because the said Spirall line is to be drawne so as
it may containe 18 seuerall portions, you haue to draw
the first portion thereof thus. First deuide the second
circular line of diuision, belonging to the outwardmost
Quadrant, into 90 equall parts or degrees, proceeding
from the fift point of the said second line of diuision vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
K, whereas is set downe the 90 degree, seruing to all the
19 circles of diuision belonging to the said outwardmost
Quadrant: which is to be done, by deuiding the said se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
line first into three equall parts, and euery one of
those parts again into three. Then last of all euery one of
them into two parts, euery part whereof shall containe
fiue degrees. And after this manner is to bee deuided
euery one of the 19 lines of diuision belonging to the
said outwardmost Quadrant. That done, take with your
Compas the first fift part of that second circle, being so
deuided, and there make a pricke: at which prick, lay the
one end of your Ruler, and lay the other end thereof at
the first fift degree of the inner Quadrant, and so draw a
dead right line, which will cut the second line of diuision
belonging to the middle Quadrant, and there make a
pricke, from which pricke to the letter L you haue to
draw the first portion of the Spirall line. Now to draw
the second portion of the said Spirall line, you must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort
to the third circular line of diuision, belonging to
the outwardmost Quadrant: and hauing deuided that
line into 90 equall parts or degrees, as you did before the
second line, and taken thereof with your Compas tenne
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:17994:148"/>
degrees, there make a pricke, to which pricke lay the one
end of your Ruler, and the other end to the tenth degree
of the inner Quadrant, and draw a dead right line, which
wil cut the third circular line, seruing to the middle Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant,
and there make the second pricke, from which
pricke you haue to draw the second portion of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
line, so as it may joine with the first portion. Then to
draw the third portion of the Spirall line, you must pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to the fourth circular line of diuision, belonging to
the outwardmost Quadrant, and deuide that into 90 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
as you did before, whereof you must take 15 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
and there make a pricke, to which pricke you must
lay the one end of your ruler, and the other end to the
15 degree of the inner Quadrant, and hauing drawne a
right dead line, you shall find that it will cut the fourth
circular line belonging to the middle Quadrant, and
there make a prick, from which pricke you haue to draw
the third portion of the Spirall line, so as it may joine to
the end of the second portion thereof. Now to find out
the rest of the 18 portions of the Spirall line, you must
obserue the selfe same order of working, which you did
before in finding out the first three portions.</p>
                     <p>Thus hauing plainely described vnto you the making
of the immouable part or Mater of the said Instrument,
I will now shew you how to make the moouable part:
which, as I said before, is none other thing but a Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant,
hauing an Index, with a Fiduciall line, answerable
in all respects to the first inner Quadrant, differing onely
in letters. For whereas the inner Quadrant is marked with
the letters F C E, this for difference sake, and for the
right placing the same vpon the Mater, is marked with
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:17994:149"/>
the letters A B G. For when you come to vse this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument,
you must place the angle A of the moouable
Quadrant vpon the centre C of the inner Quadrant,
there to be fastened with a pin, so as the moouable Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant
may turne round about vpon the Mater.</p>
                     <p>And because this Instrument is not auaileable, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the helpe of the other Instrument of Declination, I
haue therefore here set downe the shape of that Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Declination, together with a plaine description
thereof, and then I will shew the vse of both the said In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments.

                     <head>The description of the said Instrument.</head>
                     <p>THe outward broad hoope or circle of this Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
would bee of fine Latton or Brasse, contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in breadth about an inch and a halfe, and in thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
almost a quarter of an inch, and the whole dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter
thereof would be about fiue inches, and in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
middest of the inside of the broad circle is traced a
middle circle, which is deuided into foure quarters, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
quarter containing 90 degrees, whereof no more
are grauen with numerall figures, but the two neather
quarters, the one on the right hand, and the other on the
left hand, and the 90 degree is placed at the neather end,
whereas both those quarters doe meet. And at the vpper
end of the broad circle is to bee placed a ringle to hold
the Instrument thereby, when you would vse the same.
Now ouerthwart the said broad circle are fastened in the
very middest of the two outsides thereof, two thin plates
of Latton, signifying the Horizon, bearing in breadth
about a quarter of an inch. The one plate on the one
side of the broad circle, and the other plate on the other
side of the said circle, standing right and just one against
another: of which two plates, each one is bored in the
very middest on the inside with a little hole, so as into
those two holes may bee put an axletree of yron, which
axletree must be biggest in the very middest, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
that the Needle beeing wrought into the axletree,
may hang just in the middest of the said axletree; which
Needle would be smaller at the one end than at the other,
for the smallest and sharpest end thereof being touched
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:17994:152"/>
with a perfect stone, dooth alwaies shew the Magneticall
declination of the place, whereas you make your triall.
And the Needle it selfe would be in length almost equall
to the whole diameter of the broad circle, yet so, as it
may easily play and turne vp and downe, without tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the same. These parts being fitly and artificially set
together, you haue to couer the two outsides of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument,
each of them with a round and cleare glasse,
that through them you may alwayes see vpon what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
the sharpe point of the Needle falleth, after it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth
steadie without mouing: which glasses, seruing
to keepe the Needle from wind and dust, would be so fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stened
to the outwardmost edge of the broad circle, as
they may stand sure, and not fall away.</p>

                     <p>FIrst to find out by this Instrument the declination of
the Needle vnder the Horizon vpon the land, you
must resort into a place void of wind: or if you would
trie it vpon the Sea, I thinke it best to goe to that place
or coubbard of the ship, wherein the Mariners Compas
is wont to stand, and there steadily to hold the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
hanging vpon your right or left thombe, so as it
may hang right North and South, according as the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners
Compas dooth direct you, or els by helpe of
some little Diall, whose Needle is touched with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
stone, and when you see that the Needle standeth
still, marke well vpon what degree in the middle line of
the broad circle it falleth, for that shall bee the degree
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:17994:153"/>
of Declination for that place. And hauing found the
degree of Declination, take into your hand the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Latitude, made of Brasse or Pastbord, in such
forme as you see set downe on the right hand of the
first figure demonstratiue: which Instrument of Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
consisteth (as I haue said before) of two parts, the
one vnmoouable, called the Mater, and the other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uable.
In the Mater is described a Quadrant, deuided
into 90 degrees, which are the degrees of Latitude,
and also the Spirall line. And the moouable part con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth
a just Quadrant, deuided also into 90 degrees,
which are the degrees of Declination, together with
his Index, hauing a Fiduciall line to shew the latitude:
and this moouable part, when you come to vse it, must
bee placed vpon the Mater, so as the angle A of the
moouable part must bee fastened with a pin vpon the
centre or angle of the Mater, marked with the letter C,
in such sort as the moouable Quadrant may turne round
about vpon the Mater. That done, seeke out in the arch
of the mouable Quadrant, the degree of Declination,
before found by the instrument of Declination; and lay
that degree just vpon the Spirall line, described in the
Mater, and holding it fast there with your thombe, looke
at that very instant vpon what degree of latitude the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex
with his Fiduciall line falleth, for that shall be the
latitude of that place.</p>
                     <p>As for example, M. Doctor <hi>Gilbert</hi> hauing found
by the Instrument of Declination, as he wrote to me,
the declination at London to be 72 degrees: then by
applying the same to the Instrument of Latitude, in
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:17994:153"/>
such order as is before taught, he found the latitude of
London to be 51 degrees, 32 minutes. And I prouing
the same at mine owne house at Newton Flotman, not
distant aboue foure miles Southward from Norwich, I
found the declination of the Needle to bee 73 degrees
and a little more, and thereby I found our latitude here
to be 52 degrees or thereabout.</p>
                     <p>Both these Instruments I receiued not long since
from my deare friend M. Doctor <hi>Gilbert,</hi> for the which
I most heartely thanke him, the inuention of which In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
deserueth more worthie commendation and
praise, than I am able any way to yeeld, hoping that all
Sea-men will bee as thankefull to him as I am in heart
and good will, for whose profit there was neuer inuented
from the beginning of the world two such noble and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie
Instruments as these are, and therefore worthie
to be esteemed of all men accordingly.</p>
                     <p>By helpe of the said Instrument of Declination, you
may also readily find out the variation of any Mariners
Compas in North-Easting or North-Westing, if you
place the Instrument within such a standerd as <hi>Robert
Norman</hi> dooth set downe by figure in his booke cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
The new Attractiue: which point, Master <hi>Borrough</hi>
would haue to be called the Respectiue point, and not
the Attractiue. But M. Doctor <hi>Gilbert</hi> in his booke
<hi>De Magnete,</hi> prooueth by diuers good demonstrations
that it ought most properly to be called the point of
Coition, or the point Coitiue, and neither Respectiue
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:17994:154"/>
nor Attractiue. The manner how to vse the said Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in seeking to know the variation of the Marriners
Compas in any latitude, is the selfe-same which <hi>Robert
Norman</hi> and Master <hi>Borrough</hi> doe set downe in
the foresaid booke, whereunto I doe
referre you, and so bid you well
to fare.</p>

for finding the latitude by the declination of the Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neticall

worthie to be put in daily practise, especially by such
as vndertake long voyages: it was thought meet by
