            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Preface,</head>
            <p>
               <hi>THe Occasion which first produced the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Sermon, cannot be expressed in better Terms, than those which were used by the Worthy Gentlemen that were the</hi> Conservators of our peace, <hi>in their humble Address to Their Majesties, bearing Date, May 20th</hi> 1689. <hi>Wherein among other things they say,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>—Your three several Princely Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Encouraging the English Nation, to cast off the Yoke of a Tyrannical and Arbitrary Power, which at that time they were held un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, have occurred unto the View and Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the people in this Countrey, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves under alike (if not worse) evil and unhappy Circumstances with their Brethren in <hi>England;</hi> First by being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteously deprived of their Charter-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, &amp; Priviledges, without any Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Tryal, and under utter impossibilities of having Notice of any Writt served upon them; and then followed with the Exercise of an illegal and Arbitrary power over them, which had almost ruined a late flourishing Countrey, and was become very grievous &amp; intolerable; besides, the growing miseries,
<pb facs="tcp:45731:4"/>
and daily fears of a total Subversion, by ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies at home, and Invasion by forreign force; the people thereby excited, to imitate so no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and heroic an Exemple, being strongly and unanimously spirited, to intend their own safeguard and Defence, resolved to sieze up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and secure some of the principal persons concerned, and most active in the ill manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the illegal and arbitrary Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, set over them by Commission. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly upon the eighteenth day of <hi>April</hi> last past, arose as one man, siezed upon Sr. <hi>E. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dros</hi> the late Governour, and other of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil instruments, and have secured them for what Justice, Order from your Majesties shall direct.—<hi>Thus that Address.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Upon the late Revolutions thus described, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued various debates about the further</hi> Steps <hi>that were needful to be taken for the service of Their Majesties and this afflicted Countrey; Which</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates <hi>quickly issued in the Return of our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, into the Hands of our Ancient Magistrates; who with the</hi> Representatives <hi>or</hi> Deputies <hi>of the several Towns in the Colony, made another Address unto Their Majesties, bearing date, Iune</hi> 6. 1689. <hi>in which Address there were these Words,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>—Finding an Absolute Necessity of Civil Government, the People generally manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Desires and Importunity once and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
<pb facs="tcp:45731:4"/>
That the Governour, Deputy Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and Assistants, chosen and sworn in May 1686. according to Charter &amp; Court as then formed, would assume the Government;—</p>
            <p>—the said Governour, Deputy-Governour, and Assistents, then Resident in the Colony, did Consent to accept the present Care and Government of this people, according to the Rules of the Charter, for the preservation of the Peace and common safety, and the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth further Acts of Authority, upon Emergencies: until by Direction from <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> there should be an orderly Settlement; which we hope will Restore us to the full Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise thereof, as formerly; notwithstanding we have, for some time, been most unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously, and injuriously deprived of it.</p>
            <p>That Royal Charter being the sole Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Encouragement unto our Fathers and predecessors, to come over into this Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness, and to plant the same at their own Cost and Charge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In Answer to this Address, His Majesty in a most gracious Letter, bearing Date the 12th of August</hi> 1689. <hi>unto the Government here, uses these Expressions,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereas you give Us to understand, that you have taken upon you the present care of the Government, until you should receive Our Order therein, We do hereby Authorize and
<pb facs="tcp:45731:5"/>
Empower you to Continue in Our Name, your Care in the Administration thereof, and Preservation of the Peace, until We shall have taken such Resolutions, and given such Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections for the more orderly Settlement of the said Government, as shall most conduce to Our Service, and the Security and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of Our Subjects within that Our Colony.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It was in the time of our greatest</hi> Heats <hi>and</hi> Straits, <hi>and at a time appointed for a</hi> General Assembly <hi>of this great Colony, that the ensueing Sermon was expected from me. Through the Grace of God, the Sermon</hi> Then <hi>was not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unacceptable to some who desired the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of it. But I gave not my full Consent unto their Desire, until now, they had an</hi> Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity <hi>(with their Renewed Importunity) to join it with another Discourse which they have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from me; and tho' the little</hi> Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <hi>which were among us, when the Sermon was preached, are now so well Composed, yet I slatter my self with an opinion, that the things here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted on, will not, should not be judg'd</hi> Unsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I confess it is a very</hi> Bold <hi>thing, for one every way so</hi> mean <hi>as my self, to Address the whole Countrey in such a manner as here I do; but,</hi> Si crimen erit, crimen <hi>Amoris</hi> erit; <hi>and if the general Dispositions of the year will not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:45731:5"/>
               <hi>a Breach of</hi> Order <hi>in me, I have but one thing more to offer by way of Satisfaction for it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> There was once a people in the world, with whom it was a Custome, That when men would Conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liate the Favour of the</hi> Ruler, <hi>they were to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent his own</hi> Son <hi>before him, as a</hi> Sight <hi>which would speak more than any Advocate. Instead thereof, that I may not want the Favour of my</hi> Countrey, <hi>how blameable soever they may count my freedome with them, I shall only present them with my own</hi> Father; <hi>whose cheerful Encounter with an hazardous Voyage unto a strange Land, and with innumerable Difficulties and Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons there, for no other Cause, than that he might</hi> Speak FOR <hi>them, has at least merited a Pardon for</hi> Mee, <hi>with whom he has for near two years now left both his</hi> Church <hi>and</hi> Family, <hi>if I have transgressed by taking a Liberty of</hi> Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing TO <hi>them at the same time, the things which may promote our Enjoyment of the</hi> Divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence <hi>with us. Now, may</hi> Salvation be nigh unto us, <hi>and</hi> Glory dwell in our Land!</p>

The blessed God gave His peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple a notable victory over these Invaders, and they were now returning from <hi>Gerar</hi> (a place between thirty and forty miles off) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> The Holy Spirit of God exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and inclined a Prophet whose Name was <hi>Azariah,</hi> to entertain them with a faithful &amp; solid Sermon hereupon; and in my Text you have the Sum and Substance of it.</p>
            <p>We may observe,</p>
            <p>First, The <hi>Praeface</hi> of it; and that is very awful and earnest: <hi>Hear ye me</hi> Asa, <hi>and all</hi> Judah, <hi>and</hi> Benjamin. As he was proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly none of the <hi>greatest,</hi> so tis like he was none of the <hi>oldest</hi> men; for it seems by the eighth verse, that his <hi>Father</hi> was yet alive, &amp; present at this time. Yet being to speak in the Name of the great and eternal God, he expects, he demands the attention of the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45731:7"/>
whole Army to him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the <hi>Design</hi> of it; and that is, to decclare both the <hi>Rise</hi> and <hi>Use</hi> of their late Prosperity. <hi>The Lord is with you, while you you are with Him;</hi> or as the Vulgar Latin has it, <hi>Inasmuch as you have been with him.</hi> What follows, is but an Explication, and Ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of <hi>this.</hi> He saw they were taken up with various Businesses and Contrivances; they had their Enemies under Hatches, and their minds were full of Thoughts and Cares, <hi>What to do next?</hi> But he calls them off to <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge</hi> the <hi>Presence</hi> of God, as the cause of their coming off so well in their late <hi>Action,</hi> and <hi>above all things</hi> to <hi>obtain</hi> &amp; <hi>secure</hi> the <hi>presence</hi> of God, that they might come off as well, in in their future Enterprises.</p>
            <p>I am therefore to call for your Attention unto this <hi>Faithful Saying.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>DOCT. That <hi>The GOD of Heaven will be</hi> with <hi>a people while they are with Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis by the ensuing <hi>Propositions,</hi> that the <hi>Explication</hi> of this Truth shall be <hi>endeavoured.</hi>
            </p>
            <div n="1" type="proposition">
               <head>PROPOSITION. I.</head>
               <p>It is the <hi>Interest,</hi> and should be the <hi>Desire,</hi> of Every people to have the God of Heaven <hi>With them.</hi> But we are to enquire,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is implied in that</hi> presence of GOD, <hi>which we are to be solicitous about?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:45731:8"/>
For Answer to this; There is a Threefold <hi>Presence of God,</hi> mentioned in the <hi>Scripture of Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, God is <hi>Naturally</hi> present with all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. He is an <hi>Immense Being,</hi> and no Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can be without him. The Apostle thus argued in the Court at <hi>Athens,</hi> in <hi>Act,</hi> 17. 27. <hi>God is not far from every one of us.</hi> No, He is <hi>near</hi> us all, He is <hi>with</hi> us all. And <hi>Paul</hi> could have had the Gentiles themselves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing it; for besides what their <hi>Seneca</hi> did own, One of their own Poets had said, <hi>Iovis omnia plena.</hi> It is the Speech of our God, in <hi>Ier.</hi> 23. 24. <hi>Do not I fill Heaven and Earth, saith the Lord?</hi> Yea, <hi>That</hi> He do's. The Jews call God by the Name of <hi>Makom,</hi> or of <hi>Place,</hi> because all things are in Him; this is His Name in the Book of <hi>Esther,</hi> if I mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it not. Whether we may count it <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> and <hi>physical</hi> to speak of an <hi>Imaginary, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite space,</hi> beyond the utmost Selvige of the world, replenished with our God alone; yet we are sure that <hi>the Heaven of Heavens</hi> gives no limits unto His Being; and the Ancients were not mistaken when they said, <hi>Deus Ipse Sibi, et Mundus et Locus et Omnia.</hi> We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not so well say, That God is in the <hi>World,</hi> as we may say, The whole World is in <hi>God;</hi> &amp; we may say with the Psalmist, in <hi>Psal.</hi> 139. <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>. Whither shall I flee from thy presence?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:45731:8"/>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> God is <hi>Gloriously</hi> present with the Inhabitants of the Third Heaven. The Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of Heavens hath in it most intimate and marvellous manifestations of God. It is the <hi>Place,</hi> of which we may say, as tis said of that <hi>State,</hi> in Rev. 21. 23. <hi>The glory of God doth lighten it.</hi> There the blessed ones have God <hi>with</hi> them, so that they <hi>Alwayes behold His face;</hi> and they are <hi>satisfied with His like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> for ever. When we come to Heaven, then as in 1. Thes. 4. 17. <hi>We shall ever be with the Lord.</hi> So the Lord will be <hi>with us</hi> for ever. Heaven is the <hi>Throne</hi> of the Most High; He is there as a Prince in his Throne; the Great KING is in a manner very ineffa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble residing there. To be there, is called in 2. Cor. 5. 4. A being <hi>present with the Lord.</hi> Hence unto the <hi>Heaven,</hi> and not unto a <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> are we directed to make our <hi>Corporal Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications</hi> in our <hi>Prayers,</hi> or our <hi>Oathes</hi> before the Lord.</p>
               <p>But Thirdly, God is <hi>Graciously</hi> present with His people, by being <hi>Favourable</hi> unto them. And this <hi>Gracious presence</hi> of God is that which a people ought to be concerned for. It lies in The <hi>Engagement of Divine Providence for the Welfare of such a people.</hi> God is <hi>with</hi> us when God is <hi>for</hi> us.</p>
               <p>To particularize,</p>
               <p>First, God is <hi>with</hi> a people by <hi>Directing</hi>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:45731:9"/>
of them. When <hi>Israel</hi> was to pass thro' the Wilderness, they had that encouragement, in Exod. 22. 15. <hi>The presence of God going</hi> with them. What was that? Why, They had a cloudy siery <hi>Pillar</hi> miraculously Leading of them every step of the way; There was a wonderful Pillar which was a <hi>Cloud</hi> by day, and a <hi>Fire</hi> by night; the <hi>Lower</hi> part of which rested on the Tabernacle, while the <hi>Upper</hi> part was to be seen by the whole Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: the Motions of this being managed by the Ministry of Angels, now <hi>God</hi> was <hi>with them,</hi> and <hi>He led them forth by the right way.</hi> A people are often brought into a Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Difficulties and Emergencies: but if God be <hi>with</hi> them, He guides them to a good Issue of them all. The <hi>Presence</hi> of God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in His Directing and Inclining of a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to such Actions, as may be for <hi>His Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> and <hi>their Safety,</hi> and such <hi>Methods,</hi> as may extricate them out of all Distresses! When God is <hi>with</hi> a people, He shapes their Counsels for them, and he disposes them to the Things that should be done. He supplies them with Apprehensions beyond the Reach and Verge of their own Wisdome, and He layes before them <hi>Invitations,</hi> and <hi>Provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> which as it were push them into <hi>the way wherein they should go.</hi> When the Jews were upon a <hi>Re-Assumption</hi> of the desireable things
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:45731:9"/>
which the <hi>Babylonians</hi> had deprived 'em of, they took a <hi>Right Way</hi> to dissappoint all that were desirous to interrupt them in it. We find in Neh. 4. 13. That while those Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises continued, they <hi>waited</hi> in a posture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable thereunto; and when the danger was over, <hi>then they returned every one to his work.</hi> How came this to pass? 'Twas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause GOD was <hi>with</hi> them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, God is <hi>with</hi> a People, by <hi>Protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of them. 'Twas the promise of God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to His people, in Isa. 43. 2. <hi>When thou passest thro' the Waters, I will be with thee, and thro' the Rivers, they shall not overflow thee.</hi> On which Text, blessed <hi>Bilney</hi> after his Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation so sweetly paraphrased, that his Friends caused the whole Sentence to be fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly written on their Tables. A people may be ready to be swallow'd up, by a stormy, gaping Ocean of Troubles, but if God be <hi>with</hi> them, they shall escape clear of all. The <hi>Presence</hi> of God is a Defence, a Refuge to the people that are partakers of it. It was said unto <hi>David</hi> in 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 9. <hi>I was with thee, and have cut off all thine enemies out of thy sight.</hi> When God is <hi>with</hi> a people, He distracts and confounds their enemies, and He troubles <hi>those</hi> who trouble <hi>them.</hi> A people who have God <hi>with</hi> them, are too strong for all the <hi>Malice</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of their enemies; no Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:45731:10"/>
no Desolation, shall make such a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple miserable; they are the <hi>Iacob,</hi> unto whom in <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 15. <hi>Behold, I am</hi> with <hi>thee, and I will keep thee, saith the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, God is <hi>with</hi> a people by His <hi>Assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>Succeeding</hi> of them. When <hi>Ioshua</hi> had a vast Undertaking in hand, it was said unto him in <hi>Cap.</hi> 1. 9. <hi>Be of good Courage, for the Lord thy God is</hi> with <hi>thee, whither soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thou goest.</hi> q. d. <hi>God</hi> will <hi>Assist</hi> thee, and <hi>succeed</hi> thee, in thy undertakings. The <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence</hi> of God will carry a people comfortably through all that they take in hand. If they have <hi>Canaanites</hi> to subdue; if they have <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments</hi> to obtain or preserve, the <hi>Presence</hi> of God will prosper them in doing all. It was said unto <hi>Solomon,</hi> in 1. Chron. 22. 11. <hi>My son, the Lord be</hi> with <hi>thee, and prosper thou, and build the house of the Lord thy God.</hi> Thus, if the Lord be <hi>with</hi> a people, they shall <hi>prosper</hi> in all their Affairs; in every <hi>Expedition,</hi> they shall come off with Satisfaction; and they shall not miscarry in any of their <hi>Applications.</hi> This is the <hi>Presence</hi> of the Lord.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Presence</hi> of God with <hi>a people</hi> in His <hi>Outward Providence,</hi> has a diverse <hi>Foundation</hi> and <hi>Continuance</hi> from His Presence with <hi>His</hi> People, in the <hi>Covenant of Grace.</hi> As tis well
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:45731:10"/>
observed by the great <hi>Owen,</hi> in a Discourse unto the Parliament, <hi>These two</hi> are to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully distinguished. We must not reflect on the Stability of the <hi>New-Covenant,</hi> for what Variety and Soveraignty we may see in <hi>provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential Dispensations,</hi> toward this and that people in the world. This matter seems de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by <hi>David,</hi> in 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 5. <hi>Tho' my house be not so with God, yet He has made with me an Everlasting Covenant, ordered in all things and sure. David</hi> had promises for the prosperity of his <hi>House;</hi> He had also the <hi>sure mercies</hi> of the Covenant made over to him in the promises of God. These promises had now a different Establishment; The <hi>Sure mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> of the Covenant, were unto him more <hi>Absolute</hi> and <hi>Immutable;</hi> but the prosperity of his <hi>House,</hi> we find under another Law, and subject unto a dreadful Alteration.</p>
               <p>To bring these things into the case before us.</p>
               <p>God has in the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> promis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That He will be <hi>with</hi> His people. This we read in <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 5. <hi>He hath said, I will never leave thee nor forsake thee.</hi> The <hi>Alsuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient God,</hi> who is HEE that answers our Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities, Let them be what they will; the <hi>Unchangeable</hi> God, who is HE still, whatever He was to the Saints of old; this God hath <hi>said</hi> [and how much better is this <hi>Autos Eireken</hi> than the best <hi>Ipse dixit</hi> in the world!
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:45731:11"/>
He hath <hi>said</hi> it, and this] with multipli'd <hi>Negatives,</hi> in the Original, heaped one upon another, <hi>I will not,</hi> I will not <hi>leave thee, I will not, I will not,</hi> I will not <hi>forsake thee.</hi> Well, but <hi>God</hi> is not <hi>with</hi> a people in His <hi>outward</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence just after the manner therein observed.</p>
               <p>This Two-fold <hi>Presence</hi> of God;</p>
               <p>First, It has a Diverse <hi>Foundation.</hi> When we look on the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> there the <hi>Sins</hi> of one are expiated by the <hi>Sufferings</hi> of another; and so, God comes to be <hi>with</hi> His people, for whom the Atonement is thus Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured. Thus tis said in 2. Cor. 5. 25. Christ was <hi>made sin</hi> [or a Sin-offering] <hi>for us, that we might become the Righteousness of God in Him.</hi> Now come to <hi>outward Providence,</hi> and there you see other measures taken. Here God is <hi>with</hi> a people, according to those Terms, in Ezek. 18. 20. <hi>The Soul that</hi> sinneth IT <hi>shall dye; one shall not bear the Iniquity of nother.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Again,</hi> It hath a Diverse <hi>Continuance.</hi> When we look on the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> there God hath bound Himself to be <hi>with</hi> His peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for ever; yea, to see that they shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for ever be with <hi>Him.</hi> He there saies as in Jer. 32. 40. <hi>I will not turn away from them to do them good, but I will put My fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from Me.</hi> Now come to <hi>outward Providence,</hi> and there
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:45731:11"/>
you see tis otherwise. God is <hi>with</hi> a people for a while; and upon <hi>their</hi> misbehaviours and provocations, He changes the Tenour of His Dispensations to them. Tis with them, as it was with that family, in 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 30. <hi>I said indeed, that thy house should walk be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me forever; But now the Lord saies, that be far from me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The sense of these things will prepare your Thoughts for one Conclusion more, which is,</p>
            </div>
            <div n="3" type="proposition">
               <head>Proposition. III.</head>
               <p>A People must be with <hi>God,</hi> or God will not be with <hi>them.</hi> And here also, to prevent Mistakes, Let that one Text be alwaies car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in our Minds; <hi>Neh.</hi> 9. 18. <hi>Being merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, thou for sookest them not;</hi> there is <hi>Mercy</hi> in the Whole of this matter. Let it be noted, That tho' this Condition seems to be <hi>imposed</hi> upon us; yet it is <hi>Grace,</hi> pure <hi>Grace,</hi> rich <hi>Grace</hi> that helps us, when we are helped un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the performance of it. When a people have so been <hi>with</hi> God, as that He has been <hi>with</hi> them, they are to shout, <hi>Grace, Grace!</hi> concerning all. It is also to be noted, that this <hi>Benefit</hi> dos not depend upon that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, as an <hi>Effect</hi> upon the real and proper <hi>Cause</hi> of it. When a people has been <hi>with</hi> God, this does not <hi>merit,</hi> and <hi>so</hi> procure that God should be with <hi>them;</hi> but <hi>that</hi> is barely the <hi>Antecedent</hi> unto which, <hi>this</hi> is the <hi>Conse-</hi>

Having praemsed this I must now affirm, <hi>God is</hi> with <hi>you, while you are</hi> with <hi>Him.</hi> We need only reflect on the People of <hi>Israel,</hi> for an Instance of it. That whole History, which almost fills the Bible, proclames nothing more than this; it loudly declares, That while a people are <hi>with</hi> God, God will be <hi>with</hi> them; but that He will be very Terrible in His <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential Dispensations</hi> towards such a people as do <hi>forsake</hi> Him.</p>
               <p>But, What is it for a people to be <hi>With God?</hi> In short,</p>
               <p>Our being <hi>With God,</hi> implies the Whole of our <hi>Obedience</hi> to Him. Our <hi>Duty</hi> to God must be attended, that we may have the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence</hi> of God. The Whloe of this Duty is comprised in that Expressir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> of our being <hi>with the Lord.</hi> Particularly the Hebrew Particle <hi>[Gnim]</hi> in our Text, admits of three Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications; it signifies, <hi>With,</hi> and <hi>For,</hi> &amp; <hi>Like,</hi> [which last Signific<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>tion I make the more free withal, because a little <hi>Philology</hi> will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint us with many Exemples of it: for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, When <hi>David</hi> saith in Psal. 120, 5. <hi>I dwell in (Gnim</hi> Hebr.) <hi>the tents of Kedar;</hi> a very great Interpreter translates it so, <hi>I dwell</hi> As <hi>the tents of Kedar.</hi> i. e. <hi>Like</hi> the inhabitants of the Stony Sun-burnt <hi>Arabia;</hi> whom in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I don't Remember <hi>David</hi> ever was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong.] Accordingly, a people have Three
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:45731:12"/>
Things incumbent on them, if they would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the <hi>Presence</hi> of God.</p>
               <p>First, A People should be <hi>with</hi> God, by <hi>Communion [With] Him.</hi> This tis to be <hi>With</hi> Him; There are Certain meanes of <hi>Communion</hi> between God and us; and <hi>these</hi> we must be continually approaching to Him in. We are <hi>With</hi> God, while we are at <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> before Him; hence in our Context here, it immediately follows, <hi>If you</hi> seek <hi>the Lord, He will be found of you.</hi> While we do <hi>seek</hi> Him, we are <hi>with</hi> Him. The Psalmist was a man much in prayer, and therefore he could say as in Psal. 73. 23. <hi>I am continually</hi> with <hi>thee.</hi> A people much in <hi>Prayer</hi> may say the same, <hi>We are continually</hi> with <hi>the Lord.</hi> A people that will <hi>pray</hi> upon all occasions, a people that will <hi>pray</hi> over all Businesses, a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>that will retire into the Mount for <hi>Prayer</hi> (and <hi>Fasting</hi> too) at every turn; that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is <hi>with</hi> the Lord. And the whole <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> of God must be, diligently, graciously, faithfully frequented by a people that would be <hi>with</hi> Him. We are <hi>with</hi> God, when we are at <hi>His House.</hi> A people should support &amp; esteem, and use all the <hi>Ordinances of God</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. The <hi>Church</hi> of God hath His very special Preseuce in it; the Name of the Church is that in Ezek. 48. 35. <hi>Iehovah Sham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>h,</hi> the Lord <hi>is there.</hi> We should all be <hi>there</hi>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:45731:13"/>
too, and <hi>there</hi> give those Encouragements which are due to the Institutions of God; So shall we be <hi>with</hi> the Lord.</p>
               <p>Secondly, A people should be <hi>with God</hi> by <hi>Activity</hi> [For] <hi>Him.</hi> To be <hi>For</hi> God is to be <hi>with</hi> God. It was once the Summons giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en in Exod. 32. 26. <hi>Who is on the</hi> Lords lide? <hi>And all the Sons of</hi> Levi <hi>gathered themselves;</hi> they were <hi>with</hi> God in doing so. Tis a Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons given to the world in every Generation, <hi>Who is on the Lords side?</hi> They that obey the Summons are <hi>with</hi> the Lord. A people full of Contrivances for the Interest of God, are <hi>with</hi> Him. A people should set themselves to advance the <hi>Glory</hi> of God; they should own His <hi>Truths,</hi> and His <hi>Wayes;</hi> and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to draw all about them into the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of the same. A people should propound the <hi>Glory</hi> of God as their cheef <hi>End</hi> and the main <hi>Scope</hi> of all that they do; and they should think much of no <hi>Cost,</hi> no <hi>Pains,</hi> nor (tho, as a Martyr once ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed himself, <hi>tho' every</hi> hair <hi>on their heads were a life)</hi> should a Thousand <hi>Lives</hi> be dear unto them, in the promoting of it. Then are they <hi>with</hi> the Lord; they are <hi>so,</hi> when God can say of them, as in <hi>Isa.</hi> 43. 10. <hi>Ye are my</hi> Witnesses, <hi>saith the Lord, and my ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly; A people should be <hi>With God,</hi> by
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:45731:13"/>
                  <hi>Behaviour</hi> [Like] <hi>Him.</hi> To be <hi>Like</hi> God is to be <hi>with</hi> God. They that are <hi>with</hi> Him, do not <hi>walk contrary</hi> to Him. God and we should be <hi>One.</hi> A people should have the same <hi>Designs,</hi> the same <hi>Desires,</hi> which the Written Edicts of Heaven declare to be in the blessed God; and not only so, but the same <hi>Vertues</hi> too. Is God <hi>Holy?</hi> Thus a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple should not <hi>bear with them that are evil.</hi> Is God <hi>Righteous?</hi> Thus a people should abhor all <hi>Injustice</hi> and <hi>Oppression.</hi> Is God <hi>Merciful?</hi> Thus a people should be disposed unto all fair acts of <hi>Pitty</hi> and <hi>Kindness.</hi> Then they will be <hi>with</hi> the Lord; and, <hi>O that this people were so</hi> with <hi>Him!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the USE to be now made of what has been delivered.</p>
               <p>Let us all now, <hi>Be</hi> with <hi>God,</hi> that God may <hi>Be</hi> with <hi>us.</hi> I suppose, whatever else we <hi>differ</hi> in, we generally <hi>concur</hi> in that wish, 1. King. 8. 27. <hi>The Lord our God be</hi> with <hi>us, as He was</hi> with <hi>our Fathers, let Him not leave us nor forsake us.</hi> O that we might all as much concur in an endeavourous Resolution, <hi>to be</hi> with <hi>God, as our</hi> Fathers <hi>were</hi> with <hi>Him; not to leave Him, nor forsake him.</hi> There is as much of <hi>New-England</hi> in this great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation as can well be reach'd by the voice of <hi>one</hi> Address; tis indeed, the best part of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:45731:14"/>
                  <hi>New-England,</hi> that is, at least <hi>Represented</hi> in this Assembly. As the great Council at <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi> satt near the Temple, thus the whole Convention of the <hi>Massachusets,</hi> is here come into the <hi>House</hi> of God this day: Wherefore I take the boldness to say, <hi>Hear ye me</hi> Asa, <hi>and all</hi> Judah, <hi>and</hi> Benjamin. The <hi>Cheef Sinner</hi> and <hi>least Preacher</hi> among all your <hi>Sons,</hi> now takes a Liberty to mind you, <hi>That God will be</hi> with you <hi>while you are</hi> with <hi>Him.</hi> Now that we may be all of us inspired with a <hi>Zeal</hi> for this <hi>great thing</hi> this Day,</p>
               <p>Let us Consider, First,</p>
               <p>How <hi>Desirable,</hi> How <hi>Necessary</hi> a Thing it is, that we should have <hi>God with us.</hi> Truly, This is the <hi>Unum Necessarium</hi> of <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nothing is more <hi>Desireable,</hi> for us, than the <hi>Presence</hi> of our God. The Jews have a Fable of their <hi>Manna,</hi> That whatever any man had a mind to tast, he presently found in the Manna a Savour &amp; a Relish of it. It is very true of this Blessed <hi>Presence;</hi> all manner of <hi>Blessings</hi> are enwrapped in it. There is a multitude of Blessings which we are desireous of; but they are all contained in this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive thing: It will give every honest man, all that he wants. <hi>This</hi> will extricate us out of all our <hi>Labyrinths;</hi> This will set all things to rights among us; This will
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:45731:14"/>
wonderfully carry on all the <hi>Salvations</hi> which have been begun for us, by the <hi>God of our Salvations.</hi> If Christ, if God be aboard, our little Vessel will not sink in the gaping, roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, formidable <hi>Waves</hi> now tossing of it. Well did the Apostle say, in Rom. 8. 31. <hi>If God be</hi> for <hi>us, who can be</hi> against <hi>us?</hi> Thus, If God be <hi>with</hi> us, we have <hi>All</hi> for us. <hi>One GOD</hi> will weigh down more than <hi>ten Worlds.</hi> If we have the <hi>Presence</hi> of that God, Who <hi>made</hi> and <hi>moves</hi> the Universe by a <hi>Word;</hi> if we have the <hi>Presence</hi> of that God, Who can <hi>Command</hi> and <hi>Create</hi> our Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, <hi>O most Happy We!</hi> We may then join in such Triumphant Acclamations as that in Psal. 118. 6. <hi>The</hi> Lord <hi>is on my side, I will not fear; what can man do unto me?</hi> We may then defie, even the <hi>Gates of Hell</hi> it self, for, <hi>Cur metuat hominem homo in sinu</hi> Dei <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>situs?</hi> and tho' abroad at this day, <hi>The earth is removing, and the Waters roar, and are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and the mountains are shaking,</hi> splitting, tumbling, <hi>with the swelling thereof;</hi> Tho' the great and the terrible God be at this Day, <hi>coming out of His place,</hi> to make all <hi>Europe</hi> a stage of blood and fire, and make the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons everywhere drink deep of the <hi>Cup</hi> that shall make them giddy with all manner of Confusion &amp; Astonishment; Yet <hi>WE</hi> shall be <hi>helped right early,</hi> for <hi>God is in the midst of us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:45731:15"/>
Add to this; Nothing is more <hi>Necessary</hi> for us, than the <hi>Presence</hi> of God. We are undone, thrice, and four times <hi>Undone,</hi> if we have it not. Methinks I hear the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty GOD with a voice more awful than that of the loudest Thunder, saying over us, as in <hi>Hos.</hi> 9. 12. <hi>Wo to them when I depart from them.</hi> And <hi>Wo</hi> to us indeed; we are in a most <hi>woful</hi> estate, if it come to <hi>that!</hi> How can we endure the mention of it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our most importunate Deprecations, <hi>O our God, leave us not!</hi> We can have a prospect of nothing but horrible Disorders, Agonies and Vexations, if we lose the <hi>Presence</hi> of our Lord: We ly open to no less than a fearful Dissipation, and more than all our <hi>late Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressors</hi> would rejoice to see brought upon us. We have lately been complaining of <hi>Burdens,</hi> that were grievous to us; but I may warn you of our danger to feel one Burden more, which will infinitely exceed them all; tis that in Jer. 23. 33. <hi>What Burden? I will even</hi> forsake <hi>you, saith the Lord.</hi> Behold a <hi>Burden</hi> that will sink us into a bottomless <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biss</hi> of Calamities! The <hi>Presence</hi> of GOD, <hi>This</hi> is no less than the very <hi>Soul</hi> of <hi>New-En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland;</hi> We are <hi>dead</hi> and <hi>gone,</hi> if <hi>that</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw. When <hi>Israel</hi> was nimbly enough possessing themselves of the promised Land, which God had given them such a CHARTER
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:45731:15"/>
for, they perished in the Attempt; for in Deut, 1. 42. <hi>The Lord said, go not up, for I am not</hi> among <hi>you.</hi> Alas, if we don't in the first place look to this, That <hi>God be</hi> among <hi>us,</hi> we cannot avoid all manner of Dissap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments, Desolations.</p>
               <p>Let us Consider, Secondly: What uncomfortable <hi>Symptomes</hi> we have had of <hi>God's not being with us.</hi> It seems as if God had fulfilled that sad Word on this poor Land, in Deut. 31. 17. <hi>I will</hi> forsake <hi>them, and many evils shall befal them, so that they will say in that day, Are not these evils come upon us, because God is not</hi> among <hi>us?</hi> There is a vast number of Calamities, which have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us lamentable cause to fear, <hi>That God has forsaken us.</hi> Why have we suffered such a Blast, both on our <hi>Trade,</hi> and on our <hi>Corn,</hi> that the Husband-man complaines, <hi>I Iooked for much, and lo, it came to little!</hi> and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riner complains, <hi>I went out full, &amp; came home empty!</hi> Tis <hi>Because our God is not among us.</hi> Why have we had <hi>Fire</hi> after <hi>Fire,</hi> laying our Treasures in Ashes? <hi>What means the heat of this Anger,</hi> that <hi>Boston,</hi> the most noble, and vital Bowel of the Territory, hath with a twice repeted <hi>Conflagration</hi> suffered such a Loss of <hi>that</hi> which in the <hi>Body politic</hi> answers to <hi>Blood</hi> in the <hi>Body natural?</hi> Tis <hi>Because</hi>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:45731:16"/>
                  <hi>our God is not among us.</hi> Why have we had <hi>War</hi> after <hi>War,</hi> made upon us by a <hi>Foolish Nation?</hi> Why have the <hi>worst of the Heathen</hi> had renewed advantages to disturb our Peace? And why have so many of our <hi>Brethren</hi> and <hi>Neighbours</hi> been made a prey to the most Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage <hi>Murderers</hi> in the world? It is <hi>Because our</hi> God <hi>is not among us.</hi> Give me leave to say, as in Judg. 6. 12. <hi>If the Lord be with us, why then is all this befallen us?</hi> But we may find <hi>Humiliation</hi> enough to convince us of this deplorable thing, from what we have endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon the <hi>Loss of our Government.</hi> She of old said unto our Lord Jesus, in <hi>I-h.</hi> 11. 21. <hi>Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not dyed.</hi> So, If the Lord had been <hi>here,</hi> tis possible we had not <hi>Died.</hi> If the Lord had been <hi>with</hi> us, would he have made our <hi>Wall</hi> so feeble, that (as they said of <hi>Ierusalem)</hi> the <hi>going up of a poor</hi> Fox <hi>upon it, should break it down?</hi> If the Lord had been <hi>with</hi> us, had all the wild Creatures that passed by this <hi>Vineyard,</hi> found such Opportunities to be plucking at it? No, Our God would have kept us, as <hi>A vineyard of red Wine;</hi> and lest any should have hurt us, <hi>He, (the Lord) would have kept it, night and day.</hi> If the Lord had been <hi>with</hi> us, had you ever thought you had seen cause to <hi>Declare,</hi> as you have lately &amp; justly done, That <hi>a Company of abject strangers had made a meer</hi> Booty <hi>of us?</hi>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:45731:16"/>
Had we ever felt the <hi>sore grievances of an ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal &amp; arbitrary Government?</hi> No; The God of Heaven was not <hi>with</hi> that <hi>oppress'd people,</hi> to whom He said in <hi>Isa.</hi> 1. 7. <hi>Your Countrey is desolate; your land,</hi> Strangers <hi>devour it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What shall I say? It was an Appeal made in <hi>Ioel,</hi> 1. 2. <hi>Hear this, ye</hi> old <hi>men,; hath this been in your dayes?</hi> Even so, I may say to the <hi>old</hi> men within the hearing of it; <hi>My Fathers,</hi> You Remember how we were, when God was <hi>with</hi> us; pray, was it so in <hi>your dayes,</hi> as it has been in <hi>ours?</hi> Were <hi>you</hi> visited with Plague after Plague, in a long <hi>Series</hi> of heavy Judgements, as <hi>We</hi> your poor Children are? Surely, They will tell us; <hi>God is not with us, as He was with them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In all these matters, our Case may at least have some Correspondence with <hi>that</hi> in <hi>Luc.</hi> 23. 28. <hi>He made as though He would havegone; but they constrained Him, saying, Abide with us!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us Consider Thirdly;</p>
               <p>If we are not <hi>With God,</hi> we shall be guilty of an <hi>Apostasie,</hi> and <hi>that</hi> under very shameful, very direful <hi>Aggravations</hi> too.</p>
               <p>We shall be <hi>Apostates,</hi> and O let us not be so, lest our God say, <hi>My soul can have no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in them.</hi> But if we are <hi>so,</hi> we shall be of all Apostates the most <hi>inexcusable</hi> Let us Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, what <hi>Fathers</hi> we have had; they were <hi>with God.</hi> I may say of 'em as in <hi>hos.</hi> 9. 8. They were <hi>with my God:</hi> &amp; they <hi>are gone to</hi> be so <hi>forever.</hi>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:45731:17"/>
What an unaccountable thing will it be for us, to have that Character, which we have been so much cautioned against, <hi>There arose another generation which knew not the Lord?</hi> What? Shall the Grandchildren of <hi>Moses</hi> turn Idolaters? and shall the Children of <hi>Samuel</hi> become the Children of <hi>Belial?</hi> Shall we forget the <hi>Hope of our Fathers,</hi> or forsake our <hi>Fathers Friend?</hi> The very Graves of those blessed men, every <hi>Post,</hi> every <hi>Stone</hi> upon their Graves, is a Witness against us, if we <hi>do.</hi> With dismal Accents, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, their very Ghosts, will groan unto us, <hi>Alas, Is our posterity come to this!</hi> Nay, <hi>Abraham</hi> would be <hi>Ignorant</hi> of us, and <hi>Israel</hi> would not <hi>acknowledge</hi> us, if we should be so degenerate as to lose the <hi>Presence</hi> of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Let us also consider, what <hi>Warnings</hi> we have had. It may be said unto us, as in Jer. 25. 4. <hi>The Lord hath sent unto you all His Servants the prophets.</hi> This Countrey has been blessed with a most faithful Ministry, by which, I suppose, every Assembly in this Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory, has been called upon, to <hi>Be with God, and to keep with Him.</hi> Especially the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons which our ELECTIONS have put the Embassadours of God upon <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>Printing</hi> of; these have been so many loud <hi>Warnings</hi> unto us, <hi>That we leave Him not.</hi>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:45731:17"/>
In them we have been faithfully warned, That <hi>our true Interest is Not to Lye unto God.</hi> We have been Warned, That <hi>the latter end of our Misbehaviours will be Destruction from the Lord.</hi> We have been Warned, That <hi>We must Repent and do our first Works, or have the Candlestick of the Lord Iesus removed from us.</hi> In a word, We have been warned from Heaven, That <hi>If we forsake our God, He will cast us off for ever.</hi> O miserable <hi>We,</hi> if we do it after all.</p>
               <p>These Considerations, will not have their due Force, unless they expire in a Three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold <hi>Request,</hi> which I must now lay before you; and I may justly assert concerning the Things contained therein, They are not <hi>Vain Things,</hi> they are <hi>Our Life.</hi> Wherefore, <hi>Hear ye me,</hi> Asa, <hi>and all</hi> Judah, <hi>&amp;</hi> Benjamin; Hear ye these things, all ye people of the <hi>Massachusetts!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, Let us <hi>Return</hi> to the Lord. We must <hi>Come</hi> to Him, if we would <hi>Be</hi> with Him. We have marvellously backsliden from our God, but He calls after us, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn ye backsliding Children, and I will heal your Backslidings.</hi> O that we may all as one man Reply what is in Jer. 3. 22. <hi>Behold, we come unto thee, for thou art the Lord our God!</hi> If we ask that Question, in Mal. 2. 7. <hi>Wherein</hi>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:45731:18"/>
                  <hi>shall we return?</hi> Methinks, t'were an harder Quaestion, <hi>Wherin should we not?</hi> But, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, We have had a <hi>great voice out of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> in answer thereunto. We have had the Elders and Messengers of our Churches, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven d in a SYNOD, solemnly informing of us, <hi>Wherein we shall Return.</hi> God forbid the Advice of that <hi>Synod,</hi> should only serve to <hi>Convict</hi> us and <hi>Condemn</hi> us, in the Day when He shall take vengeance on us for our <hi>Contemning</hi> of it. <hi>That</hi> were dreadful indeed! But in <hi>Compliance</hi> with it, Let every man seriously now enquire of himself, <hi>What have I done?</hi> Mark what I say, That man who does not suspect himself, of having a share in the <hi>Sins</hi> which have driven away from us the <hi>Presence</hi> of our God; <hi>That man,</hi> I may safely affirm it, is one of the principal <hi>Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers</hi> of this <hi>Israel;</hi> I do without any Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple say it, <hi>Thou art the man.</hi> Let us all then Examine our selves, and set upon the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming</hi> of our own Hearts and Lives, and the <hi>Renewing</hi> of our Covenants with the Lord.</p>
               <p>Indeed, both the <hi>Objects</hi> in which, and the <hi>Authors</hi> from whom we have endured our Calamities, <hi>those</hi> are enough to indigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate what <hi>Sins</hi> they are that have exposed us thereunto. Let me in two or three instances use a plain dealing with you, agreeable to my
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:45731:18"/>
station here this day.</p>
               <p>What have been the <hi>Objects</hi> in which we have been afflicted? Our <hi>Fruits</hi> have been blasted; &amp; were <hi>they</hi> not abused in the exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Sensuality? Our <hi>Lands</hi> have been threat'ned; and were not <hi>They</hi> the Idols, for the sake of which we have offended GOD, and almost Renounced all that was <hi>Holy,</hi> and <hi>Iust</hi> and <hi>Good?</hi> The most happy and easy <hi>Government</hi> in the world, was changed with us, into what has by the most impartial men been confessed to have become <hi>Intolerable;</hi> Why, Did not men despise the <hi>Best</hi> of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, and procure <hi>other things</hi> to be set over them, because they endeavoured to make <hi>Loggs</hi> of what they before enjoyed? To pass on, Were we not in the late unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Extortions of the <hi>Law,</hi> invited to consider, Whether our needless Multiplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Litigious Contentious <hi>Law-Suits,</hi> formerly amongst us, were not a <hi>Scandal</hi> thus chastised? Were we not in the late unsuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable Injuries, Abuses, and Exactions of them, that under the pretence of the <hi>Excise</hi> carried on very outragious Villanies, put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Considering, Whether the <hi>Multitude</hi> or <hi>Quality</hi> of <hi>Drinking-Houses,</hi> in the midst of us, had not once been a <hi>Stumbling-block of our Iniquity!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:45731:19"/>
Again, What have been the <hi>Authors</hi> from whom we have been afflicted? Our Molest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations have risen very much from <hi>Indian</hi> Hands. And Alas, have we not very much <hi>Injured</hi> the <hi>Indians?</hi> I do not mean, by taking from them <hi>Their Land;</hi> For it was Hardly possible they should be more fairly dealt withal than they have been in that particular; but by <hi>Teaching</hi> of them, <hi>Our Vice. We</hi> that should have learn'd them to <hi>Pray,</hi> have learn'd them to <hi>Sin.</hi> Endeavors for their Conversion have by many people been blown upon; but there have been wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked <hi>English,</hi> who have taught them to <hi>drink,</hi> yea, and to <hi>curse,</hi> and <hi>swear;</hi> things which they knew not the meaning of, till they came to <hi>School</hi> unto such <hi>White Pagans</hi> as some that wear the Christian-<hi>Livery</hi> among our selves. And have not we also <hi>Followed</hi> the <hi>Indians?</hi> The Indians are Infamous, especially for Three Scandalous Qualities: They are <hi>Lazy Drones,</hi> and love <hi>Idleness</hi> Exceedingly! <hi>They</hi> are also most impudent <hi>Lyars,</hi> and will invent Reports and Stories at a strange and monstrous rate; and they are out of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure <hi>Indulgent</hi> unto their Children, there is no <hi>Family-Government</hi> among them. But, O how much do our people <hi>Indianize</hi> in every one of those <hi>Abominable things!</hi> We must repent of these our miscarriages, or else our
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:45731:19"/>
God will take up that Resolution concerning us, <hi>I will even for sake them, saith the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Let not <hi>Sin</hi> be <hi>With</hi> us, and <hi>God</hi> will be so. Tis the purpose of our God, in Josh. 7. 12. <hi>I will not be with you except ye destroy the Accursed Thing, from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you,</hi> Let us then <hi>Destroy</hi> that <hi>Accurs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Especially, Let us take heed of the <hi>Sins,</hi> which at this Time, we have a peculiar Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to. It was complain'd in <hi>Hos.</hi> 7. 1. <hi>When I would have healed Israel, the iniquity of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim was discovered.</hi> It has bin <hi>thus,</hi> but God will not be <hi>With</hi> us, if it still be <hi>thus</hi> among our selves. Our good God, the <hi>Lord our Healer,</hi> is now <hi>Healing of</hi> us: O let us not now be impatient patients, lest that our blessed <hi>Physitian</hi> deal hardly and roughly with us. <hi>Impatiens aegrotus</hi> crudelem <hi>facit Medicum.</hi> Let us now no more discover <hi>Revengefulness</hi> against them that have deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Ill</hi> of us. Let the <hi>Law,</hi> and not the <hi>Sword</hi> measure out their due unto them. No more discover an <hi>Unthankfulness</hi> unto them that have deserved <hi>Well</hi> of us. Requite them not with <hi>Censure</hi> and <hi>Hatred</hi> for their unwearied pains to preserve our <hi>Peace.</hi> No more discover a Contempt of the <hi>Ministers,</hi> who set themselves faithfully to <hi>Declare the</hi>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:45731:20"/>
                  <hi>Whole Counsil of God,</hi> and to <hi>Lift up their voice like a Trumpet in shewing us our sins.</hi> They are all agreed (I hope) as one man to <hi>live</hi> and <hi>dye</hi> studying of your Well-fare; but if they are unjustly ill-treated with you, the great God, whose Messengers they are, will take notice of it, and say, <hi>Ye have despised Me!</hi>
