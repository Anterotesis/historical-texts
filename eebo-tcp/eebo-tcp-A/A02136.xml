            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But the reporte of this ruthlesse Tragedie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come to the eares of Ladie <hi>Panthia</hi> (for so was his wife called) she forthwith fell into suche perplexed passions, and was so surprised with sodaine sorrowe, that before the tale could be halfe tolde she fell downe in a traunce, being hardly brought againe to life by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie. Yet at last being come to her self, after she had wept so long that the very fountaine of her teares was dried vp with continuall powring out of sorrowfull plaintes, she then (womanlike) began somewhat to listen to the comfortable counsaile of her friendes, and to applie to her sore that salue that might soonest mittigate her maladie. For through their friendly perswasions very short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly she began to consider, that as to wishe for an impossible thing was but a signe of small wit: so to sorrow without cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing for that whiche could not bee redressed did importe but mere follie: the one being a foe to desire, and y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> other a friend to death.

The Funeralls finished, <hi>Panthia</hi> for a time liued more sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfullie being a widowe then merely being a wife, till at last seeing her mourning Weede began to waxe bare, she thought best both to cast awaie her outwarde coate and her inward care, wisely waighing with her self that it is in vaine to water the Plant when the roote is dead, to aske counsell when the case is distrust, to wishe for raine when the Corne is ripe, and to sigh when no sorrowe can preuaile. The Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar tree remaineth without leaues but twelue daies, and the Date tree but seuen. <hi>Cyrces</hi> loue neuer continued aboue one yeare, and the Tapers in the Temple of <hi>Ianus</hi> burned onely but nine nightes, the call of a Quaile continueth but one quarter, and a widowes sorrowe onely two monethes: in the one sad for her olde mate, and in the other carefull for a newe match.</p>

For she had by <hi>Signior Bonfadio</hi> three daughters, the eldest named <hi>Lacena,</hi> the seconde <hi>Sostrata,</hi> and the yongest <hi>Fioretta,</hi> all so adorned with beautie and indowed with bountie, so framed in bodie and fourmed in minde, eche of them being both in outwarde complexion and inwarde constitution so singular, as hard it was to iudge which held the Supremacie. <hi>Panthia</hi> placing all her felicitie in the exquisite perfection of her three daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, sought to bring them vp so charily and chastly, that all men might like them for their beautie and loue them for their vertue, imitating the good <hi>Lapidaries,</hi> whiche in the purest golde set the most precious stone. While thus solitarily and sadly she past awaie the time amongst her children, <hi>Signior Morando</hi> a Knight, who in his life time had oft serued in the warres with <hi>Bonfadio,</hi> betweene whom there had long been a perfect League of amitie, willing to shewe in the broode h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb facs="tcp:6129:6"/>
and counselling her as his friendes wife, driuen to the one by conscience, and to the other by curtesie. Seing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore she did wholie absent her self from companie, whiche made her dreame on sondrie melancholie motions, he did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uite her and her three Daughters to a graunge house of his seuen miles distant fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Bononia,</hi> whether also diuers gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were bidden, thinking this the fittest meanes to driue her from her sorrowfull dumpes. <hi>Panthia</hi> desirous to let <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnior Morando</hi> vnderstande how greatly she did account of his curtesie, came at the daie appointed to his house, where bothe she and her Daughters were not onely well welcome to <hi>Morando,</hi> but to all the rest of the companie. Amongst whom was <hi>Signior Peratio, Messier Aretyno,</hi> and <hi>Signior don Syluestro,</hi> with others, who sitting downe to dinner and passing awaie the time with pleasaunt parle, it chaunced af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dinner as they sat talking that <hi>Signior Peratio</hi> spied han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging in the Parlera Table most curiously painted: wherein both the Sea and Land was most perfectly pourtraied. The Picture was of <hi>Europa,</hi> the Sea of the <hi>Phenicians</hi> and the Lande of <hi>Sydon:</hi> On the Shoare was a beautifull Medowe, wherein stoode a troupe of daintie Damosells: in the Sea a Bull, vppon whose backe sat a Dame of surpassing beautie sailing towards <hi>Candie,</hi> but looking to the crew of her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions from whom by Sinister meanes she was seperated. The Painter by secrete skill had perfectly with his Pensell desciphered the feature of their faces, as their countenance did seeme to importe bothe feare and hope. For seing their pereles Princesse a praie to suche a prowling Pyrate, they rusht into the Seas (as willing to be partakers of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stres miserie) as farre as feare of such fearfull surges would permit them, but pushed back with the dread of present daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, they stoode vewing how cunningly and caresully the Bull transported his charge: How <hi>Europa</hi> araied in Purple Roabes sat securely and safely holding in her right hand his horne and in her left his taile. About him the <hi>Dolphins</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to leape, the <hi>Syrens</hi> to sing, and <hi>Triton</hi> himself to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph.

                  <hi>Cupid</hi> also in the fourme of a little boy was there most curiously painted, hauing his winges spred, a Quiuer by his side, in one hande a flame of fire, in the other a chain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>
                  <hi>Signior Peratio</hi> hauing long gazed on this gorgcous Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, both praised his perfect skill that had so cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ningly made a counterfait of Nature by Arte, and also mused at the force of Loue that had by conquest caught so worthie a Captiue, that at length as one forced by affection he sighing saied: O Gods that a childe should rule both the Heauen the Sea and the Lande.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don Siluestro</hi> seing <hi>Peratio</hi> so sodainly passionate with the view of a simple Picture, taking occasion herevppon to enter into further parle began to crosse him on this maner.</p>
               <p>Why how now <hi>Peratio</hi> (quoth he) doe you sigh to see <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> so fonde as for lust to abase his dietie, or <hi>Cupid</hi> so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous as by Loue to increase his dignitie: the one she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing himself worse then a man for his follie, the other more then a God for his power.</p>
               <p>No sir (quoth <hi>Morando</hi>) you mistake his meaning, for it fares with him as with <hi>Narcissus,</hi> that was neuer in Loue but when he lookt into the water, or like the Fishe <hi>Mugra</hi> which onely leapeth at the sight of the North starre: <hi>Hypar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chion</hi> neuer sawe any Musicall Instrument but he would sing, nor he any a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The case (quoth he) which we haue to discusse, is a maxime houl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den as true as a holie Oracle: but the doubt is, whether it is to be auerred in men, or verefied in wemen: If the perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the bodie, and the constitution of the mynde, forceth men to loue, more then the greedie desire to gaine, then we haue wonne the feilde, and you lost the combate: and if we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men loue more for beautie and vertue, then for wealthe and riches, wee haue taken the foile, and you wonne the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest. But it was harde for <hi>Achelous</hi> with his shiftes to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile againste <hi>Hercules</hi> because of his strength, and it will be as harde for you to resist my reasons because thei be true. Who so readeth the Romishe Recordes, and Grecian Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and turneth ouer the volumes filled with the reporte of passionate louers, shall finde soundrie Sonnets, sawsed with sorrowfull passions, diuers Ditties declaryng their dumps, carefull complaintes, wofull wailinges, and a thousande sundrie haplesse motions, wherin the poore perplexed louers doe painte out, how the beautie of their mistres, hath ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed their mindes, how their fancie is fettered with their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite perfection: how they are snared with the fourme of her Feature: how the giftes of Nature so bountifully besto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed vppon her, hath intangled their mindes, and bewitched their sences, that her excellent vertue, and singular bountie, hath so charmed their affections, and her rare qualities hath so drowned them in desire, as thei esteeme her courtesie more then Cesars Kingdomes, her loue more then Lordshippes, and her good will more then all worldly wealth. Tushe all Treasure is but trash, in respect of her person. Yea, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the inioying of her perfection, before all the riches of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate <hi>Craesus.</hi> Thus the poore passionate louers whose life hangeth on their Mistres loue, craue onely to feede their fancies with her beautie, and to please their mindes with her vertue. But let the most iniurious Dame, who hath best skill to breath out slaundrous speeches against men, say (if

she can) that she hath euer heard, or red, of any louer that hath desiphered in his ditties, the earnest desire he had to entoye his Mistres, or painted out his passions, that he suffered to gaine his Ladies possessions: now it is a fault committed of most, and omitted of fewe, that men in their loue looke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they leepe, and therefore oftimes fall in the ditche, neuer gaping after the desire of greedie gaine, nor building their fancie vppon the fading goodes of Fortune: so that oft they win such a wife as he maie put her Dowrie in his eye for hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his sight, and her wealth maie be cast without any great count: whereby it is euident, that if a man once fixe his fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie vpon any Dame, no want of wealth, no lacke of liuing can impaire his loue, but he remaineth faithfull in despight of Fortune, wearing this Posie in his Shield, <hi>Non aurum sed amor.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ouid</hi> (quoth she) the Maister of this Arte, who busily bet his braine about setting downe of amorous principles, being demaunded what Loue was, aunswered that it was suche a vaine and inconstant thing, suche a fickle and fonde affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate passion, that he knewe not what it was, from whence it came, nor to what ende it tended: Onely this he was assured of by experience, that to the vnhappie it was a hell, and to the most fortunate (at the least) the losse of freedome. <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creon</hi> said that it was the forgetting of a mans self: whereby his sences are so besotted and his wittes inueagled: he is so suared with vanitie, and so fettered with follie, as he greede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie seeketh to gaine that thing, whiche at last turneth to his extreme losse. For who so yeeldeth himself as a flaue to loue, bindeth himself in fetters of golde: and if his sute haue good successe, yet he leadeth his life in glistring miserie. For loue according to the definition of the Philosophers, is nothing els but the desire of Beautie: so that the beginning, middest, and ende of loue, is to croppe the bitter sweete bud of Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: which how pleasaunt so euer it be in the mouth, yet so pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous in the maw, that he neuer or seldome digesteth it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out daunger both of his purse and person. Beautie the onely <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

vpon Beautie, escape without mishappe or miserie: so that I conclude, the Louer in liew of his toyle getteth suche gaine, as he that reapeth the beautifull Apples of <hi>Tantalus,</hi> which are no soner toucht but they turne to Ashes. If this trash the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be the treasure whiche Louers desire so greedily to gaine, no doubt their winninges shall be muche like to his, which sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing to embrace <hi>Iuno,</hi> caught nothyng but a vaine vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shyng Cloude. This considered, he hath either his sences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sotted, or els is blinded with selfwill, whiche seeth not the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buses in Loue and follie of Louers: whose life is so pestered with continuall passions and combred with suche haplesse cares, as it is to be counted nothyng but a very masse of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie: They spende the daie in dumpes and the night in dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, seeking much and finding little: gaping after that which they seldome gaine: and which if they get proueth at length but losse.</p>
               <p>Tis true in trothe (quoth <hi>Peratio</hi>) for of all follies, loue is the greatest fondnesse, and especially in those whiche are coumpted truest Louers: who if they want of their will, and misse of their wishe, pine awaie in hellishe pennurie, and though their mistres rewarde them with hate, yet they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer make an ende of their loue but by death. Such loue in my opinion, no wise man either will or can commende, for if to loue were good, as is now in question, yet tis a proued principle <hi>Omne nimium vertitur in vitium,</hi> therefore if euer I loue I will keepe a meane, neither to hie least I suspecte with <hi>Cephalus,</hi> nor to lowe least I mislike with <hi>Minos,</hi> and especially I would not exceede, for I thinke of Louers, as <hi>Diogenes</hi> did of Dauncers, who beyng asked how he liked them, answered: the better the woorse.</p>
               <p>This pleasant conceipt of <hi>Peratio</hi> made <hi>Morando</hi> and all the companie to laugh, seeyng how bitterly he began to bob <hi>Siluestro</hi> on the thumbes, who throughly chafed, burst foorth into these tearmes.</p>

The Philosophers who haue sought precisely to set out the perfect Anotomie of pure loue, who set downe by pen that whiche before they tried by experience, weighyng wisely the straunge affectes and force of loue, and feeling in them selues the puissance of his power, iustly cannonised that sacred essence for a God, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing vnto it the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Is there any thyng which man esteemeth more then libertie: Nay, doth he not account it dearer then life: and is not Loue the losse thereof, and the meanes to leade him into an endlesse Laberinth? Doth it not fetter him that is free, and thrall the quiet minde in perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all bondage? Is there any thyng to be found in Loue but lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wring, care, calamitie, sorrowe, sighes, woe, waylinges, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaintes and miserie? What breedeth frenzie and bringeth furie but Loue? What maketh the wise foolishe, and fooles more fond but Loue? What besotteth the senses? What bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth

the braine? What weakeneth the witte? What dusseth the memorie? What fadeth the strength? Nay, what leadeth a man to ruth and ruine but Loue? And yet forsooth no lesse then a GOD <hi>Dido</hi> had ended her golden daies with ioye in gallaunt <hi>Carthage. Phillis</hi> had neuer desperatly procured her owne death. <hi>Ariadne</hi> had not miserablie died in the soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie Desertes. <hi>Medea</hi> had raigned royally as Queene of <hi>Colchos.</hi> Yea, innumerable others had enioyed more felicitie or tasted lesse miserie, if this cruell monster Loue had not wrought their mishappe. For as soone as it once inueagleth the wit and bewitcheth the sences, it maketh straight a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphosis of the poore Louers minde: he then rageth as though he were haunted with some hellishe Hagge, or posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with some franticke Furie, like one inchaunted with some Magicall charme, or charmed with some bewitchyng Sorcerie, yea, he is perplexed with a thousande sundrie pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soons: first free, and then fettered: alatc swimming in rest, and now sincking in care: erewhile in securitie, and then in cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitie: yea, turned from mirth to mournyng: from pleasure to paine: from delight to despight: hatyng themselues and louyng others, who is the chief cause of this their calamitic. Fulfillyng the saying of <hi>Propertius,</hi> that to loue howsoeuer it be is to loose, and to fancie how charie soeuer the choice be is to haue an ill chaunce: For Loue though neuer so faithful is but a Chaos of care, and fancie though neuer so fortunate is but a M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

and though ye fill their eares with your fond reasons, yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I haue pulde backe the vale, euery one shall see they are but mere shadowes. You reason first of the definition of loue, saying: that it is no other thyng but the desire of Beautie: whiche if I graunt, what then forsooth: by an odd induction you conclude that Beautie is the breeder of mishappe, and therefore Loue the bringer of miserie: but I neither affirme the one nor graunt vnto the other. For <hi>Plato</hi> being demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in what thinges we most resemble the Gods, aunswered in Wisedome and Beautie: esteeming Wisedome the onely Iemme whiche inricheth the minde, and Beautie the onely Iewel that adorneth the bodie. Yea, <hi>Seuere Socrates</hi> said, that the Gods in framing of Beautie skipt beyond their skill, in that the maker was subiect to the thing made: for the Gods themselues haue been so subiect to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> glittering hue of Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as they haue been forcst to forsake their celestiall Sphea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, for to enioye so precious a treasure, yea, to make a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphosis of their dietie into humane shape: as <hi>Iupiter</hi> did by turning into a Bull to croppe the beautie of <hi>Europa:</hi> And thinke you then (<hi>Sostrata</hi>) you haue not bothe committed an hainous offence in blaspheming so deuine a thing, and also been greatly deceiued in thinking light of Loue, whiche ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to no other ende but to the obtaining of so deuine a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. Further, you count euery vertue in Loue to be vanitie: euery strawe to be a stumbling stocke: euery little Molehill to be a greate M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Shall therefore the Philosophers life bee contemned, because it is fraught with trouble? Shall the Marchauntes staie, or the Martiall state be despised, because the one is subiect to daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and the other to death? No, if this maie bee concluded it will breede a confusion in all estates. Shall then Loue bee thought leaud, because poore passionate Louers be readie to beare the burthen of all misfortune, to the ende to attchiue so royall a rewarde as Beautie? No, for he is to bee thought a fearfull dastard whom any worldly muck doth deceiue, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any hard attempt doth withdraw, or any humble praier doth withholde from attaining the toppe of his desire. Cease then (<hi>Sostrata</hi>) to blaspheme against Beautie sith it is deuine. Leaue of to inueigh against Loue, since it is a labour fit for the Gods: otherwise thou shalt be thought to be more wilfull then wise, and to spitt out these bitter speeches more of can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred spight then of any iust cause.</p>
               <p>Well (quoth <hi>Aretino</hi>) if that testie <hi>Tyanens</hi> were aliue, who was the contemner of Beautie, the despraiser of Loue, despiser of fancie, and the detester of all suche amorous socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and heard <hi>Siluestro</hi> tell this tale, no doubt he would not onely turne his tippet, recant his hereticall opinion, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade others to honor beautie, but he himself would become a Louer.</p>

               <p>It is a principle (quoth he) amongst the naturall Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers, that men by their constitution are indewed with a more perfect and stronger complexion then wemen, beeing more apt to endewer labour and trauaile, and lesse subiect to effeminate pleasure and pastime: hauing their hartes more hardened to withstande any kinde of passion, and lesse molli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to receiue any patheticall impression.

                  <hi>Cupid</hi> intending to reuenge himself vpon <hi>Apollo,</hi> for disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering the adultrie betweene his mother and <hi>Mars,</hi> was faine to spend many of his chiefest dartes ere he could strike him in loue with <hi>Daphne:</hi> but as the blinde boy pleasauntly sported with his mother, by chaunce he raced her breast with the tippe of his arrowe, whiche no sooner toucht her but she was deepely in loue with her darling <hi>Adonis.</hi> In fine, all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and estates haue yéelded sufficient proofes to confirme my premisses, so that I neede not alledge any more reasons, but conclude with the saying of <hi>Martiall,</hi> whiche affirmeth three thinges neuer to bee parted <hi>Mulier, Amor, &amp; incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tush (quoth <hi>Fioretta</hi>) all this wind shakes no corne, your Antecedent infers no necessary Consequent, for if I graunt that diuers Dames haue bene sodainly suprised with fancie, may you therefore conclude, that wemen are more subiecte vnto affection then men, this were <hi>Aretino</hi> to absurde an argument: But to confirme my reasons with a plaine proofe whiche we bothe see and knowe by daily experience. Are not men faine, beyng them selues once fiered with fancie to seeke and sue, to watch and warde, to prate, to parle to, pray, to protest, to sweare, to forsweare, yea, to vse a thousand son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie shiftes to alure a simple maide vnto loue: Doe they not seeke to hale her vnto their hooke, with diuers new deuises. Some practise musicke to inueagle their mindes, playng in the nyght vnder their windowes, with Lutes, Citrons, and Bandoras. Some Tornay and Iust: that by their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode they maie alure them to loue. Some painte out their passions in Songes and Sonets, to moue them vnto mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie: none saying they are to pittifull, but all exclaimyng of their crueltie. The poore woman notwithstandyng, is so vnwillyng to yeeld vnto loue, that she is hardly induced to fancie by all these flattryng alurementes, whereas the man is fiered with euery new face, fettered with euery newe fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, in loue at euery looke, yea, they cannot <hi>Accedere ad ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem,</hi> but they doe straight <hi>Galescere plus quam satis</hi> so that it
<pb facs="tcp:6129:23"/>
is harde to finde a man, but he is either fraught with loue or, flatterie.</p>
               <p>Not so <hi>Fioretta</hi> (quoth <hi>Siluestro</hi>) conclude not so stricktly, for to loue (I graunt) is proper to men, but to flatter belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to wemen.</p>
               <p>Why (quoth <hi>Peratio</hi>) dare you blaspheme so broadely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst that noble sexe, take head, if your mistres heare of this fond sensure, she hang not the lip.</p>
               <p>This is small to the purpose (quoth <hi>Morando</hi>) whether men faine or wemen flatter, it is not the marke we shoote at. Sith Madame <hi>Panthia,</hi> these two champions haue so man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully behaued themselues within the listes, that as yet the combate hangeth in suspence, to whiche of them shall wee Iudges of this quarrell assigne the conquest?</p>
