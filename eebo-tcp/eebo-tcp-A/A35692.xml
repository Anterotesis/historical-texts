         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

14 miles long, and two broad. It is bounded
with <hi>Long</hi>-Iſland on the South, with <hi>Staten</hi>-Iſland on

Which the Countrey-people perceiving, inſtantly
arm themſelves with bottles of Wine, Cream, and
Sugar, and in ſtead of a Coat of Male, every one
takes a Female upon his Horſe behind him, and ſo
ruſhing violently into the fields, never leave till
they have diſrob'd them of their red colours, and
turned them into the old habit.</p>
            <p>The greateſt part of the Iſland is very full of
Timber, as Oaks white and red, Walnut-trees, Cheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut-trees,
which yield ſtore of Maſt for Swine, and
are often therewith ſufficiently fatted with Oat-Corn:
as alſo Maples, Cedars, Saxifrage, Beach,
Birch, Holly, Hazel, with many ſorts more.</p>
            <p>The Herbs which the Countrey naturally afford,
are Purſlain, white Orage, Egrimony, Violets, Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niroyal,

nay, did we know the vertue of all thoſe Plants

with bars of ſands and ſholes, that it is a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
defence againſt any enemy, yet the South-ſide
is not without Brooks and Riverets, which empty

a mile, but you ſhall meet with one of them whoſe
Chriſtal ſtreams run ſo ſwift, that they purge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
of ſuch ſtinking mud and filth, which the ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or low-paced ſtreams of moſt brooks and rivers
weſtward of this Colony leave lying, and are by
the Suns exhalation diſſipated, the Air corrupted,
and many Fevers and other diſtempers occaſioned,
not incident to this Colony: Neither do the Brooks
and Riverets premiſed, give way to the Froſt in
Winter, or draught in Summer, but keep their
courſe throughout the year.</p>
            <p>Theſe Rivers are very well furniſhed with Fiſh,
as Boſſe, Sheepſheads, Place, Pearch, Trouts, Eels,
Turtles, and divers others.</p>

            <p>They live principally by Hunting, Fowling, and
Fiſhing: their Wives being the Husbandmen to till
the Land, and plant their corn.</p>
            <p>The meat they live moſt upon is Fiſh, Fowl, and
Veniſon; they eat likewiſe Polecats, Skunks, Racoon,
Poſſum, Turtles, and the like.</p>
            <p>They build ſmall moveable Tents, which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
two or three times a year, having their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
quarters where they plant their Corn: their
Hunting quarters, and their Fiſhing quarters: Their
Recreations are chiefly Foot-ball and Cards, at
which they will play away all they have, excepting a
Flap to cover their nakedneſs: They are great lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of ſtrong drink, yet do not care for drinking,
unleſs they have enough to make themſelves drunk;
and if there be ſo many in their Company, that there
is not ſufficient to make them all drunk, they uſually
ſelect ſo many out of their Company, proportionable
to the quantity of drink, and the reſt muſt be Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators.
And if any one chance to be drunk be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

Their money is made of a Periwinkle ſhell of which

when their corn is firſt ripe, the day being
appointed by their chief prieſt or pawaw; moſt of

congregated, their prieſt tells them if he want mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
there God will accept of no other offering, which
the people beleeving, every one gives money accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

and putting it into ſome diſhes, ſets them upon the
top of their low flat-roofed houſes, and falls to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocating
their God to come and receive it, which
with a many loud hallows and outcries, knocking the
ground with ſticks, and beating themſelves, is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by the prieſt, and ſeconded by the people.</p>
            <p>After they have thus a while wearied themſelves,
the prieſt by his Conjuration brings in a devil a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt

the people being amazed, not daring to ſtir, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves
the opportunity, ſteps out, and makes ſure
of the money, and then returns to lay the ſpirit,
who in the mean time is ſometimes gone, and takes
ſome of the Company along with him: but if any
<hi>Engliſh</hi> at ſuch times do come amongſt them, it puts
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:97866:7"/>
a period to their proceeding, and they will deſire
their abſence, telling them their God will not come
whilſt they are there.</p>
            <p>In their wars they fight no pitcht fields, but
when they have notice of an enemies approach, they
endeavor to ſecure their wives and children upon
ſome Iſland, or in ſome thick ſwamp, and then with
their guns and hatchets they way-lay their enemies,
ſome lying behind one, ſome another, and it is a
great fight where ſeven or eight is ſlain.</p>
            <p>When any <hi>Indian</hi> dies amongſt them, they bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
him upright, ſitting upon a ſeat, with his
Gun, money, and ſuch goods as he hath with him,
that he may be furniſhed in the other world, which
they conceive is Weſtward, where they ſhall have
great ſtore of Game for Hunting and live eaſie
lives. At his Burial his neareſt Relations attend
the Hearſe with their faces painted black, and do
viſit the grave once or twice a day, where they ſend
forth ſad lamentations ſo long, till time hath wore
the blackneſs off their faces, and afterwards every
year once they view the grave, make a new mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for him, trimming up of the Grave, not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
of a Graſs to grow by it: they fence their
graves with a hedge, and cover the tops with Mats,
to ſhelter them from the rain.</p>
            <p>Any <hi>Indian</hi> being dead, his Name dies with him,

being not only a breach of their Law, but an abuſe
to his friends and relations preſent, as if it were
done on purpoſe to renew their grief: And any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
perſon whatſoever that is named after that
name doth incontinently change his name, and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:97866:8"/>
takes a new one, their names are not proper ſet
names as amongſt Chriſtians, but every one invents
a name to himſelf, which he likes beſt. Some calling

like: And if a perſon die, that his name is ſome word
which is uſed in ſpeech, they likewiſe change that
word, and invent ſome new one, which makes a
great change and alteration in their language.</p>
            <p>When any perſon is ſick, after ſome means uſed by
his friends, every one pretending skill in Phyſick;
that proving ineffectual, they ſend for a Pawaw or
Prieſt, who ſitting down by the ſick perſon, without
the leaſt enquiry after the diſtemper, waits for a
gift, which he proportions his work accordingly to:
that being received, he firſt begins with a low voice
to call upon his God, calling ſometimes upon one,
ſometimes on another, raiſing his voice higher and
higher, beating of his naked breaſts and ſides, till the
ſweat runneth down, and his breath is almoſt gone,
then that little which is remaining, he evaporates
upon the face of the ſick perſon three or four times
together, and ſo takes his leave.</p>
            <p>Their Marriages are performed without any Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony,
the Match being firſt made by money. The
ſum being agreed upon and given to the woman, it
makes a conſummation of their Marriage, if I may
ſo call it: After that, he keeps her during his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
and upon the leaſt diſlike turns her away and
takes another: It is no offence for their married
women to lie with another man, provided ſhe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
her husband, or ſome of her neareſt Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
with it, but if not, it is accounted ſuch a fault
that they ſometimes puniſh it with death: An <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi>
may have two wives or more if he pleaſe; but

to imitate the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in things both good and

whom ſhe pleaſe for money, without any ſcandal, or
the leaſt aſperſion to be caſt upon her, it being ſo cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomary,
and their laws tolerating of it. They are
extraordinary charitable one to another, one having
nothing to ſpare, but he freely imparts it to his
friends, and whatſoever they get by gaming or any
other way, they ſhare one to another, leaving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
commonly the leaſt ſhare.</p>
            <p>At their <hi>Cantica</hi>'s or dancing Matches, where all
perſons that come are freely entertaind, it being a
Feſtival time: Their cuſtom is when they dance, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one but the Dancers to have a ſhort ſtick in
their hand, and to knock the ground and ſing alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
whilſt they that dance ſometimes act war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
poſtures, and then they come in painted for War
with their faces black and red, or ſome all black, ſome
all red, with ſome ſtreaks of white under their eyes,
and ſo jump and leap up and down without any or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
uttering many expreſſions of their intended va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.
For other Dances they only ſhew what Antick
tricks their ignorance will lead them to, wringing of
their bodies and faces after a ſtrange manner, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
jumping into the fire, ſometimes catching up a
Fire-brand, and biting off a live coal, with many ſuch
tricks, that will affright, if not pleaſe an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man
to look upon them, reſembling rather a company of
infernal Furies then men. When their King or <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem</hi>
ſits in Council, he hath a Company of armed

after he hath declared his minde, tells them he hath

done: no man ever interrupting any perſon in his
ſpeech, nor offering to ſpeak, though he make ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſo many or long ſtops, till he ſays he hath no

opinions, the King after ſome pauſe gives the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitive
ſentence, which is commonly ſeconded with
a ſhout from the people, every one ſeeming to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud,
and manifeſt their Aſſent to what is determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
If any perſon be condemned to die, which is

goes out in perſon (for you muſt underſtand they
have no priſons, and the guilty perſon flies into the

found him, the King ſhoots firſt, though at never

him down, and cut off his <hi>Long,</hi> which they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
wear, who for his pains is made ſome Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
or other military Officer.</p>
            <p>Their Cloathing is a yard and an half of broad
Cloth, which is made for the <hi>Indian</hi> Trade, which
they hang upon their ſhoulders; and half a yard of
the ſame cloth, which being put betwixt their legs,
and brought up before and behinde, and tied with
a Girdle about their middle, hangs with a flap on
each ſide: They wear no Hats, but commonly
wear about their Heads a Snake's skin, or a Belt of
their money, or a kind of a Ruff made with Deers
hair, and died of a ſcarlet colour, which they eſteem
very rich.</p>
            <p>They greaſe their bodies and hair very often, and

            <p>Some may admire, that theſe great and rich
Tracts of land, lying ſo adjoyning to <hi>New-England</hi>

            <p>To which I anſwer, that whilſt it was under the

the <hi>Dutch</hi> being almoſt always in danger of
them; and their <hi>Bever</hi>-trade not admitting of a
War, which would have been deſtructive to their
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:97866:11"/>
trade, which was the main thing proſecuted by the
<hi>Dutch.</hi> And ſecondly, the <hi>Dutch</hi> gave ſuch bad
Titles to Lands, together with their exacting of the
Tenths of all which men produced off their Land,
that did much hinder the populating of it; together
with that general diſlike the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have of living
under another Government; but ſince the reduce<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment

            <p>To give ſome ſatisfaction to people that ſhall be
deſirous to tranſport themſelves thither, (the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
being capabl of entertaining many thouſands,)
how and after what manner people live, and how
land may be procured, &amp;c. I ſhall anſwer, that the
uſual way, is for a Company of people to joyn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together,
either enough to make a Town, or a leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
number; Theſe go with the conſent of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor,
and view a Tract of Land, there being choice
enough, and finding a place convenient for a Town,
they return to the Governour, who upon their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
admits them into the Colony, and gives them
a Grant or Patent for the ſaid Land, for themſelves
and Aſſociates. Theſe perſons being thus qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
ſettle the place, and take in what inhabitants to
themſelves they ſhall ſee cauſe to admit of, till their
Town be full; theſe Aſſociates thus taken in have
equal priviledges with themſelves, and they make a

and Building, with Nails, Hinges, Glaſs, and the
like; For the manner how they get a livelihood, it
is principally by Corn and Cattel, which will there
fetch them any Commodities; likewiſe they ſowe
ſtore of Flax, which they make every one Cloth of
for their own wearing, as alſo woollen Cloth, and
Linſey-woolſey, and had they more Tradeſmen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them, they would in a little time live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the help of any other Conntrey for their
Clothing; For Tradeſmen there is none but
live happily there, as Carpenters, Blackſmiths,

that have no Trade betake themſelves to Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry,

            <p>Thus have I briefly given you a Relation of

In which, if I have err'd, it is principally in not
giving it its due commendation; for beſides
thoſe earthly bleſſings where it is ſtor'd, Heaven
hath not been wanting to open his Treaſure, in
ſending down ſeaſonable ſhowres upon the Earth,
bleſſing it with a ſweet and pleaſant Air, and
a Continuation of ſuch Influences as tend to
the Health both of Man and Beaſt: and the
Climate hath ſuch an affinity with that of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
that it breeds ordinarily no alteration to
thoſe which remove thither; that the name
of ſeaſoning, which is common to ſome other
Countreys hath never there been known; That I
may ſay, and ſay truly, that if there be any
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:97866:12"/>
terreſtrial happineſs to be had by people of all ranks,
eſpecially of an inferior rank, it muſt certainly be
here: here any one may furniſh himſelf with land,
and live rent-free, yea, with ſuch a quantity of
land, that he may weary himſelf with walking over
his fields of Corn, and all ſo<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſtock of Cattel amount to ſome hundreds, he needs
not fear their want of paſture in the Summer, or
Fodder in the Winter, the Woods affording ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
ſupply. For the Summer-ſeaſon, where you
have graſs as high as a mans knees, nay, as high as
his waſte, interlaced with Pea <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ines and other weeds
that Cattel much delight in, as much as a man can
preſs thorough; and theſe woods alſo every mile or
half-mile are furniſhed with freſh ponds, brooks,
or rivers, where all ſorts of Cattel, during the heat
of the day, do quench their thirſt and cool them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
theſe brooks and rivers being invironed of
each ſide with ſeveral ſorts of trees and Grape-vines,
the Vines, Arbor-like, in re-changing places and croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
theſe rivers, does ſhade and ſhelter them from
the ſcorching beams of <hi>Sols</hi> fiery influence: Here

to deny them an inheritance amongſt their Brethren,
or ſuch as by their utmoſt labors can ſcarcely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure

of land, and poſſeſſions, ſtock themſelves with
all ſorts of Cattel, enjoy the benefit of them whilſt
they live, and leave them to the benefit of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
when they die: Here you need no trouble the
Shambles for meat, nor Bakers and Brewers for Beer
and Bread, nor run to a Linnen-Draper for a ſupply,
every one making their own Linnen, and a great part
of their woollen-cloth for their ordinary wearing:
And how prodigal, if I may ſo ſay, hath Nature been
to furniſh the Countrey with all ſorts of wilde Beaſts
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:97866:12"/>
and Fowle, which every one hath an intereſt in, and
may hunt at his pleaſure; where beſides the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
in hunting, he may furniſh his houſe with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent

Cranes, Swans, Ducks, Pidgeons, and the like:
and wearied with that, he may go a Fiſh<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Rivers are ſo furniſhed, that he may ſupply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
with Fiſh before he can leave off the Recreation:
Where you may travel by Land upon the ſame Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
hundreds of miles, and paſſe thorough Towns
and Villages, and never hear the leaſt complaint for
want, nor hear any ask you for a farthing: there
you may lodge in the fields and woods, travel from
one end of the Countrey to another, with as much
ſecurity as if you were lockt within your own Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
And if you chance to meet with an <hi>Indian</hi>-Town,
they ſhall give you the beſt entertainment
they have, and upon your deſire, direct you on your
way: But that which adds happineſs to all the reſt,
is the Healthfulneſs of the place, where many people
in twenty years time never know what ſickneſs is:
where they look upon it as a great mortality if two
or three die out of a town in a years time; where
beſides the ſweetneſs of the Air, the Countrey it ſelf
ſends forth ſuch a fragrant ſmell, that it may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
at Sea before they can make the Land: where
no evil fog or vapour doth no ſooner appear, but a
North weſt or Weſterly winde doth immediately diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
it, and drive it away: What ſhall I ſay more?
you ſhall ſcarce ſee a houſe, but the South ſide is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>girt
with Hives of Bees, which increaſe after an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
manner: That I muſt needs ſay, that if there
be any terreſtrial <hi>Canaan,</hi> 'tis ſurely here, where the
Land floweth with milk and honey. The inhabitants
are bleſt with Peace and plenty, bleſſed in their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
bleſſed in their Fields, bleſſed in the Fruit of

labours.</p>
            <p>Were it not to avoid prolixity I could ſay a great
