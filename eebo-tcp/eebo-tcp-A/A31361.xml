         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>FOrasmuch as the Lord hath been pleased to permit
Thee to sit upon Thy Fathers Throne, and to sway
the Scepter in <hi>England,</hi> after Thy sojourning some
years in a strange Land, where Thou was invironed
with strangers, and sometimes compassed about with many
fears, and then did grief with sorrow of mind attend Thee,
when Thy Subjects had dissented from Thee, Thy enemies
prevailed over Thee, and Thy trusty Friends obstructed
from communicating of their substance to Thee, thereby
to have done Thee a pleasure: Dost Thou not yet remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
how Thou was in those days dejected and cast down in
Thy Spirit, when there was scarce hope remaining, of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
seeing such a day as this? And was there not then also
much commiseration in Thy heart (in the day of Thy affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
when Thou was a sufferer Thy self) towards suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
people? And didst Thou not then cry out against the
oppression wherewith Thy Friends were oppressed, that
could not conform in all things to the powers that then
were the Supreme in the Nation of <hi>England?</hi> And was it
not an evil, in Thy own judgement, in them then, that
would not let people have their liberty to worship God in
that way of which they were the most perswaded in their
own hearts, that it was according to the way of God; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they desired to have the Common-Prayer-Book, or
the Directory, or to have their liberty to worship God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
either of these, in Spirit and in Truth, which were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
these were made, and in which the Saints worshipped
God before these were framed or composed? Now certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
if it was an evil in them to debar people of their liberty in
things appertaining unto the Worship of God, then must it
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64561:3"/>
also be an evil now in them that will not give liberty to,
tender consciences in matters of worship which tendeth not
to the breach of the peace of the Kingdom. And inasmuch
(O King) as Thou Thy-self hath found by experience an
excellency in the liberty that was afforded Thee with Thy
Friends in the time of Your exilement, in things appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unto your Worship: It is therefore the more hoped by
some that thou wilt yet excel other Princes in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
considering Thy own condition: Surely if Thou, with
those that out of love to Thee, exposed themselves to the
inconveniency of exilement with Thee, had not been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
to refide in any place, except You had been confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
to their Religion, and by an Oath to have bound
your selves to have been true and fa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>thful unto their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline,
though it had been contrary to your consciences,
this would by You have been accounted hard measure; nay
moreover not only to have been debarred of your liberty
in the place, but also to have forfeited your goods, chattels
and your whole substance unto the Supreme Mag<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>strate of
that place, except you would have acted contrary to your
consciences; surely you would not have approved well of
this, neither would you have had it thus done unto
you.</p>
                  <p>And now be it known to Thee (O King) that the Lord
God of Heaven and Earth hath a little Flock in that Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
(where the Lord hath set Thee to sway the Scepter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
they are exceeding dear unto him, and pretious in his sight,
for they tender his Glory more than their natural lives,
&amp; his Commands more than their liberty: wherefore if thou
desire that it may be well with Thee, and that Thy dayes
may be prolonged in Thy Realm, be cautious how Thou
layeth Thy hand upon them, as thereby to afflict them; or
of suffering them to be oppressed by the Laws of Thy King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
for abiding in the Doctrine of their Lord, For it hath
been upon me from Him to signifie to Thee, That if thou
suffer them to incurr the danger of <hi>premunirae</hi> upon them
for abiding in the Doctrine of Christ, Know, from the Lord,
that their <hi>Estates, their goods and their Chattels</hi> shall not make
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64561:3"/>
Thee rich, neither will they be blessed to Thee; and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
if they be excluded out of Thy protection for doing
the will of their <hi>Master</hi> and for obeying his Command,
they shall not therefore be shut out of the Protection of
their God, who is both mighty to save, and mighty to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver;
And if thou should exclude Thy self out of His pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
by Thy sinning against Him, and oppressing His peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
then all Thy Forces under Thy Command within Thy
Dominions, would not be able to deliver Thee out of the
hands of Thy enemies, nor yet to preserve Thy Treasures
out of the hands of spoilers.</p>
                  <p>It is well known already upon this side of the Seas, what
a snare the <hi>Oaths of Allegiance</hi> and <hi>Supremacy</hi> are made unto
the People of the Lord within Thy Dominions, and how
that many of them are already cast into the common Goals
for refusing to take them. Even as it was in the dayes of
<hi>Oliver Cromwel;</hi> many of them were cast in prison (by such
as acted in his name) for not taking the <hi>Oath of Abjuration,</hi>
and other Oaths; And because they did not take it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
were they deemed to be Jesuites, by such as made that
a snare for this People, even as they now that act in Thy
Name make the <hi>Oaths</hi> before mentioned, a snare to this
People; and because they now take not these, therefore
are they now deemed to be <hi>Popish Recusants,</hi> as before they
were supposed to be Jesuites, when that some of them who
was accused to be Jesuites had never learned the <hi>Accedence;</hi>
and so were far from being Jesuites; and now many of
them are judged to be <hi>Popish Recusants,</hi> who peradventure
do not know what a Popish Recusant is: Moreover it is
well known that many Popish Recusants in the Nation go
free, and have not these <hi>Oaths</hi> tendred them, yet through
the envie of many that are in Authority, this People before
mentioned are brought into external trouble about this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing, which they are clear of, as they may see, that do
understand the true intent and meaning of the Act, which
was made <hi>Anno tertio Iacobi Regis,</hi> chap. 4. <hi>For the better dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
and repressing of Popish Recusants,</hi> in which Act <hi>the
Oath of Allegiance</hi> is contained; and as for the other Act
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64561:4"/>
made <hi>Anno primo Reginae Elizabethae</hi> in order to the <hi>restoring
to the Crown, &amp;c.</hi> wherein <hi>the Oath of Supremacy</hi> is contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
This also is wrested, and made as a snare to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
before mentioned, when no <hi>places of Office are conferred
upon them,</hi> neither do they nor none of them (that I know
of) receive thy <hi>Fees</hi> nor <hi>Wages,</hi> and therefore not of those to
whom the Oath of Supremacy is to be tendred; For they
are known to be credible men that feareth God, and are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
against all <hi>Treasons, Plots and treacherous Conspiracies,</hi>
whatsoever, both against Thee and all men, whose <hi>Yea,</hi> is
as much to them, yea more than many mens Oaths are to
them that will Swear; wherefore they might well be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in and credited, for of their fidelity and innocency
the Nation hath had much proof already; So that if it
were not more out of malice to them, than out of love to
Thee, or jealousie of them, these <hi>Oaths</hi> before mentioned
would not be so frequently tendred to them by those that
act in Thy Name, who might easily be prevented from
troubling this peaceable people in this matter, by a few
lines from Thee, being issued forth as an Order to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
by Thee, and thereby a stop might be put in part to
the prosecution of that wickednesse which is in the hearts
of many in Authority at this day against this innocent peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
who I do assure Thee are no <hi>Popish Recusants,</hi> and this
I shall endeavour to manifest clearly to Thy understanding
by some few plain and simple (yet sound) Arguments, as</p>
                  <p>First, If they were <hi>Popish Recusants,</hi> then would they own
a mortal man to be the head of the Church, and the Church
to be under the obedience of the <hi>Pope of Rome;</hi> but they
own Christ Jesus only (who is immortal) to be the head of
the Church, and it to be wholly under his obedience, and
not under the <hi>Popes of Rome,</hi> and therefore are they no <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
Recusants.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, If they were <hi>Popish Recusants,</hi> then would they
swear and take oaths before Magistrates, if it were required
of them; but they will not swear in no wise, though there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
required by Magistrates, though they suffer for it, but
do abide in the Doctrine of Christ, who said, <hi>Swear not at all,</hi>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:64561:4"/>
and him they chuse to obey rather than Magistrates that
require to Swear, and therefore are they no <hi>Popish Recusants.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If they were <hi>Popish Recusants,</hi> then would they
how to Images, worship them, and honour them that are
the works of mens hands: but they bow to no Image, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do they worship or honour any Image which is made
with mens hands, <hi>in the likenesse of any thing in heaven above,
or in the earth beneath;</hi> And therefore are they no <hi>Popish Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusants.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, If they were <hi>Popish Recusants,</hi> then would they
own a <hi>Purgatory</hi> after this life; but they testifie against such
Doctrine, and do not believe any such Fables, therefore
are they no <hi>Popish Recusants.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fiftly, If they were <hi>Popish Recusants,</hi> then would they
own Temporal Bread and Wine, after Consecration, to be
the Body and Blood of Christ; but they believe and know
that his Body (<hi>which is meat indeed, and his Blood which is drink
indeed</hi>) i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Spiritual and Incorruptable, and so not exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
bread and wine which will corrupt and decay after
Consecration as before: and in this particular also they
differ from the Romish <hi>Catholicks,</hi> and therefore are they
no <hi>Popish Recusants.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, If they were <hi>Popish Recusants,</hi> then would they
observe dayes, and holi-dayes, and times, as <hi>Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masse,
Lent, Easter, &amp;c.</hi> but these, do they observe no
more than other dayes and times; and therefore are they
no <hi>Popish Recusant<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Seventhly, If they were <hi>Popish Recusants,</hi> then would
they use <hi>Crosses</hi> and <hi>Crucifixes</hi> with <hi>Beads</hi> and such like fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous
things;<note place="margin">vide their little Catho. Catechis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus fol.5.</note> and they would also mark themselves with
the signe of the Crosse, upon their foreheads, upon their
mouths, upon their breasts, and from one side to the other;
but <hi>Crosses, Crucifixes</hi> and <hi>Beads</hi> they reject, as the works of
mens hands, which cannot make their worship any thing
more acceptable unto God; neither do they at all mark
themselves with the signe of the Crosse, as <hi>Popish Recusants</hi>
do, therefore are they no <hi>Popish Recusants.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Eighthly, If they were Popish Recusants, then would
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64561:5"/>
they pray for the dead, and unto the Saints that are dead,
that they might pray to God for them that are alive in the
flesh; but they do not pray for them that are outwardly
dead, nor unto the Saints that are dead, but unto the Lord
alone, in the Name of Christ, who giveth <hi>life and breath;</hi>
and therefore are no <hi>Popish Recusants.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ninthly, If they were <hi>Popish Recusants,</hi> then would they
once a year at the least confesse their sins unto a Popish
Priest, upon their bended knees, before <hi>the Virgin Mary,
the Arch-Angel, Iohn Baptist, Peter and Paul, and before all
the Saints, as Popish Recusants</hi> imagine, and then would they
pray unto these before mentioned for them to pray unto
God for their <hi>Absolution,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Fol 15, 16. 17.</note> and after they had done thus
would they receive an <hi>Absolution</hi> from the Priest, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but
they confesse their sins unto God, who is able to remit and
forgive them, and not unto Priests before the Saints that
are dead; neither do they receive Pardons or Absolutions
from any mortal man of, or for their sins, and therefore
are they no <hi>Popish Recusants.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Tenthly, If they were <hi>Popish Recusants,</hi> then would they
observe the Commands of the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> which are
chiefly these five, <hi>viz.</hi> First, <hi>That the Saints dayes be sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
and kept holy.</hi> Secondly, <hi>That they hear Masse.</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>That the Feast dayes be duly observed.</hi> Fourthly, <hi>That Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of sins be made at the least once a year to the Priest. And
finally that the Sacrament be received at or about the time of Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster:</hi>
But these Commands and Institutions of the Church
of Rome they renounce as superstitious traditions of men,
with many more of their <hi>Ceremonies and Rudiments;</hi> And
therefore are they no <hi>Popish Recusants.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Eleventhly, If they were Popish Recusants, then would
they respect mens persons, as they Papists do, and have
them in admiration because of advantage.</p>
                  <p>Twelfthly, If they were Popish Recusants, then would
they wrestle with flesh and blood, and would put such
to death as they judged to be Hereticks, that were not of
their mind; <hi>But the weapons of their warfare are not carnal
but spiritual;</hi> and therefore do not they wrestle with flesh
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64561:5"/>
and blood, but are absolutely against the taking away
of any mans life, for his judgement or opinion in matters
of Religion; And therefore are they no <hi>Popish Recusants.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirteenthly, and finally, if they were <hi>Popish Recusants</hi> then
would they go on pilgrimage, hold up Temples, Tythes, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,
Nuneries, Reliques, Indulgences, Inquisitions, then would
they, like unto the <hi>Romish Catholicks,</hi> believe whatsoever the
<hi>Church of Rome</hi> believeth; but in life and Doctrine, so well as
in matters of faith do they differ from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and that not only in the things before mentioned, but also
concerning their seven Sacraments, and their Baptizing of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,
and in many more things; And therefore may we
safely conclude they are no <hi>Popish Recusants.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that it clearly appears from what I have already said,
that they are not such men as the <hi>Authors</hi> of that Act (which
was made <hi>Anno tertio Iacobi Regis Ch.</hi> 4. wherein the oath of
Allegiance is contained,) intended <hi>to have discovered and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
&amp;c.</hi> And therefore may we conclude that the Magistrates
that tendreth this <hi>Oath</hi> to them, and maketh it a snare for them
(whom they know will not swear;) Do it rather out of malice
and envy, then in justice or equity. Now (O King) it is in
thy Power to remedy this, if it were but in thy heart to do
(something in order to the amending of it) according to the
power thou hast in thy hand, then might this yoak soon be
broken off the necks of the oppressed in thy Dominions.</p>
                  <p>Now if thou shouldest desire to have <hi>a way perscribed thee, how
such a thing might be done, or would know where ever any Prince or
Potentate did the like, when they had a People in their Dominions that
could not swear nor take up Arms,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Answer. I shall shew thee how a Magistrate did beyond the
Seas, to tender consciences, that their <hi>Yea</hi> should be taken in
place of an <hi>Oath, &amp;c.</hi> But take a view of the order it self, or a
Copy of the substance of it, which is as followeth.</p>
                  <p>WHereas there hath been an Adress presented unto his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
in the behalf of certain Inhabitants of the City of <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlebrough,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rolw. Apo. fol. 100, 101, 102.</note>
wherein complaint was made of the Magistrates
of the said City<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Who not long since hath caused the Shops of some
Inhabitants to be shut up, and consequently hath forbid their trading,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64561:6"/>
though it be their only means they have to maintain their Families by<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and that this hath been the case (to wit) their refusing the taking the
accustomed Oath as others have done; Yet nevertheless it appeareth,
that for certain years past they have paid all taxes, Contributions and
Customs belonging to the City, even equal with other Citizens and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of the said City, though they had never taken the said Oath)
and that willingly; And therefore ought they now to have their liberty
without being molested in this particular, seeing they desire nothing else,
then to live in the Inioyment of the Liberty of their Consciences; In
order to which this present war with the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was raised by
his Subjects, the which now by the help of God is come so far, that the
aforesaid Liberty of Conscience is obtained, and therefore it would be an
evil thing to take it a way from these people, who through their paying of
Taxes and Contributions and bearing of other burthens, (besides the
great hazard both of their lives and Liberties) hath holpen to obtain
it. And it appears that these people have declared that they are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to be ruled according to the Ordinances of the City, yet nevertheless
the Magistrates do and have striven with them about the Oath, which
hath not only tended to the expelling of them out of the City, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
to the forcing out of a numberless company of others in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and <hi>Zealand,</hi> with their Wives and Children, to their utter
ruine; And this would not tend to any mans profit, but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
it would be a great apparant hinderance to these Lands, because
thereby trading over all would greatly decrease.</p>
                  <p>And forasmuch as these people do proffer, that their <hi>yea</hi> shall stand
instead of an oath, and the transgressors thereof to be punished as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured
persons; which thing his Eccellency having taken into considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
doth therefore with the advice of the Governour and Counsel of
<hi>Zealand,</hi> Ordain and confirme<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and by these presents be it Ordained,
and confirmed, that the peoples <hi>yea</hi> aforesaid shall stand in stead of a
Oath, before the Magistrates of the aforesaid <hi>City,</hi> and that the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressors
of the same shall be punished, as forswearers or perjured per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;
Moreover his Excellency do charge and command the Magistrates
of <hi>Middlebrough,</hi> with all others whom it doth concern, for the
future not to burthen the Consciences of these people aforesaid any further
with the oath, but that they should open their shops and follow their
trading, as formerly they have done, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:64561:7"/>Thus very Nobly did this <hi>Prince of Orange,</hi> undertake to
procure these peoples freedome from that which envious men
made a snare for them, like as some do now the <hi>Oaths of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance
and Supremacy,</hi> as I have shewed before, and not only
in this praticular, but sometimes in other cases is swearing
made a snare for the people of the Lord in thy Dominion,
which snare thou might as easily break by an Order to the same
purpose, even as he did by the <hi>Order</hi> or <hi>Orders</hi> aforesaid, by
vertue of which, thousands at this day have their Liberty in
this particular concerning swearing, under the States of
<hi>Holland;</hi> and their <hi>yea</hi> to this day is as commonly taken before
a Magistrate in the place of an oath, as an oath is from others,
in matters of differences or other occasions, when in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates
judgement there is need of an oath.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Ho. Mo. Heeren Staten General of Holland and West-<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sland</hi>
(So called) did in this particular follow the foot-steps of
the beforementioned Prince, and the Governour and Counsel
of <hi>Zealand;</hi> For upon a certain time when they had occasion
for mony, after their great and tedious war with <hi>Spain,</hi> they
made an order for to injoyn the Citizens and others, to pay
them one <hi>Guldert</hi> out of a thousand, or one pound of every
thousand, and upon their oathes were they to declare so near
as they could, what their Estates were worth; But the Sta<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es
excepted the Anabaptists aforesaid from swearing, and ordred
that their word should be taken for truth without an oath;
yet if it could be proved that they did not speak the truth,
then were they to be punished like the rest that swore false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
            <p>It is probable that thou thy self hast had knowledge of
these things before now, being Thou hast been a Traveller in
these parts in Thy own Person; Now the Anabaptists (so
called) do not onely enjoy this Priviledge in these Low-Countries,
but also Thy Kinsman <hi>C. Lodovicus Prince of Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi>
He affordeth the same Liberty unto this People, who are
neither constrained to swear, nor yet to bear Armes within
His Dominions, no more then they are here in these united
Provinces, where they are neither fined nor imprisoned for
not bearing of Armes, nor yet for refusing to Swear; But doth
not the common Goales in <hi>England</hi> witnesse the contrary,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64561:7"/>
which doth make the hearts of the Righteous sad, who have
desired that Thou mightest so far have exceeded other <hi>Princes</hi>
in giving Liberty to the Lords People, as He hath exceeded in
mercy towards Thee, even beyond what He hath done or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested
for, or to other Princes? Oh therefore let none of
them excell Thee, in Nobility, or any Vertue, but strive to
be equall with them, if not to go beyond them, in every good
work, and especially that, (<hi>viz.</hi>) in giving Liberty to tender
Consciences.</p>
            <p>Moreover (O King) if Thou be not satisfied in Thy self
concerning the conscientiousnesse of those People in thy <hi>Realm</hi>
(that cannot swear) the Truth of their Doctrines, and the
equitablenesse of their Principles; then chuse forth some of
Thy ablest Divines, and let them have a fair Dispute in Thy
Presence, and in the presence of judicious Men that fear
God, and will judge impartially of the things they shall hear
discussed, that so the Truth may be manifested and embraced,
and Errour and erroneous opinions discovered and avoided.
Hast Thou not read how that <hi>Prince Frederick of Palatine in the
year</hi> 1571. did grant forth an order for a Dispute betwixt a
People called <hi>Wederdoopers,</hi> or Anabaptists, and the Priests? and
how He caused the aforesaid Order to be published throughout
His Dominion, in all Cities and Villages, that all His Subjects
might have timely notice of it, and He appointed two or
three men to take care that things were kept in good order,
and that each Party had free Liberty to speak, what they
understood and thought good concerning the things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded;
And He also caused ready writers to be appointed,
to take what was spoken in writing, and all was to have their
Liberty to speak one by one.</p>
            <p>And that none of the Anabaptists might refrain coming, by
reason of expences, or want of money to bear their charge;
The Prince therefore undertook to take care to provide lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
with meat and drink, for them that were appointed to
mannage the Dispute, during the continuance of it, which
was 19. dayes; and every one was to be admitted to hear,
whether they were Anabaptists, or whatsoever they were, and
the Prince himself was present at much of it, as appears by
the <hi>Protocoll.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:64561:8"/>These People called Anabaptists, had suffered exceeding much
persecution before the Dispute before-mentioned; &amp; when the
Prince saw that they could not be wel suppressed with violence,
then did He grant forth the Order aforesaid for the Dispute;
and those were a sort of people that were not conformable
in many things to the generality of his Subjects, in that they
would not baptize their Infants, neither would they swear in
any wise, neither would they take up Armes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So the Prince
being in a strait concerning them, did as aforesaid; And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
came they to obtain Liberty and Freedom, not onely
in the <hi>Paulz,</hi> but also in the Low-Countries, where at this
day here are many thousands of them; And surely it hath
been for the States profit that they have been suffered, and
that they have given them that liberty which they have affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
them; And so will it be for Thy benefit, to give liberty to
that People in Thy Dominion, who abide in the Doctrine of
Christ, and cannot swear at all; though I know some may
endeavour to perswade Thee to the contrary, like as <hi>Haman</hi>
did perswade <hi>the King Ahasuerus</hi> against the Jews,<note place="margin">Hest. 3. 8.</note> saying, <hi>There is
a certain People scattered abroad, and dispersed among the People in
all The Provinces of Thy Kingdom, and their Lawes are divers
from all People, neither keep they the Kings Laws, therefore it is not
for the Kings profit to suffer them;</hi> even so mayest Thou be insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated
against the Lords People, who are as dear unto him as
the Apple of his eye; These things lay upon me to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
to Thee, some of which may serve as <hi>Presidents</hi> and
examples for Thee, whereby Thou may in part see how to
make a <hi>progess</hi> into that which the Lord requires of Thee;
Wherefore consider of them with Thy Counsel, and if the
Lord put it into your hearts to do good, do it quickly, before
your glasse be run, and your day spent.</p>
            <p>And though many of those Anabaptists did abuse their liberty,
and so came to suffer for it formerly, in breaking their yea, yet
the Law remaineth still, which thousands have the benefit of
to this day, that keep to their yea, In the united provinces
and in <hi>Germanie.</hi> And the people called Quakers, have had
opportunities and provocations enough to have taken up
Armes, and to have defended themselves, and who have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:64561:8"/>
more then ever they did, that broke their word, and
that you know, and are convinced of; therefore have they
chosen sufferings by all the powers before you, knowing that
their Kingdom and their Glory is not of this World, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
do they not fight for the Kingdomes of this World.</p>
