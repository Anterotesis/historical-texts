         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THe Deliverer is come, let all that mourn wait for him, and let all
lamps be truly trimmed, and let all ſtand ſo prepared as that he
may be known in his coming, and be received and followed into the
kingdome, for they that ſlumber are in danger to miſſe him, and they
that are haſty cannot finde him, &amp; on theſe hands the kingdome is loſt:
therefore thou that mourns for him, and waits to be delivered by him,
keep thou in the faith, and in the patience ſtand thou ſtill, and joyn
not with the careleſſe, or with the forward ſpirits, but be quiet in thy
place, and keep thy eye in that which lets thee ſee thou wants him, and
the neceſſity to be delivered by him, and there thou ſtanding ſtill in
the watchfulneſſe, he will come in an hour that thou knoweſt not of,
for there is not a groan that riſes from the innocent in thee, but he
hath great regard unto it, and his compaſſion breaks in the ſame hour,
but for the time of deliverance thou art to wait, becauſe that hour no
man muſt know: therefore let all be ſtill, and eye the Lord, for his
hand is at work, and they that keep their own hands quiet, will know
his work to proſper, and in the ſtillneſſe will feel his faithfulneſſe to his
own begotten, for where doth the Father leave or forſake his own
child, and in what place is it beset, and he helps it not; and where is it
in bondage, and he delivers it not: if the faith be kept, and the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
continued in, he fails not in his work until he hath performed the
counſel of his own will, for in his will the babe is begotten, and in his
will in due time it is born, and none can adde unto his work; and
therefore all are to be ſtill and quiet in the light, and therein watch
and wait for his own hour, ſo will he draw nigh unto thee that mourns
for him, and with his arms of mercy he will embrace thee, and take thee
up, and heal thee, and carry thee forth of the land of thy captivity,
then ſhalt thou return with ioy indeed, when thou art incloſed in the
arms of thy beloved, and this is his own hour which none can know
until he come, and in this hour he binds up the broken-hearted, and
ſaith to the weak, I am thy ſtrength; and to the poor, I am thy helper;
and to the mourner, I am thy comforter; and to the captive, I am thy
deliverer; this is my hour, and I am come to ſet the free, thou haſt
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:98125:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
patiently waited, and haſt not grudged; thou haſt been ſtill, and haſt
not repined; and in thy loweſt ſtate my arm hath reached to thee, and
in all thy diſtreſſes I have drawn nigh to ſuccour thee: but this is the
hour in which I am come to deliver thee. O thou patient mourner, this
is the voice of thy beloved, hearken not unto another, for his word is
ſure, and all his promiſes faithful, and behold he ſpeaks comfortably to
thee, and brings thee joyful tydings of deliverance: turn not th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> face
from him as if he was a ſtranger, for it is he, and it is his hour, he hath
ſeen thy travail ſince the day he begat thee, and in all thy afflictions he
hath been af<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>icted with thee, and he hath not delayed his coming
though thou haſt thought him long, and in the depth of thy miſery haſt
ſecretly cried, why doth he not make haſt to help me, and why are my
afflictions ſo continued upon me, hath he not in that hour been near un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thee, and hath he not in that time been thy comforter, and hath he
not ſecretly relieved thee, though thou haſt not known it, and here he
hath been thy ſupport, that thou might not faint untill his own hour
came to deliver thee. O that any who have been viſited ſhould miſſe of
this hour, either by careleſneſſe or forwardneſſe; for that which ſaith
he delayes his coming that is the careleſſe ſpirit, and that which ſaith,
Behold he cometh, let us go forth to meet him, (mark) let us go forth
that is the haſty forward ſpirit, it leads forth of the faith, forth of the
patience, forth of the ſtayedneſſe, forth of the contentedneſſe, and ſo
from waiting in the pure and perfect meaſure of light which cometh
from him, and in which he cometh in his hour, and neither of theſe
births are delivered in a right hour, but are both born out of due time,
and the careleſſe proves heavy and dies, and the forward proves a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour,
which in its riſe was ſomething, but ſuddenly mounts into the
air, and after a while is no more ſeen; but the ſtill quiet babe that
waits in the true patience, it is ſafely delivered in the time appointed,
and in the hour determined, and though it hath been long bruiſed, yet
it hath patiently endured, and though it hath long ſitten mourning,
yet it hath been contented, and in the deepeſt of its miſery, it hath fled
for refuge to the throne of mercy, and hath not been without ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
faith and hope in God, yea in the very time when it could not ſee
which way any relief ſhould come, yet it hath breathed unto the Father,
and hath put its whole truſt and confidence in him, and ſo by a depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancie
upon the life of its generation, it hath lien under the arm of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98125:3"/>
it hath not ſaid he delayes his coming, and I am weary of
waiting, neither hath it ſaid, behold he cometh, I will go forth to meet
him, but here I lye bruiſed, and my mourning is not hid from him, and
here I will wait for the hour of his coming, I have no ſtrength to move
untill he come and help me; and therefore he muſt find me where I am,
and do all for me that is to be done, or here I muſt lye and mourn out
my days. I dare not ſlumber leaſt I ſhould miſſe his coming, nor I dare
not go forth to meet him, leaſt I ſhould not find him, but here will I
ſit and wait for his own hour. O thou babe of tenderneſſe, that watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
for thy beloved with diligence, thou art the object of the Fathers
pity, and he is not forgetfull of thee, neither indeed can he, for thou
art his natural child, a babe of his own begetting, and in thy travail he
is with thee, and in all thy diſtreſſes he comforts thee, and in thy deep
afflictions he is a ſupport unto thee; thou art the bruiſed, and he is come
to heal thee; the mourner, and he is come to comfort thee; the
captive, and he is come to deliver thee; this is his hour, though
the powers of darkneſſe be ſtrong, Oh thou innocent babe, thou
art deeper in feeling then words can expreſſe, there is none knows thy
travail but who are of the ſame life with thee, neither can any eye truly
pity thee but the eye which only hath compaſſion on thee, thou art the
babe which in all thy afflictions lives by faith, and though thou haſt
not deliverance in thy view, yet through thy faith thou art ſtayed in
him that loves thee, and in his ſtrength thou ſtandeſt in the time of thy
adverſity, and he in all things worketh for thee becauſe thou art no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in thy ſelf, and whereever thou art his power defends thee, and
in thy poverty his pleaſure and delight is in thee, for his covenant ſtands
ſure with thee for ever. Oh thou glorious birth of immortality, thou
art well-beloved and highly favoured of God, yea in the womb he loves
thee and favours thee, and from the day of his deliverance, and the
hour of thy birth he delights to honour thee, for out of all earthly fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
he hath choſen thee, and from all falſe births he ſeparates thee, and

therefore let all friends eye the Lord in this his day, and keep faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to the leadings of his power, leſt the ſons and daughters of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
entice any of your minds to join with them, and ſo you goe into
the defiled bed and looſe the honour; and be watchful that you run
not forth in a haſty eager mind among your ſelves, but waite that ye
may have clearneſſe in the counſel of the Lord, that ſo ye may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
that it is of God in the beginning, for if you keep not ſtayed in
the light, with the light to be guided; you may either look at the world
or at the party, as the firſt thing upon which you fix your eye, and
ſo may labour to compaſſe the party either for the love of the worlds
riches which they may poſſeſſe, or to ſatisfie your affections with the
outward beauty or comelineſſe of the perſon, and ſo the drawings and
leadings of God will not be regarded; but the worlds riches, or the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
comlineſſe, or both, will be the object of your eye, and whoever
begins in this ground, the Lord will blaſt it, and if any come to feel
that they have a real moving in the truth and in ſimplicity one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and that in the beginning they look ſingly at the begotten of God
one in another, then wait to be preſerved and kept in Gods fear and
counſel; for here the enemy will ſtand to preſent ſome temptation to
entice and entangle the minds, and if ever you open your eye into
the world, and begin to look at the glory and honour of it, that part
will preſently over ballance the real ſimplicity, and then the eye being
fixed upon the worlds riches and glory, the enemy hatches a ſecret de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
which way to compaſſe it, and attain it, and then the temptation
becomes a cloud and a vail over the excellent glory of the beautiful ſeed,
and if that eye which looks into the world, and luſts to compaſſe it, be
not anſwered in its deſire, then the love which hath been profeſſed will
decay, &amp; cool, and die, but and if that end can be obtained which the
eye looketh after, then the love will ſeemingly increaſe to a joining
in the Covenant of Marriage, and this is not honourable though
outwardly it may be brought to paſſe and effected, and whoſoever goes
together in this ground, they will ſuffer loſſe in the truth, though they
may gain the worlds ſubſtance, and death will ſurprize them in the
earth where they center, and how are many toſſed about and cannot
find where to ſettle, nor where to come into a liking to ſatisfie their

turn from it again, and preſently joyn with ſome new preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
which in its appearance ſeems to ſhew fairer unto their liking;
and thus many ſtaggers up and down in the multitude of their own
thoughts, and never waits to feel the Lords power to order them, but
through the wiles of the enemy are hurried in a reſtleſſe ſtate and looſes
their conditions in the truth, and doth not well perceive it, for if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

at, or the world catch the mind from the real movings in the ſimplicity,
or whatſoever end any layes to themſelves in this matter, they through
the ſame will come to great loſſe in the truth, whether the thing which
they aim at be effected or not effected, for if the mind be drawn into
any viſible appearance as to have a luſt after it, and to preſcribe waies
and ends to accompliſh what is intended, there cannot be a clear ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the truth, where the mind is exerciſed about the attaining or ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
any ſuch things, for they all ſtand in the liberty of the will,
and not in in the power of God which croſſeth it.</p>
               <p>Therefore this is the counſel of the Lord God unto all friends, look
not at the ſons or daughters of ſtrangers, leſt you become one with them,
neither look at the worlds riches amongſt your ſelves, but wait low in
Gods fear to receive his counſel in every ſuch motion, &amp; feel his hand to
open the way for you, &amp; when you feel a clear way opened of the Lord,
&amp; that in his eternal power &amp; wiſdom you can reach the Seed one in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
then wait for his time to make you up as one in the counſel of his
own will, &amp; when thus you feel his hand at work, then do not you begin
to ſay, we have clearneſs from the Lord in this matter, but now we would
know how it muſt be as to an outward portion or eſtate, and ſo begin to
look into the earth, and conferre one with another about the things of
this life, for if any do ſo, the Lord will draw back his hand, and hide his
counſel from you, and will leave you in the dark to grope in your own
way, &amp; though you may obtain thoſe things which your eye in that place
looks after, and may effect the thing which you aim at, yet there you
cannot obtain the Lords favour and bleſſing, not that the world or the
riches of it is hereby denied in their places, for if the Lord join any to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in the Seed, and that the things of this life be enjoyed by either
party as an outward portion, there they may prove ſerviceable as in God<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
wiſdom they are uſed, &amp; the encreaſe will be bleſſed, but where the world
is chiefly looked at, &amp; that the joining or not joining depende<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> upon it,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98125:5"/>
in that place it is denied and not otherwiſe, and let not any Friends
make way one for another by ſpeaking to any party, except they
feele a neceſſity layed upon them from the Lord, for thereby
ſome may be wronged in their ſimplicity, by giving up their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe
unto another, but let all wait to feele their own movings
in Gods counſell and leadings, and ſo to manifeſt their own mind
in his fear and wiſdome, that it may be felt on both ſides to
be of the Lord, &amp; then lay it before ſome weighty friends that are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
with heavenly wiſdom, that the ground of the motion may be bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanced
in ſound judgment, &amp; ſo to wait for the Lords hand to carry it
on &amp; finiſh it in his pleaſure, &amp; where it thus comes to paſs in a ſingle
heart to God &amp; one another, there will be true contentment with what
the world affords on either part, &amp; whether it be more or leſs, it will be
enjoyed in its place with comfort &amp; peace; &amp; though parties may differ
much in age, or in outward ſubſtance, yet the marriage is equal, becauſe it
is of the Lord, for equality ſtands not in age or wealth according to the
worlds account, but in the proſperity of the ſeed, in which both age and
youth becomes one fleſh, &amp; is made to flouriſh in one perfect beauty, &amp;
hath an equal portion of wealth in the enduring ſubſtance, and who are
thus joined together of the Lord, &amp; abides faithful with him, his bleſſing
reſts upon them every way, &amp; he preſerves them freſh and living in his
truth, for where death runs over any in that ſtate, it is becauſe the thing
is not brought to paſs in Gods counſel, or otherwiſe not abiding faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
with him when it is effected by him, &amp; ſo the world becomes a trap
&amp; a ſnare to entangle, &amp; fond affections becomes a hinderance for fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
the Lord fully. Therefore let all friends be exceeding carefull in
this weighty matter, which in the ground lies beyond the reach of the
earthly wiſedom, and can never be effected by it, to the glory of God,
or the honour of his truth, nor to the peace and happineſſe of ſuch as ſo
obtains it, but where it is begun and finiſhed in the counſel and will of
God, and that there be an abiding faithfull with him, he hath the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in it, and his peace and bleſſing remains with ſuch as a continual
portion of endleſſe joy.</p>
               <p>Oh this is the day wherein the lamb eſpouſes the undefiled virgin
which hath followed him through great tribulations, and is waſhed
white in his precious bloud.</p>
