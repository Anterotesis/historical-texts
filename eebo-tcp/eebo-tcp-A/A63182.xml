            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <speaker>Gibbons.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I am brought hither by an Order of this Court, which Order mentions a Charge of Treaſon exhibited againſt me; I ſhould betray the Liberty I am born unto, If I ſhould not deſire a Triall, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the fundamentall Laws of this Nation, which is by a Jury of my Neighbour-hood; the benefits and advantages are exceeding great, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I doe earneſtly crave to have them.</p>

               <p>The State have thought of another way of Triall, which you you muſt have, and ſubmit to; this is beſt for your advantage, and more honourable then any other you can have, therefore you muſt plead Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or not Guilty.</p>

               <speaker>Gibbons.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I ſhall never be ſo prodigall of my Bloud, as to throw away my Life, by refuſing a Triall before you, though I am not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in this new way of Triall; yet I ſhall not refuſe to plead in confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of my own Innocency, and in hope of your tenderneſſe in matters of Bloud: But before I Plead, and Anſwer to my Charge, I have this humble motion to make.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>Here he ſpake very much on the firſt day of his Triall, moving very much for Councell; but after he had uſed many Arguments to perſwade the Court to incline to it, and could not have it, he deſired the Court to be the Councell for him, and take care of his Life, and not ſuffer him by his own ignorance, to weave a web for his own ruine and deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. After much ſaid of this nature, he pleaded not Guilty; the which being entred in the Book, they proceeded to the Triall.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Attorney General.</hi> The Attorney Generall began with a long ſpeech, how Maſter <hi>Gibbons</hi> had plotted and contrived theſe Treaſons, named the Meetings, and the places, where he ſaid it began preſently after the late Kings death, under the pretence of getting the King to <hi>Scotland;</hi> but the truth was, they intended to ſettle him upon this Common-wealth. And further, that he the ſaid <hi>John Gibbon</hi> as a falſe Traitour, and out of a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litious and wicked purpoſe and deſigne to raiſe inſurrections in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, did ſeverall dayes and times in the years 1648, 49, 50, and 51. and at divers other times and places within this Common-wealth, together with <hi>Chiſtopher Love, Piercy, Jermin, Maſſey,</hi> &amp;c. and other their Complices, being falſe Traytours to this Common-wealth, trayterouſly and mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly Complot, Contrive, and endeavour to raiſe Forces againſt this Common-wealth, ſettled in way of a free State, without King, or Houſe of Lords, and for the ſubverſion of the ſame did raiſe, and collect divers great ſummes of Money, and did hold intelligence by Letters, Meſſages, and Inſtructions with CHARLES STUART, ſonne of the late King, and with the Queen his Mother, and divers other perſons, being falſe Traitours to this Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>And further, he the ſaid <hi>John Gibbons,</hi> together with <hi>Chriſtopher Love, William Drake, Peircy, Jermin,</hi> &amp;c. and other their Complices, ſince the death of the late King, ſeverall dayes and times in the years aforeſaid
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:29676:3"/>

            <p>And further, to carry on the ſaid Deſigne, he the ſaid <hi>John Gibbons</hi> ſeverall days and times in the reſpective years afore-ſaid, together with <hi>Chriſtopher Love, William Drake, Peircy,</hi> &amp;c. did endeavour to procure the <hi>Scots</hi> to invade this Common-wealth of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And further, that he the ſaid <hi>John Gibbon,</hi> on the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Aprill,</hi> 1650. and on divers other dayes and times between the 29<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of <hi>March,</hi> 1650. and the firſt day of <hi>June</hi> 1651. at <hi>London,</hi> and elſewhere, did give, uſe, and hold correſpondence with the ſaid CHARLS STUART, ſon of the late King, and the Queen his Mother, <hi>Jermin, Peircy, &amp;c.</hi>

            <p>And further, to accompliſh the ſaid Deſignes, he the ſaid <hi>John Gibbon,</hi> on the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of <hi>Aprill</hi> 1651. at the places afore-mentioned, did hold, and give correſpondence and intelligence, with divers perſons of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Nation, as <hi>Argyle, Lowden, Lo hian,</hi> &amp;c. Enemies to this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, and adhearing to the King in the Warre againſt them.</p>
            <p>And further, the ſaid <hi>John Gibbons</hi> did traiterouſly, and malitiouſly abbet, aſſiſt, countenance and incourage the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Nation, and divers other perſons adhearing to them, and did convey great ſums of Money, Armes and Ammunition into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and elſewhere: All which wicked practices and deſignes of him the ſaid <hi>John Gibbons</hi> were againſt this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, Parliament, and People; and in manifeſt contempt of the Lawes of this Nation, and Acts of Parliament: and in ſuch caſes made, and provided.</p>
            <p>After he had ended, the Witneſſes were called in; the firſt was Major <hi>Adames,</hi> the ſecond Colonell <hi>Barton,</hi> the third was Captain <hi>Hatſell,</hi> the fourth Colonell <hi>Baines,</hi> the fifth Major <hi>Alford,</hi> the ſixth Captain <hi>Farre,</hi> the ſeventh was Maſter <hi>Jekell,</hi> the eighth was Major <hi>Huntington,</hi> the ninth Maſter <hi>Harvey,</hi> the tenth was Major <hi>Corbet: Adames</hi> being firſt examined, his teſtimony was to this effect.</p>

            <p>After Maſter <hi>Drake</hi> went away, we met at Maſter <hi>Loves</hi> houſe, where Maſter <hi>Gibbons</hi> met alſo; there were Letters read, and I think Maſter <hi>Gibbon</hi>

            <p>A while after the death of the late King I was going into <hi>Cannon-ſtreet,</hi> and at <hi>Dowgate</hi> I met with <hi>Will.

            <p>At the Meeting at the Swan at <hi>Dowgate,</hi> where divers were; Captain <hi>Titus</hi> made a large Narration of the Princes deportment, declaring how inelineable he was to caſt off his Cavaliering adherents, if he were but aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured there was a People in <hi>England</hi> that ſtuck to their Covenant, he was weary of his other Councels, and was ready to apply himſelf to the ends of the Covenant.</p>

            </sp>
            <p>Upon this motion the Court adjourn'd, and <hi>M.

               <p>My Lord, the laſt time I was before this honourable Court, after I had deſired a Jury, and was denyed it, I did in confidence of my own Innocency, and your tenderneſſe in matters of Bloud, ſubmit to a Triall, though I was no way ſatisfied in this new way of Triall; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I could plead, I made this humble motion, perceiving the Charge againſt me for High Treaſon, was againſt ſeverall Statutes, Lawes, and Acts of Parliament, which I never ſaw, heard, or read them in my life.</p>
               <p>My life and eſtate thus being drawn into Queſtion (my Lord) it did very much concern me to be well adviſed, there being many things in the Statutes which made for my advantage, both in my Plea and Defence; therefore I did humbly beſeech your Lordſhip, and this High Court, that I might have Councell in Law aſſigned me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> both to adviſe me in my Chamber, and plead for me in this Court, that ſo I might be able to take all thoſe lawfull advantages which the Statutes and Acts of Parliament afford me, which I was not able to doe my ſelf, being ignorant of the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:29676:6"/>
Lawes; this being denied, and I ſeeing I could no way obtain Councell to preſerve my life, as I did ſee the State had got great Councell againſt me to proſecute me for my life. I did humbly beſeech your Lordſhip, and this High Court, that you would be ſo far of Councell againſt me a poor Priſoner ſtanding at the Bar, drawn in queſtion before the Juſtice for my life, that you would not let the Learned Councel of this Common-wealth take any advantage againſt me through my Ignorance, or want of skill in the Laws: but that if the Statutes and Acts of Parliament, and Laws of the Land did afford me any advantage, which I might over-ſlip through my Ignorance, that your Lordſhip and the Court, out of your bowels of compaſſion to a poor Priſoner, would ſtand for me, that I might not have any wrong done, nor Law denied, which by right was due unto me; upon theſe conſiderations my Lord, I did plead not Guilty: I do hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly thank your Lordſhip, and the Court for the time you have given me, but as unable to anſwer, or ſpeak for my ſelf now, as I was the laſt time, I took my leave of this Court, being wholly unfurniſhed, and altogether diſ-inabled to make my defence; for when I came back to my priſon at <hi>Newgate,</hi> with an expectation of meeting both the Copie of my Charge, and the depoſition of the Witneſſes, I found all was taken away from my Notary, whom I brought a purpoſe to this place to help me therein; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my ſelf thus totally deprived, and cut off from all helps, and hopes of making my defence, I could not tell whither to goe or ſend but to your Lordſhip, whom I thought, upon my humble Petition, might have granted both a copy of my Charge, and the depoſitions of the Witneſſes: but ſeeing that could not be granted, I am left without all poſſibilities of pleading, or making any defence: Therefore I do now again with all humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity addreſſe my ſelf to your Lordſhip, and this honourable Court, and doe moſt earneſtly deſire a Copie of the Charge, alſo the depoſitions of Witneſſes and Conncell aſſigned me to come to my Chamber to adviſe me there: alſo Councell to plead for me before this Court, and a Solicitor aſſigned me to follow my buſineſſe; and if God ſhall not incline your hearts to ſhew this mercy, I doe not look upon my ſelf as able to make my defence, as to ſtand before a company of armed men.</p>

               <p>My Lord, if I ſhould begin to proceed, and make my defence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as I ſaid already) totally ignorant in all the Lawes, and utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able both in memory and parts to take all juſt and clear objections againſt the advantages of the Charge, and Evidences; if I ſhould make my defence when all means are thus taken away, I ſhould certainly throw away my own life, and become guilty of ſhedding my own bloud; therefore I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a 100 times leave my ſelf to the mercy and Juſtice of the Court, who, I hope, are very ſenſible how much the life of a man is worth, and withall, conſider the hard meaſure I had, in taking away the books of thoſe that wrote for me, that ſo I could never have ſight of the Charge, nor Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of the Witneſſes, which all others have had, nor no Councels to adviſe me. Thus being left naked, and deſtitute of all helps, I had rather ſubmit to the mercy of the Court, then ever plead to ſave my life: my Lord, I am perſwaded, I ſtand to be Judged by a Court where I ſee the faces of thoſe that truly fear God, and that they will ſeriouſly weigh and conſider that the bloud of any, for whom Chriſt hath died, is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing precious in the ſight of God, who will not take any advantage againſt

any for their ignorance, and that you alſo doe remember that all your Judgements will be judged over again at the Tribunall of Chriſt, who will both be a Councell and Advocate for me a Priſoner now ſtanding at the Bar: thus hoping that you will reckon the life and bloud of the meaneſt perſon, for whom Chriſt hath died, as much worth as the life of the greateſt. I will rather ſubmit to your mercy, then Plead, if I cannot have, what I doe deſire: But being very unwilling to have any hand to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy my ſelf, and ſo become guilty of my own death; therefore, though for want of help I be not able to make my defence, yet I ſhall make an Appeal to the Court, which is all I can doe; and therefore deſire you ſeriouſly to weigh and conſider how far ſhort the Evidences come, and how full of contrarieties and contradictions; by the Law there ought to be two lawfull and ſufficient Witneſſes to make a man Guilty of Treaſon; theſe Witneſſes muſt agree punctually in their teſtimony, and the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they prove muſt be againſt the expreſſe words of the Act: Alſo the Law will not ſuffer thoſe that are Guilty and Convict of the ſame Crime, by their own confeſſions, whereof they accuſe me, to give Evidence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me; theſe Witneſſes therefore cannot be lawful and ſufficient againſt me, they having confeſſed thus much againſt themſelves, and ſo do either witneſſe againſt me out of fear of Death, or promiſe of Reward: this I am certainly inform'd will be proved againſt Major <hi>Adams,</hi> and was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in the face of the Court at M. <hi>Loves</hi> Triall concerning the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Major <hi>Adams,</hi> which is the moſt materiall Witneſſe againſt me: I hope your Lordſhip and the Court will look upon it, as not onely he hath been offered, received, and taken Money to diſcover the Deſigne, and witneſſe againſt me; but alſo in regard to whatſoever he ſwears as that I ſhould bring in the rough draught of Inſtructions to M. <hi>Loves:</hi> And as to my preſence at the Swan at ſeverall Meetings, was both contradicted, and poſitively ſworne againſt by ſeverall other of the Witneſſes: none but he doth ſay that I was preſent at the reading of any Letters of the Fight at <hi>Dunbar;</hi> nor none but <hi>Adams</hi> ſayth I was preſent at M. <hi>Loves</hi> houſe when any monies was debated; nor none but <hi>Adams</hi> ſayth I was a conſtant man at Meetings, thatever I invited any to a Meeting.

My Lord, I ſhall go further, and did offer unto the Court, that if in all <hi>England</hi> they could find a man that would ſay any of theſe things M. <hi>Harvey</hi> accuſed me of; then I ſaid more particularly, if any whom I had moſt frequently convers'd withall, or any of thoſe that kept my company would ſay they ever heard me ſay any of theſe words, the next time I came before this honourable Court, I would come and plead Guilty. And I doe now ſay, if it pleaſe your Lordſhip, and the Court to give me time, I ſhall be able to produce Witneſſes, I ſhall make it appear M. <hi>Harvey</hi> is as unfit to be a Witneſſe in any Court of Record, as he was unfit to be a Juſtice of Peace in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> where he was Indicted for many and notorious offences. If I might have time, I ſhould produce witneſſes that M. <hi>Harvey</hi> was the Originall reporter of ſome of thoſe things he accuſed me of. And concerning Major <hi>Corbets</hi> Teſtimony, I know little in it, but that I ſhall call God to witneſſe I knew not <hi>Maſon;</hi> I did then in the face of the Court declare how much he had wronged me, for that I had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted the Committee who examined me, that I both knew <hi>Maſon,</hi> and told them the place, and how I came to know him; beſides, there is a Copy of my Examination abroad that doth confirm the ſame; that <hi>Corbet</hi> came to me more like a Murtherer, then like a Chriſtian: and becauſe I did call God to witneſſe againſt theſe untruths he charged me withall, he did in effect, judge my Soul to the Devill, and my Body to the Gallowes, and ſo he left. For which unchriſtian carriage of his, I both complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to M. <hi>Price,</hi> Clarke to the Warden in the <hi>Fleet,</hi> my Keeper, and ſome others. My Lord, I am charged with being a Solicitor, and repreſented as a man that had nothing elſe to do but follow ſuch buſineſſes as here I am accuſed of; which is a life ſo unlike an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man, and ſo ill-becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Chriſtian, that I have all the dayes of my life walked a contrary courſe: if it were neceſſary, multitudes of Witneſſes will teſtifie the ſame for me. I was entertained by my Maſter to waite upon him in his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, after he was gone to the Houſe, I had conſtant occaſions to go into the City, either to lay out, pay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or receive Money: ſo much experience had I gained, as I entred upon a Merchants Trade, dealt with many and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall merchantable Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities, having a wife children then living, that was the Trade I reſolved to follow. My Wife dying, I went over to <hi>France</hi> ſome little time after with my Maſter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and carried many Merchantable Commodities with me, where I found library to encreaſe my experience my Maſter returning to <hi>England,</hi> where he ſtayed not a year<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but we <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:29676:8"/>
in my Ladies ſervice is ſufficiently known to be ſuch as daily lead me to go into the City; the 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>July</hi> 1650. my Lady went from the City, there was a neceſſity one man ſhe muſt leave behind in <hi>London,</hi> which fell to my portion, and my buſineſſes called me daily into the City, ſometimes to go to Councell, ſometimes to ſhew Bills of Exchange, ſometimes to pay Monies, ſometimes to lay out Money, and buy ſeverall things which both my Maſter and Lady did daily ſend for to me; there was ſome Letters that came conſtantly every week from my Lady; ſome out of <hi>France</hi> to one M. <hi>Charboners,</hi> whoſe houſe was in <hi>Tower-ſtreet:</hi> I miſſing theſe Letters often on the Monday, went on the Tueſday for them, which was the day that we met at the Club, which was the main reaſon of my being ſo conſtantly there; where I met for no other end then to ſee the faces<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of my Friends, and to diſcourſe of the Newes of the Town: moſt of what ever I heard there diſcourſed on, I found in the printed Books; nothing doe I know was ever ſaid or done there prejudiciall to the State; but ſince it is looked upon as a Crime, I would I had never come there. Concerning my Maſter, were it neceſſary, I would here make a Declaration, that he never left me to do any buſineſſe, but to wait upon his Lady, and to provide, buy, and ſend thoſe things into <hi>France</hi> that were neceſſary for him: For Letters, I never received any from him, but ſuch as might have lookt all the world in the face; neither think I, I need ſay much to clear this, for that the State have ſeen moſt of thoſe Letters that my Maſter ſent before they ever came to my hands. My Lord, this is all I can ſay, being unwilling to trouble the Court any longer, but muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare how much I am amazed to be Indicted by ſo high a Charge, of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as I dare ſay never lookt any ſuch man as I am in my condition in the face till now, and doe fully perſwade my ſelf that your Lordſhip will rather pity my ignorance, and ſad condition; then look upon me as a man either fit for Plots, or any ſuch matter I am Charged with. I doe proteſt, that if I would make a Declaration of every Act I have done, of every Word I have ſaid, of every line I have Written; I never knew it came up to the border of Treaſon, what ever is laid to my Charge: And whereas Major <hi>Adams</hi> charges me of being at ſeverall meetings preſently after the late Kings death; I did not ſee them not nine months after the death of the King: And after I came acquainted with <hi>Alford,</hi> and all that ever he layes to my Charge, is going down to <hi>Graveſend,</hi> but he did not ſay whether he or I carried the Commiſſions or Letters he ſpeaks of; it is hard for me to remember what the diſcourſe was a year and half ſince, but I dare ſay he doth moſt falſly charge me that I ſhould bid him ſhew kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to <hi>Maſon,</hi> that ſo he might repreſent the Presbyterian Party conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable to the King, and that I ſhould bid him disburſe ſome Money, and pay all the Charges, and if it was not paid him by the Company again, I would; this to the beſt of my remembrance is all falſe; Capt. <hi>Far</hi> (who is another of the Witneſſes, who went along with me, and <hi>Alford)</hi> did declare
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:29676:8"/>
it in the face of the Court, that he knew no ſuch thing, and that Major <hi>Alford</hi> was the man that invited him to <hi>Graveſend;</hi> and ſo I doe proteſt, he did me, or elſe I had never gone. For Letters, I doe not remember that ever I touched any; nor did Major <hi>Alford</hi> in the leaſt ſwear poſitively I did; onely he ſaith either he or I did deliver them; <hi>Alford</hi> doth not ſwear that ever I wrote, that ever I ſaw them open, or ever heard them read. All this my Lord was done above a year and half ago, and I hope if there ſhall be any thing found done amiſſe in that Journy, the Acts will clear me, for that it is ſaid, if a man be not Indicted within a year, he is not to be Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned, or queſtioned. All that Maj. <hi>Huntington</hi> ſays, is, He ſaw me at Maſter <hi>Loves</hi> when the Inſtructions were read, but whether I heard them he could not ſwear, but he ſaw me go out of one room into another; and ſince he ſayes I met him in the ſtreet, and asked him if he would not go to M. <hi>Loves</hi> to hear Newes: and when we came there, after Prayer half an hour, <hi>Will. Drake</hi> pulled a Letter out of his Pocket, neither ſwore he what it was, nor that I heard it read. My Lord, upon the whole, I do ſay, among all the ten Witneſſes, there is not one that doth ſay or ſwear that ever I wrote Letter, ſent Letter, or received Letter; that ever I collected Money, paid Money, or received Money; or that ever I diſcourſed any thing prejudiciall to the State; not any one Witneſſe doth ſay any one thing to my Charge done for more then this year and half beſides Major <hi>Adams;</hi> and all that ever he ſwears, is, being preſent at Letters read; he neither ſayes I heard them, or ever diſcourſed any thing concerning them. So my Lord, except it be one ſingle Witneſs, there is nothing laid to my Charge done this year and half; ſo my Lord, the utmoſt that the whole proof againſt me doth amount un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to is, but hearing of Letters read at the ſecond hand, and all this but in the utmoſt were but miſpriſion of Treaſon if fully proved; but being but one ſingle Witneſſe to ſwear this, I cannot imagine it will ever hurt me. For <hi>Potter, Jekell, Far,</hi> or <hi>Alford,</hi> (who knew as much by me as <hi>Adams)</hi> did not ſay any ſuch thing; and all that <hi>Adams</hi> did ſay, is but hearing of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; he doth not ſay that ever I ſent means to the King: though I never did this, yet I have weakned my ſelf, and opened my purſe to help the State. About the time the Kings &amp; <hi>Scots</hi> were agreed, I furniſhed my Brother with a conſiderable ſum of money, and ſent him into <hi>Ireland</hi> to doe the States ſervice, where he gained a Command under my Lord, and did very good ſervice for the State. My Lord, had I ever ſuch a mind to the War in <hi>Scotland,</hi> I could have ſent my Brother thither, and not into <hi>Ireland.</hi> Thus my Lord, I have gone as far as I can in making my appeal to the Court, being utterly unable to make any defence, I do hope there wil be no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tange taken by my Ignorance, but you will be pleaſed to take my condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into your conſideration, and yet grant me both time and Councell, and give me a Copy of my Charge, and the depoſitions of the Witneſſes, which is no more favour then was allowed to the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> and Deputy of <hi>Ireland:</hi> I crave leave of your Lordſhip, and the Court,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:29676:9"/>
that I may not ſuffer for want of experience, nor that my ignorance may be made uſe of to work my ruine and deſtruction: From my youth I have ſtudied the Scripture, but never have ſtudied the Lawes in my life, and therefore all that I have to help my ſelf with is, from the Scripture; where I find that ignorance hath conſtantly the Plea at the Bar of Heaven, and ſo I am certain ſhould have at the Bars of all the Courts of Juſtice. <hi>Abimelech</hi> that committed a very great ſin in taking another mans wife from him, he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his integrity, and God did ſpare him, becauſe he knew it not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God hath alwayes been wonderfull tender of the life of a man, and that in the time of the moſt ſtricteſt Lawes, ſo much care did he take to preſerve the life of man, that he provided Cities of refuge to flie unto, if any killed a man by accident, or unawares: Murther is a great crying ſin, yet were it done una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares God made a City of refuge to flie unto, that the man might be ſafe, &amp; out of danger of the revenger. My Lord, whatſoever I have done amiſs, I do profeſs it is out of ignorance, I never knew I broke any of the Acts of Parl. nor that I offended the Laws of <hi>England;</hi> &amp; therefore I hope my ignorance ſhall have the plea at your Bar, as I am ſure it ſhall have at the Bar of God; I have often heard that the Law of <hi>England</hi> is the Law of Mercy, and that there is no Law in the world looks with more tenderneſs and compaſſion upon a mans life: therefore I ſay as <hi>David</hi> concerning the ſword of <hi>Goliah, There is none like that, give it me;</hi> the ſame I do ſay this day, no Law is like to our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Laws, therefore let me enjoy the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I know the benefits &amp; advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hereby is wonderful great; I do verily believe I am before a Court that are fully perſwaded that the ſtrict-beholding eye of God looks upon them, and beholds all your intentions, and the thoughts of your heart to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me, and ſees whether you do deny me any help or advantage that may ſave my life. Therefore I earneſtly beſeech your Lordſhip, and this Honourable Court to look upon the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> and ſee whether there be not ſome helps, ſome City of refuge to flie unto, where I may be out of danger of all that I am here charged with. My Lord, this is the firſt time that ever I was brought upon a Stage, the firſt time that ever my name was heard of, or I known to be an Offender againſt the State: And whatſoever ſhall now be found in me amiſſe, I deſire there may be a favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable conſtruction made of it, and not to be ſtrained beyond what my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention was, who have alwayes abhorred from my very ſoul all deſignes that have tended to bloud; I have alwayes ſtood firme to the Cauſe of Liberty and Religion, and all the intereſts thereof: theſe are the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples I firſt took up, theſe are the Principles I have alwayes held; from which Principles I never yet departed, I have alwayes had a bleeding heart when the Church hath been in a ſuffering condition; I have never been of a bitter ſpirit, but have alwayes carried a moſt tender and Chriſtian reſpect towards thoſe that were of an unblameable life and converſation: And where I thought there was truth of Grace, however contrary to me in judgement, yet I have loved them, and imbraced them as Chriſtians; I have
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:29676:9"/>
alwayes lived peaceably, never no diſturber of the Church or State, either by writing, or printing Books, or any thing elſe. May it pleaſe your Lordſhip, it is my deſire you ſhould do as God did, when the cry of <hi>Sodom</hi> came up before him, <hi>I will goe down ſaith he, and ſee whether they have done al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together according to the cry which is come up to me, if not, I will know:</hi> the Lord that knows all things, knew before what <hi>Sodom</hi> had done, but after the manner of men, he came down, to teach all Courts of what they ſhould do before they proceed to Judgement. My Lord, here hath been a great Charge againſt me, a great crie come up unto your ears, I deſire you to to doe God did, that is, to know whether it be according to the cry, that you would ſeriouſly weigh all that the Witneſſes have ſaid; gather all the Circumſtances together, and ſee the utmoſt that it doth amount unto, and then I am ſure you will ſee the Evidences to come ſo infinite ſhort of what the Charge and cry hath been againſt me, that you will find argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to incline to mercy; and if I might not be quitted, yet at leaſt you will let me have thoſe helps and advantages that the Lawes afford me, and God hath commanded you to give me; that you will not keep any thing from me, that I, according to Juſtice, have demanded, and for the want of w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> ſee me deſtroyed before your faces; therefore I do once more with all earneſtneſſe deſire you will not deny me a Copy of my Charge, alſo the depoſitions of the Witneſſes, and aſſigne me Councell to come to my Chamber, and plead for me at the Bar, without which you take from me all theſe helps that ſhould enable me to make my defence; without w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> it is impoſſible for me to go any further, and muſt declare that I want all the materiall things that ſhould help me to ſave my life, when I ſee before my eyes all poſſible advantages to undo me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> MyLord, I am able to ſay no more, if thus my juſt requeſt ſhall be denyed, I have gone as far as I can without them both to clear my innocency, and vindicate my ſelf from that which is laid to my Charge; and am moſt confident, if you would let me have what you cannot juſtly deny me, a Copy of my Charge, and the depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Witneſſes, I ſhould ſtand as clear in the eyes of the Law, in the eyes of your Lordſhip, and all thi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

And thus much I have done, and am able to do no more; therefore if you do deny me, I ſhall be abundantly ſatisfied; howſoever, it ſhall pleaſe God to ſuffer you to deal with me. Concerning the Witneſſes, I have little further to ſay, but deſire that the Lord would forgive them, as I do freely, would not change conditions with them, though I were ſure to die in fire flaming, or in the mouth of Lyons, even in the worſt condition that could be imagined<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I both pity, and deſire to mourn for them, who have ſo deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately wounded their own Souls and Conſciences to deſtroy my life. And the Lord grant, that not one drop of my bloud which they have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to ſhed, may not ſtand betwixt them and Mercy, when they are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their dying beds a crying for it. And this is the worſt hurt I wiſh them
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:29676:10"/>
for all the wrong they have done to me. Now the Lord of Heaven direct your Lordſhip, and this honourable Court, that you may not ſuffer the Witneſſes Teſtimonies to be ſtrained for me to loſe my life upon circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, or what is ſuppoſed to be, or in Conſcience thought, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to clear proof and evidence; do that which may give you comfort upon a dying bed, and no more then you dare look God in the face with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and anſwer to me his poor ſervant, who am innocent at the Bar of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, where I ſhall have free liberty to ſpeak, and you muſt, and ſhall hear me; the Lord of Heaven direct you, that you do no more then what the Law will allow, and that what you doe, may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the mind of God, and moſt for his Glory, and the good of me a helpleſſe priſoner at the Bar; and ſo let it go which way it will, I ſhall ſubmit with abundance of content and ſatisfaction, and with a quiet ſpirit, ſay the will of the Lord be done.</p>

My Lord, I hope I am before a Court that doth conſider, that all thoſe days works will be judged over

again; therefore I cannot imagine that any Court of Juſtice in the world will proceed to Sentence upon ſo ſlender a Teſtimony that lies before you, but that you will rather allow me thoſe helps that may enable me to end the difference that is betwixt the State and me, that is, to let me have a Copie of my Charge, the depoſition of the Witneſſes, and Councell aſſigned me; without which, it is as impoſſible to defend my ſelf, as for a little child to encounter an Armed man with a drawn Sword in his hand. My Lord, I have no more to ſay, but ſhall ſubmit to God what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever comes; and, as I ſaid before, ſo I ſay again, I do freely forgive the Witneſſes, but do deſire that the Court will not proceed upon ſo ſlight and ſlender Teſtimonies, which never can, nor will hold water in the ſight of God, or Law.</p>

               <p>M. <hi>Gibbons,</hi> moſt of what you have ſaid now, you ſaid before, only you made ſome little addition, the Court hath debated your buſineſs and Life, with as much care as if you were the greateſt Noble man in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and upon the debate, they are perſwaded in their Conſciences that you deſerve to be Sentenced.</p>

               <p>My Lord, M. <hi>Gibbons</hi> pleads for his Life, and I for Juſtice in the befalf of the Common-wealth, therefore I deſire you will proceed to Sentence according to the Judgement of the Court. Whereupon Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence was read: After that all the whole Charge was read, and M. <hi>Gibbons</hi> Sentenced as a Falſe Traytor, to return to that place from whence he came, ſo to ſuffer death, by having his Head ſevered from his Body.</p>

            <sp>
               <p>M. <hi>Gibbons,</hi> you having nothing to doe, but to prepare your ſelf for God; you have a great acquaintance among the Miniſters, you ſhould do very well to ſend for them, and reveal what you know, and ſo do the State what good you can before you die.</p>

            <p>But M. <hi>Gibbons</hi> ſaid not one word more, but took his leave of the Court, humbly bowing to them; and after that, he bowed to the Attorney Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, and took his leave of him, and ſo came down the Staires with abundance of cheerfulneſſe, ſpeaking to his friends, and ſhaking them by the hands. And in this manner he went along the Hall untill he took Coach to go to priſon.</p>
            <p>Were we but able to give the world account of theſe three dayes Triall that M. <hi>Gibbons</hi> had, with what ſcorn and provocations the Attorney Generall did all along carry himſelf; and how much he was diſ-inabled by taking away his Papers, and all other things, whereby he ſhould make his defence; and now at laſt receive the Sentence of Death upon ſuch a Teſtimony as very few, or none, are ſatisfied with that heard the Triall; were it all publiſhed to the world, I dare ſay ſuch hard meaſure and deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſo ſevere a Triall was never known upon <hi>Engliſh</hi> ground.</p>

            <head>A true relation how I was invited to eſcape out of Priſon by <hi>Smith,</hi> who with his Maſter <hi>Dyke</hi> agreed moſt cruelly to betray, and cozen me of two hundred pounds.</head>
            <p>UPon Wedneſday night I called up <hi>Smith</hi> to pay him two ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, I had a <hi>20<hi rend="sup">ſ</hi>
               </hi> piece in my hand, let me ſee it ſaid <hi>Smith;</hi> when he had it, I told him I did not care if I gave <hi>200</hi> of theſe for my Liberty; ſaid <hi>Smith,</hi> I was offered <hi>300.</hi> I told him it was the firſt time I heard it. <hi>Smith</hi> came up again to my Chamber about one of the clock upon Thurſday morning, and when he had awakned me out of my ſleep, was very earneſt to perſwade me to be gone, if I would give a <hi>100</hi> in hand, and promiſe another, he would let me goe? I told him I would rather die my ſelf, then either wrong him, or his Maſter, he ſaid it could be no wrong to neither. Here he told me a long ſtory of one <hi>Wharton,</hi> over the Gallery by the great yard; I told him there were ſome friends of mine were looking over, and ſaid I might get away by that Gallery; I told them I never meant to try, for indeed I did abhor to make ſuch an eſcape, or to break priſon to hurt any perſon. But M. <hi>Smith</hi> ſtill following me with perſwaſions, and fully awakning me out of my ſleep, told me he would let me out of the Gate, and did give me aſſurance it would neither hurt him, nor his Maſter. At laſt I did adviſe, and concluded, that if I did not accept of ſuch a fair call, and free offer, I might become guilty of my own death. So at laſt I concluded to give him a <hi>100<hi rend="sup">l</hi>.</hi> and writ him a Note for another <hi>100. Smith</hi> having got my <hi>100<hi rend="sup">l</hi>.</hi> ſeemed very carefull to have me alter my habit, and told me, that with ſome difficulty, he had ſent his wife away, and therefore bad me prepare to be gone; he went down before me to ſee that the yard was clear, and when he had made ſome ſearch, he let me out of the Gate, where, by his appointment, ſtood <hi>Dyke,</hi> and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:29676:12"/>
another man, with <hi>Smiths</hi> wife ready to receive me, who preſently called me by my name, brought me in again, and kept my <hi>100<hi rend="sup">l</hi>.</hi> from me; and that ſame night <hi>Dyke</hi> went down to acquaint the Councell of State. Now I appeal to all, whether ſuch cruelty was ever practiced, as <hi>Dyke</hi> and <hi>Smith</hi> have done upon me a dying man. It was reſolved to go quickly to the Scaffold, but <hi>Dyke</hi> and his man, as if they intended to gratifie the Devil, uſeth all poſſible means to take off my thoughts of dying, by preſcribing a way to be gone; which <hi>Smith</hi> entreated me to accept of, and offered to go along with me himſelf; when I did not accept of, then <hi>Smith</hi> told me a long narration how he would anſwer the Councell of State how impoſſible it was to prove any thing againſt him, and that he knew his Maſter could receive no hurt, nor he neither: And that he did verily believe the Councell of State, and his Maſter both, would be glad if I were gone. I do forgive both <hi>Dyke</hi> and his man, but I fear the Lord will make a ſad reckoning with them both: remember the words of a dying man, and mark their end, and bleſſe God when I am dead for his goodneſſe towards me; for all this is ſo far from unfitting me, that it makes me the more willing to leave the world, bleſſed be God, I am going from ſuch a Generation.</p>
