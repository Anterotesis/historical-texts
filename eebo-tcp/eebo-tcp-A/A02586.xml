            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Had meant to take leave of the Preſſe, as one that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented to bee guilty of this common ſurfet. Yet once againe my zeale ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges me to breake ſilence. I finde ſo little feare of God in this world which I am ſhortly leaving, that
<pb facs="tcp:3926:5"/>
I could not forbeare, after my tears, to beſtow ſome inke upon it. Every man can bewaile it, I have ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died to redreſſe it. Wee may indevour that which GOD onely can ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. I humbly leave this to the worke of no leſſe then an omnipotent grace. In the meane time it is both holy and lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to project the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; and it ſhall bee the no-ſmall comfort of my death-bed, that I have
<pb facs="tcp:3926:5"/>
left behind me this ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable advice of better thoughts; which, when I am gone, may ſurvive to the benefit of many: Know withall that this Treatiſe entred the Preſſe under the honored name of my deare Lord, the Earle of <hi>Norwich,</hi> whoſe death preventing the publication, hath ſent it forth Patron-leſſe; Mee thought I ſhould not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure that what was once his, in my deſtination,

That bleſſed ſoule not ſtaying the leiſure of my preſent directions, haſted up to the free view of the

face of his God, which I could onely ſhew dimly, and aloofe. There will be more uſe of the imitation of his practice, then of the honour of his protection; Let us goe cheerefully on in the ſteps of true piety, and conſcionable obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, untill our faith like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſhall ſhut up in an happy fruition.</p>

otherwiſe with Feare, when it is taken up with worldly oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currents of paine, loſſe, ſhame, it is no better than a trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome paſſion, but when wee ſpeak of the feare of God, the caſe and ſtyle is ſo altered, that the breaſt of a Chriſtian is not capable of a more divine grace.

compoſition in that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall eſſence; ſo its fruition of God is made up of one ſimple act alone, which here reſults out of two diſtinct faculties. It is enough for us to know, that if all perfection of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and full union with God conſiſt in the ſeeing of him, in his glory, then it is, and muſt be our begun happineſſe, to ſee him (as we may) here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: hee can never be other than he is; our apprehenſion of him varies: Here we can only ſee him darkly, as in a glaſſe, there cleerely, and as hee is.

               <p>But what a contradiction is here, in ſeeing the Inviſible? If inviſible, how ſeene? and if ſeene, how inviſible? Surely God is a moſt purely and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply ſpirituall eſſence. Here is

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:3926:32"/>
the ſame Spirit of God within us, that muſt enable us, both to the faculty, and exerciſe of ſeeing the Inviſible; for the performance whereof, there muſt be, in the fourth place, a trajection of the viſuall beames of the ſoule, thorow all earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly occurrences, terminating them only in God; as now, we look thorow the aire, at any object, but our ſight paſſes thorow it, and reſts not in it: whiles we are here, we cannot but ſee the world; even the holieſt eye cannot look off it; but it is to us, as the vaſt aire is betwixt us and the Starry heaven, only for paſſage; all is tranſlucid, till the ſight arrive

there; there it meetes with that ſolid object of perfect content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and happineſſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it is throughly bounded. When it hath therefore attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thither, there muſt bee, in the fifth place, a certaine divine irradiation of the mind, which is now filled, and taken up with a lightſome apprehenſion of an infinite Majeſty, of a glory incomprehenſible, and bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe; attended and adored by millions of heavenly Angels, and glorified Spirits; whereto way muſt be made by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of a tranſcendent light; wherein God dwelleth; as far above this outward light which we ſee, as that is above dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:3926:33"/>
For though we may not in our thoughts liken God to any created brightneſſe, (bee it never ſo glorious;) yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing forbids us to think of the place of his eternall habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as infinitely reſplendent, above the compariſon of thoſe beames which any creature can caſt forth. He is clothed (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) with light as with a garment. Lo, when wee cannot ſee a mans ſoule, yet we may ſee his body; and when we cannot ſee the body, yet wee may ſee the clothes: Even ſo, though wee may not think to ſee the eſſence of God, yet we may ſee, and conceive of this his reſplendent garment
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:3926:33"/>
of light. Farre be it therefore from us, when we would look up to a Deity, to have our eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight terminated in a gloomy opacity, and ſad darkſomneſſe, which hath no affinity with any appendance of that divine Majeſty, who hath thought good to deſcribe it ſelfe by light: Let our hearts adore ſuch an infinite ſpirit, as that the light wherein he dwels, is inacceſſible, the light which he hath, and is, is inconceive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and rather reſt themſelves in an humble and devout ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of what they cannot know, than weary themſelves with a curious ſearch of what they cannot comprehend.

the preſence of Angels; but ſent their eye-beames after him into heaven, ſo earneſtly, that the reproofe of thoſe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſpirits could hardly pull them off. You are now ready to tell me, this is a fit task for us, when we are in our heaven; and to plead the difficulty of ſuch our ſettlement, in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of change; where our eyes cannot but bee forced aſide, with the neceſſity of our worldly occaſions; and to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion the poſſibility of view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two objects at once; God, and the world; not conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that herein lyes the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of the Chriſtians skill, in theſe divine Opticks:
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:3926:36"/>
The carnall eye looks through God, at the world; The ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall eye lookes through the world, at God; the one of thoſe he ſeeth mediately, the other terminatively; neither is it in nature hard to conceive, how we may ſee two ſuch objects, as whereof one is in the way to the other, as thorow a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective glaſſe, we can ſee a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote mark; or thorow a thin cloud wee can ſee heaven. Thoſe glorious Angels of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven are never without the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of God, yet being mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring ſpirits for the good of his Elect, here below, they muſt needs take notice of theſe earthly occurrents: the variety
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:3926:36"/>
of theſe ſublunary objects can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not divert their thoughts from their Maker: Although alſo (to ſpeak diſtinctly) the eye thus imployed is not the ſame: nothing hinders but that whiles the bodily ſees a body, the ſpirituall eye may ſee a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: As when a load-ſtone is preſented to my view, the eye of my ſenſe ſees the body, and faſhion of the ſtone, my eye of reaſon ſees the hidden vertue which is in it; both theſe kinds of eyes may be thus fixed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their ſeverall objects with<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>out any interſection of the viſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all lines of each other. But, that no man may think God hath ſo little reſpect to our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:3926:37"/>
as to impoſe upon us im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible tasks, we muſt know, that ſince the ſoule of man in this ſtate of fraile mortality, is not capable of a perpetuall act of ſuch an intuition of God, here is neceſſary uſe of a juſt diſtinction: As the Schoole therefore is wont to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of intentions, ſo muſt we here of the apprehenſion of God, which is either actuall, or habituall, or virtuall. Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, when our cogitations are taken up, and directly imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the meet conſideration of the bleſſed Deity, and the things thereto appertaining: Habituall, when we have a ſettled kind of holy diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:3926:37"/>
and aptitude inclining us ever to theſe divine thoughts, ready ſtill to bring them forth into act, upon every leaſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Virtuall, betwixt both theſe, being neither ſo quick and agile, as the actuall; nor yet ſo dull and flagging as the habituall, (which may be inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to a man whether ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or otherwiſe buſied) when by the power of an heavenly diſpoſition, wrought in the mind, we are ſo affected, as that divine thoughts are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the conſtant (though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible) gueſts of the ſoule; whiles the vertue of that ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall illumination ſticks ſtill by us, and is, in a ſort, derived
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:3926:38"/>
into all our ſubſequent co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations; leaving in them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall remainders of the holy effects of the deeply-wrought, and well grounded apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of God: As in a pilgrim towards the holy Land, there are not alwaies actual thoughts concerning his way, or end; yet there is ſtill, an habituall reſolution, to begin and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe that journey; and a ſecret power of his continued will, to put forward his ſteps to that purpoſe; there being a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine impreſſion remaining in the motive faculty, which ſtill inſenſibly ſtirres him towards the place deſired: Neither is it unuſuall, (even in nature) to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:3926:38"/>
ſee many effects continuing, when the motion of the cauſe, by which they were wrought, ceaſeth; As when ſome deep Bell is rung to the height, the noyſe continues ſome time in the ayre, after the clapper is ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent: Or when a ſtone is caſt into the water, the circles that are cauſed by it are enlarged, and multiplyed, after the ſtone lyes ſtill in the bottome.</p>
               <p>How ever therefore we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hope in this life (through our manifold weakneſſes, and diſtractions) to attaine unto the ſteddy continuance of the actuall view of him that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible, yet, to the habituall, and virtuall power of appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:3926:39"/>
him, wee may, (through the goodneſſe of him, whom we ſtrive to ſee) happily aſpire.</p>
               <p>Neither may we be wanting to our ſelves in taking all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of renewing theſe our actuall viſions of God; both ſet, and caſuall: there is nothing that wee can ſee, which doth not put us in mind of God; what creature is there, wherin we do not eſpy ſome footſteps of a Deity? every herb, flower, leafe, in our garden; every Bird, and Fly in the aire; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Ant and Worme in the ground; every Spider in our window, ſpeakes the omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and infinite wiſedome
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:3926:39"/>
of their Creator: None of theſe may paſſe us without ſome fruitfull monition of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging a divine hand. But beſides theſe, it will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite for us, every morning to ſeaſon our thoughts with a ſerious renovation of our aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full apprehenſions of God; and not to take off our hand, till wee have wrought our hearts to ſome good compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency of right, and holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of that glorious Majeſty; the efficacy whereof may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late it ſelfe to the whole follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing day; which may be often revived by our frequent ejacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations: But above all other, when wee have to do with
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:3926:40"/>
God, in the ſet immediate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of his ſervices, and our heavenly devotions, we muſt endeavour (to our utmoſt) to ſharpen our eyes, to a ſpirituall perſpicacity; ſtriving to ſee him, whom we ſpeak unto, and who ſpeaks unto us, as he hath pleaſed to reveale himſelfe. But, over and beſide all theſe, even when we have no provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations from any particular oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, it muſt be our continual care, to labour with our God, that it would pleaſe him to work us to ſuch an holy, and heavenly diſpoſition, as that what ever our imployments may be, we may never want the comfort of a virtuall and

habituall enjoying the ſight of God; ſo as the power and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of our firſt, well-taken apprehenſion may runne on, thorow all the following acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and events both of our life, and death.</p>

In a generality, we ſhall thus deſcry them in our owne

hearts. True grace is right-bred, of a divine originall, and comes down from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, even from the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of lights; Gods ſpirit working with, and by his own ordinances, produceth it in the ſoule, and feeds it by the ſame holy meanes it is wrought: The coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit is earth-bred, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from mere nature, out of the grounds of ſenſuali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alitie. True grace drives at no other end than the glory of the giver, and ſcornes to look lower than heaven: The counterfeit aimes at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but vaine applauſe, or carnall advantage, not
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:3926:125"/>
caring to reach an inch above his own head.</p>
               <p>True grace is apt to croſſe the plauſibleſt inclinations of corrupt nature, and chears up the heart to a delihgtfull performance of all good du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as the beſt paſtime. The counterfeit is a meere paraſite of fleſhly appetite, and findes no harſhneſſe, but in holy devotions. True grace is undantedly conſtant in all oppoſition; and like a well wrought vault, is ſo much the ſtronger by how much more weight it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoes; This metall is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer for the fire, this Eagle can look upon the hotteſt

Laſtly, true grace is beſt alone: the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit is all for witneſſes. In briefe, if in a holy jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie of our own deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, wee ſhall put dayly interrogatories to our hearts, and paſſe them under ſevere examinations, we ſhall not bee in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to preſume upon our miſtaken graces; but the more we ſearch, the more cauſe we ſhall find of our
