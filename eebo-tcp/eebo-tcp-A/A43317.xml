         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

for a time separated from our particular cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
and stations, and sent forth into this
Kingdome for a more publike imployment,
are in all humility and patience, waiting
what the Lord who is about some great Work in his
Church, (for which are raised so great Commotions in
these and other Kingdoms of the earth) will be pleased to
do for Reformation of Religion; the great Work of the
honourable houses of Parliament, and the reverend As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
of Divines; and for Uniformity in Religion, so
much desired by all the godly in the three Kingdomes:
Unto whch an entrance is made by a solemne League and
Covenant. We finde our selves bound against the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices
and mistakings of some, who in the dark are afraid of
that which they know not, and suffer their affections of
love and hatred to run before their understanding; and
against the mis-representations and indirect aspersions of
others, who do so commend their own way, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Churches thereby suffer disparagement; To
give that testimony unto the order and government of
the Reformed Churches, and particularly of the
Church of Scotland, which they do well deserve, and to
honour them whom the Lord hath so highly honoured,
in advancing the Kingdom of his Son, in the converting


<pb n="2" facs="tcp:109557:3"/>
and saving of so many souls, and in opposing and suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
a world of corruptions, Heresies, and Schismes, by
his wonderfull blessing upon their order and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>In this our humble testimony and true relation,<note place="margin">Our inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> unto
which we are at this time thus necessitate, we shall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
nothing but a simple and innocent manifestation and
defence, without desire or intention to give the smallest
offence to any who fear God, love the Truth, &amp; desire to
walk in truth and in love with their Brethren. This our
profession, we are confident will finde credit with all that
know us, and have observed our wayes since our coming
into this Kingdom, which have been, and (so farre as the
the truth will suffer us) ever shall be, to unite, and not to
divide; to compose, rather then to create differences;
which we conceive also to be one principall end, of the
calling of the Assembly of Divines, and which all the
members of the Assembly, against all particular interests,
are after a speciall manner ingaged to aime at and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
            <p>The order and Government of the reformed Churches
in the beauty and strength thereof,<note place="margin">The Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Reformed Churches is known.</note> as it is not hid in a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
wrapped up in a Mystery, or covered under a cloud of
darknesse; but is known to the Nations and Kingdomes
of the earth, openly professed and practised in the eyes of
the world, and cleerly seen, as a City that is set on a hill,
in the light of the Sunne at noone day; So is it commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and already confirmed by a long tract of time, and the
experience of many yeers, and hath been countenanced
from Heaven, and blessed from above, with the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the truth and unity of Religion, against Heresies
and errours in Doctrine, Idolatry and corruptions in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and all sorts of Sects and Schismes, wherewith it


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:109557:3"/>
hath been continually assaulted: <hi>How goodly are thy Tents:
O</hi> Jacob, <hi>and thy Tabernacles O Israel, &amp;c.</hi> It hath made the
Church of Christ terrible as an Army with banners, and
like a strong and fenced City, against which the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
have despaired to prevaile, but by making a breach
in this wall, and where they have gained ground or gotten
any advantage, either the wall hath not been built, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
built hath been broken down, or not vigilantly keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Watch-men.</p>
            <p>The Instruments which the Lord used in the blessed
Work of Reformation of the Church of Scotland (wee
speak not of the reformers of other Churches) were not
onely learned and holy men,<note place="margin">The Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers of the Church of Scotland.</note> but had somewhat in their
calling, gifts, and zeal to the glory of God, more then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary:
Their Adversaries were not able to resist the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and Spirit by which they spake; some of them had
a propheticall Spirit, manifested in divers particular and
wonderfull predictions, and some of them were honoured
to be Martyrs, and sealed the truth with their blood: So
that in them, in the people of God converted by them, and
and in the Reformation brought about by the blessing of
God upon their labours, against all the Learning, Pride,
Policie, and abused power of the time, there was to bee
seen a representation of the Primitive and Apostolicke
times, and a new resurrection from the dead. After them
also did the Lord raise up in the Church of Scotland ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
burning and shining lights, men of the same spirit,
mighty in converting of souls, walking in the same way,
and who communicated their Counsels and keeped cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence
with Divines of other Nations, and with the
greatest and purest lights in the Church of England, in the
point of Reformation and setling of Church-government,
which at that time was the common study and endeavour


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:109557:4"/>
of both, and wherein they and their Successors continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
till the times of defection, which made an unhappy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption
of the work. What men are like to do in after
times we cannot foresee; but we have not seen or heard
of any to this day, farrer from partiality and prejudice in
the matters of God, then their wayes witnesse them to
have been; and were they now living we beleeve there
would be none in the reformed Churches, so far swayed
with partiality or prejudice, that would deny them this
testimony.</p>
            <p>They had no other rule and paterne of Reformation
but the word of God,<note place="margin">The rule and patern of their Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</note> and the practice of the Apostolicke
Churches in the Word. All the books of God are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
the book of life, the book of nature, the book of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
and especially the book of Scripture, which was
dy<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed by the Holy Ghost, to be a perfect directory to all
the Churches, unto the second coming of Jesus Christ;
but so that it presupposeth the light and law of nature, or
the rules of common prudence, to be our guide in circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
or things locall, temporall, and personall, which
being <hi>Ecolesiastico Politica,</hi> are common to the Church
with civill societies, and concerning which, the Word gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
generall rules to be universally and constantly obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by all persons, in all times and places: Of things of
this kind a godly and wise Divine giveth two rules: One
is, that the Physician cannot by sending his letter to the
Patient appoint the dyet and bath, the pulse must bee
toucht, and as it is in the proverbiall speech, <hi>gladiatorem
oportet in arena capere consilium.</hi> The other is, that in things
of this kind, when the change is not to the better, it is both
without and against reason to make a change; without
reason, because when the change is made unto that which
is but as good, the one and the other in reason are equall:


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:109557:4"/>
Against reason, because the change it self in such a case, is
an hinderance to Edification, savoureth of the love of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation,
and derogateth to the authority which maketh
the Constitution.</p>
            <p>What they had once received,<note place="margin">Their cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty in matters of Religion.</note> not upon probable
grounds in way of conjecture, but upon the warrant of the
Word, and by the teaching of the spirit, with certaintie of
faith, that they resolved to hold fast, &amp; did hate every false
way contrary unto it. They did not in the matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
rest upon a <hi>Sceptical</hi> or <hi>Pyrrhonian</hi> uncertainty (the
charge of the Orthodox Divines against the tenets of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians
and Socinians) which keepeth the mind uncertain
unstable, is a fountain of perpetuall alterations in the
Church of God, an open door to all heresies and schismes
to enter by, and a ground of despairing to bring questions
and controversies to a finall issue and determination. And
for us, as upon the one part, we not only conceive, that no
man attaineth so full assurance of faith, in any matter of
Religion, but he may receive encrease of his faith, and
therefore should alwayes have his minde open and ready
to receive more light from the Word and Spirit of God:
but also do ingenuously acknowledge (as wee have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
professed) that wee are most willing to hear and
learn from the Word of God, what needeth further to be
reformed in the Church of Scotland: Yet God forbid,
that we should never come to any certainty of perswasion,
or that we should ever be learning, and never come to the
knowledge of the truth; wee ought to be resolute and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable
in so far as we have attained; and this we take to
be the ground, as of other practices, so also of Covenants
and Oaths, both assertory and promissory, in matters of
Religion.</p>
            <p>As they held it not sufficient,<note place="margin">Their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</note> to receive or retain some


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:109557:5"/>
such practices, as other reformed Churches judged war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable;
for thus they should have rested upon some few
principles and beginnings of Reformation, and might
have differed as much in other things from the Reformed
Churches, as they agreed in some things with them; so can
it not be satisfactory, that any Church should only pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
some things, universally received in the Reformed
Churches. (1) All Christian Churches, although very
different in ordinances and practices, yet do agree in some
things, (2) If our desire of Uniformity with other refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Churches, and the reverend esteem we have of them,
draw us to conform to them in some things; upon the
same reason we ought to joyne in all things wherein they
do all agree amongst themselves. (3) Differences about
Negatives and the denying of profession and practice in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
matters wherein they are all unanimous and uniform,
may prove no lesse dangerous and destructive, then diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
about Affirmatives. The Arrians, Socinians, and
many others, do erre dangerously in denying some posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
points and received principles of the doctrine of the
reformed Churches, concerning the Person of Christ, and
his Offices. The Antinomians also (if we should mention
them) do also agree with us in the principles of Grace;
but in their superstructures and conclusions, runne in a way
destructive to the doctrine and deductions of the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
and reformed Churches, and to the principles recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by themselves. (4) Such Churches as make profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of differences only in Negatives, or in denying some
practices received in the reformed Churches, have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and do hold some positive practices of their own,
which the reformed Churches do not allow, and which
to them are negative. Of this (would we suffer our selves
to descend into particulars) we might give divers known


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:109557:5"/>
instances: now if they do not allow of the reformed
Churches, in so far as they do not admit of these their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
practices, how shall they think that the reformed
Churches can allow them in the like? for the rule is,
<hi>Wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thy self, for thou
that judgest dost the same things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They did honour <hi>Luther, Calvin,</hi> and many others,<note place="margin">They are not to be called Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinians.</note> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
their Predecessors or contemporaries, who had heart
or hand, especially in an eminent degree, in the blessed
work of Reformation: for their direction, they made use
of the light which such notable servants of Jesus Christ
did hold forth, in doctrine and discipline, and in all thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse
they did desire and wish, that their names might
be had in eternall remembrance: Nor was it possible that
so great an alteration as the corrupt state of the Church
required could be effected, and not carry some remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of the instruments: but for this to call us <hi>Calvini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi>
and the reformed Churches, <hi>Calvinian reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi>
is to disgrace the true Churches of Christ, and to
simbolize with the Papists, who call themselves The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke
Church, and hold the rule delivered by <hi>Hierome</hi>
against the <hi>Luciferians: If any where we finde men professing
Christianity, called by the particular names of men, know them
to be the Synagogue of Antichrist, and not the Church of
Christ.</hi> The separation may be well allowed to be called
Brownists, and others from the matter wherein they erre,
and part from all, not onely the reformed, but Christian
Churches, as the <hi>Monothelites</hi> of old, and the <hi>Anabapists</hi>
now, may bear their own names. They who apprehend
any danger in names (as there is a great deale of danger in
them) ought not to appropriate unto their own opinion,
that which is common to all the reformed Churches, nor
to joyne with Papists in giving names of Sects unto the


<pb n="8" facs="tcp:109557:6"/>
reformed Churches; and they who conceive no evill in
so doing, ought not to offend, that names are given unto
them, especially since their differences from the reformed
Churches, must be designed under some name and noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and in this case charity commands the mildest names,
such as hint most clearly at the difference, and are farrest

            <p>Nothing was farrer from their thoughts and intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,<note place="margin">Their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation was not framed to State ends.</note>
then to frame in their own forge a Lesbian rule, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
to any particular forme of civill policy, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyable
with State ends. That they looked with single<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of minde to the rule of Scripture, we give these three
evidences (1) The great pains they took in searching the
will of God, and after they had found it, their grievous
sufferings from the civill authority in defence thereof, of
both which afterward in the own place (2) The restlesse
objection and continuall opposition of politick men and
Court Sycophants against Presbyteriall government, as
incompatible with Monarchy, and their manners (3) And
the necessary assertion of the true policy of the Church
by Divines in both Kingdoms (between whom there was
no notable difference) demonstrating that it was in it self
unalterable, because divine, and yet complyable with
every lawfull kinde of humane policy and civill govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and able to keep a whole Kingdom or state in a right

their education in other Churches, which was the
goodnesse of God to them and us: there did they see ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of Reformation, and conversed with other refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,
by whom they were taught from the word in the
wayes of God, and thence did they bring (as the Romans
their laws of old from Greece and other Nations) models


<pb n="9" facs="tcp:109557:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of Church-government, that comparing one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
they might fix upon that which was builded upon
the foundation of the Apostles. Like as we accompt it no
small happines, that we have bin educated in the Church
of Scotland, and are acquainted with the practice of
Church-government there, which giveth us much light
and confidence against such scruples and doubtings as are
powerfull enough to suspend the assent of others, who by
reason of their education in other Churches, are strangers
unto it. Nor do we know a reason why education in sound
doctrine and true worship, should be accompted a matter
of thanksgiving to God, and yet should glory in this,
that we are not by education ingaged in any one form of
of Discipline and Church-government, but left to our
selves to be moulded by our own private thoughts.</p>

Government of the Church by Assemblies and Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries,
although they could not attain that perfection at
first in the infancie of Reformation, but gave place to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
which in such cases is universall, and in this they
followed the example and practice of the Churches plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Apostles, which if not at first, yet afterward
were of greater number in one City, then did or could
ordinarily assemble in one place for the worship of God,
and therefore had a plurality of Pastors and Officers,
which made up a common Presbytery for governing the
whole: They set up such Officers in the Church, as were
both necessary and sufficient for the Church, <hi>Pastors, Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
ruling Elders,</hi> and <hi>Deacons:</hi> They did not permit such
as are called Laymen, and intended to continue such, to
preach or prophesie in the Congregation, nor did they
admit of any other ruling Elders, but such as are solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
elected and ordained, although they do maintain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves

            <p>What shall be rendred unto the Magistrate by others,<note place="margin">What they give unto the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate.</note>
whose particular tenets are not yet known either to the
Church or Magistrate, unlesse it be in a hid and secret
way, unto which we are not privy, we cannot determine:
but the doctrine of the Reformed Churches, concerning
the honour and obedience due to the Magistrate, is open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
known by their confessions of faith, and long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
practices; and this much we know, that the principles
both of Civill and Church-government, are laid out in
Scripture, and therefore the one cannot be contrary to the
other, or they inconsistent between themselves. Nor do
wee measure the power of the Magistrate by the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Presbyteriall Government, but both of them
by the Word, and therefore deny not unto the Magistrate
what God giveth them; and more then this dare we not
professe, for any respect to our selves, or to the form of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall
Government professed by us: How much,
and for what ends, the Pagans and Infidels of old, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,
Prelates, and Arminians of late, have laboured to
make the way of Christ hatefull to Princes and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates,
is too well known, and hath been bitterly felt, yet
God hath cursed this policy in the end. There may bee
good reason to expresse our judgement of this or other
points of duty from Scripture: but to avouch when we


<pb n="11" facs="tcp:109557:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are not challenged, and that only in the generall, by way
of comparison, That we ascribe more to the Magistrate,
then the reformed Churches doe, they being faithfull to
their own principles of Ecclesiasticall Government, may
suffer a harder construction, then we our selves would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
under-go, or put upon the intentions of men, who
seek not their own things, but the things of Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>As the blessed Instruments of Reformation proceeded
by no other rule but the Word of God,<note place="margin">Their dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent search for true Church-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and the good hand of God upon them.</note> so did they with
great judgement and learning, which they had in a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
above others, examine and frame all things diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and exactly according to the rule; and although the
Reformers in England were either altogether, or for the
greater part taken up with the Doctrine; yet in the
Church of Scotland it was otherwise. After the doctrine
was established, which was speedily done, they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised
in Conferences and Assemblies, with debating
the matters of Discipline and Government above the
space of 20 years, which endured much opposition from
authority, from worldly men, and from the adversaries of
the Truth, both Prelaticall on the one hand, and upon the
other hand Separatists, of which sort some came into
Scotland from England, which was unto them a whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone
to quicken them, and to make them the more cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspect
&amp; exact in their way, which lay in the middle,
betwixt Episcopacy upon the one hand, and popular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
on the other. It pleased the Lord, whose presence
and blessing they sought after in these dayes with fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
prayer and humiliation, both in private and in the
publike Nationall Assemblies, so to assist and lead them
in all truth; that the Church of Scotland was honoured
from abroad, both from England and other Nations, with
the testimony of such a Reformation, as other Churches


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:109557:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
accounted to be the greatest happinesse upon earth, and
when they were wishing after a Reformation, they made
it the measure of their wishes. We would willingly shun
comparisons, were we not brought upon this straine: We
do upon very good reason judge the Church of England
in the midst of her Ceremonies, to have beene a true
Church, and the ministery thereof, notwithstanding the
many blemishes and corruptions cleaving unto it, to have
been a true ministery, and shall never deny unto them that
praise, whether in debating controversies with Papists, or
in practicall Divinity for private Christians, which they
do most justly deserve. Upon the other part, we are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
so ignorant nor so arrogant, as to ascribe to the
Church of Scotland such absolute purity and perfection,
as hath not need or cannot admit of further Reformation.
Yet that there is a wide difference betwixt the one and
the other, acknowledged also in the Common Covenant;
Wee bring two famous witnesses from the Church of
England to prove: The one is <hi>Brightman; Loath would I
be</hi> (saith he, speaking of the Church of Scotland) <hi>to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
any man to envy, or to grieve him with my words: Yet this
I must say, There is no place where the Doctrine soundeth more
purely, the worship of God is exercised more uncorruptly, where
more faithfull diligence of the Pastor doth flourish, or more free
or willing obedience is given by the people, nor yet where there
is greater reverencing of the whole Religion amongst all or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi>
And afterwards<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Neither doth it onely keep the Doctrine
of salvation free from corruption, but it doth also both deliver
in writing, and exercise in practice, that sincere manner of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
whereby men are made partakers of salvation,</hi>
Revel. of the Apocal. cap. 37. The other is <hi>Cartwright:
Yea, the Scottish Nation, which were some yeers behind us in the
profession of the Gospell, the first day almost that they received


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:109557:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the truth, did by many degrees in the way of purity outstrip us.</hi>
These two witnesses, unto which we might adde many
other from the reformed Churches in other Nations,
bear testimony, that there is no such thing in the Church
of Scotland, as might prove her to be no Church, or bar
Communion in worship with her, as the Liturgy, Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
and Prelacy in the Church of England; or that
the Corruptions of the one and the other are of the same
kinde, equally destructive of the essence of a Church, and
equally impedetive of Communion and worship. All vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Churches, which have been, or shall be at any time
on earth, consist of persons good and bad, Sheep and
Goats, Wheat and Tares, such as walk Christianly and
such as walk inordinatly: Which therefore must also be
the condition of the Church of Scotland, yet the order of
the Church, admitteth not either ignorant or openly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
and scandalous persons, to the participation of the
Lords supper: If any Pastor and particular Eldership bee
negligent in their duty, it is their fault, who are to beare
their own guiltinesse, and ought not to be imputed to the
order of the Church, which standeth in force against it.
We may be very confident, that the godly people, who
did transplant themselves out of this Island, (the fame of
whose piety and zeal shall never suffer detraction or the
smallest diminution from our thoughts or words) might
have lived in the Church of Scotland, injoying the pure
Ordinances of God, with peace in their consciences and
comfort to their souls, and would have willingly come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Scotland, when they went into New-England, could
they have been free of the usurpation and tyranny of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats
and the Prelatical party, which at that time did reigne
and rage in that Kingdome, vexing the Godly Ministery
and people there, with many and bitter sufferings.</p>

The two extreams of the true forme of Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,<note place="margin">The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of against adversaries on both hands.</note>
which standeth in the middle way betwixt Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish

Anarchie, were contrary one to another, and have
their own degrees of Tyranny or Anarchie in themselves,
which is the cause of their sub-divisions, fractions, and
differences amongst themselves: but both sides agree, and
strongly joyne in opposing the true Government, which
standing constantly, and without variation between the
one and the other, is contrary to both. This is the true
cause (nor could it be otherwise) that on what hand the
invasion was hotest, there the defence was strongest.
Against Prelacie which had many friends, and therefore
made many enemies to Presbyteries, the Presbyteriall
power and pens were long pleading: No sooner is the
Prelaticall party, by the power and blessing of God, begun
to be subdued in this Island; but ariseth unexpectedly, The
opposition on the other hand, waiting the opportunity,
stronger then it was before, which moved some of our
Divines of late, to write on this hand in defence of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the reformed Churches, as others had done
before them in other Churches. In France <hi>Beza,</hi> &amp; against
<hi>Morellius Sadeel.</hi> Two Nationall Synods also of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Churches in France, the one at Orleans in the
year 1561. Another at Rothel 1571. And in all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Churches, governed by Presbyteries and Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,
the positive grounds of the Government are laid
open, which work equally against Adversaries on both
sides, and have been applyed against them <hi>prove nata</hi> as
they did arise or shew themselves. If so much have not
been written upon one hand as the other, in a polemicall
and Anaskeuastick way, let it be attributed unto the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versarie,
which was but obscure and weak, and from


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:109557:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
whom small danger was apprehended<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it being laid for
a common ground by them all, That where a whole
Nation is converted to the Christian faith, every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Church is not to bee left to it selfe, as if it were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
in a Nation, but that Christ had provided a way,
and there is a necessitie of a common Nationall Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement,
to preserve all the Churches in Unitie and
Peace.</p>
            <p>It is the Will of God,<note place="margin">Their suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings for the true Church government.</note> and hath been alwayes the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
course of Divine providence, that when his servants
have been diligent in searching the truth, and zealous by
professing and preaching, to hold it forth unto others,
that they confirme and seal the truth, which they have
beleeved and professed with their confession and suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
The Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> had many Confessours,
divers Pastours brought before the Lords of Councell,
the High Commission, Diocesan Synods, were removed
from their places, deprived of all the means of their live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood;
some confined, others imprisoned: a third sort
brought into <hi>England,</hi> whence some of them were never
suffered to returne, all of them for the Government of
the Church. Others for the same cause were proceeded
against by the criminall Judge, condemned of Treason,
sentenced to death, and after long imprisonment, before
and after the sentence, could finde no other mercy, but
perpetuall banishment, wherein the greater part of them
ended their dayes, without any Congregation, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of their owne Nation, rich or poore, to comfort
them. So many of these witnesses as were suffered to live
in their owne Land, did not undergoe any voluntary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ile;
but in much poverty and affliction, went up and
down, teaching and confirming the good people, and
waiting for a spring time, wherein the face of God might


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:109557:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
again shine upon his Church and (to use their owne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression)
some buds might arise out of the stumpe of
Church government left in the earth. Had they at that
time abandoned the poore oppressed Church, when they
were put from their places, and deprived of their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and had carried away with them such of the people
as were of their minde, they had (if wee would judge
according to ordinary providence, and the course of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
causes) opposed the poore desolated Church for a
prey to Episcopall oppression, and made the case of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
in that Kingdome desperate: Or if they should
have returned upon a revolution of extraordinary provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
they would have preferred the sufferings of their
Brethren left behinde them in the midst of the fiery tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
unto their owne exile, and would have been loath to
have impeded or retarded the late Reformation, with
any thing they had brought with them from abroad: so
many as returned from constrained banishment, having
in all Unitie of minde, and heart joyned in the worke of
Reformation.</p>
            <p>The Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Their exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of that true Church government for which they had done and suffered so much.</note> as all other reformed
Churches, hath used the power of the Keyes, &amp; Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censures
of all sorts, especially the gravest of excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication,
with such sharpnesse and severity, and yet with
such caution and moderation, as it hath been very pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull
and effectuall, to preserve the Name of God from
being blasphemed, the Church and people of God from
contagion, and the Delinquents brought under censure
from destruction; which are the ends proposed by them
in executing the censures or the Church, and where such
scandalls arise, whether in matter of opinion or practise,
as are apt to make the Name of God to be blasphemed,
are dangerous for the Church, and waste the Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

to abstain from, lest it render them and their profession
suspected of some such opinions and practises, as in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
wee judge to be farre from their minds and wayes.</p>
            <p>Two main objections are made against the principles

Churches,<note place="margin">This govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for Churches li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> for which the <hi>Church</hi> and Kingdome of
<hi>Scotland,</hi> have done and suffered so much of old and of
late. One is, that there is no need of the Authoritative
power of Presbiteries and Synods, and that the exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of particular <hi>Churches</hi> one to another, the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station
of one against another, and the withdrawing of
communion one from another, may bee a sufficient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,
and no lesse effectuall against all offences, then
excommunication it selfe: especially if the Magistrate
shall vouchsafe his assistance, and interpose his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
for strengthening the sentence of Noncommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To this we answer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That this Objection supposeth a case, which hath


<pb n="18" facs="tcp:109557:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not been found in the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> for the space
of above fourescore yeares, and which wee beleeve was
never heard of in any of the Reformed Churches, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
those of the separation: the pronouncing of Non-communion
or Excommunication against a whole
Church. Our excommunication hath beene executed,
and but seldome against particular members, never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
a whole Church, and wee thinke never shall bee,
and therefore this imaginary feare of that which never
falleth forth, is not considerable: Rules are made for
ordinary and usuall cases.</p>
            <p n="2">2. What shall bee the remedy where the censure is
mutuall, and two or more Churches mutually protest,
and pronounce the sentence of Non-communion one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
other? unlesse there be a common Presbyterie, or
Synod made up of the whole, which may decide the
controversie, and give order unto the severall Churches.
This Non-communion may prove a mean of division,
rather then union.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In this Exhortation, Protestation, and Non-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
there is no more to be found, then one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
member may doe against another, which yet is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
to bee unsufficient for removing of offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
unlesse the authority of the Church, of which both
of them bee members, shall interveine: Were it in the
power of particular members to submit, or not submit,
as they please, there would bee as great difference and
division amongst members, as now there is amongst
Churches.</p>
            <p n="4">4. What shall be done if the Magistrate be negligent
or care for none of those things? or if his Authoritie
cannot be obtained? or if hee bee of another Religion,
and foment the difference for his owne politicke ends?


<pb n="19" facs="tcp:109557:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hath not the wisedome of the Sonne of God provided
remedies in the Church for all the internall necessities
of the Church, and constitute it a perfect body within
it selfe.</p>
            <p n="5">5. By what probabilitie can it be made to appeare to
any Rationall man and indifferent minde, that no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
shall be as valide as authority against the obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
that <hi>via admonitionis, &amp; requisitionis,</hi> is equall with
<hi>via citationis, &amp; publicae authoritatis:</hi> There cannot be so
much as triall and examination of the offence without
Authoritie, unlesse the partie be willing to appeare: that
perswasion and Jurisdiction, that the delivering over to
Satan, and thereby striking the Conscience with the
terrour of God, by the authority of Jesus Christ, which
hath the promise of a speciall and strong ratification in
Heaven, and any other Ecclesiasticall way whatsoever,
which must be inferiour to this, and depend onely upon
perswasion on the one part, and free will on the other,
can be supposed to bee a like efficacious. No man will
say, but in civill matters, it is one thing to have adoe
with our neighbour, who hath no more authority over
us, then we have over him; and another thing to have to
doe with civill power which hath authority over both.</p>
            <p>The other Objection is:<note place="margin">This govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with the libertie and equalitie of particular Churches.</note> That by this Authoritie and
Order of Government, one Church hath power over
another, which is contrary to that liberty and equalitie
Christ hath endued his Churches with, and is no other
but a new Prelaticall dominion set over the Churches
of Christ?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To this we answer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That we are very farre from imposing or acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
any such collaterall power of one particular


<pb n="20" facs="tcp:109557:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Church over another, nay not of the greatest, in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
whatsoever over the smallest, for God hath made
them equall one to another. The power which we
maintain, is aggregative of the Officers of many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations
over the particular members of their Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration:
even as a member of the Naturall body is not
subject to another; but each one of them to the whole
Man consisting of them all: And as one Member of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
one Counseller; or to goe lower, one member
of a company, is not subject to another, but every one
to the whole Colledge: The same may bee said of
townes and cities: so is it with particular congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
combined in one Presbyterie. All the Reformed
Churches acknowledge the Independencie of one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Church upon another.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is as miserable a mistake to compare Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
and Prelates together: for the courts of Prelates are
altogether forraign and extrinsecall to the congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
over which they rule, and then indeed the Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan
Church usurpeth and tyrannizeth over other
Churches: but the power of Presbeteries in intrinsecall
and naturall, they being constitute of the Pastors and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of the particular congregations over which they
are set: So that another without themselves doth not
beare rule over them; but all of them together by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
consent doe rule over every one, which is a most
milde and free forme of Church-government: it being
no more contrary to the liberty of a particular Church
to bee ruled by a common Collegiate Presbytery, or
Ecclesiastick Senate, then it is for a Member of a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
congregation to bee ruled by his owne particular
Eldership.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Were this way of government as well known by


<pb n="21" facs="tcp:109557:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
experience unto others, as it is unto us, it would bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
rather <hi>Subsidium,</hi> then <hi>Dominium,</hi> and would be
looked at, rather as auxiliary to particular Ministers
and Elderships, then authoratative over them, especially
since they neither ordain nor depose Ministers, they
discern no censure, nor sentence of Excommunication
of any Member, without the knowledge and consent
of the congregation which is particularly concerned
therein: whatsoever their authority be, the Minister and
particular Eldership are advised, assisted, and strengthned,
rather then commanded, enjoyned, or forced: which
the particular Churches should much rather chuse, then
through want of counsell and assistance, suffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to run rashly upon Deposition or Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and afterward either be brought to the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Churches to the publike confession of their errour,
which lesseneth their authority afterward, or to have
the sentence of Non-communion pronounced against
them, which must bee the cause of Schisme or scandall.</p>
            <p n="4">So much for the present have we said,<note place="margin">This govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment usefull and benefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to all sorts of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</note> not for confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;
but meerely for justifying our owne, and other
Reformed Churches, against such misrepresentings and
mistakings, as in matters of Religion are too frequent in
this place at this time, to the perverting and abusing of
simple and unstable minds, which will never be brought
to a consistence and unitie, without this true order and
governement of the <hi>Church,</hi> and the blessing of God
from heaven upon his owne ordinance. Were Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
and civill powers acquainted with the power
thereof, they would finde their authority increased, their
worke more easie, and their places more comfortable
thereby. Such as are most adverse to this order and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment

worship, or practise) might enjoy their peace, and
all the comforts of their Ministery and profession under
it, without controlment, from that authoritative power
which they so much apprehend. The <hi>Church of England</hi>
which God hath blessed with so much learning and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie,
by this Reformation and Uniformitie with other
Reformed Churches, which all of us have solemnely
sworn and subscribed, sincerely, really, and constantly
through the grace of God, to endeavour in our severall
places and callings, should be a praise in the Earth.</p>
