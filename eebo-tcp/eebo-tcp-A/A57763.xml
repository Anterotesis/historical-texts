            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

saved our army, but without aid of man o'rethrew the pagan Host,

fronts the foe; at sight of whom the <hi>Saxons</hi> stood amaz'd: for to

if it be Love or Lust that thus incites her, the sin is horrid and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestuous;
if to betray my life, what hopes she by it? Yes, it may
be a practice 'twixt themselves, to expel the <hi>Brittains</hi> and ensure
the State through our destructions, all this may be valid with a
deeper reach in villany, then all my thoughts can guess at, however</p>
               <l>I will confer with her, and if I finde</l>
               <l>Lust hath given Life to Envy in her minde,</l>

               <l>And what of this sir?</l>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Clown.</speaker>
               <p>Why thus the matter
<pb facs="tcp:99843:14"/>
stands sir: There's one of your Courtiers Hunting Nags has made
a Gap through another mans Inclosure. Now sir, here's the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
who should be at charge of a Fur-bush to stop it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Nic.</speaker>
               <p>Ha, ha, this is out of my element: the Law must end it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Clown.</speaker>
               <p>Your Worship says well; for surely I think some Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer
had a hand in the business, we have such a troublesom Issue.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Nic.</speaker>
               <p>But what's thy business with me now?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Clown.</speaker>
               <p>Nay
sir, the business is done already, you may see by my sisters belly.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Nic.</speaker>
               <p>Oh, now I finde thee, this Gentlewoman it seems has
been humbled.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Clown.</speaker>
               <p>As low as the ground would give her
leave sir, and your Worship knows this: though there be many fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
without children, yet to have a childe without a father, were
most unnatural.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Nic.</speaker>
               <p>That's true ifaith, I never heard of
a childe yet that e're begot his father.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Clown.</speaker>
               <p>Why true, you
say wisely sir.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Nic.</speaker>
               <p>And therefore I conclude, that he that
got the childe, is without all question the father of it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Clown.</speaker>
               <p>I, now you come to the mat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

your Worship for the discovery of this father.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Nic.</speaker>
               <p>Why,
lives he in the Court here?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ioan.</speaker>
               <p>Yes sir, and I desire but
Marriage.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Nic.</speaker>
               <p>And does the knave refuse it? Come,
come, be merry wench, he shall marry thee, and keep the childe
too, if my Knighthood can do any thing; I am bound by mine Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
to help distressed Ladies, and can there be a greater injury to
a woman with childe, then to lack a father for't? I am asham'd of
your simpleness: Come, come, give me a Courtiers Fee for my
pains, and Ile be thy Advocate my self, and justice shall be found,
nay Ile sue the Law for it; but give me my Fee first.</p>

               <p>Nay
there's two, for your better eye sight sir.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Nic.</speaker>
               <p>Why well
said: give me thy hand wench, Ile teach thee a trick for all this,
shall get a father for thy childe presently, and this it is, mark now:
You meet a man, as you meet me now, thou claimest Marriage of
me, and layest the childe to my charge, I deny it: push, that's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
hold thy Claim fast, thy words carries it, and no Law can

               <speaker>Sir Nic.</speaker>
               <p>Past all opposition, her own word carries it, let her

all the Artists summon'd now, that seeks the secrets of futurity, the

and spake my thoughts before me; therefore away, shuffle thy self
amongst the Conjurers, and be a made man before thou comest to

decrees, fate hath no power to alter: The Saxons, sir, will keep the

present you Prophecies which shall concern</p>

               <p>This King, my Lord, presents your Royal Son, who in his
prime of years shall be so fortunate, that thirteen several Princes,
shall present their several Crowns unto him, and all Kings else
shall so admire his fame and victories, that they shall all be glad ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
through fear or love, to do him homage; But death (who
neither favors the weak nor valliant) in the middest of all his
glories, soon shall seize him, scarcely permitting him to appoint one
in all his purchased Kingdoms to succeed him.</p>
