            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The Ancient Teſtimony and Principle Of the People called QUAKERS <hi>Renewed with Reſpect to the King and Government, and touching the Preſent Aſſociation.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>WE the ſaid People do ſolemnly and ſincerely declare, That it hath been our Judgment and Principle from the firſt Day we were called to profeſs the Light of Chriſt Jeſus manifeſted in our Conſciences, unto this Day, That the ſetting Up, and putting Down Kings and Governments, is Gods peculiar Prerogative, for Cauſes beſt known to himſelf; and that it is not our Work or Buſineſs to have any Hand or Contrivance therein, nor to be Buſibodies in matters above our Station; much leſs to Plot and Contrive the Ruine or Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of any of them: But to pray for the King, and for the Safety of our Nation, and good of all Men, that we may live a Peaceable and Quiet Life, in all Godlineſs and Honeſty under the Government which God is pleaſed to ſet over us.</p>
            <p>And according to this our Antient and Innocent Principle, we often have given forth our Teſtimony, and now do, againſt all Plotting, Conſpiracies and contriving Inſurrections againſt the King or the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and againſt all Treacherous, Barbarous, and Murtherous Deſigns whatſoever, as Works of the Devil and Darkneſs: And we ſincerely Bleſs God, and are heartily Thankful to the King and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, for the Liberty and Priviledges we Enjoy under them by Law; Eſteeming it our Duty to be True and Faithful to Them.</p>
            <p>And whereas we the ſaid People are required to ſign the ſaid Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation, we ſincerely declare, That our Refuſing ſo to do, is not out of any Diſaffection to the King or Government, nor in Oppoſition to his being Declared Rightful and Lawful King of theſe Realms, but purely becauſe we cannot for Conſcience-ſake Fight, Kill, or Revenge, either for our ſelves, or any Man elſe.</p>
            <p>And we believe that the Timely Diſcovery and Prevention of the late Barbarous Deſign, and Miſchievous Plot againſt the King and Government, and the ſad Effects it might have had, is an Eminent Mercy from Almighty God; for which We, and the whole Nation, have great cauſe to be humbly Thankful to Him, and to Pray for the Continuance of his Mercies to Them and Us.</p>
