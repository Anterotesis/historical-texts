         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is availeable for the better entertainment of this
worke to know ſomething concerning the <hi>Author,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the <hi>worke</hi> it ſelfe, and concerning the <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi>
for the <hi>Author,</hi> my acquaintance with him
was eſpecially towards the declining part of his yeeres;
at what time (as they ſpeake of the Sunne towards ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting)
the light and influence which comes from wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
men is most mild and comfortable. The gifts of
men then (perhaps) are not ſo flouriſhing as in their younger time; but yet more
mature, and what commeth from them is better digested. In the prime of his
yeares hee was trained up in <hi>S. Iohns Colledge</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> being there fellow
of the Houſe; and for Piety and Parts esteemed highly in the <hi>Univerſity,</hi> of
thoſe that excelled in both. Afterwards he grew to that note, that he was choſen
to reade the lecture in <hi>Pauls,</hi> ſucceeding therein that great l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ned man, <hi>Doctor
Andrewes,</hi> late <hi>Lord Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> which he diſcharged, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the ſatisfaction, but to the applauſe of the most judicious and learned hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
witneſſed by their frequency and attention. Not long after he was removed
to a pastorall charge in <hi>Clavering</hi> in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> where being fixed till his death, hee
ſhined as a ſtarre in his proper ſpheare.</p>
            <p>This good mans aime was, to convey himſelfe by all manner of wayes into the
heart, which made him willingly heard of all ſorts; for witty things onely, as they
are ſpoken to the braine, ſo they rest in the braine, and ſinke no deeper: but the
heart (which vaine and obnoxious men love not to bee touched) that's the marke
a faithfull teacher aimes to hit. But becauſe the way to come to the heart, is often
to paſſe through the fancy, therefore this godly man ſtudied by lively repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
to helpe mens faith by the fancy. It was our <hi>Saviour Chriſts</hi> manner of
teaching, to expreſſe heavenly things in an earthly manner. And it was the
ſtudy of the wiſe man <hi>Salomon</hi> (becomming a Preacher) to finde out <hi>Pleaſant
words,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 12. 10.</note> or <hi>words of delight:</hi> but when all paines is taken by the man of God,
people will reliſh what is ſpoken, according as their taste is. It falleth out here as
it doth in a garden, wherein ſome walke for preſent delight, ſome carry flowers
away with them to refreſh them for a time, ſome as Bees gather honey which they
feede on long afterwards; ſome ſpider-like come to ſucke that which may feede
that malignant and venemous diſpoſition that they bring with them. <hi>There
cannot be a better Character of a man, than to obſerve what hee reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth
moſt in hearing:</hi> for as men are, ſo they taste, ſo they judge, ſo they ſpeake:
<hi>Ezekiel</hi> (beſides Propheticall gifts fit for ſo high a calling) had no doubt a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull
<pb facs="tcp:17958:4"/>
manner of expreſſion of himſelfe, whereupon the wickeder ſort of Iewes
(engaged in ſinfull courſes) came to heare him,<note place="margin">Eze. 33. 32.</note> but as a Muſitian to pleaſe their
eares, neglecting the authoritie of his Perſon, and the weight of his meſſage, its
no wonder therefore if in theſe dayes people ſticke in the barke and neglect the pith,
though ſometimes it falleth out with ſome as with <hi>Auguſtine</hi> hearing <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe,</hi>
whilst they bite at the baite of ſome pleaſing notions, they are at the ſame
time catched with the Spirits hooke.</p>
            <p>Hee was skilfull in the originall languages, and thereupon an excellent Text<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
well read in writers that were of note, in the ſeverall ages of the Church,
which made him a well-furniſhed and able Divine, his judgement was cleere, and
his conſcience tender; and which helpt him most, he brought to the great worke of
the ministerie an holy and gratious heart, which raiſed and carried him to aimes
above himſelfe and the world. In his converſing he was modest, fruitfull, wiſe, and
winning: in his expreſſions witty, and gracefull, in ſo much that hee hath left a
freſh and a ſweet remembrance of him, untill this day. Towards his end her grow
more ſpirituall, ſetting light by all things here below, and onely waited (as his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
was) for the comming of the <hi>Comforter:</hi> at length (his worke being
finiſhed) breathing out his life,<note place="margin">Revel. 22. 20.</note> with that wiſh of the ſpouſe, <hi>Yea, come Lord
Ieſus.</hi> Thus much I thought not unfit to be made knowne of the Man.</p>
            <p>Now for the <hi>Worke</hi> it ſelfe it must be conſidered by the learned Reader, that
theſe things were ſpoken though to a People high-raiſd in knowledge, and more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
than ordinary by his teaching; yet to the People; not with a purpoſe that
they ſhould come to the view and cenſure of the learned. But though they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet are they not ſo popular, but (if my love to the man and
the Worke deceive me not) they will have the best Reader, either more learned,
or more holy or both. It must therefore bee remembred, for the more favourable
acceptation of this Worke, that theſe Sermons were taken by one of his Pariſh, a
man though pious and of good parts, yet not skilfull in the learned languages, and
therefore it must needs bee, that many apt and acute ſentences of the Fathers (by
which this learned man did uſe to beautifie and ſtrengthen the Points hee delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red)
are fallen to the ground and lost, for lacke of skill to take up. But howſoever
much of the ſpirits bee lost, yet heere you have the corpes and bulke of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
and not without ſome life and vigour, wherein this is peculiar in his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of handling, that hee hath choſen fit texts of Scripture, to ground his expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of every article upon.</p>
            <p>Now for the <hi>Argument</hi> it ſelfe the <hi>Creed,</hi> I thinke it fit to premiſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
becauſe it hath beene omitted by the <hi>Author,</hi> or at least not gathered with
the rest. The <hi>Creed</hi> is of middle authority, betweene divine and humane, and
called the Apostles <hi>Creed,</hi> not onely for conſanguintty with the Apostles
Doctrine, but becauſe it is taken out of the Apostles writings, and therefore of
greatest authority next the Scriptures. It is nothing elſe but <hi>A ſummary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
of the counſell and worke of God concerning our ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
condition heere and hereafter.</hi> The Doctrine of Salvation is ſpread
through the Scriptures, as ſpirits in the Arteries and blood in the veines, as the
ſoule in the body. And heere (for eaſier carriage) the moſt neceſſary Points are
gathered together, as ſo many pearles or pretious ſtones, that we might have a
ready uſe of them upon all occaſions: being as it were a little Bible or Testament,
<pb facs="tcp:17958:4"/>
that Christians of all rankes (as ſuited for all conditions) may beare about with
them every where without any trouble. In every <hi>Article</hi> there is both a ſhallow
and a depth, milke for babes and meat for ſtrong men. Though there be no growth
in regard of fundamentall Principles (which have beene alike in all ages of the
Church) yet there hath and will be a proficiencie, in regard of concluſions drawne
out of thoſe Principles. The neceſſities of every Chriſtian, and the ſpringing up of
unſound opinions in the Church will continually inforce diligence and care in the
further explication and application of theſe fundamentall truths.</p>
            <p>It will not therefore bee amiſſe to ſet downe a few <hi>Directions</hi> for the more
cleere <hi>underſtanding</hi> of the <hi>Creed,</hi> and for the better making <hi>uſe</hi> of it. And
firſt, for the <hi>underſtanding</hi> of it. It hath the Name of <hi>Creed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1</note> or <hi>Beleefe,</hi> from
the act exerciſed about it, to ſhew that it doth not onely containe Doctrine to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved,
but that that doctrine will doe us no good, unleſſe by mingling it with our
Faith we make it our <hi>Beleefe,</hi> therefore both the <hi>Act</hi> and the <hi>Object</hi> are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
in one word <hi>Beleefe.</hi> Secondly, from the <hi>Execution</hi> in creation and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation
wee muſt ariſe to <hi>Gods decree,</hi> nothing done in time, which was
not decreed before all times,<note place="margin">Act. 15. 18.</note> 
               <hi>knowne unto the Lord are all his workes,
from the beginning of the world.</hi>
               <note place="margin">3</note> Thirdly, wee muſt ariſe from one
Principall Benefit to all that follow and accompany it, as in <hi>forgiveneſſe of
ſins,</hi> follow <hi>righteouſneſſe, Peace, and Ioy;</hi> the <hi>Spirit of Sanctification,
Chriſtian liberty, &amp;c.</hi> though the Articles be nakedly propounded, yet are we
to beleeve all the fruits and priviledges. <hi>So to Gods creating of heaven and
earth,</hi> we must joyne his <hi>Providence</hi> in upholding and ruling all things in both.
Fourthly, in the <hi>Conſequent</hi> wee are to understand all th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> went before by way
of <hi>Cauſe</hi> or <hi>Preparation,</hi>
               <note place="margin">4</note> as in the <hi>Crucifying of Chriſt;</hi> his preceding
<hi>Agony,</hi> and the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of it, <hi>Our ſinnes,</hi> and the love of God and Christ in
thoſe ſufferings,<note place="margin">5</note> &amp;c. Fiftly, though we are to beleeve <hi>Circumſtances</hi> as well as
<hi>the thing it ſelfe</hi> yet not with the ſame neceſſity of Faith: as it is more neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to beleeve that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was crucified, than that it was under <hi>Pontius Pilate:</hi>
though when any Circumstance is revealed, we ought to beleeve it, and to have
a preparation of minde to beleeve whatſoever ſhall be revealed: yet in the <hi>maine
points</hi> this <hi>preparation of minde</hi> is not ſufficient, but there muſt bee a <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</hi>
and an <hi>expreſſed faith.</hi> We muſt know that as in the Law he that breaketh
one Commandement breaketh all,<note place="margin">6</note> becauſe all come from the ſame authority, ſo in
the grounds of faith he that denies one in the true ſenſe of it,<note place="margin">Fides non eligit objectum.</note> denies all, for both
Law and Faith are copulatives, the ſingling out of any thing it contrary to the
obedience of faith.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Particular and dayly uſe,</hi> wee muſt know<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Firſt, that every <hi>Article</hi>
requires a <hi>particular faith,</hi> not onely in regard of the Perſon beleeving, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
in regard of the <hi>application</hi> of the Article beleeved: or elſe the Dev <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
might ſay the <hi>Creed,</hi> for he beleeves there is a <hi>Creator,</hi> and that there is a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of ſinnes, &amp;c.</hi> but becauſe hee hath no ſhare in it, it inrageth him the
more. Our adverſaries are great enemies to particular faith, and thinke we coine
a thirteenth Article, when wee inforce particular aſſurance, becauſe (ſay they) par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
men are not named in the Scripture, and what is not in Scripture cannot
be a matter of faith. But there is a <hi>Double Faith, a Faith which is the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
wee doe beleeve,</hi> and <hi>Faith which is the grace whereby wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:17958:5"/>
and this Faith is matter of <hi>Experience</hi> wrought in our hearts by the
Spirit of God. It is ſufficient that that faith which wee doe beleeve is contained
in the Scriptures. Now whereas they object that we make it a thirteenth Article,
their fourteenth Apoſtle adds to theſe twelve many more articles of faith,<note place="margin">Bulla Pii quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti.</note> which
he inforceth to be beleeved, with the ſame neceſſity of faith as theſe twelve; neither
hath he onely entred upon Christs prerogative in minting new articles of faith,
but likewiſe they have uſurped over all Christian Churches by adding <hi>Romane</hi>
to the Catholike Church in the Creed. A bold imposture.</p>
            <p>But for ſpeciall faith, the maine office of the Holy Spirit is, <hi>In opening gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Truths, to reveale our particular intereſt in thoſe Truths, and to
breed ſpecial Faith whereby we make them our owne,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 11, 12.</note> becauſe the Spirit of
God reveales the minde of God to every particular Christian; for as the things
beleeved are truths above nature, ſo the Grace of faith whereby we beleeve, is a
grace above Nature, and created as a ſupernaturall eye in the Soule, to ſee ſupernaturall
truths.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
               <hi>Where ſacred truths are truely apprehended, there the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
workes an impreſſion in the ſoule ſutable to the things beleeved:</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Article hath a power in it which the Spirit doth imprint upon the Soule.
The Beleefe of God to be the <hi>Father Almighty,</hi> breeds an impreſſion of depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
reverence, and comfort. The Beleefe and knowledge of <hi>Chriſt crucified,</hi>
is a crucifying knowledge. The true knowledge and faith in <hi>Chriſt riſing,</hi> is a
raiſing knowledge; the knowledge of the <hi>Abaſement of Chriſt,</hi> is an abaſing
knowledge, becauſe faith ſees it ſelfe one with Chriſt in both states. We cannot truly
beleeve what Chriſt hath wrought for us, but at the ſame time the Spirit of Chriſt
worketh ſomething in us.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> it is convenient for the giving of due honour to every perſon to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
of <hi>the worke appropriated to every one:</hi> all <hi>come from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi>
all are <hi>exactly performed by the Son</hi> in our nature for the Redemption
of thoſe that the Father hath given Him. The <hi>Gathering</hi> out of the world of
that bleſſed ſociety (which we call the <hi>Church</hi>) into an holy Communion and the
<hi>Sanctifying</hi> of it, and <hi>Sealing</hi> unto it all the priviledges believed; as <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe
of sinnes, Reſurrection of the body, and Life everlaſting, &amp;c.</hi>
proceed from the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4</note> it hath pleaſed the great God to enter into a <hi>Treaty and covenant
of agreement</hi> with us his poore creatures, the articles of which agreement are
here comprized. God for his part undertakes to convey all that concernes our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe,
upon our receiving of them, by beleeving on him. Every one in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
that recites theſe articles (from a ſpirit of faith) makes good this condition,
and this is <hi>that anſwer of a good conſcience,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.</note> which <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeakes of, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
being demanded what our faith is; every one in particular anſweres to every
Article, <hi>I beleeve;</hi> I not onely underſtand and conceive it, but aſſent unto it in
my judgement as true, and conſent to it in my will as good, and build my comfort
upon it as good too me: this act of Beleefe carries the whole ſoule with it.</p>
            <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5</note> though it is wee that anſwer, yet the power by which wee anſwer,
is no leſſe than that, whereby God created the world, and raiſed Chriſt from the
dead. The anſwer is ours, but the power and ſtrength is Gods whereby wee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere,
who performes both his part and ours too in the covenant. It is a higher
<pb facs="tcp:17958:5"/>
matter to beleeve, than the common ſort thinke it. For this anſwer of <hi>Faith</hi> to
theſe truths as it is cauſed by the power of Gods Spirit, ſo is it powerfull to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
all temptations of Satan, all ſeducements of the world, all terrours of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
from the wrath of God and the curſe of the Law, it ſetteth the ſoule as upon a
rocke above all.</p>
            <p>Sixthly,<note place="margin">6</note> theſe Articles are <hi>a touchſtone at hand to try all opinions by,</hi>
(for crooked things are diſcernded by bringing them to the rule) what directly or by
immediate and neere conſequence oppoſeth theſe, is to bee rejected as contrary to
the platforme of wholeſome doctrine. That one monſter of opinions, <hi>of the bread
turned into the body of Chriſt by tranſubſtantiation,</hi> overthrowes at once
foure Articles of the Creed; The <hi>incarnation of Chriſt, Aſcenſion, Sitting at
the Right hand of God, and comming to judgment:</hi> for if Chriſts body
be ſo often made of a peece of bread, being in ſo many places at once here upon
earth, how can all theſe Articles be true?</p>
            <p>Againe,<note place="margin">7</note> ſeventhly, theſe grounds of <hi>Faith</hi> have likewiſe <hi>a ſpeciall influence
in direction and incouragement unto all Chriſtian duties:</hi> A holy life is
but the infuſion of holy truths: <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith well, <hi>non bene vivitur, ubi be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
de Deo non creditur:</hi> men of an ill beleefe, cannot be of a good life, wherupon
the Apoſtles method is, to build their exhortations to Chriſtian duties upon the
grounds of Chriſtian Faith. But we muſt remember, that as faith yeelds a good
life and conſcience: ſo a conſcience is the veſſell to preſerve the Doctrine of
Faith, elſe a ſhipwracke of faith will follow. If there bee a delighting in unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe,
there will not be a love of the truth, and if we love not the truth, then
there will be a preparedneſſe to beleeve any lye; and that by Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> juſt judgement,
2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 12.</p>
            <p>Eighthly,<note place="margin">8</note> as theſe fundamentall truths yeeld ſtrength to the whole frame of
a Chriſtian life: So <hi>they are ſo many ſprings and wels of conſolation for
Gods people to draw-from:</hi> whereupon that good Prince <hi>George Anhalt,</hi>
(whom <hi>Luthers</hi> time became a Preacher of the Goſpell) intending to comfort
his brother Prince <hi>Iohn,</hi> raiſeth his comfort from the last three Articles,
<hi>Remiſſion of ſinnes, Reſurrection of the body, and Life Everlaſting:</hi>
which as they have their ſtrength from the former Articles are able to raiſe any
drooping ſpirit, and therefore in the greateſt agonies, it is the readiest way to
ſuck comfort from theſe benefits: But I omit other things, intending onely to ſay
ſomething by way of <hi>Preface.</hi> And thus <hi>Good Reader,</hi> I commend this worke
unto thee, and both it and thee to Gods bleſſing.</p>

two conditions only, the Lord hath promiſed <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Salvation, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi>
and <hi>Faith;</hi> which two conditions are the loweſt rate he hath ſet
life at. Having therefore ſpent much time in the Doctrine of <hi>Repentance,</hi>
our courſe now is to ſpeake of the <hi>Doctrine of Faith;</hi> for howſoever it be
that <hi>Repentance</hi> is a neceſſary Grace, without which we cannot be ſaved;
yet notwithſtanding all the <hi>Repentance</hi> in the world cannot ſave us, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
wee ſhould weepe our eyes out, unleſſe wee have <hi>Faith.</hi> ſome
thinke that if they repent and mourne for their ſinnes onely, they ſhall
be ſaved; but the truth is, we cannot be ſaved without <hi>Faith.</hi> For,</p>
               <p>Firſt, though <hi>Repentance</hi> may drive a man to ſeeke to be ſaved, as the
aking and pricking of a ſore, may drive a man to the Phyſitian or Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:17958:7"/>
ſo ſorrow and griefe may drive us to ſeeke to Chriſt, there to ſhew
our wounds: but if we ſtay there, and apply not the remedies, we have
no helpe; for it is not <hi>Repentance</hi> that doth ſave us, but <hi>the blood of Chriſt:</hi>
As it is 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 7. where he ſheweth that <hi>The blood of Chriſt cleanſeth us
from all our ſinnes,</hi> and <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>loſſ.</hi> 1. 14. <hi>In Him we have Redemption through his
blood,</hi> that is, <hi>the forgiveneſſe of ſins.</hi> Therefore when the Lord, <hi>Zechar.</hi> 12.
10. promiſeth, <hi>to powre upon the houſe of David, and upon the inhabitants of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,
the Spirit of grace and compaſsion;</hi> that they ſhould mourn for their
ſins. In the next <hi>Chapter</hi> he promiſeth, that <hi>He would open unto them a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
for ſin and uncleanneſſe;</hi> to wit, the blood of Chriſt: and therefore,
beſides a fountaine of our teares for ſinne, there muſt bee a fountaine of
the blood of Chriſt, to waſh and cleanſe us from our ſinnes: not <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi>
onely, but there withall <hi>Faith</hi> alſo.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe it is ſaid, <hi>without Faith we cannot pleaſe God, Heb.</hi> 11. 6.
therefore <hi>Repentance</hi> without <hi>Faith,</hi> ſufficeth not: for <hi>Faith</hi> in Chriſt is
that which makes a man acceptable before God; for which cauſe in the
matters of <hi>Faith,</hi> nothing contents a Chriſtian but Chriſt only; in which
caſe the Apoſtle flings away all, accounting all but <hi>dirt and dung in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of Chriſt, Phil.</hi> 3. 8. Therefore, though a man be ſorry for his ſins, yet
he hath need of <hi>Faith</hi> alſo to beleeve the promiſes and pardon of them.
As when a <hi>Rebell</hi> flies into another land, where he is taken and ſent home
in a ſhip,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> in which caſe the ſhip which brings him home can doe no
more; but there muſt bee ſome meanes beſides, to bring him in favour
with the king to have a pardon: So when we rebell againſt God by ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
we runne away from him, <hi>Repentance</hi> is the ſhip to bring us home
againe, which can doe no more, therefore there muſt be another means
to reconcile us, which is <hi>Faith</hi> in the Sonne of God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, our <hi>Repentance</hi> is unperfect, and therefore muſt be grounded
on ſome perfect thing (<hi>as the Schoolemen ſay) Every unperfect thing muſt be
grounded on ſomething that is perfect:</hi> So our <hi>Repentance</hi> being unperfect,
muſt be grounded on Chriſt apprehended by <hi>Faith,</hi> one of them will
not ſerve.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> As a bird which hath two wings to flie with, take away one
of them, well may the bird flutter and beat upon the ground, but ſhee
cannot flie: So <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance</hi> are the two wings of a Chriſtian,
whereof take away one, and they fall to the ground. Now in the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Faith</hi> divers things are to be obſerved.</p>

                  <item>6. The extention and right object of Faith.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The firſt is, <hi>the uſe of Faith in the life of a Christian;</hi> for who will take
care for a thing, till hee knowes the uſe of it. If a man tell us that ſuch
a herbe, or ſuch a ſtone is good, the next queſtion is, but to what
uſe ſerves it, what is it good for? So when wee heare of <hi>Faith,</hi>
this queſtion may ariſe, to what Vſe ſerves my Faith? For when
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:17958:7"/>
men know the uſe of it, this makes them ſeeke for it. Now there bee
foure uſes of Faith in the life of a Chriſtian, too many know one uſe to
make of their faith, and that is to ſweare by it, but God hath not given us
our faith to ſweare by it, but to other uſes.</p>

then our faith may uphold us.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The firſt uſe of faith is,<note place="margin">1</note> that <hi>it doth juſtifie us in the ſight of God;</hi> for if we
be detected by ſinne,<note place="margin">Vſe of Faith.</note> and found infinitly guilty, we have a diſcharge by
faith, for if the divell accuſe us, or our conſcience condemne us, then
faith, that acquitteth us, and juſtifieth us in Gods ſight as <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 28.
There may bee many graces, but none of them can juſtifie us, but faith
only; for Love is a work of the Law, and so is Patience, and many other
graces, but faith it is that juſtifieth us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 28. <hi>Therefore,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>wee
conclude that a man is not juſtified by the workes of the Law, but by faith onely.
Rom.</hi> 5. 1. <hi>Therefore being juſtified by faith, wee haue peace with God through
our Lord Ieſus Chriſt:</hi> and <hi>Galatians</hi> 1. 15. ſaith hee, <hi>We which are Iewes
by nature and not ſinners of the Gentiles, knowing that a man is not juſtified by
the workes of the Law, but by the faith of Ieſus Chriſt:</hi> and that for two rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">The first Reaſon why Faith alone Justifieth.</note> becauſe it lets all goe, in the matters of ſalvation, and brings
Chriſt as the full price of our redemption to the Father; for when the
divell doth accuſe us, and we are found guilty and condemned, then
faith runnes to the Croſſe of Chriſt, into the grave, and through the
dens of death, and brings Chriſt with his head crowned, his backe
whipped, his ſides wounded, his hands and feete peirced: and then a
Chriſtian is bold to ſtand up, and ſay, O Lord, I have ſinned againſt thee,
but behold, here is my Redeemer and Saviour, he hath anſwered thee
whatſoever thou couldſt require, let his paines be my eaſe, his ſhame my
glory, and his death my life, &amp;c. A man arreſted for a great debt, he
being in the Bailiffes hands readie to be carried and throwne into the
Gaole, perhaps hath a little Boy ſtanding by, who ſtraight way runnes
to his friends, and tels them that his father is in the Bailiffes hands,
and ready to be throwne into the Gaole, and so brings his friends,
who come with a great bagge of money; powre it downe, and so
diſcharge the debt, that the man goeth free: even ſo, when wee bee
arreſted with the judgements of God like Bailiffes, and likely to bee
throwne into Hell, <hi>faith</hi> is like the little Boy which runnes to our friend
Ieſus Chriſt, who then comes, and paies our debt, pacifies the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
and we goe free.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">The ſecond Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why Faith alone justifieth. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 17. <hi>Ephe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>.</hi> 3. 17.</note> becauſe it maketh us one with Chriſt as we see in the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lathians,</hi>
and in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians;</hi> wee are fleſh of his fleſh, and
bone of his bone, and therefore being one with him, all the holy ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
that be in him are made ours, the obedience of Chriſt, his patience,
his love, his meekeneſſe, his goodneſſe, his holineſſe, and whatſoever
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:17958:8"/>
is in him wee partake of it. As we ſee in experience, if a man be marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to a woman, whatſoever he hath hee communicates to his wife, for
if he be rich, ſhe cannot be poore, if he be noble, ſhe cannot be baſe; for
looke what the man hath hee communicates to his wife: even so being
made one with Chriſt by faith, looke what good things Chriſt hath,
that hee communicates to us; his Righteouſneſſe, his Holineſſe, &amp;c.
Looke what he hath, we cannot want. If a man ſhould commit treaſon,
againſt the king, be condemned for it, adjudged and ſentence given that
he ſhold have his hand cut off, or his eyes pulled out: if he had this cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
that he could make his hand or his eye to bee the eye of the kings
ſonne, he ſhould not have his hand cut off, nor loſe his eye, becauſe it
then were the eye or hand of the kings ſonne: even ſo this is the skill
and cunning of faith, it makes us members and parts of Chriſt the
ſonne of God, and therefore if wee be but the leaſt bone in the body of
Chriſt, God will not caſt us away, we ſhall not periſh for his ſonnes ſake.
So that faith doth not ſave us, by reaſon it is a more holy quality than
other graces, or for the worthines of it above others, but becauſe it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
us one with Chriſt: as if a man had a ſtone in a ring that could heale
many diſeaſes, we ſay it is the ring, but indeed it is not the ring but the
ſtone in the ring that cures them; and even ſo it is ſaid, faith ſaveth us,
but not by the owne vertue, but becauſe it layeth hold on Chriſt, and
makes us one with him.</p>
               <p>The ſecond uſe of faith is,<note place="margin">The ſecond uſe of Faith.</note> 
                  <hi>to ſanctifie us in this world;</hi> for it doth not
onely juſtifie us, and take away the guilt of ſinne, but alſo ſanctifies us
in this world, and taketh away the corruption of ſinne. So we ſee it is
ſaid <hi>Act.</hi> 15. <hi>Their hearts were purified by faith:</hi> and <hi>Galatians,</hi> 5. 6. that
<hi>Faith worketh by Love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There be two workes of faith: Firſt,<note place="margin">Two workes of Faith.</note> it worketh in heaven, for when
we have ſinned and grieved God, and are ſmitten in conſcience for it,
accuſed and condemned,<note place="margin">1</note> then faith worketh in Heaven by tendring and
offering up Ieſus Chriſt to God for our Redemption, and ſatiſfaction
of his juſtice:<note place="margin">2</note> Secondly, faith worketh in earth by ſtirring up ſanctified
and holy motions. Now two waies it may ſtirre up good motions:
Firſt, by the meditation of the death of Chriſt. Secondly, by combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or conjunction with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Firſt, by meditation; for faith doth carry us to the croſſe of Chriſt,
there to behold the great paines that Hee hath ſuffered for us, how his
body was racked and tormented for us: and to this end Faith makes us
conſider theſe three things:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The cauſe of his death.</item>
                  <item>2. The end of his death.</item>
                  <item>3. The manner of his death.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> to conſider the cauſe of his death, that it was nothing in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
but it was our ſinnes,<note place="margin">Conſideration.</note> and tranſgreſſions, that cauſed his body to
be whipped, his face to be buffeted, his hands to be peirced, his feete to
be nailed, his Head to be crowned, his ſides to be launced with a speate:
So that our ſinnes are the cauſe of the death of Chriſt, and of all the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:17958:8"/>
grievous things that he ſuffered, as it is in three and fiftieth chapter of
<hi>Eſay,</hi> and the fifth verſe: <hi>But he was wounded for our tranſgreſsions, he was
broken for our iniquities, the chastiſement of our peace was upon him, and with
his ſtripes wee are healed.</hi> And 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 2. 24. <hi>Who his owne ſelfe bare our
ſinnes in his body on the tree, that wee being delivered from ſinne ſhould live in
righteouſneſſe, by whoſe ſtripes we are healed:</hi> and therefore ſeeing our ſinnes
cauſed this cruell death, and grievous paine to be upon Chriſt, to doe
the like to our ſinnes, to goe to the croſſe of Chriſt, to take them
downe, to crucifie them, to hang them up, to take the ſpeare out of
Chriſts ſide,<note place="margin">How to deale with ſinne.</note> to thruſt it into the ſide of ſinne, as in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> we
may ſee a voyce came to the Church concerning bloody <hi>Babylon, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
her as ſhee hath rewarded you:</hi> ſo doth this voyce come to a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
concerning ſinne, <hi>reward it, as that hath rewarded Chriſt,</hi> that would
not let Chriſt to be at reſt, till it had killed him: even so we ſhould not
let ſinne be at reſt till wee have killed, it ſaith <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> If one ſhould
kill thy father or thy mother, wouldeſt thou entertaine him into thine
houſe, wouldeſt thou let him feede at thy table, nay thou wouldeſt hate
him, and ſpit at him; nay, (ſaith he) ſinne hath not killed thy father
and mother, but it hath killed Chriſt thy Saviour and Redeemer:
what, ſaith hee, wilt thou then entertaine ſinne? wilt thou let it ſleepe
in thy boſome, wilt thou feede it? Nay, (ſaith he) hate it, defie it, and
ſpit at it, as at a Toade.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing we are to conſider,<note place="margin">2</note> is the end of Chriſts death:
now all the paines that Chriſt ſuffered,<note place="margin">Conſideration.</note> it was to aboliſh ſinne, ſo wee
ſee <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 26. <hi>But now in the end of the world hath hee appeared once to
put away ſinne by the ſacrifice of himſelfe.</hi> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 8. <hi>For this purpoſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
the Sonne of God, that hee might looſe the worke of the divell:</hi> And
therefore ſeeing the death of Chriſt was to aboliſh ſinne, if wee
live in it, we make all the paines of Chriſts ſufferings and his death of
none effect; wherein judge you what an injury and wrong is offered
to Chriſt: the Prophet complaineth <hi>Eſai.</hi> 49. 4. That <hi>He laboured and
ſpent his ſtrength in vaine, and for nothing;</hi> ſuch a complaint may Chriſt
take up againſt us, on the croſſe. For this cauſe was I ſent of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
into the world to aboliſh ſinne; and for this cauſe was I incloſed
ninth moneths in the darke wombe of the Virgin; and for this cauſe
was I borne in a ſtable, and layd in a manger; for this cauſe was I thirty
three yeeres labouring among you; for this cauſe did I dye a curſed
death on the corſſe: all this was to aboliſh ſinne, and therefore if men
live in ſinne ſtill, it may ſeeme to them Chriſt hath ſpent all his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
and ſtrength in vaine, nay, he may ſay he hath ſpent his blood, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
all his blood, even five ſtreames of blood that came from him, and
all this in vaine to them. It is ſaid, <hi>Eſai.</hi> 53. 11. of Chriſt, <hi>hee ſhall ſee of
the travell of his ſoule, and ſhall bee ſatisfied;</hi> and therefore, if men bee
brought to God, if they live a holy life, if they bee conſcionable in
their wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>s, and carefull to pleaſe God in their courſes; then this will
ſatisfie Chriſt; But if wee live in our ſinnes, in our prophaneneſſe, in
our luſts ſtill, then it ſhall grieve Him that ever he was borne into the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:17958:9"/>
world, ſweate in the garden, died, and ſhed his blood on the Croſſe
for us.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">The third Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</note> wee are to conſider of the manner of his death, that it
was in the greateſt extremity that might be, ſo <hi>Paul,</hi> ſaith <hi>Philip,</hi> 2. 8.
<hi>Hee humbled himſelfe, and became obedient to that curſed death on the croſſe,</hi>
and ſo in <hi>Eſai.</hi> 5 3. 12. it is ſaid, He <hi>hath powred out his ſoule unto death, &amp;c.</hi>
Now the greateſt extremity that Chriſt ſuffered may make us conſider
of two things: Firſt, the greatneſſe of our ſinnes. And ſecondly, the
greatneſſe of Gods mercie.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> wee may conſider the greatneſſe of our ſinnes, that when wee
have ſinned againſt God;<note place="margin">The greatneſſe of our ſinnes.</note> nothing will bring us into favour againe, but
it muſt coſt blood, and the blood of the Sonne of God, therefore how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
men make but a light matter of ſinne, yet when we have ſinned
all the powers of Heaven, and earth cannot bring us into favour againe,
all the Angels in heaven cannot doe it, nor all the blood of the Saints,
but it muſt bee the blood of the Sonne of God that muſt doe it, if the
king ſhould make a law, that if a man told a lye, or ſowre an oath, or
committed a ſinne, he ſhould loſe a droppe of his blood, how afraid
would he be of ſinning? Now when we ſinne, although it doth not coſt
us blood, yet it coſt the blood of the Sonne of God; and therefore wee
ſhould bee afraid to ſinne, leſt wee bee more waſtfull of the blood of
Chriſt, than of our owne.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> wee are to conſider of the greatneſſe of Gods mercie, that
when wee had ſinned,<note place="margin">The greatneſſe of Gods Mercy.</note> hee would ſend his owne Sonne to die for us,
as 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 10. <hi>Herein is Love, not that wee loved God, but that hee lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
us, and ſent his Sonne to bee a reconciliation for our ſinnes:</hi> and so in
<hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 8. But God ſetteth out his love towards us, ſeeing that whiles we
were yet ſinners Chriſt dyed for us, and therfore ſeeing God hath ſo lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
us, that he was content to part with his Sonne for us, let us never
ſticke to part with our ſinnes and luſts to ſerve him: but we see it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
that God doth not ſticke to part with his ſonne to die for us, and
yet we ſticke to part from our ſinnes to ſerve him.</p>
               <p>The ſecond way that faith doth ſtirre up holy motions,<note place="margin">The ſecond way. How Faith ſtirs up holy motions.</note> is, becauſe it
doth combine and knit us unto Chriſt, so it is by combination, by being
made one with Chriſt, for as from the head doth flow into the reſt of
the members life, even so Chriſt doth extend unto us his graces and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.
In the <hi>ſecond</hi> of the <hi>Kings</hi> wee ſee, that when the dead body of the
Prophet did touch the dead body of the man,<note place="margin">2 King. 13. 21.</note> life came into him; much
more if we went downe into the grave of Chriſt, and touched him, wee
ſhall live being joyned with the living body of Chriſt, who hath glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
and triumphantly overcome death, hell, and the divell. We see in
experience that if a man would have water flow into his field, he will
make a trench and dig into the ground, till he comes at the fountaine,
and then the fountaine will flow water into the field; even ſo if
men would have the graces of Chriſt to bee diſtilled into them, let
them never be at reſt, till they have joyned themſelves to Ieſus Chriſt,
and then hee will diſtill all his graces and vertues into them; ſo faith
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:17958:9"/>
never leaveth us, till it brings us unto Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Now the uſe of this point is, that ſeeing we are ſanctified in this world
by faith, as we find other uſes thereof, so we ſhould labour to find this
uſe and benefit of it: and therfore whereas men thinke that ſome are too
preciſe and too ſtrict, it is a ſure thing, that unleſſe we be ſanctified in
this world, we cannot be juſtified before God, and yet do not looke to
be ſanctified before men. And therefore ſearch thy ſelfe, oh man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
I pray thee, art thou brought to the hatred of ſinne? Or is it weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in thee? Doest thou labour to lead an holy life in the ſight of men
here? Then thou art juſtified in the ſight of God: but if thou liveſt in ſin,
and makeſt no conſcience in thy waies, but liveſt looſely, never then
looke to be juſtified in the ſight of God. It is a good obſervation, that a
learned man hath out of the eighth of the <hi>Romans</hi> of the golden chaine,
(ſaith he,) There be foure Linkes of it, two he hath in his owne hands,
and two he hath put out to us, to lay hold on: the two linkes that he
hath in his hands, are <hi>Predestination,</hi> and <hi>Glorification,</hi> the firſt and the last
linkes; and the two middle he hath left for us to lay hold on, <hi>Vocation,</hi>
and <hi>Iustification:</hi> and therefore doe thou oh man, caſt out thy hands, and
lay hold on theſe two linkes that thou mayſt be called and juſtified, that
ſo thou maieſt be glorified in the world to come. This is comfortable,
that God hath left theſe two linkes for every man, whereby hee may
be drawne up to Heaven. The third vſe of faith is that which <hi>Paul</hi>
ſpeaketh of here, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 17. <hi>The juſt man ſhall live by his faith;</hi> ſo a man
muſt not onely be juſtified by faith in the ſight of God, and ſanctified
in this world,<note place="margin">Gal. 2. 20.</note> but he muſt live by his faith, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Thus I live, yet
not I now, but Chriſt liveth in mee, and in that I now live in the fleſh, I live
by Faith in the Sonne of God, who hath loved mee and gave Himſelfe
for mee.</hi> A man may live the life of nature without faith, hee may
buy and ſell, and doe the workes of his calling, hee may eate and
drinke, &amp;c. But he cannot live the life of grace without faith, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
part of men care not to live in faith, but they deſire to die in faith.
They would die a comfortable death, like <hi>Balaam</hi> that would deſire to
die the death of the righteous, but care not to live ſo ſtrict a life, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if men doe not care to live in faith, they cannot die in faith, for this
is the true uſe of faith to live by it,<note place="margin">Habak. 2. 2.</note> ſo the prophet <hi>Habakuk</hi> ſaith, <hi>the juſt
ſhall live by his faith:</hi> a man that hath lived by it, hee ſhall die in faith
alſo, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 39. it is ſaid, <hi>all thoſe dyed in Faith,</hi> becauſe as they had lived
in faith, so they died in faith too, therefore if wee will die in faith, wee
muſt labour to live in faith, and then faith will not faile us, when wee
come to die. Now that wee may live in faith, two things are to bee
required:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. All that we doe, we must doe in Faith.<note place="margin">1</note>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>All that wee ſuffer,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2</note> 
                     <hi>wee must ſuffer in Faith,</hi> we muſt ſtill looke to
the promiſes, when we doe any thing, or ſuffer any thing.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Now that we muſt doe all that wee doe in Faith,<note place="margin">1</note> we have theſe two
Scriptures. The firſt is,<note place="margin">All things must be done in Faith.</note> 
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 23. <hi>For hee that eateth is condemned,
if hee eate, becauſe hee eateth not of Faith, and whatſoever is not of Faith
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:17958:10"/>
is ſinne;</hi> ſo then if we doe any thing and hath not a warrant for it, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
doe it of Faith, and if it be not of Faith, it is ſinne. So wee read <hi>Heb.</hi>
11. 6. <hi>But without Faith it is impoſsible to pleaſe God:</hi> ſo then, if we have
not Faith we cannot pleaſe God, and therefore all that we do wee muſt
do in Faith. It is the opinion of the world, that ſome of our actions we
ſhould doe in Faith but not all; but a man muſt do all his actions in faith,
becauſe he is not at his owne diſpoſing, but at the Lords, and therefore
we are to bee ruled and governed by him, and not to doe as we thinke
good. The Lawyers have a ſaying, <hi>For our maſters, and not for our selves;</hi>
all muſt be at the maſters diſpoſing, and not of the ſervants: even ſo we
are the ſervants, and He is the Lord, and therefore wee muſt bee at his
diſposing, and not at our own; and therfore <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. All the holy men are
commended, becauſe all that they did, was in faith: ſo it is ſaid of <hi>Noah,
that by faith being warned of God, he went and made the Arke;</hi> and ſo for this
<hi>Rahab,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> and all the holy men there are recorded. All which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
are to teach us that that which we doe, we ſhould doe in faith.</p>
               <p>How muſt wee doe all in faith?<note place="margin">Quest. How to doe all our actions in Faith.</note>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwere in the faith of theſe three things:</p>
               <p>Firſt, in the Faith of reconciliation, that we are perſwaded that God
is our Father by the meanes of Chriſt,<note place="margin">1</note> and whereas hee was our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note>
that now hee is our friend, and loveth us, as notwithſtanding all
our labours and paines we ſhall be bleſſed one day, ſo we ſee it is ſaid
<hi>Iob.</hi> 14. 14. <hi>If a man die ſhall hee live againe? all the dates of my appointed
time will I waite untill my change ſhall be,</hi> and <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 27. 10. ſaith <hi>David,
Though my father and my mother forſake mee, yet the Lord will gather mee
up.</hi> So 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 2. <hi>Dearely beloved, now are wee the ſonnes of God, but it
doth not appeare what wee ſhall bee:</hi> there was two kinds of labour,
which the children of Iſrael indured; the labors of Egypt, and the
labours of the deſart, the labours of Egypt was penall labour, which
tended to no profit; but the labour of the deſart, was fruitfull labour, it
tended to Canaan: and even ſo all the labours of the wicked, are like the
labours of Egypt, a penall labour, no fruite, or benefit comes by it, but
the labours of the godly are like the labours of the deſart: which tends
to heaven. The true Chriſtian ſuſtaineth himſelfe with this comfort, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he labour and take paines, and endure much trouble, yet that
one day he ſhall ſit downe with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of heaven: a number of people labour and take great paines,
and have but little comfort by it, becauſe it is not done in faith of our
reconciliation to be perſwaded that God is our friend and father by
meanes of Ieſus Chriſt, and loveth us; and therefore if we would have
comfort in our labours and paines, we muſt doe them in the faith of our
reconcilement.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> that we doe, wee muſt do out of a ground of Faith, which
is the word of God,<note place="margin">Meanes to doe all in Faith.</note> where there is no word we muſt not do it, we muſt
have a ground for all our actions out of the word of God, a warrant,
a command from God, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 4 When <hi>David</hi> did underſtand that
God had commanded to keepe his commandements diligently; <hi>Oh,</hi>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:17958:10"/>
ſaith hee, <hi>that my heart were directed to keepe thy ſtatutes. Deuter. chapter</hi> 12.
<hi>verſe</hi> 32. ſaith <hi>Moſes, That whatſoever I command you, take heede yee doe
it, thou ſhalt put nothing there-to,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eſai. 8. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>nor take ought there-from.</hi> And ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
the prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> ſayes, <hi>To the Law and to the Testimony;</hi> there is
the Rule of a Chriſtian, to directall his actions by: when a ſhip goes
to ſea the Marriner ſets his Carde and his Compaſſe how to direct
him; when he hath done ſo, howſoever the skies may lowre, and the
windes blow hee is not affraid, hee hath his rule and directions to
ſayle by: even ſo a Chriſtian muſt doe, when hee doth any thing, he
muſt ſet his Compaſſe, he muſt have a ground from Gods word for the
doing of it, and when hee hath done ſo, howſoever the skies lowre,
and the winde blowe, howſoever things ſeeme to make againſt him,
yet hee is ſafe becauſe hee hath a Rule and a direction to walke by: for
howſoever a man may doe good things, that are good in themſelves, as
the labours of our callings, and releeving of the poore, cloathing of the
naked, feeding of the hungrie, and ſuch like; if hee doe it not of Faith,
if he have not a ground and command from God, the Lord doth not
accept it, we muſt doe it as a part of our duty commanded from God,
and then two Comforts doe enſue:</p>
               <p>The firſt is,<note place="margin">Two comforts of doing things in Faith.</note> that God doth like and allow, and is well pleaſed with
it, becauſe we have his word and warrant for the doing of it; a Chriſtian,
this is his comfort,<note place="margin">1</note> when hee doth any thing that he knoweth that God
is well pleaſed with it, when he hath a warrant and command from
Gods word, then he is ſure that he ſhall pleaſe God, then he may ſay
as the Angell ſaid in <hi>Ezek.</hi> the 9. that had the writers Inkhorne by his
ſide, <hi>I have done as thou hast commanded me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond is,<note place="margin">2</note> that ſeeing we doe that which God hath commanded
us, that God will ſuſtaine and aſſiſt us in the ſame by his power; as wee
read <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. our Saviour Chriſt ſendeth his diſciples, to <hi>teach all
nations, baptizing them and teaching them to obſerve all things whatſoever hee
had commanded, and loe</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>I am with you unto the end of the world:</hi> ſo
in <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. 12. ſaith the Lord to <hi>Moſes, I will be with thee; I will be with thy
mouth to aſsiſt thee, and to direct thee,</hi> and ſo likewiſe in <hi>Eſai.</hi> 41. 10. Saith
God, <hi>Feare not for I am with thee, be not afraid for I am thy God, I wil ſtrengthen
thee and helpe thee: and will ſuſtaine thee with the right hand of my Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:</hi>
and therefore it is a comfort to a Chriſtian, that if he hath a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
or warrant from God for the doing of his actions, that hee ſhall
have the power of God to aſſiſt and ſuſtaine him.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The uſes hereof be two.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> that ſeeing we muſt have a word, and warrant from God for
the doing of any thing: whatſoever we doubt of wee muſt not doe, for
if we doubt, we cannot doe it in Faith, becauſe Faith expelleth doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.
So wee ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 23. <hi>For he that doubteth, is damned if he eate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he eateth not of Faith: For whatſoever is not of Faith is ſinne.</hi> And
therefore if thy conſcience be doubtfull for the doing of any thing, doe
it not till thy conſcience be reſolved, for if thou doeſt, thou doeſt ſinne:
doſt thou doubt whether thou maieſt doe ſuch a thing, or ſuch a thing
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:17958:11"/>
on the Sabbath day? doe it not untill thou be reſolved: ſo likewiſe
art thou in doubt, whether thou maieſt borrow mony at intereſt? doe it
not untill thou be reſolved: and ſo likewiſe of any thing wee doubt
of. It is the boldneſſe of many, that although they doubt of the doing
of a thing, yet they will doe it, becauſe others doe it; well let them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
that all we do muſt be in faith, for if it be not, it is ſinne in us.</p>
               <p>The ſecond uſe is,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> that ſeeing whatſoever we doe, we ſhould have a
ground out of Gods word for it, whatſoever wee cannot have a ground
for, we cannot doe it in faith, and if we doe it not in faith, it is ſinne to
us. There be many things wee cannot doe in faith, wee cannot put our
mony to uſury in faith, becauſe we have the word of God againſt it, <hi>Pſal.</hi>
15. And ſo when men be ſicke likewiſe, to goe out for helpe to witches,
we cannot doe it in faith, becauſe wee have the word of God againſt it:
and ſo likewiſe if a man be in want or neceſſity to ſeeke to releeve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
by unlawfull meanes, he hath no warrant for it, and therefore hee
muſt not doe it, yea whatſoever a man cannot doe in faith, he muſt not
doe it, there be thouſands of this kinde, that wee cannot doe in faith,
and if wee doe it not in faith, wee cannot pleaſe God, nor aſſure our
ſelves that God is pleaſed with us; and ſo we cannot die in faith, becauſe
we have not lived in faith, or will not live by it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">The third meant to doe all in Faith.</note> wee muſt doe it out of a perſwaſion that God will bleſſe us,
and give us ſuch ſucceſſe, as he in his wiſedome ſeeth meete, as his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
is <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>Whatſoever he doth it ſhall proſper:</hi> and <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28. <hi>Alſo we
know that all things worke together for the beſt unto them that love God:</hi> even
theſe accidents that ſeeme to worke cleane contrary; by the ſecret
hand of God, they ſhall all turne to our good. As wee ſee in a clocke
there bee ſome wheeles that turne the cleane contrary way, yet all
ſerve to one end to make the clocke goe: even ſo it is with them that
love and feare God, although there be ſome things that worke one
way, and ſome another, yet by the ſecret hand of God they are turned
to the beſt for them that love him. This is a great comfort that wee
have ſuch a promiſe, that a man may aſſure himſelfe, that even ſuch
things as may ſeeme to turne to his hurt, by the wiſedome of God and
by a ſecret hand they are all turned to the beſt for his people, and
therefore when we have done any good duty, or any thing that he hath
commanded us, although wee doe not ſee ſuch ſucceſſe to follow as
wee deſire, yet wee ſhould commit it to the Lord, and perſwade our
ſelves, that hee will give ſuch a bleſſings, as ſhall be fit for us. There bee
two cares that men trouble themſelves with: How they may doe a
thing; and when they have done it, they take care how and what ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
will follow it. Now the firſt care that every one muſt take
how to doe the duties of his calling is, that which God requireth: but
the ſecond care, that wee muſt commit to God, what ſucceſſe he will
give to it. Wee ſee an hundred men in a ſhip; they are all at the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
diſpoſition, ſome of them he appointeth to the maſte, ſome to bee
at the ſterne, ſome to the fore-decke, ſome to the anchor, and all
tends to the bringing home of the ſhip in ſafetie, and to the good of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:17958:11"/>
them all: even ſo the Lord hath the diſpoſing of us, and turnes all our
labours to our good. And therefore when we have done the firſt,
the ſecond we muſt commit to the Lord. But oh, we ſee men ſo farre
from doing things in Faith; that they doe it in no hope of a bleſſing,
for let a man give admonitions and exhortations and good counſell:
as I pray you heare and receive the Sacraments, and ſuch like; wee
are farre enough from doing it in Faith, when wee doe it not in hope
of a bleſſing, therefore wee muſt doe the firſt, and commit the bleſſing
to God. The next thing is, how we ſhould ſuffer in Faith; of which
there are two kindes:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Spirituall Deſertion.</item>
                  <item>2. Worldly Croſſes.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Spirituall Deſertions are,<note place="margin">How to Suffer all in Faith.</note> when he taketh away the comfortable fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of his favour, the power of grace, or the meaſure of feeling of it:
this kind is the greateſt and heavieſt, to feele God departed from a man
more than worldly croſſes, loſſes, or any affliction that wee feele out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly.
Now in both theſe, Faith muſt ſuſtaine and uphold us, the
luſt he muſt live by his Faith.</p>
               <p>In ſpirituall Deſertions Faith upholds us,<note place="margin">The firſt meanes how Faith up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds us in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion.</note> by three wayes: Firſt, that
although wee feele not the comfortable feeling of Gods favour, yet
we are all one with Chriſt, becauſe we ſtand not in our owne apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
but Chriſt doth apprehend us, as it is <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 12. <hi>Not as though I
had already attained to it, either were already perfect, but I follow, if that I may
apprehend, that for whoſe ſake alſo I am apprehended of Christ Ieſus.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
howſoever we let goe our hold through weakeneſſe, and frailtie;
yet Chriſt doth not let goe his. Even as a mother taketh a Child by the
hand, when howſoever the Child let goe his hold, yet the mother
doth not let goe hers: ſo howſoever we may let goe our hold through
weakeneſſe or frailtie, yet Chriſt doth not let goe his: and therefore
wee ſee it is ſaid in <hi>Peter,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>we are kept by the power of God through Faith unto
Salvation.</hi> Therefore it is the power of God that doth keepe us. So
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 94. 18. (ſaieth he) <hi>When I ſaid, my foote ſlipped: thy mercy, O Lord, held
me up.</hi> Even ſo being one with Chriſt, Gods mercy it is that uphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
us. Trees that ſeeme to be dead in Winter, yet becauſe there is life
and ſap in the roote, in the ſpring they do recover. Even ſo although a
man may ſeeme to be dead in his owne feeling, yet becauſe there is life
in the roote, life in Chriſt, we ſhall recover againe.</p>
               <p>The ſecond action that Faith doth ſuſtaine us by in ſpirituall deſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
is:<note place="margin">The ſecond meanes how faith upholds us in deſertion.</note> that although wee feele not the comfortable feeling of Gods
favour, yet it ſhewes us that this forſaking is but for a time, as it is ſaid,
<hi>Eſai.</hi> 54. 8. <hi>For a little while have I forſaken thee, but with great compaſsion will
I gather thee, for a moment in mine anger, I hide my face from thee for a ſeaſon,
but with ever lasting mercie I have had compaſsion on thee, ſaith the Lord, thy
Redeemer.</hi> And therefore although wee feele not the Love of God
at the preſent, yet Faith muſt uphold us, and wee muſt perſwade our
ſelves it is but for a little time. And ſo likewiſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55. 22. it is ſaid,
<hi>He will not ſuffer the righteous to fall for ever.</hi> Howſoever they may fall, yet
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:17958:12"/>
they ſhall riſe againe. And <hi>Mic.</hi> 7. 8. The Church doth ſuſtaine her
ſelfe by this, <hi>Rejoyce not againſt me, O mine enemie: although I fall, yet I
ſhall riſe againe.</hi> If a man fall into a ſwoond that he neither breathe nor
pant: yet bring him to the fire, and chafe him, put a little <hi>Aquavitae</hi> into
his mouth, and he will recover againe, if there be any life in him: even
ſo, if a man fall into a ſpirituall ſwoond that he neither breathe nor pant;
yet if he be brought to the uſe of good meanes, as prayer, preaching, and
the Sacraments; if there be the life of grace in him, he will recover
againe. This we ſee in <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> that when <hi>Nathan</hi> came to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
and told him of his fault, he ſtraightway recovered: and ſo <hi>Peter,</hi>
that had but a looke of Chriſt, recovered. If a man caſt mud into a
fountaine, it will in time worke it ſelfe cleere. So in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 14. A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
is compared to a fountaine, in which although there be mud caſt,
yet it will worke it ſelfe cleere.</p>
               <p>The third action whereby faith ſuſtaineth us in ſpiritual deſertions,<note place="margin">The third means how Faith up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds in Deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> is,
that al is for their good that God is departed from them. For <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16. it is
ſaid, <hi>It is expedient for you, that I goe away from you.</hi> So the abſence of Chriſt
from the Church is for their good, that they may the more long for
him, when he is departed, earneſtly ſeeke after him, and ſet the greater
price upon him, when they have him. If a man have poyſoned himſelfe
a Phyſition cannot helpe him, but by giving him ſome ranke poyſon;
even ſo the Lord lets us fall into ſome great ſinne to expell ſome other
ſinnes. And therefore as Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 11. of <hi>Lazarus</hi> his ſickeneſſe,
<hi>That it was not unto Death, but for the glory of God.</hi> So wee may ſay of all
the falls of Gods people, that there falls are not unto death, but for
the glory of God.</p>
               <p>Now for worldly croſſes faith ſuſtaineth foure wayes:<note place="margin">In worldly creſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes Faith ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports ſoure waies.</note> Firſt, it perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
us that all the judgements of God, that fal upon us are juſt, and that
he doth us no wrong thereby: therefore that we muſt quiet our ſelves
yeelding to the good will of God; So we ſee the Church doth in
<hi>Micah</hi> 7. 9. <hi>I will beare the wrath of the Lord becauſe I have ſinned against
him.</hi> So <hi>Ier.</hi> 10. ſaith he, <hi>It is my ſorrow and I muſt beare it:</hi> As though he
ſhould ſay, it is mine owne ſinne, I may thanke mine owne ſelfe for
it, it is my ſorrow, and I will beare it. The good Theefe, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23. 41. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes,
<hi>Wee are indeed juſtly puniſhed heere, for wee receive things worthy for
that we have done.</hi> And therefore let us never murmur nor grieve at it,
we are heere righteouſly, theſe things be juſtly come upon us. Thus
Faith makes us to quiet our ſelves in looking at the good will of God.</p>
               <p>The ſecond way whereby Faith ſuſtaineth us in worldly croſſes is,<note place="margin">The ſecond way how Faith ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaineth in croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</note>
that it makes us ſhut up our eyes, and wholly to relie upon God. So
<hi>David</hi> in the <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 26. <hi>My fleſh and my heart faileth: but God is the
ſtrength of my heart and my portion for ever.</hi> So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 49, 50. <hi>Remember
thy promiſe made unto thy ſervant wherein thou haſt made me to hope. It is my
comfort in my trouble, for thy promiſes have quickened me.</hi> And ſo likewiſe
<hi>Iob</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Iob 13. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>Though hee kill me, yet I will truſt in him.</hi> Faith, it makes believe
one contrary in another, that although we die, and rot, yet wee ſhall
live, and we ſhall live againe, and riſe againe: though God doth ſeeme
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:17958:12"/>
to be our enemie, yet Faith doth perſwade us that he is our friend: and
although wee bee miſerable, yet that wee are bleſſed and happie: thus
Faith makes us beleeve one contrary in another.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Faith doth hereby ſuſtaine us in worldly croſſes, becauſe it
aſſures us that God is preſent with us in all our troubles, in our ſickneſſe,
about our beds, in our graves, and in the gaole. Even as God was with
<hi>Moſes</hi> in the buſh, and with the three children in the fiery ſornace; ſo God
is with all his ſervants in all their troubles and afflictions. The want of
this conſideration, that God was not preſent with <hi>Saul,</hi> made his afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the greater,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 28 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> ſaith he, <hi>The Philiſtims made warre againſt me, and God is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
from mee:</hi> therefore when Faith ſhall aſſure us, that in all our
troubles and afflictions God is preſent with us, this is a mighty meanes
to ſuſtaine and uphold us. So ſayes <hi>David, Pſalme</hi> 23. 4. <hi>Yea, though I
ſhould walke through the valley and ſhaddow of Death, yet I will feare none ill;
thy rod, thy ſtaffe, they comfort me:</hi> and <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 31. <hi>If God be with us,</hi> ſaith he,
<hi>who can bee againſt us?</hi> When old <hi>Iacob</hi> was ſent for into Egypt, as wee
may ſee <hi>Gen.</hi> 46. 3. The Lord ſpake in a viſion to <hi>Iacob,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>Feare
not Iacob to goe downe into Egypt, for I will goe with thee:</hi> Even ſo when the
Lord ſhall ſay to us, feare not to goe into the grave, for I will bee with
you, or into the dennes of death, or into the gaole, or into any other
trouble whatſoever, ſeeing hee will bee preſent to ſuſtaine and to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
us, we ought to doe it cheerefully.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Foure meanes whereby Faith ſupports us in Afflictions.</note> Faith doth ſuſtaine us in worldly croſſes, with this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration,
and comfort: that when all temporall things faile, yet wee
ſhall bee made partakers of ſpirituall and heavenly things. Thus wee
ſee <hi>Iob</hi> did ſuſtaine himſelfe, when all temporall things failed him, when
hee had loſt his children, his goods and all, then he comforteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
in this,<note place="margin">Iob 19. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>I know that my Redeemer liveth. And although after my ſkinne
wormes deſtroy this body, yet ſhall I ſee God in my fleſh, &amp;c.</hi> So <hi>David</hi> in the
perſon of Chriſt in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 9. Howſoever they deprived him of theſe
temporall things, and killed him, yet ſaith hee comfortably, <hi>My heart
is glad, and my tongue rejoyceth, my fleſh alſo ſhall rest in hope; for thou wilt
not leave my ſoule in grave, neither wilt thou ſuffer thy holy one to ſee corruption.</hi>
And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27. 13. <hi>I ſhould have fainted, but that I beleeved to ſee the goodneſſe
of God, in the land of the living;</hi> and therefore, howſoever temporall
things faile us, yet Faith perſwadeth us of moſt happy and heavenly
things.</p>
               <p>The uſe is, that if a man have Faith, hee muſt labour to live by his
Faith; a number have saith, and yet doe not labour to live in faith, and
therefore, haſt thou faith, labour to live in faith; all that thou doeſt, doe
in faith; and all which thou ſuffereſt, ſuffer in faith.</p>
               <p>The fourth uſe of faith in the life of a Chriſtian is,<note place="margin">4</note> 
                  <hi>to die in Faith,</hi> for
as I have ſhewed you before, a man can never looke to die thus, except
hee live by his faith,<note place="margin">Vſe of Faith in our life-time.</note> for when a man hath lived by it here in this world,
then he is ſure to die in faith, and ſo be ſaved by it, at the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
therefore this is a good comfort for us, that when all ſhall leave
us, when we ſhall part with our goods, our friends, and with this world,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:17958:13"/>
then wee ſhall be ſaved by our faith: when others ſhall deſire the hils
and mountaines to fall upon them, then our faith will bee a cup of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
for us. Let a man have houſes and lands, goods and cattle, ſilver
and gold, and plate, and all the rich jewels that may bee; when death
comes, all is gone, hee muſt part from all, and then what comfort can
hee have of them? when death ſeazes upon him, and hell is readie to
ſwallow him up. But if a man have lived in faith, and died in faith, this
will bee a comfort unto him, that hee ſhall alſo bee ſaved by his faith,
that hee ſhall ſee the heavenly viſion, as <hi>Stephan ſaw heaven opened, and
Chriſt ſtanding at the right hand of God.</hi> I have ſhewed you before, that if
a man lye upon his death-bed, and make his will, hee giveth ſome of
his goods to one, and ſome to another, and ſo leaveth himſelfe nothing;
now if hee hath not faith to comfort him, what a pittifull caſe is this
man in; hee is a miſerable man and thrice miſerable if hee hath not
faith, whatſoever the party is, whether he be King or Lord.</p>
               <p>Now foure waies we muſt die in faith,<note place="margin">Foure waies to dye in Faith.</note> as wee may ſee in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 13.
Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> they did acknowledge they were but ſtrangers, and pilgrimes,
and had but a little time to tarry here; that heaven was their home; ſo al
the holy men have done before us, <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 39. 12. <hi>For I am a ſtranger
and ſojourner, as were all my fathers:</hi> And ſo in the 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 11. hee exhorts,
<hi>Dearely beloved, I beſeech you as ſtrangers and pilgrims, abstaine from fleſhly
luſts, which fight againſt the ſoule.</hi> And therefore ſeeing wee are ſtrangers,
and pilgrimes here, wee ſhould bee contented to leave the world, when
God would have us: it is a pittifull thing to ſee that men hang on the
world, as if they were borne to continne here for ever.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">The ſecond way to dye in Faith.</note> the holy people of God that died in faith did ſee the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
of God afarre off, and did thankefully rejoyce in them: it is a
Metaphor taken from men when they bee at ſea, one goeth up the
maſt to ſee if hee can ſee the ſea ſhore, if hee can ſpy it, it makes his
heart leape in his belly; even ſo when we lye on our death-beds, if we
can get upon the maſt of faith, and ſee the ſhore of heaven and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;
this will make us to rejoyce. So we ſee <hi>Stephan</hi> ſaw at the time
of his death <hi>heaven opened,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 7. 56.</note> 
                  <hi>and Chriſt ſtanding at the right hand of God</hi> to
helpe him, and receive him. And ſo alſo <hi>Iacob,</hi> when he went to Syria,
when he tooke a ſtone, and laid it at his head, and ſlept in the open fields,
he ſaw a heavenly viſion, a ladder reared up to heaven, and the Angels
aſcending, and deſcending by it: ſo this will be a great comfort to us,
when we lie on our death-beds,<note place="margin">Gen. 28. 1.</note> and ſhall ſee ſuch heavenly viſions, a
ladder reared up to heaven, where the Angels of God aſcend and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend,
ready to receive our ſoules, and to carry them up to heaven. <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.
Wee ſee the <hi>Cherubins</hi> were ſet to keepe paradiſe, that a man ſhould
not come in there, but now it is comfortable that they ſhall be ready to
receive our ſoules, and carry them to heaven.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if we die in faith, we muſt ſeeke for a heavenly country; it
makes us to let all goe, and to ſeeke for heaven: ſo we ſee the Theefe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the croſſe, hanging in paines and torments, he lets all goe, and labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
for the ſaving of his ſoule, <hi>Lord,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>remember me when thou
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:17958:13"/>
commeſt into thy kingdome:</hi> So likewiſe the Apoſtle <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. 8. ſaith, <hi>I
haue counted all things loſſe, and doe judge them to be dung, that I might winne
Chriſt.</hi> If a man ſhould lie floating on the Sea ready to be drowned, if
one ſhould caſt out a planke to ſave him, that man would bee ready to
let all goe, and to lay hold on the planke to ſave himſelfe: even ſo wee
are all floating in the ſea of this world, and God hath as it were throwne
a planke out unto us, which are ready to bee drowned, which is his
Sonne <hi>Ieſus Chriſt:</hi> Therefore at the houre of death wee ſhould be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to let all goe, and to lay hold on him.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">The fourth way to die in Faith.</note> to die in faith, we muſt ſeeke death in life, and make a way
through the dens of death to life: put a hound upon a ſent, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
we ſee nothing, yet the hound will follow the ſent; and even
ſo put faith upon a ſent of Chriſt, although we ſee him not, yet faith will
follow and purſue, till it come at Chriſt, and ſo lay hold on him.</p>
               <p>The uſes are firſt,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> that we labour above all things to get faith, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
it coſt us; ſeeing wee are juſtified before God and ſanctified in
this world, we muſt live in faith, and we muſt die in faith; therefore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all things labor to get faith. If a man goe to the market, if he heare
there is a commodity, that hee can make ſome great advantage by, hee
will have it whatſoever it coſt him; ſo ſeeing wee heare there is ſuch
great advantage to bee made of faith, let us labour above all things to
get it, whatſoever the price be, or whatſoever it coſt.</p>
               <p>The ſecond uſe is,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> that ſeeing we have ſuch uſe of our faith here in
this life, that wee nouriſh it by prayer and meditations, and by all the
good meanes. If a man did hang out of an high Tower, out of the top
of it by a cord, or threed, and were like to fall into a pit of fire, how a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraide
would that man be of every hand, that ſhould come to breake
this threed or cord? even ſo faith is the threed or cord wee hang by,
over the pit of hell, how afraid then ſhould we be of every hand, or any
thing that ſhould breake the threed and cord of faith?</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving ſpoken of the <hi>utility of Faith,</hi> and of the great uſe
thereof in the life of a Chriſtian, firſt, that a man is juſtified
by it, before God; ſecondly, that he is thereby ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in this world; thirdly, that hee muſt live by his faith;
and fourthly, that hee muſt die in faith: wee raiſed from
hence two points of exhortation; the firſt was, that wee labour to get
faith, whatſoever it coſt us, becauſe wee are juſtified by it, before God,
and ſanctified by it in this world. If a man goe to market, and hee
heare hee may have good advantage by buying of ſuch and ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities,
hee will not ſticke at it, whatſoever it coſt, or whatſoever
the price be. And even ſo ſeeing faith doth bring us ſuch advantage,
let us not ſticke at the price of it, whatſoever it coſt us, our pleasures,
our eaſe, or much labour. The ſecond point of exhortation was, that
wee labour to keepe, and to nouriſh it by all meanes: now becauſe
there bee divers faiths, and leſt the divell ſhould deceive us, with a
dead faith, as the mother was with the dead childe, inſtead of her li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
therefore wee will ſpeake of the divers kinds thereof. For as
wee muſt labour for it, ſo wee muſt looke it be the true faith: if a king
ſhould have a ſervant, and ſhould ſend him into his Treaſurie, and he
ſhould bid him take ſilver and gold, or what jewels he would have, and
whatſoever he wanteth, the ſervant would ſurely looke he had the key,
and the right key too, or elſe hee might turne and turne, and never the
better: ſo when God doth offer ſuch rich treaſures in the Goſpell, then
the next thing is, we muſt looke to it, that we muſt have a right key, that
is true faith, or elſe wee may turne and turne, and never the better: and
therefore that we be not deceived, we are to conſider generally, there
be foure kinds of faith:</p>

life, nor to the humbling of himſelfe. This hath no grace in it, it is no
worke of God, but it ariſeth from the light of nature; for as wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
other ſtories, ſo alſo wee may beleeve this, and aſſentunto it, and
therefore no grace of God. <hi>Iames</hi> 2. the divels have this kinde of faith,
they beleeve the Scriptures, that there is a God, and therefore tremble:
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:17958:14"/>
now he doth not ſo, becauſe he is illuminated by Gods Spirit; but by
the light of nature, by this he knowes it, and therefore a man may have
this faith, and not true faith. Here we are to note a ſtrange malice of the
divell, that he would keep from men, that which he beleeveth himſelfe,
for hee beleeveth that there is a God, and beleeveth the word of God
to bee true,<note place="margin">Note.</note> and that there is a hell to torment; and yet many men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
not this, they do not beleeve there is a God, or that there is a hell,
or that the Scriptures bee true, and therefore they come ſhort of the
faith of the divell, have no grace, and therefore it cannot be true faith.
A man may beleeve there is a God, that he is a juſt God, that the word
of God is true, that there is pardon for ſinnes, rewards for the Godly,
puniſhments for the wicked, and yet this is not the true faith, for it failes
in two things: firſt, is failes in the true reſolved grounds of faith; for as
the Schoolemen ſay, True faith never reſts till it come at his reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
ground, to reſt on God, for (as they ſay) faith doth not beleeve the
reſurrection of the body, becauſe <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>Paul</hi> wrote, and the reſt of
the holy men, but true faith doth beleeve it, becauſe God ſpake it; ſo
that true faith reſts on God, as the laſt ground. So 2 <hi>Peter</hi> 1. 21. ſaith he,
<hi>For the Prophecy came not in old time by the will of man, but holy men ſpake as
they were moved by the holy Ghost:</hi> ſo theſe holy men did not write the
Scriptures in their owne name, but they wrote them as the Pen-men
and Secretaries of Almighty God; and therefore we are not to reſt in
them, becauſe they wrote them but becauſe God ſpake them, and it is
his will,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 16.</note> and all Scripture is given by inſpiration of God: <hi>Tertullian</hi>
hath a ſaying, and that is this, That the Kings and Princes of this world,
when they would have their Lawes knowne to men, they ſend it by
Shreeves to proclaime and make it knowne to them: ſo (ſaith he) the
Prophets and Apoſtles be as it were the Shreeves and Officers of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God, to make Gods Lawes knowne unto men. And as another
learned man ſaith, namely <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> That it is true that Chriſt did write
the Scriptures, but not in his owne Perſon, for he is the head, but the
Prophets and Apoſtles did write them as the very parts of Chriſt, the
very hands of Chriſt, or the fingers of Chriſt to write the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
for whatſoever Chriſt would have written to his people concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
his will, he hath wrote by his Prophets and Apoſtles. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9. 8.
Chriſt is there deſcribed to haue an Inckhorne of a writer, at his reines,
Chriſt had his Inckhorne at his backe to write his laſt will, and teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to his people, when hee turned his backe upon them, even when
he was departed. And therfore wee ſee that true faith in the laſt reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
ſtaies on God, it doth not reſt on the Scriptures, becauſe <hi>Peter</hi>
and <hi>Paul,</hi> and the reſt of the holy men of God ſpake it, but becauſe
God hath taught it. Therefore here wee may conſider the ground of
an hiſtoricall faith, generally to beleeve the Scriptures, and the Reaſon
why men beleeve the Bible, and in their common ſpeech talke of it, is,
becauſe they never heard otherwiſe ſince they were borne, but that the
Scriptures were true. So that it doth not ariſe from the true ground.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing that hiſtoricall faith doth faile in,<note place="margin">The ſecond de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall Faith.</note> is, becauſe it
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:17958:15"/>
wants particular application of the word of God, it doth aſſent to it
that it is true, but it goes no further, it beleeves there is a God, but not
beleeve hee is a God to him, it beleeves there is pardon of ſinnes, but
not that his ſinnes be pardoned, and that God is juſt, but not to him.
This is a maine defect in this Faith, it doth not apply the word of God:
in the body there be two ſorts of veines, ſome of them bee ſucking
and drawing the meate into the ſtomacke to concoct, the other carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſtrength of it, into every part of a man: ſo true faith like to
theſe ſucking veines, carrieth the word downe into a mans heart, and
applyeth it unto him. In the Goſpell when Chriſt ſpake to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
generally that one of them ſhould betray him; ſtraight-way they
ſaid every one, <hi>Is it I, Maſter? Is it I?</hi> And ſo true faith doth apply the
word particularly to themſelves: hiſtorical faith doth not ſo, but is like
the Apothecaries boy, that gathered herbes and ſimples for other mens
diſeaſes, and not for his owne: even ſo many men gather good things
out of the word, and others have the benefit of it, and they have none;
all their comfort hangs on this, to talke and ſpeake of the judgements of
God, and of the good things that be in Him; but it goes no further, it
doth not apply home the word, and therefore it is another kinde of
faith, that wee muſt looke and labour for.</p>
               <p>The ſecond kinde is, <hi>Temporary faith,</hi> this kinde goes further than
the first did.<note place="margin">Secondly Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary Faith. The firſt Cauſe.</note> For it doth not onely aſſent to the word of God, that it is
true, but doth particularly apply it in part, and there is alſo ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoundneſſe
left behinde it: this kinde of faith is ſpoken of in <hi>Matthew</hi>
13. 20. it is ſaid to be the <hi>ſtony ground that brings forth fruit for a time,</hi> all is
not well with them, for they do not continue, they go away. This is the
common faith of the world, to heare the word of God, to apply it in ſome
part, ſo farre as it goeth with them; but if it croſſe them, then it faileth,
and is carried away with the ſway of corruption in them, that as the
weeds eate out the heart of the corne, ſo corruption eateth out the heart
of their ſaith. Now it is called Temporary faith, &amp;c.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Becauſe it ariſeth from Temporary cauſes.</item>
                  <item>2. Becauſe it is but of Temporarie continuance.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The temporary cauſes are three: firſt, becauſe that men have a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to get knowledge above the reſt, and to keepe Table-talke, and to
put downe others, when they bee in company. The ſecond is, to
keepe credit with the world, they would not be counted odde men, and
to bee pointed at; this is the reaſon why <hi>Simon Magus Act.</hi> 8. belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
became a great man in the world, becauſe he would not be pointed
at, or counted an odde man. The third cauſe is worldly eaſe and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit;
there is ſomewhat to bee gotten by it, or ſome are afraide that if
they doe not ſo as others doe, they ſhall bee brought in danger of the
Law. As <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 26. the people followed Chriſt, <hi>but it was to be fed of him;</hi>
and in <hi>Numbers</hi> wee ſee the hope of liberty and the priviledges that the
Iſraelites had, made other to joyne with them: So likewiſe <hi>Heſter</hi> 8.
17. <hi>Many of the people of the land became Iewes, for the feare of the Iewes fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them:</hi> but wee muſt have a better ground than this, if ever wee will
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:17958:15"/>
be ſaved or bleſſed of God, and ſaved at the day of judgement.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is called temporary faith, becauſe it is but of temporary
continuance,<note place="margin">The ſecond Cauſe.</note> for a time, it is ſtony and hard at the bottome, it doth not
hold, becauſe it hath no roote, it wants a roote of judgement, and roote
of affection.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it wants a roote of judgement, becauſe they beleeve as others do,
and never heard otherwiſe; they doe not beleeve it, becauſe God hath
taught, and revealed it, therefore they are in danger to fall away; but if
they beleeved it, becauſe God hath ſpoken it, and it is his will, it is not
all the world that could beare them over in it. This wee ſee in the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Church,</hi> and in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> daies, that the great Doctors and
Schollers could not over-beare them, although they were but poore
men, becauſe they were rooted in judgment; therefore if men will
hold out unto the end, they muſt labour to have this roote in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 85. The prophet <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>I will hearken what God ſaith.</hi> I
will not hearken what the world, my corruptions, nor what men ſay, but
I will hearken what God ſaith.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in regard of affection; a man muſt love the word, eſteeme
it, and ſet a high price upon it, or elſe hee may well have a roote of
judgement, but no roote of affection, and there will be no continuance:
and therefore doſt thou love it, and regard it? be ready to apply it to thy
ſelfe, joy in it as the chiefeſt treaſure, and count it as the greateſt bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
and be contented to part, and to let all goe in regard of it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Thirdly, Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Faith.</note> 
                  <hi>Miraculous Faith</hi> is a perſwaſion that God will uſe ſome
men for ſome excellent worke, to worke ſome miraculous thing:
this kind of Faith was in <hi>Iudas,</hi> and many ſuch others, that Chriſt will
ſay unto at the laſt day, <hi>Depart from mee yee workers of iniquitie.</hi> As, what
is it to caſt out the divell? and not to caſt out a mans owne ſinnes? what
is it to clenſe a Leper and yet cannot clenſe our ſelves from our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions?
to raiſe the dead, and thou to lie ſtill in thy ſinnes? to give
ſight to the blind, and thou not ſee the good things of God? to open
the eares of the deafe, and thou wilt not have thine eares open to heare
the good things of God? And therefore, if thou haſt juſtifying Faith to
caſt out thy ſinnes &amp; corruptions, thou haſt a more excellent gift than to
worke miracles, to raiſe the dead, to clenſe the ſoule Leper, to give ſight
to the blind, to make the dumbe to ſpeake, the lame to goe, the deafe
to heare, for thou ſhalt goe to heaven when they they ſhall goe to hell.
Wee ſee <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. 17. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When Chriſt had ſent out his Diſciples to caſt
out divells, at their returne, <hi>they came againe rejoycing, and told him, that
the ſpirits were ſubdued through his name,</hi> they rejoyced, but our Saviour
bids them <hi>not to rejoyce at this, but rejoyce that their names were written in
heaven.</hi> And therefore if thou haſt by true faith caſt out thy ſinnes, if
thou canſt caſt up thine eyes of faith to heaven, and there behold and
ſee thy name written, this ſhall bee greater comfort to thee than the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
out divells.</p>
               <p>The fourth kind of ſaith is,<note place="margin">Fourthly, Iu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

without this faith in Chriſt; this it is that muſt juſtifie and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:17958:16"/>
fie us; which faith is an aſſent to the whole word of God, to make uſe
of it to ourſelves, and a particular application of the promiſes of God
made untous in Chriſt, wherein we ſtand perſwaded of our reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the blood of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Now there be three things required in this <hi>justifying and ſaving faith.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Three things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Faith.</note>
Firſt, <hi>there muſt be an aſſent to the whole word of God,</hi> for it doth not beleeve
God in one point,<note place="margin">1</note> and not in another, but it beleeves the whole word of
God. The ſchoole-men ſay, a true beleever maks no choice what point
he will beleeve, if God hath revealed them, he will beleeve them all;
it is ſaid, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 5. <hi>Caſting downe the imaginations, and every high thing that
is exalted againſt the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivitie every
thought to the obedience of Chriſt:</hi> it doth ſo bring under and captivate his
wits, that whatſoever Chriſt ſpeaketh, it will beleeve. The common
faith of the world is not ſo; for they beleeve God in one thing, and not
in another, they beleeve God in his promiſes, and not in his threatnings,
in his mercy, but not in his judgement, they beleeve God in one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,
and not in another; therefore this is not the true faith
that the Scripture ſpeakes of, for all the parts of true faith be ſo joyned
and knit together, that if wee take away one, wee deſtroy all: even as
it is in a ſtone wall, take away one part, and the reſt falls; and even ſo,
take away one part of true faith, and yee deſtroy all: and as one cracke
in a bell ſpoyles the ſound of a bell; even ſo, one part of our faith being
taken away deſtroyes our faith: To this effect, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 6. The Apoſtle
ſaith, <hi>I marvell yee are ſo ſoone turned to another Goſpell:</hi> they miſſing one
point of faith, he ſhewes they deſtroyed all.</p>
               <p>If any man object and ſay,<note place="margin">Object.</note> How can that be, that a man failing in one
point of faith, ſhould faile in all? Wee ſee <hi>Abraham</hi> beleeved God
in one thing and not in another.</p>
               <p>I anſwere,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> wee are to conſider two things. Firſt, what he beleeved,
and what hee beleeved not; all points be not of one conſequence, ſome
bee of greater moment, and ſome of leſſe: for as <hi>Aquinas</hi> ſaith, ſome
points bee the grounds of faith, and thoſe bee of greateſt weight and
moment, and there bee ſome that bee in relation to others; ſo many
things in the ſtory of the Bible bee moſt directed to faith, as grounds,
and ſome be in relation to others to helpe and further it: now <hi>Abraham</hi>
doubted not of any maine point of faith, but hee doubts of the leſſe, hee
beleeves God for ſaving of his ſoule, that God for Chriſts ſake would
ſave that, but hee doubts of this, that God would not give him a child,
ſo hee doubts not of the maine matter, but of the leſſer: a man may
beleeve God in the maine, beleeve God for the ſaving of his ſoule, and
doubt of the leſſer, this doth not deſtroy true faith. Even as a man
comming to a ſhelfe where be a number of diſhes, a man may take away
one and the reſt may ſtand, but if hee take away the ſhelfe all the diſhes
fall downe: even ſo it is in faith, take away one point which is in relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to another, all the reſt will ſtand, but take away that which is the
ground and beareth up all of them, and then all the reſt fall. Now the
cauſes of this defect are:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:17958:16"/>
Firſt,<note place="margin">The firſt Defect.</note> becauſe they beleeve it not; not out of any diſtruſſfulneſſe of
God,<note place="margin">Pſalm. 7<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

And as the Prince wee read of in the <hi>ſecond</hi> booke of the <hi>Kings</hi> that
doubted of the power of God: but it ariſeth for want of light, that
they doe not ſee it to bee ſo, or becauſe they have not beene as yet
taught it out of the word of God.</p>
               <p>The ſecond defect is,<note place="margin">The ſecond De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</note> for want of ſtrength, for although hee ſees
it to bee a truth, yet hee cannot beleeve it, but is carried away with
the ſway and ſwinge of Nature againſt his judgement, that hee is
faint to ſtrive and ſtruggle againſt it. This is the maine difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the people of God, and the world, for although they beleeve
not ſome particular thing, yet they ſtrive to beleeve; even as the man
in the Gospell ſaid, <hi>Lord I beleeve, helpe my unbeleefe.</hi> But the world doth
not ſo, for they doubt and doe not beleeve many particular things, and
yet they doe not ſtrive againſt their unbeleefe; and therefore, if we doe
not find it ſo in ourſelves, that there is not a ſtriving to beleeve, it is no
true faith, for true faith doth beleeve God in the maine matters; it
doth beleeve that God will give them Chriſt, and yet many times they
doubt of health; it beleeves Chriſt will give them heaven, and through
weakneſſe doubts that God will not give them ſeaſonable weather, and
yet there is a ſtriving to beleeve all.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing that wee are to obſerve in ſaving faith is,<note place="margin">The ſecond thing in ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Faith. Iob 5. 7.</note> That <hi>it
makes uſe unto it ſelfe of the word of God,</hi> and not in generall, but it applieth
every promiſe of God, made for our good. As <hi>Eliphas</hi> ſaith to <hi>Iob,</hi> take
this, and take to thy ſelfe; ſo true faith, beleeve this, and beleeve it for
thy ſelfe; ſo that it doth not beleeve in generall, but it makes uſe and
applies every promiſe of God made home, and to ſay with <hi>David,
I have reſpect unto all thy Commandements.</hi> Herein true faith differeth
from the faith of the world, whoſoever beleeveth the word of God in
generall, and yet cannot apply it to themſelves, may bee compared to
the Apothecary which giveth others Phyſicke, but doth not take it
himſelfe, whereas true faith applies the promiſes of God for its owne
good; this is a juſtifying faith.</p>
               <p>The third thing in true ſaving faith is, that as it applies all the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of God to it ſelfe,<note place="margin">The third thing in ſanctifying Faith.</note> ſo eſpicially it applies and <hi>takes hold of the great
promiſes made unto us in Chriſt,</hi> wherein wee ſtand perſwaded of our
redemption by the blood of Chriſt. Even as a man being carried away
in a great ſtreame, looketh up, and eſpying a great tree hang over
him, takes hold of it, and ſaveth himſelfe from drowning: ſo when a
man is carried away in the ſtreame of corruption, and lookes up, by the
eye of faith hee eſpieth Chriſt, like a tree, hang over him, takes hold of
him, and by this meanes, hee ſaveth himſelfe, when thouſands of others
periſh. It is true indeed that true faith looketh to the whole word of
God: it beleeveth the threatnings, and the promiſes of God, as in <hi>Heb.</hi>
11. That by the ſame faith that <hi>Noah</hi> beleeved God for the ſaving of
his ſoule, by the ſame hee beleeved God for the ſaving of his bodie by
an <hi>Arke;</hi> and ſo likewiſe <hi>Abraham,</hi> by the ſame faith hee beleeved
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:17958:17"/>
that God would give him heaven, by the ſame faith hee beleeved that
God would keepe him in a ſtrange countrey: ſo <hi>Moſes</hi> by the ſame faith
that hee beleeved that God would preſerve him from hell, by the ſanie
faith hee beleeved that God would preſerve him from the wrath of
<hi>Pharaoh.</hi> Yet in the matters of our ſalvation, true faith lookes at Chriſt
onely, and at the promiſes made unto us in him: even as the people of
<hi>Iſrael</hi> that were ſtung with the firie ſerpents, with the ſame eye where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they looked on <hi>Moſes, Aaron,</hi> on the people, and on their tents, with

them: ſo it is in true ſaith; it lookes to all the promiſes of God made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us, and yet in the matters of ſalvation, it muſt bee the great promiſe
made unto us in Chriſt that muſt ſave us, which true faith lookes at.</p>
               <p>All the hope we have of heaven hangs on faith; and leſt we ſhould
be deceived of our faith, and ſo deceived of heaven, I will give you ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
true notes and markes of faith, whereby wee may diſcerne true
faith,<note place="margin">Seven trials of true Faith. The firſt.</note> from the faith of the world: which are theſe that follow:</p>
               <p>The firſt ſigne of true faith, whereby wee may diſcerne it from the
faith of the world is, <hi>By the efficient cauſe, which is preaching.</hi> For thence it
ariſeth, ſo it is preaching that workes faith in us: ſo wee ſee in <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.
<hi>Faith commeth by hearing the Word of God preached,</hi> it doth not ariſe of
nothing, but comes of preaching; therefore it is called <hi>Semen, the ſeede
of the Word,</hi> that even as plants and herbs come of ſeedes, ſo of the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
of the Word comes faith; but the faith of the world, that doth
not ariſe of the preaching of the Word, but of the ſpeech of people, and
by a report they have heard of ever ſince they can remember, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
heard otherwiſe, and therefore this is not the true faith. Wherefore
every one ſhould looke how he comes by his faith, and by what means;
if it comes not by preaching, it cannot be true faith. Now if preaching
be the meanes to get true faith in us, let us labour to have it, becauſe it
is the meanes to worke true faith; for how can wee have it, if wee want
the meanes; if wee have not ſeede, wee can have no corne, and hee that
ſtealeth away a handfull of our feede, doth us more hurt than hee that
ſtealeth much more out of our barne: ſo if we have no preaching, which
is the meanes, we can have no faith: and he that takes away preaching
doth us more hurt, than to take any thing elſe from us.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ſigne or marke of true faith,<note place="margin">The ſecond triall of true Faith.</note> whereby wee may diſcerne
it from the faith of the world is, <hi>That it begins in weakeneſſe.</hi> Even like a
childe that is weake at the firſt, and afterwards it groweth ſtronger
and ſtronger through the nouriſhment it takes; ſo our faith is weake at
the firſt; and by the uſe of good meanes it groweth ſtronger and ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
<hi>Iudges.</hi> 6. we ſee how weake <hi>Gideons</hi> faith was at the firſt; and ſo the
diſciples of Chriſt, their faith was ſo weake at the firſt, that Chriſt did
reprove them for it.<note place="margin">Note.</note> Now the faith of the world, that doth not begin
in weakeneſſe, but it is as ſtrong the firſt day, as it is many yeares after:
there is no doubting of Gods mercy; they leape into the full aſſurance
of faith at the firſt; and therefore this cannot bee true faith, for this
beginnes in weakeneſſe, and after by little and little it comes to the full
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:17958:17"/>
aſſurance of faith. Even as a man that climbes up to the top of a tree,
he catcheth hold firſt on the lower boughs, and ſo by little and little
he windes himſelfe into the Tree, till at laſt he comes at the top; ſo
wee come not to the full aſſurance of faith at firſt, but wee muſt winde
our ſelves into it, by prayer, meditation, conference, and ſuch like duties,
till wee come unto the full aſſurance thereof. It is the bold preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the world, that they thinke they ſhall bee ſaved, as ſoone as
they looke into Religion, when as it comes onely by the uſe of good
meanes many a day together.</p>
               <p>The third point wherby wee may diſcerne true faith from the faith
of the world,<note place="margin">The third triall of true Faith.</note> 
                  <hi>That it groweth,</hi> although it begins in weakeneſſe, yet it
growes by the uſe of the good meanes that it was gotten by, as by prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
of the Word, prayer, and ſuch like good meanes: as the Apoſtle
ſhewes 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 13. <hi>For this cauſe alſo thanke wee God without ceaſing, that
when ye received the Word of God, ye received it not as the word of man, but as
it is indeede the Word of God, which worketh in you which beleeve.</hi> The graces
of God are compared to a little ſeede, and not to a ſtone, for that ſtands
at a ſtay: Now true faith groweth, by the uſe of good meanes: ſo we
ſee, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1. <hi>As new borne babes deſire the ſincere milke of the word that
ye may grow thereby.</hi> The faith of the world doth not grow, but keepes
at a ſtay, and doth not increaſe by the preaching of Gods word, and
prayer, and by the uſe of good meanes, therefore it cannot be true faith;
if a man hath a little child, and they feede it and give it meate, and the
child grows not therby, but ſtands at a ſtay they may ſay it is a change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
but this is not alwayes true. It is obſerved to bee a judgement of
God to reſtraine the bleſſing of foode; although it be not alwaies true in
this, yet it is true in our faith, if it keepe at a ſtay, and doe not grow, when
there is good meanes, it is no true faith, no better than a changeling.</p>
               <p>The fourth point whereby wee may diſcerne of true faith from the
faith of the world is,<note place="margin">The fourth triall of true Faith.</note> 
                  <hi>By the qualities of the perſon in whom it is found,</hi> for
it is not found, but in a heart bruiſed and broken with ſinne, as <hi>Acts</hi> 2.
<hi>they were pricked in their hearts;</hi> and in <hi>Acts</hi> 16. <hi>the Iayler</hi> there <hi>trembled;</hi>
ſo that true faith is alwayes in a heart broken and bruiſed for ſinne.
Now in the faith of the world there is no compunction nor ſorrow for
ſinne, they never mourne nor grieve for it, therefore becauſe it is not
found in a heart bruiſed and broken, it cannot be true faith, they bee as
merry at the firſt, as at the laſt day. If a Phyſitian ſhould tell us that ſuch
a herbe would helpe us againſt all Infections whatſoever, but it alwayes
growes in a watery place, and hee ſhould tell us that there is another
herbe like that in colour, ſtalke, leafe, ſmell, and in bloſſome, but it
groweth on a rocke, or on a ſtone wall; if wee ſhould finde ſuch an
herbe on a rocke, or on a ſtone wall, wee could not ſay it were that
which would preſerve us againſt the infection, becauſe it groweth not
in a watery place: even ſo the heavenly Phyſitian hath told us that true
ſaving faith doth alwayes grow in a heart that is broken and bruiſed for
ſinne, in a watery conſcience, and therefore if wee find one like it in
in all things, and find it on a rocke, or on a ſtone wall; if we find it in
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:17958:18"/>
an impenitent and hard heart, and a heart never touched for ſinne, this
is not the true faith. Wee read that <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> brought a boxe
of coſtly oyntment to Chriſt, and broke her boxe, and powred it our,
which Chriſt did accept of; all other oyntments are beſt in a whole
boxe, but this oyntment of faith Chriſt doth not accept, but in a broken
boxe, in a heart broken for ſinne, and becauſe the world hath not their
faith in a broken boxe, in an heart broken for ſinne, therefore Chriſt
doth not accept of it.</p>
               <p>The fifth point whereby wee may diſcerne true faith from the faith
of the world is,<note place="margin">The fifth triall of true Faith.</note> 
                  <hi>by the oppoſition that is made against it in all true beleevers.</hi>
The corrupt nature of man is ready to oppoſe againſt it, ſo that we ſhall
have much adoe to hold our faith, and to keepe it. By experience eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man may finde this in himſelfe, that even when temptations ceaſe,
hee ſhall have much adoe to holde and keepe his faith, therefore in
the <hi>Revelation</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>Hold fast that which thou hast, and let no man
take away thy crowne.</hi> And in <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>de, Strive for the maintenance of faith, once
given to the Saints.</hi> Let a man attend to preaching, prayer, and the uſe
of good meanes, yet hee ſhall have much adoe to hold his faith, but it
is an eaſie matter to hold the faith of the world, there is no oppoſition
made againſt it, and therefore it is not the true and ſaving faith. One
oppoſition againſt true faith is ſinne, for this alwayes weakens faith in
a true beleever; ſo in <hi>Pſalme</hi> 51. Wee ſee <hi>Davids</hi> faith was weakened
by the reaſon of his ſinnes, <hi>Cast mee not away from thy preſence;</hi> and ſo
likewiſe <hi>Iob</hi> 13. 26. his faith ſtaggered by the meanes of his ſinnes, ſaith
hee, <hi>Thou writest bitter things againſt mee, and makeſt mee to poſſeſſe the Iui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities
of my youth.</hi> But the faith of the world is not weakened by ſinne,
for although they commit never ſo many ſinnes and grievous, yet their
faith is not weakened, but it is as ſtrong as ever it was, and as confident
in God; and therefore this faith is not true faith.</p>
               <p>The ſixth point whereby wee may diſcerne true faith from the faith
of the world,<note place="margin">The ſixth triall of true Faith.</note> is, <hi>by the power of faith; for whatſoever they ſuffer or endure,
they bee contented with it,</hi> and labour to quiet themſelves with the good
will of God. This wee ſee in <hi>Iob, Though thou killeſt mee, yet will I truſt in
thee:</hi> And ſo the good Theefe, <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>k.</hi> 23. <hi>We are indeed righteouſly here, for
wee receive things worthy of that wee have done:</hi> ſo they never murmur, nor
grudge at it, but quiet themſelves with the good will of God. Now
there is no ſuch matter in the faith of the world, for let trouble come,
and they bee at their wits end, they have no comfort in God, nor in
Chriſt, and therefore it is no true faith. The <hi>Philoſophers</hi> tell us, how
wee ſhould know true gold from that which the <hi>Alchymiſts</hi> make, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it cannot be diſcerned by the colour, touch, or by the weight,
yet take it in extremitie, and it will comfort the heart, it is cordiall:
but counterfeit gold will not: And even ſo wee may diſcerne of true
faith, from the faith of the world, for in extremitie it is cordiall, it will
comfort the heart.</p>
               <p>The ſeventh ſigne whereby wee may diſcerne true faith from the
faith of the world is,<note place="margin">The ſeventh tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of true Faith,</note> 
                  <hi>by the companions of faith,</hi> and holy traine that doth
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:17958:18"/>
attend it: and they bee five.<note place="margin">By five Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</note> Firſt, <hi>Ioy unſpeakable and glorious,</hi> that God
hath given us faith whereby wee may bee ſaved,<note place="margin">The first Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of true Faith.</note> and that hee will
reſpect us; never was any child ſo glad of his fathers lands, and livings,
and of that his father did bequeath him, as they are glad, that God hath
bequeathed Chriſt, life and eternall happineſſe unto them: ſo wee ſee
<hi>Paul, Epheſ.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>Bleſſed be God, even the Father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, which
hath bleſſed us with all bleſſings in heavenly things.</hi> And 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 1. 3. <hi>Bleſſed bee
God even the Father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, which according to his abundant
mercy, hath begotten us againe unto a lively hope, by the reſurrection of Ieſus
Chriſt from the dead, to an inheritance immortall, undefiled. &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 2. companion in the traine of faith is,<note place="margin">The ſecond Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion of true Faith.</note> 
                  <hi>Holy admiration and admiring
and wondering at the kindneſſe and mercie of God, that hath refuſed others and
choſen us,</hi> that he hath made of us that were ſlaves, ſervants; of ſervants,
ſonnes; of ſonnes, heires, and heires with his ſonne Chriſt, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. As
<hi>Iudas</hi> ſaith there, <hi>What is the cauſe that thou ſheweſt thy ſelfe to us, and not
unto the world.</hi> Even ſo wee may admire and wonder at the kindneſſe,
and mercie of God, why hee ſhould ſhew himſelfe unto us, and paſſe by
others that be better than we.</p>
               <p>The third companion in the traine of faith is,<note place="margin">The third Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion of true Faith.</note> 
                  <hi>Exceeding love to God.</hi>
Seeing he hath done ſo much for us, we cannot doe too much for him,
and therefore we muſt be ready to do his will in all things that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth.</p>
               <p>The fourth companion in the traine of faith is <hi>Forſaking of the world;</hi>
and to lay all downe at the feete of Chriſt,<note place="margin">The fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion of true Faith.</note> and to be contented that hee
ſhould diſpoſe of our health, and of our goods, and of our lives, and to
ſay with <hi>David here am I, doe as it pleaſeth thee;</hi> diſpoſe of my health and
of my goods, and of my life, I am contented with it.</p>
               <p>The fifth companion in the traine of faith is, <hi>A deſire to have a more
neere conjunction with Chriſt in heaven,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The fifth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panton of true Faith.</note> whereby men are contented to
leave all behinde, and to goe with him, and much more will it bee when
wee ſhall live with him, for ever and ever: and therefore the Apoſtle
deſireth to be with him,<note place="margin">Phil. 3.</note> ſaying, <hi>I deſire to be diſſolved, and to be with Chriſt:</hi>
but the faith of the world hath not ſuch companions, and ſuch a traine
to attend it. If a Lady comes to a poore mans houſe, how ſhall wee
know whether ſhee be there ſtill, and ſee her not? wee may know it by
her traine, and thoſe that attend her; although we ſee her not, yet if we
ſee her traine, it is certaine ſhe is there ſtill: and even ſo a man may
know whether there be faith in his heart or no, although he cannot ſee
it; if there be the companions and traine of faith, then it is certaine
that there is faith ſtill. Therefore every man ſhould try and examine
himſelfe by theſe ſignes, whether hee hath true faith or no, that hee
may not be deceived, for wee all ſhall die at the time appointed, either
ſooner or later, and if wee have it not, wee are like to periſh for ever;
for wee muſt ſtand before God, and the divell and our conſciences will
bee ready to accuſe us for our ſinnes, and then if wee have not Faith to
ſtand by us, and to pull out a bagge of the merits of Chriſt for us, a
pardon ſealed with his blood, we ſhal ſurely be condemned at that day.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:17958:19"/>
The uſes are foure, ſeeing true Faith is accompanyed with ſuch a
traine,<note place="margin">Foure uſes.</note> and with ſuch companions.</p>
               <p>Firſt, to rejoyce in God. Secondly, to admire at the mercy of God.
Thirdly, to love God. Fourthly, to forſake the world. Fifthly, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
a more neere conjunction with God.</p>
               <p>Now the Faith of the world hath not this traine nor abundance, and
therefore let us take heed that wee bee not deceived with a falſe Faith,
inſtead of the true Faith. If a man were to paſſe into another countrey,
and hee ſhould put his whole eſtate into a ſhip, even all that ever
hee hath; if hee ſhould eſpie a leake in the ſhip, how affraid would hee
bee to adventure his goods: this were but to hazard goods; but if a
man hath a fault in his Faith, hee doth not adventure his goods, and
hazard them, but hee doth hazard his ſoule. And therefore take heed
thou bee not deceived with a falſe Faith; a poore man may dwell in his
houſe all Summer, and may thinke hee is as well as they that dwell in a
better houſe, but when Winter comes, and it raines into his houſe in
twenty places, ſo as hee cannot bee at reſt in it, then hee ſeeth his error:
ſo a man thinkes himſelfe as well that hath but a counterfeit, as he that
hath a true Faith; all the ſummer time of his life, but when the winter,
death, and the judgement day comes, then hee ſhall ſee his error: and
therefore let us labour that wee may have true Faith whiles wee live
heere, leſt wee be condemned then.</p>
               <p>Now the next thing we are to handle by order &amp;<note place="margin">Three degrees of Faith.</note> courſe is the degrees
of Faith. There is not only one meaſure and degree, but there be diverſe
degrees of it, the two Cherubines in the temple were all of one ſize and
meaſure, but there be diverſe degrees thereof according to the ſeverall
growths of Faith:<note place="margin">1 2 3</note> now there are three degrees of it: firſt, <hi>Weake Faith.</hi>
Secondly, <hi>ſtrong Faith.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>full aſſurance of Faith.</hi> So the Apoſtle,
1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 12. ſhews the three degrees of it, according to the three ages of
men, by <hi>babes, young men,</hi> and by <hi>old men;</hi> by babes weake Faith, by young
men ſtrong Faith, by old men the full aſſurance of Faith. Now weake
Faith is accompanied with much wandering and doubting, and yet
there muſt bee in it an apprehenſion of the promiſe made unto us in
Chriſt; but it is ſo accompanied with wandering and doubting, that
ſometimes it cannot tell whether it doe or no: even like the ſmoaking
flaxe that lieth ſmoaking and paddering, that it cannot bee diſcerned
whether there bee any fire or no, but by the ſmoaking: ſo there may be
ſuch weake apprehenſion of the promiſes of God made unto us in
Chriſt, that wee can hardly diſcerne whether there bee any Faith or
no.</p>
               <p>I,<note place="margin">Object. Sol.</note> but there is weakneſſe in all, even in the ſtrongeſt.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, there is great difference betweene a ſtrong man weakened
by ſickneſſe, and the weakeneſſe of a child, ſo there is a great difference
betweene the Faith of a ſtrong Chriſtian weakened by ſinne, and
the weakeneſſe of Faith in a new beginner,<note place="margin">First, weake Faith in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> a childe in religion: and
of this weakneſſe there <hi>bee two reaſons:</hi> firſt, weakneſſe of judgement:
Secondly, weakneſſe of apprehenſion. Firſt, weakneſſe in judgement:
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:17958:19"/>
ſo wee ſee the diſciples of Chriſt, how weake their judgement was in
regard of knowledge, that they did not beleeve one of the articles of
Faith, they did not beleeve the reſurrection of the dead; the Evangeliſt
<hi>Marke</hi> ſhewes, and ſo likewiſe in <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. how weake the Faith of the
<hi>Samaritane</hi> in regard of her knowledge: and ſo of <hi>Rahab,</hi> her faith was
weake in judgement, for ſhe had heard of the wonders that were done
in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and had a deſire to bee joyned to the people of God; and this
is the weake Faith that is here ſpoken of,<note place="margin">weakneſſe of Faith in appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion.</note> 
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 10. The ſecond is
weakneſſe in apprehenſion of the promiſes of God, that it is not able
to apply Chriſt unto it ſelfe, one would doe it, but hee cannot, hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves
there is a pardon for his ſinnes, if hee could apply Chriſt, and yet
he cannot doe it: ſo we ſee <hi>Iohn</hi> 20. what a long time it was ere <hi>Thomas</hi>
could apply Chriſt to him, and ſay, <hi>hee was his Lord and his God:</hi> ſo it is
long ere a Chriſtian can apply the promiſes of Chriſt unto himſelfe.
Now this is weake Faith, and this weakneſſe of Faith is in all belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
beginnes in weakneſſe, and therefore none ought to bee diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
although they cannot apply Chriſt to themſelves, becauſe weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of Faith is in all; and if thou be ſtronger in Faith than thy brother,
doe not exclude or diſcourage him, but labour by all meanes to nouriſh,
and to ſtrengthen it: ſo the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>him that is weake in the Faith,
receive unto thee:</hi> and ſo likewiſe <hi>Zecharie</hi> 4. 10. <hi>For who hath deſpiſed the
day of ſmall things?</hi> and therefore if it be but the ſmalleſt and the leaſt
that may bee, labour to nouriſh and encreaſe it: the reaſon is, becauſe
the leaſt meaſure of true Faith is able to ſave us, for if a man hath but as
much true Faith as a graine of muſtard ſeede, it is able to worke won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
<hi>to remove mountaines,</hi> as wee ſee, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17. We ſee in experience,
that the hand of a little child is able to lay hold of a bagge of gold,
when the father giveth it, indeed the hand of a ſtrong man is able to take
it out of the hand of the father, but yet the hand of a child can lay hold
of it: Even ſo weake Faith may lay hold of the promiſes of God, as well
as ſtrong faith, although it doth not ſo ſtrongly apply Chriſt: as <hi>Num.</hi> 21
when the people were bitten with the fiery ſerpents, there was a brasen
ſerpent ſet upon a pole, that ſo many as being bitten looked upon it,
ſhould be healed, which did not only help the ſtrongeſt, but the weakeſt
ſighted alſo, if they were able but to caſt up their eyes to it; and not
onely ſo, but thoſe that lay on their ſicke beds in the tents, if they were
able but to eſpy him at a litle chinke or creviſe, they were healed. So not
only they that have the ſtrongeſt Faith are ſaved, but even thoſe that
have but a weake alſo, yea although they lye on their death-beds, yet
if they can but eſpie Chriſt by the eye of Faith at a little chinke or cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe,
they ſhall be ſaved. But how may wee know weake Faith, from
no Faith? I anſwer, it may be knowne foure waies:</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Foure trialls of weake from no Faith.</note> 
                  <hi>When it is attended with good deſires.</hi> That a man hath a deſire to
beleeve, to repent, to doe the will of God, but cannot, as <hi>David</hi> ſaith,
<hi>I deſire to doe thy will, O God,</hi> although I cannot; ſo wee ſee weake Faith
is attended with good deſires, therefore where there be not theſe good
deſires, there is not weake Faith, but no Faith. I, but are there not good
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:17958:20"/>
deſires in ſome that have not true Faith?<note place="margin">Quest. Sol.</note> I anſwer, <hi>Balaam</hi> hee had good
deſires, <hi>hee deſired to die the death of the righteous,</hi> ſo then there be deſires
in both, but the deſires of weake Faith have theſe three properties:
firſt, <hi>they bee earneſt and ſervent:</hi> ſecondly, <hi>conſtant and ſetled:</hi> thirdly,
<hi>actuall and lively.</hi> Firſt,<note place="margin">Three trialls of a right deſire.</note> 
                  <hi>they bee earneſt,</hi> they cannot bee at reſt, till they
have the thing they deſire. Even as a child that is hungry, nothing will
content him,<note place="margin">1</note> till hee have meate, give him this and that thing,
yet will hee not bee quiet till hee hath foode; ſo it is with a Chriſtian,
nothing will content him till hee hath Chriſt, and the pardon of his
ſinnes, and aſſurance of his ſalvation, he cannot be at reſt.</p>
               <p>The ſecond propertie is,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>That they bee conſtant and ſetled deſires.</hi> They
give not over, till they have the things they deſire: many have deſires
but they bee floating and unſetled; they give over before they have
the thing that they deſire: where there are ſuch deſires, there is not
weake Faith, but no Faith.</p>
               <p>The third propertie is,<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>That they bee lively and actuall;</hi> they bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to take any paines and labour, for to have the things that they
deſire. In the <hi>Proverbes</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>The ſluggard hee luſteth, and yet he hath
not:</hi> what wants hee? hee hath deſires, but he is loth to take any paines
or labour, to come by that which hee deſireth, and therefore he goeth
without. But the deſires of a Chriſtian bee lively, will put them upon
any paines and labor, they will not ſticke at any thing ſo that they may
have the things that they deſire.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ſigne whereby we may know that wee have weake Faith
from no Faith is,<note place="margin">The ſecond triall of weake Faith.</note> 
                  <hi>That it worketh according to the meaſure of weakneſſe:</hi> as
<hi>Matt.</hi> 8. when the <hi>Diſciples</hi> were in the ſhip, and in danger of drowning,
they goe to Chriſt, and cry unto him, <hi>Helpe, Master wee periſh:</hi> Chriſt
doth not reprove them, becauſe they had no Faith, but becauſe they
had but little Faith, it was but weake, and yet thiſ weake Faith did
worke in them, and drove them to Chriſt to cry to him for helpe; this
was true Faith though weake: ſo if wee cry to Chriſt in extremity,
and ſeeke to him for helpe, there is true Faith, but when men ſeeke
to witches, (as <hi>Saul</hi> did) and ſorcerers for helpe, there is not weake
Faith, but no Faith.</p>
               <p>The third thing whereby we may know weake Faith from no Faith
is,<note place="margin">The third triall of weake Faith.</note> 
                  <hi>That it doth deſire to encreaſe, and to get ſtrength by the uſe of good meanes.</hi>
Even as a tree being ſet into the ground, it ſends downe its rootes, and
ſpreads them this way and that way to get ſtrength and nouriſhment
unto it ſelfe, that it may grow: ſo weake Faith, it doth deſire to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
by all good meanes, by prayer, preaching, the uſe of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
reading, and ſuch like things. So wee ſee the Diſciples came to
Chriſt, and ſay, <hi>Lord, encreaſe our Faith.</hi> And the man in the Goſpell,
<hi>I beleeve, Lord helpe my unbeleefe:</hi> So wee ſee weake Faith, that deſires to
encreaſe, and therefore if we doe not deſire to encreaſe our Faith, there
is not weake Faith, but no Faith.</p>
               <p>The fourth thing whereby we may know weake Faith from no Faith
is,<note place="margin">The fourth triall of weake Faith.</note> 
                  <hi>That it is ready to lay hold upon every little helpe</hi> even as the vine is ready
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:17958:20"/>
to catch hold of every poſt, and every wall, and every ſticke, and ſprig
with her, &amp; windes about it, to reſt upon it: even ſo true Faith laies hold
on every little helpe, and every little word: as <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. It was but a little
word, and a ſowre word, that Chriſt ſpake to <hi>Marie, Woman, my houre
is not yet come;</hi> and yet the Faith of <hi>Marie</hi> laid hold upon it, for ſhee did
beleeve that hee had his houre, for ſhe ſaith after to the the ſervants, <hi>what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
hee biddeth you doe, that doe yee.</hi> And ſo in <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. It was but
a word that Chriſt ſpake to the woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and a ſowre word it
was too, <hi>It is not lawfull to take the childrens bread, and to give it unto dogs,</hi>
and yet her Faith laid hold of it: and therefore what ſhal we ſay of the
Faith of the world? Doe they profit by the meanes God giveth them?
hath not God ſent his mercies and his judgements amongst us? wee
have preaching and teaching, and yet wee doe not lay hold of it, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
by it, be not brought to walke conſcionablie before God: ſhall
wee ſay, there is weake Faith in us? Nay there is no Faith, for weake
Faith will grow and encreaſe, and lay hold upon every little meanes
of helpe.</p>

therein, the neerer wee come to Gods preſence,
and a view of his love in Chriſt: even as a man
aſcending up ſome ſteepe high hill. The firſt ſtep
he ſees ſomewhat, when he is higher he ſees more, but when he is at the
top of the hill, then he ſees the whole Countrie round about him, flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
length, breadth, Latitude both of Sea and Land. So when wee
have weake Faith, we ſee ſomewhat, when ſtrong Faith, we ſee more;
but when wee come to the full aſſurance of Faith, to the top of the
hill as it were, then wee ſee the length and breadth of Gods love in
Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Hauing ſpoken of weake Faith, and how it may bee diſcerned, wee
are now come in the next place to ſpeake of ſtrong Faith; which is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
degree of Faith: but firſt by your patience, I deſire to ſhew you
ſome trialls and markes how a man ſhall diſcover his weakeneſſe of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:17958:21"/>
Faith: for every man that would know this weakeneſſe muſt doe theſe
two things; he muſt labour</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. To finde it out.</item>
                  <item>2. To helpe it as ſoone as may be.</item>
               </list>
               <p>First,<note place="margin">The firſt triall of weake Faith.</note> one ſhall finde and know weakeneſſe of Faith in himſelfe, <hi>when
hee doubteth of the favour of God,</hi> that hee cannot rejoyce, nor have his
heart made glad with it, and ſtandeth in doubt of his own ſalvation: this
doth ſhew weakneſſe of Faith, as <hi>Peter, Mat.</hi> 14. 30. <hi>When he ſaw the wind
ariſe, hee was afraid</hi> of drowning; which did ſhew weakneſſe of Faith in
him: ſo <hi>Iames</hi> 1. 6. ſaith hee, <hi>But let him aske in Faith, and waver not:</hi> ſo
then if a man aske any thing at Gods hand, and ſtandeth in doubt of it,
here is weake Faith.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing whereby wee may know weake Faith in our
ſelves is,<note place="margin">The ſecond triall of it.</note> 
                  <hi>when wee truſt God for one thing, and not for another;</hi> when wee
truſt God for the ſaving of our ſoules, but not for the feeding and cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of our bodies, and of the ſaving of them. So <hi>Abraham</hi> he beleeved
God in one thing &amp; doubted in another, he beleeved God for the ſaving
of his ſoule, but doubted of a child, as wee ſee, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. And <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.
the diſciples were afraid that their bodies ſhould periſh: and therefore
when wee truſt God for one thing, and will not for another: this doth
ſhew weakneſſe of Faith in us; or if wee truſt him in one trouble, and
when another is comming faint, this is weakneſſe of Faith.</p>
               <p>The third thing whereby wee may know weakneſſe of Faith in our
ſelves is,<note place="margin">The third triall of it.</note> 
                  <hi>When we are comfortable to our ſelves in time of peace, but faint
hearted in the time of trouble:</hi> as it is, <hi>Proverbs</hi> 24. 10. <hi>If thou faint in the
day of adversity, thy ſtrength is but small.</hi> If a man come to a tree and shake
it with his finger, this way and that way, it doth ſhew that the tree is
not well rooted: even ſo when the leaſt trouble that comes, unjoynts,
vexes, and ſhakes us on euery side: it ſhewes that we are not well rooted
and grounded in Faith.</p>
               <p>The fourth thing whereby wee may diſcerne weakneſſe of ſaith in
our ſelves is,<note place="margin">The fourth triall of it.</note> 
                  <hi>When wee beleeve God can helpe us, but it muſt bee by ſuch and
ſuch meanes;</hi> So <hi>Iarus</hi> beleeved Chriſt would helpe his daughter, but
it muſt bee by touching and laying on his hands, as wee ſee, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.
this was weake faith to beleeve that Chriſt can helpe, but it muſt bee by
ſuch and ſuch meanes. And ſo in <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. The diſciples beleeved that
Chriſt could feed five thouſand, but they muſt have two hundred pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
worth of bread for to doe it withall: So likewiſe, <hi>Moſes</hi> beleeved
that God could give him water enough for the children of Iſrael, but
not out of a rocke, but it muſt bee out of the river, this then is weakneſſe
of faith, to beleeve that God can helpe us, but it muſt bee by such and
ſuch meanes.</p>
               <p>The fift thing whereby wee may know weakneſſe of faith is,<note place="margin">The fift triall of it.</note> 
                  <hi>By the
effects of faith, when they bee weake in us;</hi> as in the booke of <hi>Iudges</hi> wee see
how <hi>Sampſon</hi> did know he was growne weak, and that his ſtrength was
departed from him, it was by the weaknes of his actions, not being able
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:17958:21"/>
to reſiſt the <hi>Philiſtimes</hi> as formerly; ſo may we know weakneſſe of faith
in our ſelves, when wee bee weake in our actions, in our prayers, and in
the performance of other holy duties, therefore howſoever men talke
of ſtrong faith, if they bee weake in the performance of holy duties,
and are not ſtrong to ſtand againſt the temptations of the divell and to
reſiſt them, it is but weake faith.</p>
               <p>The uſe of this is,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> that if we finde weake faith in our ſelves, we muſt
take accompt of it, labour to bee humbled for it, and to ſay with <hi>David
Pſal.</hi> 6. <hi>I am weake,</hi> but Lord, helpe my weakneſſe: and as the man in
the Goſpell ſaid, <hi>Lord I beleeve, but helpe thou mine unbeleefe,</hi> Lord, I have
weakneſſe of faith, but Lord, helpe this weakneſſe of faith in me.</p>
               <p>The ſecond uſe is,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> that if wee find weakneſſe of faith in our ſelves,
we ſhould labour to ſtrengthen it by the uſe of good meanes, by praier,
reading, preaching, and by ſuch like meanes. Wee know if a poore
man dwell in a rotten houſe, if the wind ariſe, hee will get props and
ſhoares to underprop it, that ſo hee may keepe it from falling: ſo ſeeing
wee dwell in rotten houſes, if the winds of temptations ariſe, we ſhould
labour to prop up our faith by the uſe of good meanes, by preaching,
prayer, the uſe of the Sacraments, and ſuch like, that ſo wee may bee
able to ſtand in the time of temptation; for (as we have heard before)
faith is compared to a ſeed and not to a ſtone, becauſe a ſeed will grow
to be a tree, but a ſtone groweth not: and therfore if we uſe good means,
and doe not grow by it, it is to be ſuſpected, it is not weake, but no faith;
for where true faith is, although it be weake, yet it growes to bee
ſtronger by the uſe of good meanes: ſtrong faith never doubteth of
ſalvation, and the pardon of ſinnes; unleſſe it bee in the time of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and doth aſſure it ſelfe of ſalvation, and of the pardon of ſinnes by
a ſylogiſticall reaſon, the ground whereof is laid in the word of God,
thus it may be framed,<note place="margin">Argument.</note> God hath ſaid in his word, that whoſoever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penteth
and beleeveth ſhall undoubtedly be ſaved; this is the great
ground and maxime whereon ſtrong faith doth ſtay it ſelfe, which is
built on the word of God: then the true beleeving heart, ſaith, Lord,
but I upon the ſearch of my conſcience doe find that I doe truly repent
and beleeve; and then the concluſion ariſeth, therefore I ſhall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
and certainely be ſaved.</p>
               <p>The papiſts say, that we cannot be aſſured of the padon of our ſinnes
and of the ſalvation of our ſoules here in this life, but I would have
them to anſwer me theſe two reaſons; the firſt is, <hi>That whatſoever God
hath ſpoken in his word,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>wee are bound to beleeve it under the conduct and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of faith;</hi> but God hath ſaid in his word, that whoſoever repenteth
and beleeveth, is bound by the certainty of his word, and of his faith to
beleeve his ſalvation, and the pardon of his ſinnes.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, <hi>That whatſoever we are bound to pray for, that we are bound
to beleeve,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2</note> but wee are bound to pray for the pardon of our ſinnes, and
for our ſalvation, as wee may ſee in the fifth petition of the Lords
Prayer, therefore wee are bound to beleeve it. Now ſtrong faith
is not ſo ſtrong, but that it may bee ſhrewdly ſhaken in the time
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:17958:22"/>
of temptation, as <hi>Davids</hi> faith was, hee ſaith, <hi>I am cast out of thy
preſence;</hi> and ſo <hi>Peter</hi> was ſhaken for the time, and yet Christ had <hi>prayed
that his faith might not faile him;</hi> therefore wee ſee that ſtrong faith
may bee ſhaken, and weakned, of which there bee theſe occaſions or
reaſons.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Foure Reaſons why our Faith is ſhaken.</note> 
                  <hi>Becauſe we have given way to ſome sinne,</hi> and have not been watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to keepe the doores of our hearts ſhut againſt it but given way unto
it; this will weaken ſtrong faith: a man that is ſtrong may catch a cold
or a ſurfeit,<note place="margin">1</note> and be made ſo weake, that hee cannot bee able to goe with
a ſtaffe; ſo a man may catch a cold, that is, hee may commit ſome ſinne,
that hee may make his faith ſo weake, that hee ſhall not bee able to ſtirre
or feele any comfort, in reſpect of his offence that hee hath done.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>By the neglecting of the uſe of good meanes,</hi> as preaching, prayer,
reading,<note place="margin">2</note> and ſuch like, ſo it may become weake, <hi>Mark.</hi> 3. wee read,
<hi>there was a man that had a withered hand,</hi> the reaſon whereof was, becauſe
there were obſtructions in the veines, that it could not carry downe
nouriſhment to that hand which withered; ſo when there be obstructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that doe hinder us, that we cannot draw downe nouriſhment to our
hearts by the uſe of good meanes, our faith will bee weakned, our
aſſurance withered and drie.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>The malice of the divell,</hi> for hee will doe as the <hi>Philiſtimes</hi> did
with <hi>Sampſon,</hi> knowing his ſtrength lay in his haire, they cut it off, and
hee became weake; ſo the divell doth, knowing that all the ſtrength
of a Chriſtian lyeth in his faith, therefore hee labours to weaken it,
as much as may be.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4</note> 
                  <hi>The wiſe providence of God to humble us,</hi> to make us take the
faſter hold; for all that the Lord doth is but to ſettle us, that wee
ſhould bee the deeper rooted. As a man when hee goeth to plant a tree,
when he hath ſet into the ground, and put earth about it, he doth ſhake
the tree this way and that way, as if hee would overthrow and pull it
up, yet all is but to ſettle it that it may ſtand the faſter: ſo the Lord
doth when hee hath planted a man, hee doth as it were pull at him, and
ſhake him, as if hee would pull him up, and yet the Lord doth it but to
ſettle, and ground him, that hee ſhould ſtand the faſter, and to make
him the more conſtant, and therefore the people of God have no cauſe
to be diſcouraged with the dealing of God.</p>
               <p>Now come we to ſpeake of ſtrong faith which doth ordinarily aſſure
a man of ſalvation, and of the pardon of ſinnes, unleſſe it be in the time
of temptation: if therefore any man would know how he comes to this
aſſurance, and what the ground is, that ſtrong faith gathereth this
aſſurance upon:<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> I anſwer, that it gathereth it from the merits &amp; dignity
of the death of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> for Chriſt and the Croſſe were our pledge and
pawne; looke what wee ſhould have ſuffered, that Chriſt hath ſuffered
for uſ in our place, and in our roome, when all our ſinnes were imputed
to him; therefore Chriſts ſufferings were as much in acceptation with
God, as if wee ſhould have ſuffered our ſelves, ſo that wee are thereby
diſcharged and acquitted. Now from this ground ſtrong faith doth
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:17958:22"/>
draw aſſurance of Salvation, and of the pardon of ſinnes by looking
backe into the merits of Chriſts death: Indeed, if wee looke into our
ſelves, and our ſinnes; wee can aſſure our ſelves of nothing but death,
hell, and damnation, but if we looke into the merit and dignitie of the
death of Chriſt, then faith aſſureth us of Salvation and pardon of
ſinnes.</p>
               <p>The Papiſts ſay,<note place="margin">Object.</note> that a man cannot have aſſurance of the pardon of
ſinnes, and aſſurance of Salvation here in this life, for this openeth a
window (ſay they) to all diſorder and looſeneſſe of living.</p>
               <p>But I answere, that there be two kindes of aſſurance; the firſt <hi>abſolute,</hi>
the ſecond <hi>conditionall:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sol. Two ſorts of aſſurance of Salvation.</note> firſt, abſolute aſſurance, That whatſoever a man
doth, or howſoever a man liveth, yet he ſhall be ſaved; faith doth not
aſſure a man of Salvation, if he live in his ſinnes, and doe what he liſt or
thinke good, nay, hee is like to periſh if he doe ſo, and he ſeales up his
damnation; and therefore it is not abſolute aſſurance that we have by
faith. <hi>Conditionall aſſurance</hi> is that which the Goſpell teaches, that if we
repent for our ſinnes, lay hold on Chriſt by faith, if we beleeve, then we
may aſſure our ſelves that we ſhall be ſaved; but if wee have no care to
repent, to beleeve, nor to walke with God in newneſſe of life, then wee
cannot be ſaved. Therefore if men ſay they are ſure of Salvation, they
muſt looke that they have a right ground: If a man ſhould demand of
ſome to know how they ſhould be ſaved; and they anſwere, becauſe
we have not committed many ſinnes; others, becauſe wee have done no
harme to any body, or becauſe we heare the word of God: Al this were
nothing, till one can ground himſelfe on theſe two conditions, to repent
and beleeve; and ſo to make a logicall diſcourſe of Aſſurance to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
from this ground that God hath ſaid in his word, that whoſoever
repenteth and beleeveth ſhall bee ſaved; but I upon the ſearch of my
Conſcience doe finde that I have repented and doe beleeve, therefore I
ſhall be ſaved: untill a man (I ſay) can make this diſcourſe, he cannot be
aſſured of his Salvation, but when men have the aſſurance of Salvation
from this ground, and can make ſuch a diſcourſe unto themſelves, it is
not all the divels in hell that can plucke away this aſſurance from them.
This is a goodly comfort, that a man can aſſure himſelfe that hee ſhall
be ſaved, and that he is beloved of God, howſoever he be poore, ficke,
afflicted and troubled here in this life, yet he can be perſwaded that one
day he ſhall <hi>fit downe with Abraham, Iſaac, and Iacob in the kingdome of
heaven,</hi> and death muſt be the gate to let us in.</p>
               <p>If a man ſhould go a long and tedious journey, and in the way ſhould
meete with many inconveniences, yet if he knew hee ſhould be kindly
entertained at his journies end, this would comfort him; ſo wee all are
walking as it were a long journey here in the wilderneſſe of this world,
where although we meet with many diſcomforts, and troubles, yet let
us comfort our ſelves with this, that one day it will be bleſſed and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
with us, when we come at home, at our journies end, then Chriſt wil
gird himſelfe and ſerve us, and all the holy Patriarkes and Prophets
will be ready to entertaine us. This is it that may comfort us; ſo <hi>Iob</hi> was
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:17958:23"/>
comforted in the time of his trouble, <hi>Iob</hi> 19. 23. <hi>I know,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that my
Redeemer liveth;</hi> and howſoever I have trouble here, yet one day <hi>I ſhall
ſee God:</hi> ſo <hi>David, Psal.</hi> 27. 13. <hi>I ſhould have fainted, but that I beleeved to ſee
the goodneſſe of God in the land of the living.</hi> I ſhould have fainted, but that
for the hope of heaven, and of glory which upheld me: ſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 36.
where the Apoſtle ſaith, that the people of God <hi>were killed, and as ſheepe
appointed to the ſlaughter,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>yet in all theſe things, we are more than Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors;</hi>
for all theſe troubles they rejoyced and hoped in God excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly:
So he burſt out into this ſpeech in a holy triumph, and ſaith
there, <hi>I am perſwaded that neither death, nor life; nor principalities, nor powers,
nor things preſent, nor things to come, can ſeparate us from the love of God, which
is in Chriſt Ieſus our Lord.</hi> Now ſtrong faith you ſee is not ſo ſtrong, but
that in time of temptation it may bee ſhrewdly ſhaken; for as a ſtrong
man may catch a cold, and by diſ-dieting make himſelfe that he cannot
be able to walke with a ſtaffe: ſo a man may, as it were, catch a cold,
and diſ-diet himſelfe by his ſinnes, make himſelfe weake. So <hi>David</hi> was
confident in one part, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31. 14. <hi>But I truſted in the Lord; I ſaid, thou art
my God;</hi> and in another place of the ſame Pſalme, he ſaith, <hi>I am caſt out of
thy ſight:</hi> ſo <hi>Iob</hi> in one place was confident in peace, and rejoycing in
God, yet Chapter 17. he cryeth out, <hi>Where is my hope? for though I hope,
yet the grave ſhall be my house, and I will make my bed in the darke: I ſhall ſay
unto Corruption, thou art my father, and to the worme, thou art my mother and
my ſiſter: where is now my hope?</hi> So we ſee ſtrong faith is not ſo ſtrong but
that it may be ſhrewdly ſhaken, as ye have heard.</p>
               <p>Now ſome man may ſay,<note place="margin">Object.</note> If a man may loſe the feeling and comfort
of his aſſurance of Salvation, in the time of temptation, what Comfort
in this case can he have?</p>
               <p>I anſwer,<note place="margin">Anſw. Foure co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſorts in want of feeling aſſurance of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. The firſt.</note> a man may have comfort, conſidering theſe <hi>foure things:</hi>
Firſt, <hi>That there is alwayes a ſeede and a roote of faith left:</hi> though hee may
feele the loſſe of the comfortable aſſurance, yet there is the Sanctity,
and effects of faith ſtill, there is an hatred of ſinne, a love of goodneſſe, a
deſire of the preſence of God, and of his love and favour, which may
be his comfort. We read <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 10. that <hi>Eutichus fell out of a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
and was taken up dead, but Paul went downe, and fell upon him, and imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
him, ſaid, Trouble not your ſelves, for his life is in him:</hi> ſo we may ſay of
all the fals of Gods people, There is life in them; This may bee their
comfort, that in all their fals, there is a ſeed of faith, there is the ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of faith ſtill remaining in them, this muſt be their ſtay and comfort in
all their ſpirituall afflictions, and deſertions whatſoever.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is,<note place="margin">The ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</note> that <hi>although they loſe the feeling of Gods favour, yet it is
not perpetuall,</hi> but for a ſhort time: So it is ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55. <hi>Hee will not ſuffer
the righteous to fall for ever,</hi> and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94. 18. <hi>When I ſaid, my foote ſlippeth, thy
mercy, O Lord, held and ſtayed me up:</hi> Trees in a great winde are ſhaken, and
beate this way and that way, as if they would breake, but if the windes
goe downe and there bee a calme, they come to their former eſtate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine;
ſo it is in faith, in the time, of temptation we may be ſhaken, and
carried this way and that way, but when the temptation is at an end,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:17958:23"/>
wee come unto our former eſtate againe, and to as comfortable appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
of the Love of God, and of his favor as before. ſo <hi>Zech.</hi> 10. 6. the
Lord promiſed the ſame powerfull grace to his people, after their fals
as before, for ſaith he, <hi>And I will ſtrengthen the houſe of Iudah, and I will
preſerve the houſe of Ioſeph, and I will bring them againe; for I pittie them, and
they ſhall be as though I had not caſt them off, for I am the Lord their God, and
will heare them.</hi> And therefore ſeeing it is not perpetuall, but for a little
time this may comfort them, and glad their hearts.</p>
               <p>The third is,<note place="margin">The third com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</note> 
                  <hi>The wiſe providence of God, who diſpoſeth all things to the good
of his ſervants.</hi> A man ye know when he plants a tree, he caſteth moulds
about it, puls and ſhakes it this way and that way, and yet it is but to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
the tree; ſo the Lord doth when he plants a man, hee puls him this
way and that way, and all is but to ſettle him, that he may be the better
rooted and grounded; as it is <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28. <hi>All things worke together for the good
of thoſe that love God:</hi> Therefore let a man love God, and then all things
ſhall worke together for his good. There be ſtrange workes of God, and
ſome that ſeeme to bee againſt men, and yet by a ſecret hand of God,
they are all carried and worke together for the good of them that love
him: As ye ſee in a Clocke, there be ſome wheeles turne one way, and
ſome another way, and yet all tend to one end to make the Clocke goe
well; ſo ſometimes God ſends a man adverſity, and ſometimes proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
ſometimes he deales one way with us, ſometimes another, and yet
all is but to draw us neerer unto him in holineſſe and obedience.</p>
               <p>The fourth thing that may comfort them is,<note place="margin">The fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</note> 
                  <hi>that they cannot be at quiet
or at reſt till they have returned to the Lord againe;</hi> ſtill there is a thirſting of
the heart after God, and they cannot bee at reſt till they bee returned
againe: ſo we ſee <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 119. <hi>ver. ult.</hi> ſaith, <hi>I have gone aſtray like a
ſheepe that is loſt,</hi> oh ſeeke me; <hi>for I have not forgotten thy Commandements;</hi>
as a loſt ſheepe cannot be at reſt, but he runnes here and there, hee cries
to the ſheepheard, and is not at reſt and quiet till he be returned home
unto the ſheepfold; ſo the people of God, when they have gone aſtray,
cannot be at reſt till they have runne here and there, and cried to the
ſheepherd, they can never be at quiet till they be returned home unto
God; therefore ſo long as a man cannot be at quiet in his fals and ſinnes,
but that there is a thirſting of the heart after God, and hee takes no reſt
till he be returned,<note place="margin">Note.</note> this may give him comfort: We ſee in nature, that if
the ſhipmans needle be touched with the Loadſtone, it cannot be at reſt,
nor at quiet till it looke upon the North Pole, if it be hindred with any
little thing, it ſtandeth trembling and ſhaking, as if it were diſcontented;
ſo if a mans heart be touched and ſet a fire with faith in Chriſt, it doth
alwayes gather to Chriſt, and if it be hindred by any meanes, it is not at
reſt, but it is diſcontented, untill it come home to him: When a man is
in danger of drowning hee will fling out his armes, and catch hold of
every ſtraw to ſave himſelfe; ſo we ſhould doe, when wee perceive our
ſelves to be in danger of hell, we ſhould fling out our armes abroad, and
catch hold of Chriſt, and ſo ſave our ſelves.</p>
               <p>Now if any man ſhould aſke how he ſhould recover againe,<note place="margin">Quest.</note> when he
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:17958:24"/>
is in this eſtate:<note place="margin">Sol.</note> I anſwer, firſt, he muſt repent him of his ſinnes, and turne
to God.<note place="margin">1</note> Secondly, he muſt cry to God for his former falling; ſo we ſee
<hi>David</hi> did,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. ſaith he, <hi>Reſtore me to the joy of thy Salvation,</hi> and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.
<hi>Lord lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3</note> Thirdly, ſtrive againſt
the infidelitie of thy owne heart, as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42. ſaith he, <hi>Why art
thou caſt downe, O my ſoule? and why art thou thus diſquieted within me? waite
ſtill on God.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">4</note> Fourthly, to ſtrengthen our faith from the former mercies
and kindneſſe of God, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 29. <hi>The graces and gifts of God are without
Repentance:</hi> And in another place, <hi>Thoſe whom the Lord loveth, hee loveth
unto the end;</hi> and therefore if ever thou canſt approve to thine own heart,
that God hath loved thee, he will love thee ſtill unto the end.</p>
               <p>The third ſtep and degree of faith is,<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>The full aſſurance of faith;</hi> when a
man is at this top and degree,<note place="margin">Full aſſurance of Faith.</note> he is as it were at the top of the hill, for as
you know that a man being at the top of an hill hee may ſee the whole
countrey round about him, the latitude and length of it, both by ſea and
land; euen ſo when a man comes at this ſtep and degree of faith, he ſhal
ſee the latitude and length of Gods love in Chriſt, heaven open, and
Chriſt ready to receive him, the holy Apoſtles ready to carry his ſoule
into heaven, as <hi>Lazarus</hi> was, and all the Saints and Martyrs ready to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine
him. Now this Metaphor is taken from a ſhip at ſea, that hath
ſea roome enough, being paſt rockes and ſands, and ſo out of danger
ſaileth ſafely unto his appointed place: even ſo when a man is come to
the full aſſurance of faith, he is paſt all danger, he ſaileth ſafely towards
God, and joyfully even untill hee come to heaven. This is the moſt
joyfull and bleſſed eſtate that any man can have, or bee in here in this
life; but this is not the case of many, for a man comes to this by degrees,
and it is a long while ere he can attaine unto it, and many doe not feele
it untill the time of their death.</p>
               <p>Now having ſpoken of the degrees of faith, we will in the next place
ſpeake of the <hi>Effects</hi> and <hi>Fruits of faith;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 6.</note> for as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Faith
worketh by love;</hi> it is not idle in a man nor lyeth ſtill, but ſheweth it ſelfe
by good effects, and fruits, for there is nothing in the world can ſave a
man, no outward thing, neither circumciſion, nor uncircumciſion, but
only faith, which worketh by love: In a Clocke when the great wheele
ſtirres, all the little ones will ſtirre, becauſe they doe depend upon it;
ſo faith is the great wheele in the life of a Chriſtian, that if it be ſtirred,
it will move all the reſt of the wheeles, all the reſt of our graces. It is
ſaid <hi>Iames</hi> 2. <hi>Shew me thy faith:</hi> For many will talke and ſay they have
faith, but if you have faith, Oh thou man or woman, ſhew me thy faith,
make declaration of it, for if thou canſt not ſhew mee thy faith by good
effects and fruits, it is to be ſuſpected, that it is not true faith: If one lay a
little ſtraw on the aſhes, if there be any live-coles, they will catch hold
on the ſtraw; ſo if there be faith in us, it will ſhew it selfe by the fruites
and effects: <hi>Mat.</hi> 9. 2. it is ſaid, that Chriſt <hi>ſaw</hi> the faith of the ſicke man,
and of thoſe that brought him; why, could Chriſt ſee their faith? could
he ſee into their hearts? Yes: but hee ſaw alſo their faith, becauſe it did
ſhew it ſelfe by the effects &amp; fruits; wherefore if you have not a faith at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:17958:24"/>
with good fruits and good effects, it is not true faith. It is a good
obſervation of a learned man, ſaith he, A man that goeth upon a ladder
to ſerve a Maſon, he muſt have two hands, one to hold by, and another
to give up Morter, and Bricke, and ſuch like; ſo, ſaith he, a Chriſtian
muſt have two hands, hee muſt have the hand of faith to lay hold on
Chriſt, to ſave himſelfe, and hee muſt have the hand of charitie to give
out things to his brethren: So we ſee the faith of a Chriſtian muſt bee
attended with good effects and fruits, as yee have heard.</p>
               <p>Now the fruits and effects of faith are many, but I cannot ſtand to
ſhew you them all; and therefore I will onely point at the chiefe, which
the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> doth aime at, <hi>Hebrewes</hi> 11.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Effects of true. Faith.</note> 
                  <hi>that faith makes a man offer a better ſacrifice to God than others;</hi> this
is ſhewed by the example of <hi>Abel</hi> and <hi>Caine;</hi> the Apoſtle telleth us
that his was greater than <hi>Caines:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 1. it is ſaid, that <hi>Abel did offer
of the firſt fruits of his ſheepe, and of the fat of them, and Caine of the worſt;</hi>
they did both offer ſacrifice, what was that then that made the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence?
the Apoſtle telleth us that faith made the difference, for <hi>Abel</hi>
beleeved that God had pardoned his ſinnes, that God would ſave him
and bleſſe him, and beſtow upon him all things needfull in this life, and
heaven and happineſſe in the life to come, and therefore hee thought
nothing too good to offer unto God; but <hi>Caine</hi> he had not faith, he did
not beleeve that God would ſave him and bleſſe him, hee had no hope
of heaven, nor no hope of the pardon of his ſinnes, hee did not beleeve
that God did love him, and therefore hee thought any thing good
enough for God. So it is ſtill, faith doth make a man offer a better ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
and a greater than others; for when men beleeve that God hath
pardoned their ſins, that they ſhall be ſaved, enjoy heaven and happines,
bee bleſſed in this life, and in the life to come, then they thinke all the
ſervice that they doe is too little to ſuch a God that hath loved and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
ſuch bleſſings upon them, they ſatisfie others, yet they cannot
ſatisfie themſelves, becauſe God will infinitely acquit them; if they
had a thouſand bodies and ſoules, all were too little to doe ſervice unto
him. <hi>David</hi> ſaith in the 1 <hi>Chro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> 22. 14. <hi>Now behold, according to my po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty
have I prepared for the houſe of the Lord, an hundred thouſand talents
of gold, and a thouſand thouſand talents of ſilver, and of braſſe, and iron paſſing
weight, for it is in abundance; I have alſo prepared timber and ſtones:</hi> here
we ſee that <hi>David</hi> did accompt all this as nothing in regard of God. So
<hi>Matth.</hi> 26. <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> brought a coſtly boxe of oyntment, ſhe
broke her boxe, and powred forth her oyntment on Chriſt, ſhe thought
nothing too good or too deare for him: thus much Chriſt inſtructs us
in the Goſpell, <hi>that when wee have done all wee can, yet wee are unprofitable
ſervants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a good ſaying of S. <hi>Bernard;</hi> ſaith he, it is an infinite debt that we
owe unto God for our redemption; if all the lives of the ſons of <hi>Adam</hi>
were in one man, and all the vertues and good things that were in all the
<hi>Patriarkes</hi> and <hi>Prophets,</hi> and all the holy men, yet all were nothing to
doe ſervice unto him; yea ſaith hee, for mine owne part, I have but two
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:17958:25"/>
farthings to pay the Lord withall,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bernards</hi> two farthings.</note> and they bee farthings of the leaſt
ſize and meaſure, my body and my ſoule; nay indeed, ſaith hee, I have
but one farthing, and that is, <hi>my good heart, and my good will:</hi> thus faith
makes a man offer a better ſacrifice than others, becauſe the men of this
world doe not beleeve that their ſinnes bee pardoned, and have not
hope of heaven, they thinke a little will ſerve to pleaſe God, a little
prayer, repentance, and a little care; this doth ſhew that it is not true
faith, for if a man have true faith, hee cannot pray enough, bee carefull
enough, take too much paines, all will bee too little that hee doth in
the ſervice of God.</p>
               <p>The ſecond effect of faith is,<note place="margin">The ſecond effect of true Faith.</note> 
                  <hi>that it maketh a man exceeding carefull to
pleaſe God, and to walke with him:</hi> as is ſhewed in the example of <hi>Henoch,</hi>
of whom it is reported, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5. 24. that hee pleaſed God in his courſes,
for hee beleeved that hee ſhould loſe nothing, but bee well rewarded
for it, it was not in vaine to walke with God, to please him, and praiſe
him: ſo it is ſtill, if a man beleeve that God is a rewarder of all them that
ſeeke unto him, they will let all goe, and deſire to pleaſe God in their
courſes; this was that made <hi>David</hi> ſay, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. <hi>Teach mee thy way, and
I ſhall walke in it:</hi> and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 56. 13. <hi>For thou haſt delivered my ſoule from death,
and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lſo my feet from falling, that I may walke before God in the light of the liuing:
Micha</hi> 4. 5. <hi>For all people will walke every one in the name of his God, and wee
will walke in the name of the Lord our God for ever and ever:</hi> therefore if
men bee not carefull to walke with God, to leave their corrupt cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
they have no faith. And becauſe every man will bee ready
to catch hold on this, and to ſay they walke with God: (then I
anſwere) <hi>If thou walkeſt with God, thou muſt leave ſome markes and prints
behinde;</hi> ſo if we walke with God, we muſt leave behinde us markes and
prints: we read 2 <hi>King.</hi> 7. 15. <hi>That when the Iſraelites went after the Syrians
unto Iordan, loe all the way was full of cloathes and veſſells, which the Syrians
had cast behind them:</hi> ſo if we walke with God, all the way that we goe,
ſhall leave markes behind us of patience, of faith, of holineſſe of life,
till we come at <hi>Iordan, viz.</hi> till wee come to die; where men have not
walked with God, there is not any prints or markes left behind them.</p>
               <p>The third effect and fruit of faith is,<note place="margin">The third effect of true Faith.</note> 
                  <hi>That it will let all goe in the matters
of this life, and provide for ſaving of thy ſoule:</hi> this is set forth unto us,
by the example of <hi>Noah, Gen.</hi> 6. that builded an <hi>Arke</hi> for the ſaving of
himſelfe, and his houſhold, when others were buſie about their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
ſports, and following their worldly profits, hee applyed himſelfe
to make an <hi>Arke;</hi> what was the reaſon of it? becauſe he had the faith
of theſe two things:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1 That God would bring a floud.</item>
                  <item>2 That he would ſave him by this meanes, by the Arke.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> hee did beleeve that God would ſend a floud for the drowning
of the world; for as there was a time of mercy, a time that God did
patiently forbeare them; ſo hee did beleeve that there would be a
time of judgement when the Lord would puniſh the wicked and the
ungodly.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:17958:25"/>
Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> he was perſwaded that when others did periſh, he ſhould
bee ſaved, nor by carrying him above the clouds, nor by incloſing him
in the waters, or to make him walke in the dry land, as the children of
<hi>Iſrael</hi> did; but hee did beleeve that God would ſave him in the <hi>Arke,</hi>
ſo a Chriſtian muſt bee perſwaded and ſettled in the aſſurance of theſe
two things: firſt, that God will ſend a floud of deſtruction, a floud of
fire upon the world, and that as there is a time of mercie, ſo alſo there
will bee a time, and a day of judgement, a time to call them to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt
for all their ſinnes. Secondly, wee muſt bee perſwaded, that
there is no other meanes to bee ſaved but onely by <hi>Ieſus Chriſt;</hi> and
when a man is ſetled in the faith of this, it will make him let goe all,
and lay hold on Chriſt, that he may bee ſaved in the day of judgement.
The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3 8. <hi>Hee accounteth all things but to bee dung and
droſſe, that he may be found in Christ;</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, Let the world goe,
take it with all the pleaſures and profits, I accompt it but dung and
droſſe that I may winne Chriſt, and be found in him. So <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 7.
he ſayes, <hi>Whereunto our twelve tribes, inſtantly ſerving God day and night, hope
to come to the reſurrection, and ſo ſtand with joy and comfort before God.</hi> So if
once this be ſettled in our hearts, that there is no other meanes to bee
ſaved, but onely by Chriſt, then a man will bee contented to let all goe,
and lay hold on Him, that ſo hee may be ſaved and ſtand with joy and
comfort before God:<note place="margin">Gen. 19.</note> we ſee in Geneſis, that when <hi>Lot</hi> went out of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
the Angels did haſte him, that he might not looke backe againe
to his pleaſures, and profits, and goods, that hee had left behind him;
what was the reaſon of it? that ſeeing God had given him the meanes of
ſaving of himſelfe, he would apply himſelfe to it; where there is not this
affection, it comes not into ones heart nor his thoughts all his life long,
to conſider how he ſhall be ſaved, and be contented to let all goe, and
apply himſelfe to the meanes.</p>
               <p>The fourth effect is,<note place="margin">4</note> 
                  <hi>to obey the calling of God whatſoever it cost:</hi> this is
ſhewed unto us in <hi>Abrahams</hi> example,<note place="margin">Effect of true Faith.</note> when the Lord called him out of
his countrey, and from his kindred, he did not hang upon them, but he
loſt all, and obeyed Gods Commandement: ſo if a man hath faith in
God, call him to any ſervice or dutie, call him out of his ſinnes, or call
him out of the world, he will be contented to let all go, and obey God,
whatſoever it coſt him, and what troubles ſoever he endureth. So wee
ſee <hi>Matthew,</hi> when Chriſt called him, left all his profits, and followed
him; and ſo in <hi>Matthew</hi> 4. when Chriſt called his other diſciples, they
left their fiſhes, nets, and followed him: ſo if there be faith in us, we wil
obey God whatſoever it coſt us; therefore when men will not come
out of their ſinnes, but ſticke in them ſtill, there is not this effect of true
faith in them, howſoever the divell may perſwade them to have it.</p>
               <p>The fifth effect of true faith is,<note place="margin">5</note> 
                  <hi>That it will make us live like Pilgrimes
herein this world:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Effect of true Faith.</note> to dwell in our houſes like ſtrangers ready to depart,
and leave all, as the Patriarkes did, who accounted themſelves as Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims,
and ſtrangers here, and heaven to be their home, this is a great
worke of faith. Now in foure reſpects wee muſt live like strangers,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:17958:26"/>
and Pilgrimes here in this world.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">In foure reſpects we are Pilgrims here.</note> 
                  <hi>a Pilgrime hath not his heart</hi> (as you know) <hi>ſettled upon the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
and countries that he paſſeth through,</hi> but his minde is ſet at home;
and if he comes where men be dauncing,<note place="margin">1</note> and taking their pleaſure, hee
doth not attend it, his minde is of his journey; if he come where men
be at play, either in fencing or any other ſporting, he doth not minde it,
but his deſire is bent only on his journey: ſo we ſhould be like Pilgrims
and ſtrangers, in this reſpect, our hearts ſhould not bee ſet on the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
and countries we paſſe through, they muſt not bee ſet on this
world: If a man come where pleaſures be, hee muſt not have his heart
intangled with them, or attend on them, he muſt not minde them, but
his bent muſt be ſet on his journey, and his home. I have ſhewed you
heretofore a pretty ſtory of a man travelling to <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> the holy city,
who as he travelled, came to a city where hee ſaw muſtering of men,
trayning of ſouldiers, and running of horſes, and hee being delighted
therewith, thought to have tarried there, but this came into his minde,
this is not the holy land, nor the holy city; ſo away he went: Then hee
came to another city, and there he law dauncing, and ſporting, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
delights, and he had thought to have tarried there, till this came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his thought, this is not the holy land, nor the holy city, and ſo he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
thence; then he came to another city, where he ſaw goodly hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
fine women, good cheere, where he thought to have tarried, but he
remembred this was not the holy land, nor holy city: ſo a Chriſtian
muſt doe, when hee comes at the pleaſures and profits of this life, his
heart muſt not bee intangled with them, but this muſt come into his
minde, that this is not the holy land, nor the holy citie that we looke
for.</p>
               <p>The ſecond reſpect is, <hi>to pleaſe the Lord of the countrey eſpecially, and the
Lord of the ſoile,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>that he is to paſſe through,</hi> that ſo he may be at peace: ſo it
muſt be our care to pleaſe the Lord of the ſoile and countrey, that wee
paſſe through; and ſeeing God is the Lord of the Earth, it muſt bee
our care to pleaſe him, that ſo wee may with peace paſſe through this
earth to heaven, leſt we be arreſted and ſtayed in our journey.</p>
               <p>The third reſpect is, <hi>that a Pilgrime is ever hasting,</hi> what company ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
he comes in,<note place="margin">3</note> he is ſtill gathering home, whatſoever hee doth, his
minde is of home: ſo we ſhould be like Pilgrimes in this reſpect, that
what company ſoever we come into, or whatſoever we doe, our minde
ſhould ſtill be gathering home; as in the <hi>Philip.</hi> 1. 23. the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>
deſireth <hi>to be diſſolved, and to be with Christ: Iob</hi> 14. 14. ſaith, <hi>All the daies
of my appointed time, I will waite till my change ſhall be.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fourth reſpect is, <hi>that a Pilgrime hath no care but this one, to have ſo
much foode,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">4</note> 
                  <hi>as may ſerve him in his journey, till he come at home,</hi> that ſo he doe
not ſtarve: ſo ſeeing we are ſtrangers and Pilgrimes here in this world,
this muſt teach us to be carefull to get ſo much food, knowledge, faith,
as may ſerve us till we come at home, be brought to heaven and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;
there is much talke of faith, and many thinke that they have it,
but when God ſhall bring us downe to the waters, as <hi>Gideon</hi> did his
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:17958:26"/>
men, we ſhall finde but a few to have true faith, if wee try our ſelves by
theſe effects.</p>

faith, and of our holy Religion is compriſed in the Articles of our
Creede: The ſumme whereof is firſt to beleeve in God, diſtinguiſhed
into three Perſons; <hi>Father, Sonne,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost;</hi> and that this God hath
gathered a Church, or a Company of people out of this world, on
whom he will beſtow his graces here in this world, and glory in the life
to come: this is the ſumme of the faith, that wee are juſtified and ſaved
by. And if any deny, but one Article of this faith, he doth, as it were,
raſe the foundation, deny the Faith, and deſtroy it: in a houſe, a man
may pluck downe a ſparre, or pluck a lath off, and the houſe may ſtand,
but if they take away a maine pillar, or raſe downe the foundation, the
houſe will fall: ſo it is in faith, a man may deny ſome points of Faith,
which be not the foundations of Religion, but if he doe denie any of

he denies all; as it is ſaid of ſome that they deſtroyed and denied the

that appertaine unto us) our truſt and confidence in him.<note place="margin">1</note> Firſt,<note place="margin">That there is a God.</note> wee
beleeve <hi>that there is a God,</hi> for although wee doe not ſee him, or feele
him, yet wee beleeve it through the light of nature, and the light of the
ſpirit: This is the foundation of all Religion, which foundation if it bee
once laid, that there is a God, then the heart of man will bee ready
to beginne and to looke after Relgion, and I doe not doubt, but that
if a man come once to this, to beleeve there is God, then it is an eaſie
matter to bring him to this, that this God muſt bee ſerved, feared, and
honoured:<note place="margin">Note.</note> I doe not inſiſt in this, becauſe I doubt or thinke that any
doubt of this, whether there bee any God or no, but becauſe there be
ſome remaines and remnants of blindneſſe and ignorance in us, the
divell alſo having his temptations; but I doe in this, as men that have
planted young trees, they ſhake the trees, and tread the moulds downe
to ſettle the tree: ſo I doe as it were tread downe the moulds and ſettle
the tree, even you the more in this point that there is a God. Which we
may prove by theſe five things:</p>

               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>by the works of God, Rom.</hi> 1. <hi>For the inviſible things of him;</hi> his eternal
power and Godhead,<note place="margin">The workes of God prove a Deity.</note> 
                  <hi>are ſeene by the creation of the world;</hi> ſo the workes
of God declare there is a God. Now the workes of God are of two
ſorts: 1. <hi>The workes of Creation.</hi> 2. <hi>The workes of Government.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> the workes of Creation ſhew there is a God; the Creatures
could not make it,<note place="margin">The workes of Creation.</note> the birds and beaſts could not, nor man could not,
for, <hi>then the part ſhould make the whole;</hi> nor it made not it ſelfe, but it was
God that made it. If a man ſhould come into a ſtrange Countrey, and
ſee a number of goodly houſes, and yet ſee no man there, he would not
ſay that the birds and beaſts built them, but he would thinke that it was
ſome greater power (that of men) that built it: ſo when wee ſee this
goodly frame of heaven and earth, ſhall we ſay that the birds and beaſts
did make it, or man? Nay, it was ſome greater power, even that of God.
<hi>Origen</hi> ſaith, that if we ſhould aſke the Creatures who made them, they,
if they could ſpeake, would tell us, that God made them, and framed
them: If (ſaith he) we ſhould aſke the heavens, who made them, they
would ſay God; If the earth, who made it, it would ſay, God made me,
and framed mee; and ſo all the Creatures in the world, if they could
ſpeake, would tell us that God made them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:17958:27"/>
Now as the workes of the Creatures ſhew that there is a God,<note place="margin">2</note> ſo
doth the <hi>workes of government ſhew it in the excellent wiſedome appearing to
carry all things in their natures, and operations, to their ends:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The workes of Government.</note> For if God
ſhould not uphold them, they would runne to Confuſion; therefore
that every Creature continues in his nature, operation, and is carried
to his end, this doth ſhew there is a God. If a man ſhould looke on a
Clocke, and ſee the turning of the wheeles, the ſtriking of the hammer,
the hanging of the plummets, hee would ſay there were ſome Clocke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker,
that did make, order and governe it: ſo when we looke on the
Creatures, and ſee every thing in his nature, and in his courſe, we muſt
ſay that there is ſome Divine power that doth it; which is God: If one
ſhould be one the top of an hill, and from thence ſee an army of men in
companies, bands, ranckes, and ſquadrons, with their faces bent one
way, turning and marching forward, he would thinke there were ſome
great captaine there, that did order and governe them; ſo when wee
looke upon the Army of the Creatures, and ſee them in their ranckes,
armies and orders, we muſt ſay there is ſome divine power that orders
all, which is God.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>the place of God doth ſhew there is a God:</hi> every place is in regard
of ſomething contained in the place,<note place="margin">The place of God.</note> and there is no place but it is reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,
and there is nothing but hath reſpect to ſomething contained in
the place; as a Chaire being ſet in ſome roome it is for ſome to ſit in, ſo
no place is voyd; If we looke into the ſea, that is filled and repleniſhed
with fiſhes, the fields with beaſts, the ayre with birds, hell with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels,
then heaven cannot be voyd; for if all places be made in reſpect of
ſomething, and be repleniſhed, then it is impoſſible heaven ſhould bee
void. If a man ſhould come into a ſtrange countrey, and ſee a number
of goodly houſes, and one ſhould exceede all the reſt, for fine building,
being greater and beautifuller than all the other, he would ſay, ſure the
Lord of the Country dwelleth in that houſe: ſo when wee ſhall looke
on the houſes of all the Creatures, and ſee one houſe exceed all the
reſt in beautie and ſplendour, who would not ſay ſurely this is Gods
houſe; the Lords houſe of the countrey? If one ſhould bring out an
Atheiſt, and aſke him whoſe houſe is this, and ſhew him the Sea, hee
would ſay it were the fiſhes; and if one ſhould ſhew him the earth, and
aſke him whoſe houſe that were, he would ſay the wormes; if one ſhew
him the fields, and aſke him whoſe houſe that were, he would ſay the
beaſts; If one ſhould ſhew him the ſky, and aſke him whoſe houſe that
were above the Sunne, the Moone, and the Starres (the heavens)
he muſt needs be convinced that it were Gods, ſo then the very place
where God is may ſhew us there is a God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> wee may prove there is God; <hi>by the nature of the Creatures,</hi>
and that two wayes:<note place="margin">By the Nature of the Creatures.</note>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>1 By their Motion.</item>
                  <item>2 By their Multitude.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> by their <hi>Motion,</hi> for there is nothing moved, but it muſt bee
moved by ſomething;<note place="margin">Motion.</note> for as the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> ſay, <hi>There is nothing moved,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:17958:28"/>
but it is by ſome unmoveable thing:</hi> As for example theſe inferiour
bodies upon the earth are altered and moved by the ayre and other
elements, and the elements by the influence and motion of the Sunne,
Moone, and other heavenly bodies, and theſe Planets are moved by
the higheſt Orbe, or Spheare of al, called <hi>Primum mobile,</hi> the firſt moover:
now if one ſhould aſke, who mooveth that? an Atheiſt muſt needes
confeſſe that it is God; ſo then the very mooving of things doth ſhew
there is a God.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>Multitudes</hi> come from unites: as many rivers come from
one ſea,<note place="margin">Multitudes.</note> leaves from one ſtalke, veines in the body from one liver, arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
from one heart, many ſinewes from one braine, and innumerable
beames from one Sunne; ſo all multitude of things and creatures
come from one unitie, which is God; therefore the multitude of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
doth ſhew there is God.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4</note> wee may proove there is a God <hi>by our owne conſcience;</hi> for
conſcience carrieth its eyes directly unto God,<note place="margin">By Conſcience.</note> it regardeth not man,
nor looketh to his law, but directly looketh to God, ſo that conſcience
is, <hi>a meere reſpect unto God;</hi> which although it may bee corrupted, yet it
cannot bee extinguiſhed, for every man hath a witneſſe in his owne
boſome, that there is a God. Hence wee gather, no man can bee an
abſolute Atheiſt in regard of judgement; indeed in regard of affection
hee may bee for a little ſeaſon, yet hee cannot be quite ignorant that
there is a God, as long as there is conſcience in him: this is a great
matter that God hath given us conſcience ſo that wee cannot loſe him,
hee hath ſet it up as a light to direct us to him, and to ſhew that there is
a God.</p>
               <p>The fifth thing whereby wee may proove there is a God,<note place="margin">5</note> is, <hi>By
our owne experience:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">By our owne Experience.</note> for the more wee have ſerved God and obeyed
him, the more wee have found his bleſſing to bee upon us; and the
more wee have ſinned againſt God, and diſobeyed his word, the more
wee have found the hand of God againſt us, to puniſh and afflict us;
therefore although wee had not a Bible to tell us there were a God, yet
our owne experience doth ſay that there is a God, finding his hand
againſt us, when we ſinne againſt him; and his bleſſings upon us, when
wee ſerve and obey him. So <hi>Eſai.</hi> 43. 12. it is ſaid, <hi>I have declared, and I
have ſaved, and I have ſhewed when there was no ſtrange God among you, and
therefore you are my witneſſes, ſaith the Lord, that I am God.</hi> Thus our owne
experience may tell us that there is a God.</p>
               <p>The uſe of this is,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> firſt, that ſeeing there is a God, then fie upon
the Atheiſts that ſay there is no God: hee that ſaith there is no God,
that man is the wickedeſt sinner in the world, for a theefe taketh away
but our goods, a perjured perſon our lands, a murtherer our lives, but an
Atheiſt takes away God from us: <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20. when <hi>Mary</hi> came to the
ſepulchre, and found not Chriſt there, ſhe wept, and ſaid, <hi>They have
taken away my Lord, and I cannot tell where they have laid him;</hi> as if ſhee
ſhould have ſaid, they have taken away my Lord, in whom all my
comfort and all my hope was laid up: ſo wee may ſay of the Atheiſts,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:17958:28"/>
they have taken away God from us, in whom all our comfort and hope
is laid up; therefore an Atheiſt is the moſt wicked creature that is,
becauſe hee takes away God from us. By the law of the land, if a man
bee condemned by twelve men, hee muſt die the death, but worthily
may hee die, that is not onely condemned of twelve men, but of twelve
thouſand creatures. If a man doubt there is a God, let him ſtep but
one ſtep out of this life, and hee ſhall feele there is a God; <hi>Chryſostome</hi>
ſaith, if thou doeſt not beleeve there is a God, what doeſt thou O man
in the houſe of God? (ſaith hee) pay thine hire, and get thee out of
his houſe, tread not on his ground, feede not of his creatures, but get
thee another place.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> ſeeing there is a God, why doe a number of men live as if
there were no God at all? men cry out of the Atheiſts that ſay there
is no God, and thou ſaiſt there is a God, and yet doeſt not ſerve and
obey him: here is the difference betwixt thee and him; thou art an
Atheiſt in practice, and hee is an Atheiſt in judgement, ſo although thou
doeſt acknowledge in judgement there is a God; yet in thy practice
thou doeſt deny him. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 16. <hi>They profeſſe
that they know God, but by their workes they deny him, being abhominable and
diſobedient, and unto every good worke reprobate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Vſe 3.</note> ſeeing their is a God, it is a ſure thing that every man ſhould
looke after God, and labour to ſerve and worſhip him, to give him that
glory which is due, for he is the fountaine of all our comfort. It was
the condemnation of the world, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. when men knew there was a
God, yet did not worſhip and give him that glory which was due unto
him: ſo this is the condemnation of the world ſtill, that when men
know there is a God, they doe not worſhip him, and give him that
glory which is due. If a man dwell in the Kings houſe, and yet will not
come at the kings Leetes to doe him ſervice, hee ſhall bee turned out of
the kings houſe and ſervice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo if wee dwell here as in Gods houſe, he
being our Land-lord, if wee doe not performe our ſervice and duty to
him, giving him his due, it were juſt with God to turne us out of his
houſe and home. Wee ſee the creatures obey God, and doe that they
were made for, even thoſe that have not that ſenſe, reaſon, or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that wee have, being guided by the inſtinct of nature onely,
whereas wee, having knowledge, ſenſe, and faith, doe not obey God,
and give him that honour that is his due, but neglect and deſpiſe him
from day to day. It is a laudable cuſtome among us, that before wee
beginne the harveſt, wee beginne in the Temple, and that for two
cauſes:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. To acknowledge the Soveraignty of God.</item>
                  <item>2. That wee may ſhew wee deſire to enjoy theſe bleſsings, but with his love and
leave.</item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eſai.</hi> 38. 12. The life of man is compared to a <hi>Weavers Warpe,</hi> which
the beame windes up, and ſo is filled, which if they doe not fill, it is
found full of flawes, bancks, bracks and gaules, when it is cut off: ſo our
life is the warpe, and every day is as the beame to winde up ſomewhat
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:17958:29"/>
of the life wee live. Wherefore every day wee muſt bee doing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
to fill our warpe, leſt when wee bee cut off, wee ſhould not bee
found filled, but full of bracks, gaules, and flawes. Now to helpe you
this way, wee have ſpent a great deale of time in the doctrine of faith
and repentance, which bee the fillings of our lives, therefore let us not
paſſe a day without renewing of repentance and faith.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> wee beleeve <hi>that there is but one God:</hi> as it is, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 39.
<hi>Vnderstand therefore and conſider in thine heart,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">That there is but one God.</note> 
                  <hi>that the Lord is God in heaven
above, and upon the earth beneath; there is none other;</hi> And 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 4. <hi>Wee
know that an Idoll is nothing in the world, and that there is no other God but one.</hi>
So 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>For there is one God, and one Mediator between God and man, the
man Christ Ieſus:</hi> thus wee ſee there is but one God. The heathen had
a number of Gods, the <hi>Romans</hi> had great Gods and little Gods, the
<hi>Grecians</hi> had heavenly Gods and earthly Gods; Gods for the ſea, and
Gods for the land; but wee beleeve there is but one God. <hi>Athanaſius</hi>
hath a pretty ſaying, an inſtrument that hath many ſtrings, take many
men to ſtrike the ſtrings, and they have no order, conſent, or ſweet
harmony betweene, but take a man that hath cunning and skill to ſtrike
upon the ſtrings, then there appeares a ſweet order, conſent and harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;
ſo, ſaith hee, this world and the creatures bee as it were an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with a number of ſtrings, take men to ſtrike upon the ſtrings of the
creatures, then there is no order, nor conſent amongſt them; but let
one God ſtrike upon the ſtrings of the creatures, and then there is a
ſweet conſent and agreement betweene them. Now if a man ſhould
ſay, why is there not more Gods than one? This were a frivolous
queſtion, we acknowledge divers perſons, and but one God in ſubſtance,
eſſence and power: wee read, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 7. <hi>There bee three that beare record
in heaven, the Father, the Word and the holy Ghoſt: and theſe three are one.</hi>
A good Divine doth thus illuſtrate it: water is but one thing in nature,
and yet hath divers beings, as it is in the fountaine, as it runnes into the
river; &amp; as it is conveied home to the houſe in pipes, payles, or buckets:
ſo the three perſons are one in nature, and eſſence, but it is in the Father,
as the <hi>Fountaine;</hi> in Chriſt, as the <hi>River;</hi> in the holy Ghoſt, <hi>as a pipe or
a payle, to convey, and bring it into our hearts.</hi> So it is in a diverſe manner,
<hi>but all one in eſſence, ſubſtance, nature and power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The uſes are,<note place="margin">Vſesi.</note> firſt, ſeeing there is but one God, wee muſt take heed
wee make not many Gods, that wee make not a God of our pleaſures,
of our goods, of our bellies, or of our ſinnes: as the Apoſtle complaines,
<hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 19. <hi>Whoſe belly is their God, and whoſe glory is their ſhame, who minde
earthly things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I,<note place="margin">Obiect.</note> but ſome man may ſay, is there any man ſo bad, to make his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
his belly, his ſinnes, and his goods, his god?</p>
               <p>I anſwer,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> it may be proved by theſe two Evidences: Firſt, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
he loveth above God,<note place="margin">1</note> that he maketh his god, but it is evident that
many a man loveth his pleaſures more than God,<note place="margin">Evidence.</note> or his goods, or his
belly, or his ſinnes, and therefore hee maketh them his gods. If a man
ſhould ſet a Childe betweene two men, let them both call the childe,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:17958:29"/>
and looke which the childe loveth, unto him will the childe runne: ſo
let a man be ſet betweene God and his pleaſures, God and his mony,
God and his ſinnes, which now a man runnes unto, that he loveth beſt:
ſo it is evident that men make theſe things their god.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">The ſeemd evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> whatſoever a man takes moſt paines for, that he makes his
god. But it is evident that men take more paines about their pleaſures,
and money, than they doe about God, and therefore they doe make
that their god. <hi>Chryſostome</hi> ſaith, Aske not thy tongue, whether thou
loveſt God or no, or takeſt more paines about thy pleaſures, money,
belly or thy ſinnes, than for him: But aske thy life and converſation, and
that will tell thee, that thou loveſt thy pleaſures more than thy God:
therefore he that ſaith, he loveth God, and yet loveth his pleaſure more
than God, he lyeth: hereby we muſt take heede that we doe not ſet our
profits, and our pleaſures in the roome of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> ſeeing there is but One God, wee muſt labour to bee one
as he is One; For Gods labour is to bring all the decaied Creatures to
be one, as hee is One; It is the Devill that brought in diviſion, and ſet
man againſt God, and one man againſt another, but God laboureth to
bring all to one: though we cannot be all one in subſtance, yet let us la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to be one in affection; as it is ſaid,<note place="margin">Act. 4. 32.</note> that <hi>the number of them that belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
were of one heart and of one mind,</hi> ſo we muſt labour to be of one heart,
and of one minde, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 5. It is ſaid, <hi>There is one Lord, one Faith, one Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme,
one God, and Father of all:</hi> ſo <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 10. It is ſaid, <hi>Have we not all one
Father? hath not one God made us? why doe we tranſgreſſe every one against his
brother, and breake the covenant of our Father?</hi> Therefore ſeeing God is
one, we muſt labour to be one as he is one, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. wee read how the
Prophet ſaw a <hi>number of bones</hi> lye ſcattered here and there, but when
once the Word of God came amongſt them, <hi>they ran bone to his bone, ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes
grew upon them, and fleſh on the ſinewes:</hi> ſo howſoever we be ſcattered
in our affections, yet if the Word of God come amongſt us, we bee one
aſ God is one, ſtraight way we runne together, and be made one, though
not in ſubſtance, one, yet in affection, heart and minde.</p>
               <p>The fourth uſe is,<note place="margin">Vſe 4.</note> that ſeeing God is one, therefore there is but one
meanes of life and ſalvation; as <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 30. <hi>For it is one God who ſhall ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie
the Circumciſion by Faith, and the uncircumciſion through faith.</hi> There is
but one meanes, whereby he gathereth all men unto him, ſo that the
beſt and holieſt men that ever were, are ſaved by the ſame meanes, that
the meaneſt and pooreſt are, and the greateſt ſinner is ſaved by. It is an
opinion of ſome, that they ſhall be ſaved in what Religion ſoever they
profeſſe, but this cannot be, becauſe there is but one meanes of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of all men. There was but <hi>one Tree of life, one Doore in the Arke, one
high Priest, one Mediator betweene God and man,</hi> and therefore there is
but one way to life and ſalvation: if we be out of that way, wee are in
the way to damnation. Therefore we muſt doe as a man in a journey, O
Sir (ſaith he) I am in a way, but whither doth this way lead, if he be told
it leadeth to the kings court, where he ſhall have great favour ſhewed,
or to a garden of pleaſure, or a place of Comfort, then he will goe on
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:17958:30"/>
cheerefully; but if he be told that it leadeth to a priſon, a dungeon, or
to a place of torment, he will ſtay and goe no further: ſo ſhould we ſay,
O ſir, we are in a way, but whither doth it lead? If to heaven, to Gods
favour, to joy and comfort unſpeakeable, then we may with comfort go
on; but if we be told, that the way we walke in, leadeth to hell, deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and to torment, we ſhould make a ſtand, and go no further, therefore
ſeeing there is but one way to life, every one ſhould labour to walke in
that way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3</note> we profeſſe that we beleeve he is a true God; <hi>True, firſt</hi> in regard
of his Nature:<note place="margin">He is a true God in regard of his Nature.</note> 
                  <hi>ſecondly,</hi> in regard of his properties.</p>
               <p>Firſt, he is a true God in regard of his <hi>Nature,</hi> for he is of a ſpirituall &amp;
no bodily ſubſtance;<note place="margin">1</note> there is no extention of his parts, he doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
of parts, as we doe, but he is of a ſpirituall ſubſtance, as <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 24. <hi>God
is a Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> he is infinite in time, and in place, there is no bounds nor
limitations of him, he cannot be comprehended; as it is <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145. 3. <hi>Great
is the Lord, and moſt worthy to be praiſed, and his greatneſſe is incomprehenſible;</hi>
ſo that his wiſedome, power, juſtice, and mercy no man can compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> he is the fountaine of all good things, ſo that whatſoever
good things the Creature hath, it is from God; <hi>For by him we live, move,
and have our being,</hi> and breathing, as it is in <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 28. God doth give a
being to us; he hath a being of himſelfe, and therefore he hath no need
of us, he is not the better for our prayers, nor the ſervice wee doe him,
but we be the better for it; and therefore every one when he conceiveth
of God, muſt ſee he hath a right apprehenſion of him, hee muſt ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him, as he hath revealed himſelfe in his Word, or elſe hee ſetteth
up an idoll of his owne in his heart. The heathen did deride Chriſtians,
asking them where their God was, and bidding them ſhew their God,
for they could ſhew theirs in ſuch a Church, and ſuch a place. Saith the
Chriſtian, I cannot ſhew thee my God, for he is a Spirit, and cannot bee
ſeene, and therefore he is the true God; yours may bee ſeene, therefore
he is not the true God; but (ſaith he) if you would ſee my God, get you
the eyes of faith, and I will ſhew you my God. Men that have weake
eyes, get them eyes of a Chryſtall glaſſe, and then they ſee a number of
things, that they could not ſee before: ſo, when we cannot ſee God, we
ſhould get Chryſtall eyes, the eyes of Faith, and then wee ſhall ſee that
we never ſaw before. A number of people in the world cannot ſee God
in the fields, in their publike meetings, in their houſes, but let them get
the eyes of Faith, and they ſhall ſee him very comfortably.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">God is true in his Properties.</note> as we beleeve God to be true in <hi>Nature,</hi> ſo we beleeve God
to be true in his <hi>Properties;</hi> He is a powerfull, a wiſe, a juſt, a mercifull, a
loving God. And therefore if wee beleeve that God is <hi>powerfull,</hi> why
then doe wee not truſt in him? If hee bee <hi>wiſe,</hi> why be we not guided,
and governed by him? If he bee <hi>juſt,</hi> why doe wee not beleeve him in
his promiſes? And why are wee not affraid of offending him? If hee
be <hi>mercifull,</hi> why ſhould we deſpaire? But a number of men take away
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:17958:30"/>
the power of God,<note place="margin">SERM. V.</note> for (as the children of Iſrael in the wilderneſſe, ſaid,
<hi>Can God prepare a table for us?</hi>) ſo they ſay, Can God helpe us in ſickneſſe?
Can he helpe us in affliction? ſo likewiſe they preſume to ſinne, and ſo
take away the <hi>justice of God,</hi> for though hee brings his judgements to
light every day, yet they will not learne to feare, and be aſhamed. And
ſo they ſoothe themſelves as the Prophet complaines, That every one
that doeth evill, is good in the ſight of God, or he delighteth in them,
or ſay where is the God of Iudgement? ſo they take away wiſedome
and mercy from him, as was ſhewed out of <hi>Ieremy.</hi> But a Chriſtian muſt
beleeve the properties of God, that he is <hi>powerfull,</hi> therefore to truſt and
relye upon him; <hi>Iust,</hi> therefore to beleeve his promiſes; <hi>wiſe,</hi> therefore
to be guided by him. We may ſee a worthy example hereof in <hi>Hezeki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi>
2 <hi>King.</hi> 19. 15. When <hi>Senacherib</hi> went againſt <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> he told them
that hee had deſtroyed ſuch and ſuch places, and countries, and their
goods; and ſhalt thou be delivered? Then <hi>Hezekiah came before the Lord,</hi>
told it him, <hi>ſpread the writing before him, and prayed to the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Fourthly, that God is our God.</note> 
                  <hi>we beleeve that God is our God by the meanes of Christ;</hi> this is the
maine point of all, not to beleeve God in generall onely, but to bring
him home to our ſelves, and to be perſwaded that he is our God: ſo the
holy people (as <hi>Eſay</hi> ſhewes) ſaid, <hi>This is our God, we have waited on him,
and he will ſave us.</hi> If he be our God, that then whatsoever is in him, as
his power, wiſedome, mercie, juſtice, love, and goodneſſe, it doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine
to us, wee ſhall have the benefit; this faith is a comfort, and
that which God reſpects; <hi>Thomas</hi> could have no comfort of his Faith,
till he could ſay, <hi>My Lord and my God;</hi> and Chriſt, when he would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
his Diſciples at his departure, ſaith, <hi>Goe tell my brethren, I aſcend to my
God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 20. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>and your God, to my Father, and your Father:</hi> ſo if once a man come to
this, that he can perſwade himſelfe that God is his God by the meanes
of Chriſt; this will comfort, and give him more peace, than the world
can yeeld.</p>
               <p>The uſe is, that ſeeing God is our God, therefore we ſhould reſpect
and love him, and be deſirous to pleaſe him in our courſes: <hi>Mich.</hi> 4. 5.
<hi>For all people will walke every one in the name of his God, but we will walke in the
Name of the Lord our God for ever and ever:</hi> therefore as we doe profeſſe
that God is our God, we muſt labour to pleaſe him in all our courſes, be
loth to doe any thing that may diſpleaſe him: It was the ſpeech of <hi>Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lah</hi>
to <hi>Sampſon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> 
                  <hi>Iudges</hi> 16. 15. <hi>How canst thou ſay, thou loveſt mee, when thy
heart is not with me?</hi> ſo how can we ſay, that we love God when our cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
ſhew to the contrary: it is a pittifull thing to ſee how men doe not
regard God, they doe ſo toile themſelves with their labours, that ſo
ſoone as they be ſet in the Church they are fallen faſt aſleepe; men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
they beleeve God is their God, and yet doe not reſpect nor ſerve
him. In the 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9. mention is made of <hi>Samuels</hi> feaſt unto the people,
where one ſpeciall diſh given before unto the Cooke is brought forth,
it was a ſhoulder ſet up onely for the king, that none but he ſhould have
it;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> in like manner it ſhould bee our wiſedome ſo to ſpend our ſtrength

about the world in the weeke time,<note place="margin">ARTIC. I.</note> that we reſerve a part for the Lords
Sabboth, to doe him ſervice with.</p>
               <p>Hitherto God hath beene conſidered as he is in himſelfe; now wee
come to ſpeake what God is in relation: and there is a twofold relation
of God:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. To the Trinitie.</item>
                  <item>2. To the Creatures.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt, God ſtands in relation to the three Perſons, for <hi>I beleive in God,</hi>
ſtands in relation to the <hi>Father,</hi> to the <hi>Sonne,</hi> and to the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Here
are foure points of Faith to be beleeved:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That there is a diſtinction of Perſons in the Godhead.</item>
                  <item>2. That there is a divine Perſon called the Father.</item>
                  <item>3. That he is the Father of Chriſt.</item>
                  <item>4. That he is our Father by the meanes of Chriſt.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt, we beleeve <hi>that there is a diſtinction of Perſons;</hi> for though there be
but one in Subſtance, Eſſence and Power, yet there bee three diſtinct
perſons ſubſiſting in one Godhead, as 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 7. <hi>There be three that beare
record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghoſt, and theſe three are
one;</hi> and ſo <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. in the charge that Chriſt gave his Diſciples,
when he ſent them out <hi>to preach in the Name of the Father, the Sonne and
Holy Ghoſt:</hi> and elſewhere the Scripture doth teach diſtinction of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
as <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 30. <hi>I can doe nothing of my ſelfe, as I heare, I judge, and my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is juſt, becauſe I ſeeke not mine owne will, but the will of my Father that ſent
me:</hi> ſo <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. 26. <hi>But the Comforter, which is the holy Ghoſt, whom the Father
will ſend in my Name, he ſhall teach you all things.</hi> So then wee ſee plainely
that the Father is a diſtinct perſon from the Sonne, and the Sonne a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
perſon from the Father, and the Holy Ghoſt a diſtinct perſon from
the Father and the Sonne. There is a difference betweene the Faith of
a Chriſtian, and a Turke; the one beleeveth in one God, diſtinct in three
perſons, the other in one God, without diſtinction of perſons.</p>
               <p>Now there bee two grounds that overthrow this opinion of the
Turkes: firſt, it is a rule in Divinitie, that whatſoever as God reveales
himſelfe to be,<note place="margin">The firſt ground to proove a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Perſons.</note> ſo we muſt beleeve he is; but God hath revealed himſelfe
to be one God, and three Perſons, therefore ſo we muſt beleeve; for no
man can dive into the bottome of God, to know what he is, but he muſt
reveale himſelfe to us; ſo <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 18. <hi>No man hath ſeene God at any time, the
onely begotten Sonne of the Father, he hath revealed him:</hi> and 1 <hi>Timoth.</hi> 6. 16.
ſaith the Apoſtle (ſpeaking of God) <hi>Who onely hath immortalitie, and
dwelleth in the light that no man can attaine to, whom never man ſaw, neither
can ſee, unto whom be honour and glory everlaſting, Amen.</hi> And therefore
as a man going into the Sea, in danger, or to swimme, ſo farre as his
Corke will carry him up, ſo farre he may goe ſafely, but if this faile to
carry him up, he makes a ſtand and ventures no further: in like manner,
ſo farre as our Corke will carry us up, ſo farre we may walke ſafely, ſo
farre as we have warrant out of Gods Word; but if we have no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
out of Gods Word, let us make a ſtand and goe no further: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:17958:31"/>
as God hath revealed himſelfe, ſo we muſt beleeve; but he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
himſelfe to be one God, and three diſtinct Perſons, and ſo wee
muſt beleeve.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ground is,<note place="margin">The ſecond ground for Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of Perſons.</note> that it is not poſſible to redeeme man without
diſtinction of Perſons; for God the Father being offended with
man for sinne, there muſt bee a second Perſon for a Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
God and man, to reconcile them, and to make them one
againe, which muſt bee the Sonne; and there muſt bee a third to apply
this to the heart of man, that is, the holy Ghoſt; therefore it is not
poſſible that the redemption of man ſhould bee wrought without the
diſtinction of Perſons. The Turkes demand of the Chriſtians, what
good they have to beleeve in God diſtinct in three perſons, more than
they have in God without diſtinction of Perſons? If they should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of me, I would make them this anſwer, thus, That wee could not
have our redemption, but by the diſtinction of perſons; for when men
were out of favour with God; they muſt have a thing of infinite value,
and of greater price than all the ſoules and bodies of men are worth,
to ſatiſfie for them, and to apply it; and therefore this benefit wee
have by beleeving the diſtinction of perſons, more than the Turkes
have.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Secondly, that the Father is a diſtinct Perſon.</note> 
                  <hi>that there is a divine Perſon called the Father:</hi> there bee
three divine Perſons, the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Sonne,</hi> and the <hi>holy Ghoſt;</hi> now
they are not divided as three men, to ſay, here is one, here is another,
and there is another, but they are diſtinguished; as three candles being
light in a roome, wee cannot ſay, here is the light of one candle, and
here is the light of another,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> their light cannot bee divided one from
another, and yet there be three diſtinct lights; even ſo there bee three
diſtinct Perſons, the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Sonne,</hi> and the <hi>holy Ghoſt,</hi> and yet we may
not divide them, and ſay, here is the <hi>Father,</hi> or here is the <hi>Son,</hi> or here
is the <hi>holy Ghoſt,</hi> apart one from the other: for as of <hi>water, wine,</hi> and <hi>Roſa-ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi>
being put into one glaſſe (three diſtinct things) wee cannot ſay,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> this
is the <hi>water,</hi> and this is the <hi>wine,</hi> and this is the <hi>Roſa-ſolis,</hi> but where one is,
there is the other; ſo there bee three divine Perſons, but wee cannot
ſay, here is one, and there is another, but where one is, there is all: and
therefore let us goe no further than our corke will beare us up; if our
corke will not beare us up, let us make a ſtand, let us goe no further
than we have warrant out of the word of God.</p>
               <p>In that he is called a <hi>Father,</hi> it is becauſe hee is a fountaine to the
reſt. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 35. <hi>The Father loveth the Sonne, and hath given all things into
his hands:</hi> and <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 30. <hi>I ſeeke not mine owne will, but the will of my Father
that ſent me:</hi> and <hi>Ioh.</hi> 28. <hi>Yee know me, and whence I come, yet I am not come
of my ſelfe, but hee that ſent me is true, whom yee know not; But I know him, for
I am of him, and hee hath ſent me:</hi> and in the <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. he sayes, <hi>Who being
the brightneſſe of his glory, and the engraven forme of his perſon.</hi> So then we
ſee that God the Father is a divine perſon diſtinct from the Sonne, and
the holy Ghoſt; hee is called a <hi>Father,</hi> becauſe hee is a fountaine to all
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:17958:32"/>
the reſt, and that he is ſo, it ariſeth of the infinite goodnes that is in God.</p>
               <p>There is a queſtion amongſt Divines how he communicats his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
to the reſt of the Perſons.<note place="margin">Quest. Sol.</note> The anſwer is, that the more goodneſſe
there is in God, the more he communicates his goodneſſe. Now there
is no creature capable to receive the goodneſſe that is in God,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> for the
creatures have goodneſſe indeed, but it is but as a drop, in reſpect of the
goodneſſe that hee doth infuſe to the divine perſons; and therefore he
doth infuſe his goodneſſe to the reſt of the divine perſons, even as a
fountaine of water when it is full,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> it ſends and gives it out againe; ſo
the Father gives out his goodneſſe to the reſt of the divine Perſons.
This is a deepe point to dive into, and therefore a man muſt doe in
divinity, as a man doth going into a river, as long as hee feeles the
ground with his feet, ſo farre hee may wade ſafely, but if hee feele no
ground, it is good to make a ſtay and goe no further: in like manner,
ſo long as wee may wade in Divinity, and feele the ground with our
feet, wee may ſafely goe on ſo farre as there is a warrant out of the
word, but if this be wanting, it is good to make a ſtand, and venture no
farther.<note place="margin">Vſe.</note> The uſe is, that ſeeing God containes not himſelfe, but
communicates his goodneſſe, let us labour to have communion with
him, and then he wil communicate his goodnes, as to the three Perſons,
ſo to us, in proportion. As <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145. 3. <hi>Great is the Lord, and most worthy to
be prayſed and his greatnes is incomprehensible,</hi> the Lord is great in goodnes,
and gives and powreth it out to others; therefore <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.
<hi>It is a good thing for me to cleave unto God.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> If a great man in a Kingdome
ſhould give out his goodneſſe, and be beneficiall, all men would ſeeke
for his ſervice, but if he were a niggard, no man would ſeeke to him:
ſo ſeeing God gives out his goodneſſe, all men ſhould ſeeke to have
communion with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The third point is,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Thirdly, God is the Father of Chriſt.</note> that he is the Father of Chriſt: <hi>ſo it is ſaid,</hi> Rom. 15. 6.
That yee with one mind, and with one mouth may praiſe God, even the Father
of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt; <hi>And</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 3. Bleſſed be God, even the Father of our
Lord Ieſus Chriſt, &amp;c. <hi>The point is plaine, I ſhall not need to prove it
any more: we will make uſe of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt is,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> that ſeeing he is the Father of Chriſt, whatſoever Chriſt
hath done in the great matters of our redemption, God will approve
and accept of: as <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 35. <hi>The Father loveth the Sonne, and hath given all
things into his hands;</hi> and therefore ſeeing it is his Sonne who hath
reconciled us, hee will approve and accept of it; ſeeing hee hath payed
the price for us, wee shall bee acquitted and diſcharged before God,
and ſo goe free.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> that none can be fitter to be the Mediator than Chriſt,
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 11. 42. <hi>Ieſus</hi> ſaith, <hi>I thanke thee, Oh Father, becauſe thou haſt heard me; I
know thou heareſt me alwayes, but becauſe of the people that ſtand by I ſaid it, that
they may beleeve that thou haſt ſent mee.</hi> And therefore becauſe hee is the
Sonne of God, hee is the more fitter to be the Mediator. <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. 37.
It is ſaid, therefore it may be <hi>they will reverence my Son:</hi> In the law we ſee
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:17958:32"/>
whenſoever the high Prieſt was to appeare before God, he was to have
the names of the twelve Tribes in his breſt-plate, and on his ſhoulders
engraven in ſtones for a continuall remembrance before the Lord;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Simile.</hi> Exod. 29. 6.</note> ſo
Chriſt is our high Prieſt, and he carrieth all the names of the elect, and
preſents them before God for a continuall remembrance.</p>

God our Father boldly, which we have by the meanes of Chriſt; all
the Angels in heaven could not doe or procure it, no not for the poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
or meanest man: But Chriſt hath procured it, and by no other
meanes but by his death and bloudſhed. Indeed naturally we may ſay
as <hi>Iob,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iob 17. 14.</note> that <hi>Corruption is our father, and the wormes our mother:</hi> ſo naturally
an earthly man may ſay, Sinfull is our father, the divell naturally is our

And therefore as Christ ſaith of himſelfe, <hi>that he was not come to doe his

the ſtranger bid him to doe any thing, and he will not regard it, but let
his father command him, and ſtraightway he will doe it: ſo if God be
a ſtranger unto us, then we will not regard or obey him; But if he be our
Father, then we will be ready to obey him in all things that hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth
us. <hi>Ierem.</hi> 35. 5. we ſee it there related, that <hi>there were pots full
of wine, and cups ſet before the Rechabites; And I ſaid unto them, Drink wine: but
they ſaid, We will drinke no wine, for Ionadab the ſonne of Rechab our father com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded

obey him. It is a great ſinne and corruption that men doe profeſſe God
to be their Father, and yet they will not obey him, but doe the quite
contrary: God hath commanded we ſhould ſanctifie the Sabboth, but

guide of my youth?</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, Ye call me Father indeed, but ye do
not uſe me like a Father, ye doe not obey me, and walke in my wayes:
If I be your Father, uſe me like a Father, reſpect me, obey me: ſo <hi>Eſay</hi> 1.
2. the Lord ſaith, <hi>I have nouriſhed and brought up children, but behold rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious
children:</hi> And therefore ſeeing we profeſſe God to bee our Father,
we muſt obey him, and regard him as a Father.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Secondly, If God be our Father, we muſt labour to be as like him as may be.</note> ſeeing God is our Father, we muſt labour to be like him,
as much as may be; for a Childe deſires to bee like the Father, and
therefore ſeeing we profeſſe to be the Children of God, let us labour
to be like him in all holineſſe and uprightneſſe: So the Apoſtle exhorts
<hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 1, 2. <hi>Be ye therfore followers of God as deare children:</hi> ſo 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 14. <hi>As
obedient children, not faſhioning your ſelves unto the former luſts of your igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.
But as he which hath called you is holy, ſo be ye holy in all manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation.</hi>
If we his Children,<note place="margin">Three things to be like God in.</note> we muſt be like him in three things:</p>
               <p>Firſt, we muſt be like unto God in doing good unto all men, within
the compaſſe of our ability;<note place="margin">1</note> therefore <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 45. our Saviour
ſhewes how wee ſhould bee like our heavenly Father,<note place="margin">In doing good to all.</note> 
                  <hi>Hee maketh the
Sunne to ſhine upon the evill and the good, and ſendeth raine on the juſt and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:17958:33"/>
unjuſt;</hi> ſo our goodneſſe ſhould be extended to all men.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> we muſt be like God in forgiving the injuries and wrongs
that bee done unto us;<note place="margin">In forgiving wronge and iniuries.</note> As <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 21. <hi>Now therefore (as the elect of God,
holy and beloved) put on tender mercy, kindneſſe, humbleneſſe of mind, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
long ſuffering, forbearing and forgiving one another;</hi> If any man have
a quarrell to another, even as Chriſt forgave you, even ſo do ye.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> we muſt be like him in holineſſe of life; As 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 17. <hi>If yee
call him Father,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In holineſſe of life.</note> 
                  <hi>which without reſpect of perſons judgeth according to every
mans workes, paſſe the time of your dwelling here in feare; and bee yee holy, for
hee is holy.</hi> Wee ſee how wicked men imitate the steps of their fathers,
they will bee like them; and therefore it is ſaid of <hi>Abia,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 15. 3.
<hi>That hee walked in all the ſinnes of his father, as hee had done before him;</hi> So
thoſe wicked people, <hi>Ier.</hi> 44. 17. ſay they, <hi>Even as our Fathers have done
before us, ſo will wee doe.</hi> Here wee ſee how ready these were to follow
the waies of their wicked fathers, then how ready ſhold we be therfore
to be like our heavenly Father? God is mercifull, and we be unmercifull;
ready to forgive us the injuries and wrongs that wee doe to him, and
wee backeward to forgive the injuries and wrongs that our brethren
doe to us; hee is holy, and wee be unholy; and therefore I marvell,
that we doe not bluſh to call God Father, and yet walke in the ſteps of
the divell; God is holy, and thou art prophane; God is mercifull, and
thou art cruell. This is the ſecond inſtruction.</p>
               <p>The third is, that ſeeing God is our Father, therefore wee muſt trust
in him,<note place="margin">3</note> and rely on him as a Father, we muſt labour to moderate the
cares of this life,<note place="margin">To moderate the cares of this life.</note> becauſe we have one God to take care for us: <hi>Matth.</hi>
6. 25. our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Bee not carefull what yee ſhall eate, or what yee ſhall
drinke, nor yet for the body what ye ſhall put on, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>verſe</hi> 32. he giveth
a reaſon, why wee ſhould take no care; <hi>for your heavenly Father knoweth
that yee have need of all theſe things;</hi> and out of his Fatherly care will
make a ſupply of them by ſuch good meanes as hee hath appointed:
therefore wee muſt wholy rely, and truſt on him. If wee ſee a young
man eager of the world, carking, caring, ſcraping, and gathering toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
riches: men may ſay, this man hath no Father to provide for him.
So if wee ſee men ſcraping, gathering, carking, and caring for the things
of this life, ſurely wee may feare, God is not his Father, for if he were
hee would rest upon him. <hi>Chryſostome</hi> ſaith, if a man were going to a
feaſt, would hee take care for meat? if one were at a fountaine, would
hee take care for water? God of his Fatherly care will provide a table
for us, and as a rich fountaine will make a ſupply of all our wants, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we have no cauſe to carke or care, for the things of this life: let this
bee thy comfort, that if God bee our Father, hee will provide for thee,
This therefore condemnes the ſcrapers and miſers of this world, that
care not by what meanes they can get it, or by what bad course they
have it; and therefore they doe not reſt on God as a Father. It is true
indeed, there is a provident care to bee had for the things of this
life, but this same carking and diſtruſtfull care is that which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
condemne.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:17958:34"/>
The fourth is, that all the chaſtisements that come upon us, we take
as from the hand of a loving Father,<note place="margin">4</note> and patiently beare them: ſo wee
ſee,<note place="margin">All our chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments then come from the hand of a loving Father.</note> 
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39. 9. <hi>I was dumbe and ſaid nothing, becauſe it was thy doing.</hi> So
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 18. <hi>It is the Lord, let him doe what ſeemeth him good:</hi> And
<hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 2. <hi>Father, if thou wilt take away this cup from mee; nevertheleſſe not
my will, but thy will bee done.</hi> So every croſſe and affliction we ſhould
take as a cup tempered and reached out by the hand of a loving Father,
and therefore wee ſhould patiently beare it. Wee ſee in experience,
if a ſtranger beat a child, the child will murmur at it, but if a Father
correct it, it will patiently beare that, ſo if God bee a ſtranger to us,
then we will murmur at his corrections, but if God be our Father, then
we will patiently beare his loving chaſtiſements.</p>
               <p>The fifth inſtruction hence is,<note place="margin">5</note> that ſeeing God is our Father we ſhould
bee content to part with any thing wee have to give unto Chriſt:<note place="margin">We ſhould part with any thing to give unto Chriſt.</note> wee
read in the ſtory of <hi>Samſon,</hi> that when his Father and Mother was going
to the wedding, <hi>he went aſide to looke on the carcaſe of the Lion which hee had
killed,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iudg. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>where hee found a ſwarme of beeſ and hony, whereof he did eate, and
gave to his Father and Mother;</hi> ſo we ſhould doe, going to the heavenly
wedding, wee should give ſuch good things as wee have, ſeeing we
cannot give them to Chriſts owne perſon, let us give them to his needy
members, and Chriſt will accept it as done unto himſelfe; as <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 45.
<hi>Forſomuch,</hi> saith he, <hi>as ye have done it unto one of theſe little ones, ye have done
it unto mee.</hi> Seeing God is our Father, therefore all Chriſtians are our
brothers, and wee ſhould love them for our Fathers ſake. So <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.
10. <hi>Have wee not all one Father? and hath not one God made us? why doe wee
tranſgreſſe every one againſt his brother, and breake the covenant of our God and
Father?</hi> therefore ſeeing God is the Father of us all, we muſt love them,
and regard them: ſo <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8. 42. <hi>If God were your Father,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>then
ye would love me;</hi> ſo we may ſay, if God were your Father, then ye would
love Chriſtians, but becauſe yee hate and deſpiſe them, therefore it is
evident that God is not your Father.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing that was obſerved,<note place="margin">Vſe 2. Comfort. Firſt, our digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be the Sons of God.</note> was matter of comfort: firſt,
that ſeeing God is our Father, therefore wee are called to a greater
dignity and honour than this world can afford us, for it is the greatest
preferment in the world to bee called the Sonnes of God; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 1. hee bringeth it in with an <hi>ecce, Behold, what love the Father
hath shewed on us, that wee ſhould bee called his Sonnes:</hi> and therefore <hi>David</hi>
to this purpoſe ſaith, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. 23. <hi>Seemeth it a light thing unto you to bee
the Sonne in law to a King.</hi> Now then if it be ſuch a matter to bee Sonne
in law to a King, what an honour is it to bee Son to the King of Kings,
to God? if wee conſider wee bee but duſt and ſinfull, and the children
of the divell: therefore as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. 18. <hi>Who am I? and
what is my life, and the familie of my Father in Iſrael, that I ſhould bee Sonne in
law to the King?</hi> So wee may ſay, Lord, what am I, or what is my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
houſe, that this honour ſhould bee put upon me, to bee called thy
Sonne? And therefore whatſoever our estate be here in this world, it is
a great comfort to us to bee one of the Sonnes of God, the greateſt
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:17958:34"/>
dignity that this world can afford. I ſhewed you lately, that it is the
greateſt goodneſſe and mercy of God to put honour upon his ſervants,
that even Kings are glad of this favour; and howſoever men cannot
away with ſuch now, but deſpiſe and contemne them, yet one day, at the
day of judgement, or of their death, to have honor with the meaneſt of
Gods people, they would bee glad, if they could have but a looke: and
therefore it is a greater comfort to be one of Gods ſonnes and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
than to have all this world.</p>
               <p>The ſecond comfort is, that ſeeing God is our Father, therefore he
will bee a Father to us,<note place="margin">Secondly, That God will be a Father to us.</note> as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 18. <hi>I will bee a Father unto you:</hi> and not
in name, but a Father in deed to us, hee will performe the duty of a
Father; there is no Father in time of need will doe more for his child,
than God will doe for us, nor no Father ſo ready to helpe his child as
wee shall have helpe of God. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. 13. <hi>As a Father hath compaſſion
on his children, ſo hath the Lord compaſſion on them that feare him:</hi> and <hi>Eſai.</hi>
63. 16. <hi>Doubtleſſe thou art our Father, though Abraham bee ignorant of us,
and Iſrael know us not, yet thou O Lord art our Father, and our Redeemer;</hi> and
therefore great is the comfort that wee ſhall finde, ſeeing hee is our
Father: it is a comfort in the time of mutation of friends, when they
leave, and forſake, and caſt us off, yet wee may ſay with comfort, Lord,
I thanke thee, thou art my Father, thou wilt not leave mee nor caſt
me off, but ſtand by me when the world will forſake me, and my world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
friends.</p>
               <p>The third is,<note place="margin">Thirdly, that God will give us a heavenly inheritance.</note> that ſeeing God is our Father, hee will give us an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
inheritance: a father wil not die, and leave his childe nothing, if he
be able; ſo God will not be a Father, and leave us nothing, but he will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath
unto us an heavenly inheritance; ſo our Saviour ſaith <hi>Luke,</hi> 12. 23.
<hi>Feare not little flocke, for it is your Fathers will to give you a kingdome.</hi> So alſo,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 16. <hi>Wherefore God is not aſhamed to be called their God; for he hath
prepared for them a City:</hi> God would have us men be aſhamed to call him
father, if he had nothing to give us, but ſeeing he hath prepared for us a
City, hee is not aſhamed to bee called our Father; therefore ſeeing hee
hath provided ſuch a heavenly inheritance, it is a comfort to us: art thou
a poore man, and haſt thou little to live on? or art thou a yonger bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and haſt thou no inheritance? labour to have God thy Father, and
although thou bee a meane man here, yet thou ſhalt be great in heaven,
Chriſt ſhall be thy brother, and heaven shall be thine inheritance.</p>
               <p>The fourth is,<note place="margin">Fourthly, All Gods cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiſements ſhall turne to the beſt.</note> that ſeeing God is our Father, all his chaſtisements ſhall
turne to our good: ſo <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 6. the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>For whom the Lord
loveth, hee chaſteneth, and he ſcourgeth every ſonne he receiveth.</hi> If a father
correct his childe, it is for his good, and amendment, or at least-wiſe he
would have us to thinke ſo; in like manner as we would have others to
thinke of us, when wee are correcting of our children, that wee doe it
for their good,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> let us be perſwaded, and thinke ſo of God, that it ſhall
turne to our good. If a friend ſhould temper a potion, and give us it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our hands to drinke, although it ſhould worke furiouſly upon us, yet
wee would thinke that it ſhall turne to our good: ſo ſeeing God is our
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:17958:35"/>
friend, and our father, though our afflictions worke ſtrongly upon us
yet wee muſt bee perſwaded, that it ſhall turne to our good. We heard
in the morning out of the ſtory of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that <hi>Abimelich</hi> the King
ſought to <hi>Abraham</hi> to make a league with him, at that time, when hee
was a great heavineſſe for the loſſe of <hi>Iſmael;</hi> for <hi>Hagar</hi> and <hi>Iſmael</hi>
were caſt out of his doores. The Doctrine from hence was, <hi>That the
Lord never ſendeth extraordinary croſſes, and troubles, but he ſends his ſervants
extraordinary comfort:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> and this ariſeth of his fatherly care towards us:
if a Father gives to his child a ſowre cup, or a bitter cup, he will ſecretly
convey into his hand a peace of ſugar to allay the bitterneſſe and
ſowrenesſe; ſo the Lord doth, when he giveth us a bitter cup to drinke,
hee conveyeth into our hearts ſecretly,<note place="margin">Mercie in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>iddest of wrath.</note> as it were, a peece of ſugar,
ſome comfort to allay the bitterneſſe of it. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaith, There
were no man able to ſaile at Sea, if there were no havens, and ſhores,
and harbors for ſhips to lye in,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> in the time of tempeſt, ſo, ſaith hee, it
were not poſſible for a Chriſtian to paſſe this earth through, if God
ſhould not give him comfort in the time of his trouble.</p>
               <p>The fifth comfort is,<note place="margin">5</note> that ſeeing God is our Father, wee may with
comfort at the day of death lay downe our ſoules and bodies into his
hands; ſo wee ſee Christ doth <hi>Luke.</hi> 23. 46. <hi>And Ieſus cryed with a loud
voyce, Father into thy hands I commend my ſpirit:</hi> this muſt teach us when
wee come to die, to commit our spirits into the hands of God. It is the
diſpoſition of a childe, if hee hath any Iewell in the time of danger, to
runne and put it into his father hands, where he thinkes it a thouſand
times ſafer than in his owne: ſo wee ſhould doe, ſeeing wee have but
one jewell, our ſoules, in the time of danger wee should runne to God,
and commit it into his hands, and thinke it a thouſand times more ſafe
than in our owne keeping. Now having ſpoken of the <hi>Perſon</hi> of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the next in order and courſe is, to ſpeake of his <hi>Attributes,</hi> which
are two, mentioned in this place.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That he is Almighty.</item>
                  <item>2. That he is the maker of Heaven and Earth.</item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Why God is ſaid to bee Almighty.</note> that he is Almightie: <hi>Now God is ſaid to be Almighty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he hath power in himſelfe, to doe whatſoever he will,</hi> Pſal. 111. 3.
But our God is in heaven, and doth whatſoever he will: <hi>and</hi> Pſal. 135. 6. Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
pleaſeth the Lord, that did hee in heaven, and in earth, and in the ſea: <hi>ſo alſo</hi>
Ephes. 3. 20. Vnto him therefore that is able to doe abundantly, above all that we
can aſke or thinke, according to the power that worketh in us, be praiſe and Glory.
Philip. 3. 21. <hi>ſaith the Apoſtle,</hi> Who ſhall change our vile bodie, that it may be
faſhioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able
to ſubdue all things to himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Here a queſtion may be moved,<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> why we are taught to beleeve that
God is almighty, ſeeing the minde of man is finite, and it is not able to
conceive of an infinite thing, such as is the power of God?</p>
               <p>I anſwere,<note place="margin">Ans.</note> as a man may ſtand on the sea ſhore, and looke on the ſea,
where, though hee be not able to ſee the length and breadth of it, yet

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tious, and a large thing; ſo howſoever we
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:17958:35"/>
are not able to conceive the greatneſſe of God, and his Almightineſſe,
to ſee the largeneſſe of him; yet apprehending of him as wee may, we
ſhall ſee him to bee great, yea the further wee goe, the greater we ſhall
ſee him to be; though we be not able to ſee his length, and depth, yet we
may perceive the Almightineſſe of him: as if a man come to a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
which hee is not able to comprehend in his armes,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> yet hee is able
to apprehend it, and to lay hold on it with his hands: ſo howſoever
we are not able to comprehend the Almightineſſe of God, yet we may
apprehend it, and lay hold on it.</p>
               <p>Now God is said to bee Almighty,<note place="margin">God is said to be Almighty foure waies. Firſt, becauſe he is able to doe whatſoever hee will.</note> foure wayes: firſt, becauſe he is
able to doe whatſoever hee will, his power is as large as his will,
as <hi>Eſai.</hi> 46. 10. <hi>My counſell ſhall ſtand, and I will doe whatſoever I will;</hi> and
<hi>Numb.</hi> 23. 19. <hi>God is not as man that hee should lye, nor as the ſonne of
man that hee ſhould repent: hath hee ſaid it, and ſhall hee not doe it? hath
hee ſpoken it, and ſhall hee not accompliſh it?</hi> So wee ſee God hath
power to doe whatſoever hee willeth: many times wee will a
thing, and wee have no power to doe it, but whatſoever the
Lord willeth, hee hath power to doe it; his power is as large as his
will. And therefore as the Leper said to Christ in <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. 2. <hi>If thou
wilt, thou canſt make mee cleane;</hi> ſo wee may ſay in our paines, Lord, if
thou wilt, thou canſt give mee eaſe in my paines; Lord, if thou wilt,
thou canſt give me health in ſickneſſe; proſperity in adverſity, and in
the times of my diſtreſſe, comfort.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee is able to doe whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in Nature is poſſible.</note> God is ſaid to bee Almighty, becauſe hee is able to doe
whatſoever in Nature is poſſible to bee done: if there bee any power
that can doe any thing for us, God is able to doe it; as <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 9. It is
ſaid, <hi>God is able of theſe ſtones to raiſe up children unto Abraham:</hi> and
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 8. <hi>God is able to make all grace to abound <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>wards you, that ye having

there bee any thing poſſible in Nature to bee done, God hath power to
do it; much more if we want any thing, God by his power can make a
ſupply of it, if wee deſire any thing God can helpe us, wee need ſeeke
no further, he hath power in himſelfe to helpe us. In the ſecond booke

them that ſeeke to witches and wizards for helpe; is it not becauſe
there is no power in God to helpe thee, that thou uſeſt ſuch baſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toward

power in God, to doe any thing that is poſſible in Nature to bee done,
why doe wee not ſeeke to him in our wants? why doe wee not relie

               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Thirdly, becauſe the whole ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Power is in God.</note> God is ſaid to bee Almighty, becauſe the whole fulneſſe

fire can warme us, but it cannot feede us, becauſe there is but a part of
power; meate can feed us, but it cannot helpe us againſt diſeaſes; ſo
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:17958:36"/>
likewiſe Phyſick cannot helpe us when death commeth, the reaſon is,
becauſe there is but a part of power in theſe. Now in God is the whole
power, therefore God can make supplie unto us whatſoever our wants
be. Therefore it is the madneſſe of the world to truſt to their money,
to their goods, to their worldly friends, in which things there is but a
part of power, the whole fulneſſe being in God: what is there but hee
hath? what doe we want, but hee can ſupply it? And therefore let us
all goe and rely on the fulneſſe of power that is in God.</p>

<hi>For in him wee live and move and have our being.</hi> The <hi>Philoſophers</hi> ſay, that
the second cauſe cannot worke, but by the power of the firſt cauſe; As
in a clocke, if there bee a ſtand in the great wheeles, there muſt needes
be a ſtand in the little ones alſo,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> becauſe theſe doe depend on the great
wheeles; ſo if there bee a ſtand in God, there muſt needs bee a ſtand in
the creatures, becauſe they all depend on him, for all the power we have
to ſtand and move, is from God: therefore when we ſinne againſt Him,
we turne the ſame power we have from God, againſt him. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
<hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Shall wee take the members of Chriſt, and make them the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of a Harlot? God forbid;</hi> ſo we may ſay, ſhall we take the power wee
have from God,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and turne it againſt him? God forbid, it is an heavy
thing ſo to doe. <hi>Therefore ſeeing all the power of the creatures is from God,
there is no enemy that can lift up a hand or a foote against us to doe us hurt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">None can hurt us but by power from God given.</note> 
                  <hi>but
from the power they have from God:</hi> As our Saviour ſaith to <hi>Herod, Ioh.</hi> 19.
11. <hi>Thou couldſt have no pwoer at all againſt mee, except it were given thee from
above.</hi> And it is ſaid, <hi>Revel.</hi> 9. 14. <hi>Looſe the foure Angels which are bound in
the great river Euphrates. And the foure Angels were looſed.</hi> Thus we may ſee
that all adverſary powers are not able to ſtirre, or moove againſt us, but
by the power they have from God. If one ſhould ſee a Lion or a Beare
chained, and in the hand of his father, he would not be afraid of them;
ſo ſeeing there bee a number of wicked ſpirits in vilde men that be like
Lions,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and Beares, yet are they chained, and in the hands of our father,
wee need not bee afraid of them, for they have no power to doe us any
hurt, but by the power they have from God.</p>
               <p>But ſome man may ſay, and object, is there power in God to doe any
thing?<note place="margin">Object.</note> There bee ſome things that God cannot doe, How then is God
Almighty? As <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 2. It is ſaid, that <hi>God cannot lye;</hi> nor hee cannot
deny himſelfe: And 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 13. <hi>Hee is faithfull and cannot deny himſelfe:</hi>
ſo alſo, God cannot dye. Here then wee may ſee that there bee ſome
things that God cannot doe.</p>
               <p>I anſwer,<note place="margin">Anſ.</note> indeed, God cannot doe theſe things, <hi>for theſe things imply
weakneſſe, and not power:</hi> for why doe men deny themſelves? or why
doe men lie?<note place="margin">What thing? God cannot doe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they imply weakneſſe in one.</note> becauſe of weakneſſe: or why doe men die, and have no
power to withſtand it? if God ſhould doe thoſe things, hee ſhould
deſtroy his owne nature; for it is againſt the nature of God to lye, or
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:17958:36"/>
to deny himſelfe;<note place="margin">SER. VI.</note> God cannot doe any thing, that implyes weakneſſe,
God cannot doe any thing, that deſtroyes his owne nature.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Secondly, God cannot make the Creature God.</note> 
                  <hi>God cannot make the Creature God,</hi> becauſe the Creature is
not capable of it, it being a finite thing, with bounds and limits,
therefore not capable of an infiniteneſſe: now the want of power in
this caſe, is not in God, but the defect is in the Creature; as let a man
take foure pottles of wine,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and put it into a pottle glaſſe, the glaſſe is not
able to receive it; the defect here is not in the power of man, but in
the glaſſe, for hee was as able to powre out all of it as one drop, but the
glaſſe could not receive it. Againe, God cannot doe any thing that
implyes contradiction,<note place="margin">Thirdly, God cannot doe any thing which i plyeth Contradiction.</note> as to cauſe a thing to bee, and not to bee, as the
Sunne to ſhine, and not to ſhine, all at one time: or a body to be in a place
and not to be, or to be in divers places at one time.</p>
               <p>The uſes are, for <hi>Instruction,</hi> and <hi>Comfort.</hi> The firſt Inſtruction is, that
ſeeing God is Almighty,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> all men must ſtoope and bow before him, in
the conſideration of his great power;<note place="margin">Men must ſtoop and bow before him.</note> as <hi>Eſa.</hi> 25. 3. <hi>Therfore ſhall the mighty
people give glory unto thee, the city of the ſtrong nations ſhall feare thee. Ier.</hi> 10.
7. <hi>Who would not feare thee, O King of nations? For to thee appertaineth the
dominion, for among all the wiſe men of the Gentiles, and in all their kingdomes,
there is none like unto thee.</hi> So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95. 6. <hi>Come let us worſhip and fall downe,
and kneele before the Lord our Maker:</hi> therefore the great power that is in
God muſt humble us, bring us low, and make us fall downe before
him.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Secondly, to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to make him our friend and bee in his favour.</note> that ſeeing God is Almighty, labour to make him thy
friend, and to be in his favour, for nothing is almighty in this world but
God: wee ſee how men labour to bee in favour with Noblemen, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
thereby to procure ſome great matter to themſelves; but there is
none greater than God, therefore labour to have his favour. This is that
a Chriſtian deſires above all the things in this world: so <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 4.
6. <hi>Lord,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us, and that
ſhall make my heart more glad than they that have their corne and wine and
oyle increaſed:</hi> So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 80. 19. <hi>Turne us, O Lord God of hostes, cauſe thy face to
ſhine upon us, and wee ſhall be ſafe.</hi> In which Pſalme, it is thrice repeated, as
the onely deſire of a Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Thirdly, above all things ſinne not againſt him.</note> that ſeeing God is Almighty, therefore above all things
take heed we doe not ſinne againſt, and offend him, for all the creatures
are not able to doe the thouſand part of that hurt that God can doe
unto thee: why then are men commonly ſo afraid of great men, and
of the hurt they can doe to them? our Saviour tels them, whom to feare,
<hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 4. ſaith hee, <hi>Feare not him that can kill the body, and after that is able
to doe no more; but feare him that is able to destroy both Soule and body, and to
cast them into hell fire;</hi> him wee ought to feare; therefore the power
that is in God ſhould make us afraid to offend him. Wee ſee <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith,
Gods judgements were fearefull to mee, and I could not bee delivered
from his highneſſe; ſo we ſee the conſideration of the power that was
in God, made <hi>Iob</hi> ſtand in awe of him: a number of men never ſtand in
awe of God, are never afraid of his great power,<note place="margin">Iob 31. 23.</note> indeed they feare an
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:17958:37"/>
earthly power, are afraid of breaking the Princes lawes, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements
of men; but O that men could bee afraid of the great
power that is in God, who is able to deſtroy both ſoule and body.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, ſeeing God is Almighty, therefore in all extremities wee
are to reſt and relie on the power that is in him;<note place="margin">Fourthly, in all extremities trust in him.</note> for howſoever men
runne here and there for helpe, yet no man is able to helpe but hee.
A Chriſtian muſt beleeve that God is able to helpe by meanes, as <hi>Noah</hi>
was ſaved in a wooden <hi>Arke,</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> in an Arke of reed; ſo likewiſe
wee muſt beleeve that God is able to helpe us without meanes, againſt
meanes, or beyond meanes, and above the meanes: ſo as with the
Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> we may ſay,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 38.</note> 
                  <hi>If God be on our ſide, who can be against us?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the next thing obſerved was comfort.<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> Firſt, that ſeeing God
is Almighty, therefore our Salvation is in the hands of God; if it were
in our owne,<note place="margin">Firſt, that our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is in his hand.</note> wee might loſe it, but ſeeing it is in Gods keeping, it is
ſafe, as 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5. it is ſaid, <hi>Wee are kept by the power of God.</hi> In the time of
mans innocency <hi>Adam</hi> had the keeping of his owne Salvation, it was
in his owne hands, and hee loſt it; but now it is in Gods keeping, and
therefore we are ſure we ſhall not loſe it, ſeeing his power is Almighty.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Secondly, wee ſhall bee ſafe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> that ſeeing God is Almighty, therefore wee ſhall bee ſafe
under his protection; ſo <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27. 1. <hi>The Lord is my light, and
my Salvation, whom ſhall I feare? the Lord is the ſtrength of my life, of whom
ſhall I bee afraid?</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23. 4. <hi>Yea, though I ſhould walke through the
valley of the ſhaddow of death, yet I will feare none evill, for thou art my God,
and thou art with mee.</hi> If God bee our friend wee need not to care who is
our foe, for Gods power is Almighty.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Thirdly, that all his promiſes ſhall bee fulfilled in due time.</note> that ſeeing Gods power is Almighty, therefore all his
promiſes ſhall bee fulfilled in due time: ſo <hi>Gen.</hi> 21. 1. <hi>Now the Lord
viſited Sarah, as hee had ſaid: and the Lord did unto her according as hee had
promiſed.</hi> And <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 14. ſaith the Angell, <hi>ſhall any thing bee hard unto
the Lord?</hi> therefore ſeeing all Gods promiſes ſhall bee performed in
due time, and nothing is hard for him, comfort thy ſelfe therein; for
haſt thou a promiſe that God will raiſe thee out of the grave to glory
and happineſſe, or haſt thou any other promiſe, it is moſt ſure, it ſhall be
fulfilled in the due time by God.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that ſeeing God is Almighty,<note place="margin">Fourthly, that he is powerfull to deſtroy our adverſaries.</note> therefore we ſhall not need
to doubt or feare, but that hee is able to deſtroy our adverſaries
power, whoſoever ſhall riſe againſt him or us; <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. 8. <hi>Therefore ſhall
her plagues come one day, death, and ſorrow, and famine, and ſhee ſhall bee burne
with fire, for ſtrong is the Lord our God which ſhall condemne her.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Oncerning the Almightineſſe of God (which is
His firſt Attribute) we have already ſpoken: now
wee come to the ſecond, which is <hi>Maker of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

without any repetition: onely remember wee
that <hi>the more power there is in God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The more power there is in God, the more ſhould be our comfort. Simile.</note> 
                  <hi>the more is our
true comfort;</hi> for when a man knowes that all the
power that is in God is for his good, then the
more there is in God, the more is his comfort. As if a man ſhould ſee a
great deale of armour laid up in the hands of his friend, he might thinke
it were the better for him, he ſhall be the ſafer by it, but if he ſee a great
deale in the hands of his enemie, this may ſtrike a terrour into him;
ſo if we can finde that God is our Father and our friend, then the more
power there is in God, the more is our comfort, but if God be our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and diſpleaſed with us for our ſinnes, then our terrour is the greater,

               </list>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Firſt, God made heaven and earth.</note> who made Heaven and Earth? <hi>It was God; no man, nor Angell
made it, nor it made not it ſelfe, but God made it:</hi> Geneſis, 1. 1. In the
beginning God created Heaven and; Earth <hi>and ſo</hi> Paul <hi>ſaith in this place that
I have read unto you;</hi> I preach unto you, that ye ſhould turne from theſe vaine
idols unto the living God, that made heaven and Earth, and the Sea, and all
things that in them are: <hi>ſo</hi> Heb. 3. 4. For every houſe is builded by ſome man,
but he that hath builded all things is God: <hi>ſo then the point is cleared, none
can deny it. Now let us come to make uſe of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> ſeeing God made the world, and it was not made by man, nor
Angell,<note place="margin">Since God made the world, hee is to be praiſed for the comforts in the ſame.</note> neither did it make it ſelfe, but God made it, therefore if there
be any comfort or any delight to bee found in any creature, God is the
Author of it, and to be thanked for it; for we cannot make a ſticke nor a
ſtraw, a feather, an eare of corne, nor a ſtalke of graſſe: therefore seeing
God hath made a number of good things for our comfort and benefit,
God is to bee thanked for it. If a man ſhould ſet up an houſe for a poore
man to dwell in,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſo often as hee looketh on the houſe, he thinkes of the
good will of him that ſet up the houſe; ſo God hath ſet up heaven (as
it were) to cover us, earth to beare us, ſea and land to feed us: therefore
ſo often as we looke on any of theſe, we are to be thankfull. So <hi>David
Pſal.</hi> 8. 1. <hi>O Lord how excellent is thy name in all the world? Who haſt ſet thy
glory above the heavans:</hi> and <hi>verſe</hi> 4. <hi>What is man, that thou art ſo minde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
of him? and the ſonne of man that thou viſitest him?</hi> So <hi>Davids</hi> affections
were swallowed up in the consideration of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> ſeeing God made heaven and earth, take heed we doe not
diſpleaſe him,<note place="margin">Not to displeaſe him who made all, ſince hee is able to deſtroy all.</note> for hee that made all, is able to deſtroy all. As it is <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.
7. <hi>And the Lord ſaid, I will destroy from the earth the man whom I have
created, from man to beast, and to the fowles of the heaven, and to the creeping
things;</hi> therefore ſeeing he made all, take heed we doe not ſinne againſt
him, remembring what is ſaid, <hi>Eſai.</hi> 51. 12. <hi>I, even I am hee that comforteth
you: who art thou that thou ſhouldest feare a mortall man, and the ſonne of man,
who shall bee made as graſſe? and forgettest the Lord thy maker, &amp;c.</hi> Wee ſee
men are afraid of men to diſpleaſe them; but we ought to bee much
more afraid of the power of God, who is able to deſtroy all: if a man
ſhould hang from the top of an high tower by a twine threed, and in ſuch
manner,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> as if he that held him, ſhould let it goe, he would daſh him all
to peeces, how afraid would hee bee to offend him? and how glad to
pleaſe him? So wee all hang as it were, out of an high tower by the
threed of our life, God holds the threed, who if he ſhould forgoe his
hold, wee fall and daſh to nothing; therefore how afraid ſhould we be
to offend or to diſpleaſe him with our ſinnes, and carefull to pleaſe him
in all our courſes? if men had grace to conſider this, they would not
live in knowne ſinnes as they doe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Vſe 3.</note> seeing he made all, hee is able to diſpoſe of all, at his owne
will and pleaſure, for the workeman is able and may diſpoſe of his
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:17958:38"/>
owne worke; wee are the workemanſhip of God, and therefore wee
ſhould bee content with his diſpoſing whatſoever it bee,<note place="margin">Since God did make all, he is able to dispoſe all at his owne pleaſure.</note> ſickneſſe or
health, proſperity or adverſity. <hi>Eſay,</hi> 45. 9. it is written, <hi>Woe be to him that
ſtriveth with his maker; let the potſheard with the potſheards of the earth. Shall
the clay ſay to him that faſhioneth it, What makeſt thou, &amp;c?</hi> and therefore we
ſhould labour to be content with Gods diſpoſing, whatſoever it be, he
made all, he may diſpoſe of all, as it beſt pleaſeth him.</p>
               <p>The ſecond point is,<note place="margin">The ſecond point God made hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth.</note> 
                  <hi>What he made?</hi> he made the heaven and the earth;
the heavens, where God and his Angels be, and the lower world, where
ſinfull men and women are; he made viſible and inviſible things, and
whatſoever is within the compaſſe of heaven and earth: So ſaith <hi>Paul,
Act.</hi> 14. 15. <hi>I preach unto you, that you ſhould turne from your vaine Idols to
the living God, who made heaven and earth, the ſea, and all that therein is,</hi> and
ſo it is written <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 3. <hi>All things were made by it, and without it was nothing
made, that was made.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The uſe of this is, ſeeing God made all things, take heed we doe not
injurie and wrong God with them:<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> ſaith <hi>Paul, Shall I take the members of
Chriſt, and make them the members of an harlot?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Since God made all, not to wrong God with them.</note> 
                  <hi>God forbid:</hi> ſo ſay you, ſhall
wee take the Creatures that God hath made, and abuſe them, and ſo
wrong God? God forbid. This provokes God to vengeance as it is
<hi>Hoſeah</hi> 2. 9. <hi>Therefore will I returne, and take away my Corne in the time thereof,
and my wine in the ſeaſon thereof, and will recover my flaxe and wooll lent to her
to recover her ſhame:</hi> therefore if we abuſe Gods bleſſings and turne them
to the diſhonour of his name, he will take them from us.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſeeing God made all things, therefore we ſhould acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
them as the gifts of God,<note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> put into our hands by the Lord, and to
receive them as from his hands.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> The rivers receive their waters from
the ſea by ſecret paſſages, and againe runne into the ſea, and ſo carry it
backe againe thither: in like manner as we receive all from the hands of
God, ſo we ſhould returne all to him againe by publike thankefulneſſe
for them; as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in this place, that we <hi>ſhould turne from theſe vaine
idols to the living God, that made heaven and earth, the ſea, and all that therein
is:</hi> becauſe he made them, therefore we ſhould goe backe againe in the
conſideration of it, and returne thankes to him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Vſe 3.</note> ſeeing God made all things wee ſhould not looke upon his
workes, without great conſideration of them; as his workes of mercy
or judgement: If a workeman make an excellent worke, it is a great
indignity,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and injury offered to the workeman to paſſe by it, ſlight it, not
to looke on it or regard it: ſo ſeeing the Lord hath hanged as it were,
the chamber of this world with many goodly workes of his mercy, and
judgements, it is a great injury and indignity offered unto God for
men to paſſe by them, and never to looke upon them: ſo God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 28. 5. <hi>Becauſe they regard not the workes of the Lord, nor the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of his hands, therefore hee ſhall breake them downe, and not build them up;</hi>
ſo it is a great ſinne to paſſe by his wonderous workes, and not to looke
upon them, and conſider of them.</p>
               <p>The third point is,<note place="margin">The third point, how God made all.</note> 
                  <hi>how hee made them?</hi> By no inſtrument: but by his
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:17958:39"/>
word: as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33. 6. <hi>By the word of the Lord were the heavens, and all the hoast
of them by the breath of his mouth.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The third point how God made all.</note> Now wee are not to thinke it was a
vocall word of God, but it was his commandement: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33. 9. <hi>For he
ſpake, and it was done, hee commanded and it ſtood, or was created.</hi> So <hi>Pſal.</hi>
148. 5. <hi>Hee commanded and they were created. Solomon,</hi> when hee builded
the Temple, had thouſands of workmen to doe it, but God when hee
made the world, made it with his word: therefore we may ſee the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
power of the word of God, that let him but ſpeake and there is a new
heaven, and an earth, and a ſea, and ſkie, and beaſts, and birds for the
uſe of man:<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> Therefore the <hi>Centurion</hi> ſaith well, <hi>Matthew</hi> 8. <hi>Doe but
ſpeake the word, and thy ſervant ſhall be whole.</hi> So we muſt learne to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the excellent power of the word of God, that if hee ſay to ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
depart; it ſhall depart, if to health, come, it ſhall come, looke what
God ſpeaketh ſhall be done; as it is ſaid in the <hi>Pſalme, he ſent out his word,
and healed them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> ſeeing God made the world, with a word, wee may won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
at our untowardneſſe, that there is never a creature ſave man, but
doth yeeld to the Word of God: the Lord hath ſpoken ten words in
his Law, nay many more in the goſpell unto us, and yet what adoe is
there, an almighty power muſt ioyne with the word to bring a ſinner
to repentance: therefore wee may wonder at our untowardneſſe that
the creatures yeeld to the word of God, and yet ſinfull man cannot
ſubmit to a thouſand words of God, to bring him to repentance.</p>
               <p>The fourth point is,<note place="margin">The fourth point what he made all of.</note> 
                  <hi>what hee made the world of?</hi> and that was of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
<hi>Hebrewes</hi> 11. 3. <hi>Through faith wee underſtand that the world was
made by the Word of God;</hi> ſo that the things wee ſee were made of things
that did not appeare. Philoſophers ſay, <hi>of nothing nothing can hee made:</hi>
It is true in Nature, but not in regard of Gods power: In Nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede
there is no Artificer that can make any thing, unleſſe he hath mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to make it of; as a Smith cannot worke without Iron, and a Maſon
muſt have ſtone, and a Carpenter muſt have timber: but God is able to
make all things of nothing.</p>
               <p>The uſe is, firſt,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> that ſeeing God did make the world of nothing, hee
is able to make a man ſomewhat when he is nothing; he is able to give
grace where there is none, to create faith where there is no faith, and
to worke repentance where there is none: ſo ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 6. <hi>For
God who commanded the light to ſhine out of darkeneſſe, hath ſhined into our
hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Ieſus
Chriſt.</hi> And therefore if God be able to make the world of nothing, he
is able to make a man ſomething, that is nothing in himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> ſeeing God is able to make the world of nothing, he is able
when we are nothing in our worldly eſtates to raiſe us up of nothing, and
to make us great men in the world, ſo faith <hi>Hanna</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 6, 7. <hi>The Lord
killeth &amp; maketh alive, bringing downe to the grave and raiſing up: the Lord ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
poore, and maketh rich; bringeth low, and exalieth: he raiſeth the poore out of
the duſt, and lifteth up the begger from the dunghill to ſet them amongſt Princes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Vſe 3.</note> ſeeing God made the world of nothing, ſo let us know the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:17958:39"/>
world would diſſolve and come to nothing againe, if God ſhould not
uphold it; for naturally all things diſſolve into that they were made of,
as a man made of duſt, ſo naturally turnes and comes to duſt againe; ſo
Ice being made of water, it turnes to water againe, and Snow being
made of raine, it diſſolves to it againe:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſo the world being made of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
would come to nothing, if God ſhould not uphold it. Therefore
how much are wee bound to God for every houres continuance of this
world: which <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. is ſaid, <hi>to be upheld by his mighty power and word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, ſeeing he made the world of nothing, wee may ſee the
meanes of our beginning,<note place="margin">Vſe 4.</note> that it was of nothing; and therefore howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
ſome ſwell with greatneſſe of their Anceſtors, and of their Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
yet we ſee the meanneſſe of our beginning, wee came of nothing:
therefore this may ſerve to humble us, how great ſoever we be; <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
hee confeſſed he was but duſt, this did humble him, and were know
the duſt was made of nothing; which ſhould ſerve to humble us, in that
all our greatneſſe came of nothing.</p>
               <p>The fifth point is,<note place="margin">Fiftly in what eſtate God made the world.</note> 
                  <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> what eſtate God made this world in?</hi> in exceeding
good eſtate, <hi>Geneſis</hi> 1. 25. therefore if there be any creature that is not
good, or hath any defect in it, we are to thanke our ſelves, and our owne
ſinnes; as we ſee in a clocke,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> if there be any alteration or ſtop in the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
wheeles, it is becauſe there was firſt a ſtop in the great wheeles, for
the little ones doe depend on the greater wheele, ſo that if there bee a
ſtand in that, there is a ſtand in the little wheeles: in like manner if
there be any defect in the creatures, or if there be any that be not good,
it is becauſe there is a defect, and a failing in us, for man is as the great
wheele of the Clocke, therefore if hee bee out of order, no marvell
though the creatures be ſo alſo.</p>
               <p>Hence we may learne, that if there be any which be not good, or have
defect in them, wee may thanke our ſelves and our ſinnes for it: thus
much the very <hi>Heathen</hi> could tell <hi>Ionas,</hi> that becauſe there was a diſorder
in the creatures, a great tempeſt cauſing the Sea to rage, they thought
there was ſomewhat amiſſe amongſt them, therefore they caſt lots to
ſee for whose cauſe it was.<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> And this ſhall bee the firſt uſe, that ſeeing
God made all good, if there bee any defect in the creatures, wee may
thanke our ſelves, and our ſinnes.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> Seeing God made all the creatures good, wee muſt take
heede wee doe not abuſe, and turne them to evill ends; for God made
apparell to cover our ſhame, and to keepe us warme, therefore wee muſt
take heede we doe not uſe it to pride; He made our meate to feede us,
and nouriſh us, wee muſt take heede that wee abuſe it not to gluttony
and drunkenneſſe; and ſo of the reſt. If a ſervant ſhould be allowed a
candle to doe his buſineſſe by,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and ſhould therewith goe and ſet the
houſe on fire, this were not the maſters ſinne, but the ſervants, hee ſhall
anſwere for it, for his maſter gave him a candle to doe his buſineſſe by,
and not to ſet his houſe on fire: ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> we abuſe the creatures of God, and
turne them to wrong ends, the fault is not in God that gave them, but it
is our fault and we ſhall anſwere for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:17958:40"/>
Thirdly, ſeeing God made all the world good, wee ſhould wiſh to
reduce them to their former ſtate;<note place="margin">Vſe 3.</note> which ſeeing wee cannot doe, wee
ſhould labour to bring our ſelves to our former eſtate and goodneſſe
againe. And ſhould therefore apply our ſelves to the uſe of good
meanes, as preaching, prayer, reading of the word, meditation, the uſe
of the Sacraments and the like. If a man ſhould make an Image or pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
and it ſhould bee defaced,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> the eyes plucked out, or the face defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
or wanting a hand, or a part of it, if the picture had life and reaſon,
whether would it goe to be renewed, but to him that made it? ſo ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſinne hath defaced us, whither ſhould wee goe to be renewed, but to
him that made us? As <hi>David</hi> makes his requeſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 73. <hi>Thine
hands have made me, and faſhioned me, give me underſtanding that I may learne
thy commandements:</hi> even ſo ſhould we, if we feele any defects or wants
in our ſelves, goe to God, and deſire him to reſtore us againe; ſo that
although wee cannot reduce the creatures to their former eſtate, yet we
muſt labour to reſtore our ſelves againe.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, <hi>In what time the Lord made heaven and earth?</hi> hee could have
made it in a moment,<note place="margin">Sixthly, in what time God made all.</note> in ſixe houres: but hee was ſixe dayes in making
it. Here wee may ſee the great power of God, that he was able to doe
that in ſixe dayes, that all the powers of heaven and earth are not able to
doe in ſixe thouſand yeares, nay, not at all: it is a long time since the
world was made, and yet all the creatures in the world could not make
ſuch an heaven and earth in all this time, we can doe nothing without
time, although wee bee willing to doe for our friend, yet we will ſay,
I pray you give mee time, I muſt have time to doe it in: <hi>Solomon</hi> was
thirteene yeares in building the Temple, and the Iewes were fortie
yeares; but God made the world in ſixe daies. Men muſt have time
for all things; ſo we ſee <hi>Moſes</hi> was a long time in delivering the people
out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Ioſhua</hi> was ſeven yeares in placing of them: and <hi>Daniel</hi>
muſt have time to interpret the dreame,<note place="margin">Dan. 2. 16.</note> but Gods power is not tyed to
any time, hee is able at an inſtant to helpe us, and therefore wee muſt
take heed we doe not tye the power of God unto time: <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 20.
The woman that had a bloody iſſue, did but touch the hemme of
Chriſts garment, and was made whole; and <hi>Luk.</hi> 5. 13. He did but touch
the <hi>Leper,</hi> and he was made clean, and <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. when his Diſciples were
at the ſea, in great diſtreſſe, when the winds blew, and the ſhip was in
danger of ſinking, and drowning, Chriſt did but ſpeake a word, and there
was a great calme: ſuch a change the Lord can make ſtill, that if there
be any danger upon our perſons, or in our eſtates, hee is able to remove
it, and to make a great calme, in a moment: therefore wee are not to
tye Gods power to any time, hee can doe great matters in a ſhort
time.</p>
               <p>God made the world, and all things in it, in ſixe dayes, but hee was
thirty three yeeres in redeeming of us; therefore the worke of our
redemption is a greater worke than the worke of our creation. So S.
<hi>Ambrose</hi> ſaith, O Lord, I am more beholding to thee, for that thou
haſt redeemed me by thy blood of thy Sonne, when I was loſt by ſinne,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:17958:40"/>
than I am, for that thou haſt created mee by the hand of thy power.
Therefore it is a pittifull thing, that neither the worke of our creation,
nor the worke of our redemption can moove us; the Lord may ſay to
us, as hee did to the children of Iſrael in <hi>Eſai.</hi> 5. 4. <hi>What is it that I can doe
more for my vineyard, that I have not done?</hi> ſo the Lord may ſay to us, what
could I have done more for you? I have created you, and made you
reaſonable creatures, and when ye were loſt by ſinne, I have redeemed
you; I was content to bee borne of a Virgin to bee laid in a manger, to
ſhead my blood, and to dye for you: what could I have done more for
you? Wee read <hi>Gen.</hi> 30. 16. <hi>Leah</hi> ſaid unto <hi>Iacob, Come in unto mee, for I
have bought: thee, and have paid for thee with my ſonnes mandrakes;</hi> ſuch a
claime and challenge the Lord may lay to us, Come unto mee, live, and
abide with me, for I have bought you, and paid for you; I have not
onely bought you with mandrakes, but I have bought you with mine
owne blood: The Lord was but ſixe dayes in making the world, but he
was thirty three years in redeeming of it; hence this Queſtion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But why was the Lord ſixe dayes in making of this world?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Queſt.</note> he could have
made it in a moment, in ſixe houres:</p>
               <p>I anſwer,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> it was to determine the time of mans labor, that ſeeing God
did labour ſixe daies together before hee reſted, and then reſted the
ſeventh day;ſo wee ſhould labour ſixe dayes,<note place="margin">1</note> and reſt the ſeventh day;
as <hi>Leviticus</hi> 23. 3. <hi>Sixe daies ſhall worke bee done, but the ſeventh day is the
ſabbath of rest.</hi> Againe, hee was ſixe dayes to ſhew the ordinary courſe
of Gods labour, that, God brings not things together at once, but by
little and little:even as a man when hee filleth a bottle or veſſell,<note place="margin">2</note> first
hee filleth it to the quarterne, and then to the halfe, and then unto the
top,; ſo it is in the worke of grace, it is not perfect at an inſtant,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> but in
time it ſhall bee perfect; for as the Lord was ſixe daies in making of the
world, and filling it; even ſo the Lord is many dayes in furniſhing the
ſoule of man with graces, though grace bee but weake at firſt in us, yet
it ſhall be perfect in time; therefore the graces of God are compared
to a ſeede that is but little at the firſt,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and not to a ſtone, for a ſtone
groweth not; but a ſeede albeit it bee little at the beginning, yet it will
grow greater. No man therefore ought to bee diſcouraged at ſmall
beginnings of grace, for although they bee little at firſt, yet they ſhall
bee perfect in time. And although things depend on the power of
nature, yet they doe much more depend on the power of God: for
before the Lord made the Sunne, and Moone, and the ſtarres, he made
the trees to bud, and hearbs to grow; where nature was wanting,
his power was aſſiſtant; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 19. ſay the children of Iſrael, <hi>Can God
prepare a table in the wilderneſſe?</hi> they looked not to the power of God:
ſo likewiſe of <hi>Moſes</hi> who was a good man, <hi>Numb.</hi> 20. 11. it is ſaid, <hi>Hee
ſtroke the rocke twice;</hi> hee looked to the power of nature, but the power
of God is beyond the power of nature: when the power of nature
faileth, yet the power of God is able to doe anything: and therefore
wee ſee <hi>Abraham</hi> beleeved God, when the power of nature failed,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 4. <hi>Hee conſidered not the deadneſſe of his owne body, which waſ almoſt an
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:17958:41"/>
hundred yeers old, nor the deadnes of Sarahs womb; neither doubted he of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
of God through unbeleefe, but was ſtrengthened in the faith, and gave glory
to God, being fully aſſured, that he that had promiſed, was able to performe it;</hi> ſo
thou that art a Chriſtian, never doubt but that God is able to raiſe thee
out of thy ſins, or out of the grave, and to give thee life; for things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
not ſo much on the power of nature, but much more on the power
of God.</p>
               <p>Seventhly,<note place="margin">Seventhly, in what order all things were made.</note> the order, <hi>first hee made the heavens and then the earth:</hi> as
we ſee, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. And therefore where God beginnes his worke firſt, there
a Chriſtian muſt beginne his care to ſeeke for heaven; our Saviour
ſaith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 33. <hi>First, ſeeke the kingdome of God, and his righteouſneſſe,
and all other things ſhall be ministred unto you:</hi> ſo that where God beginnes
his worke, there a Chriſtian muſt beginne his care, to make heaven ſure
to himſelfe, which when hee hath done, hee may the better looke for
theſe earthly things: it is a corruption that men ſeeke for theſe earthly
things firſt, and never ſeek for heavenly till they be ſick or come to dye.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Quest.</note> in the order that God made the world, wee may obſerve
that God made all the creatures before he made man, hee was the laſt;
ſome man may ſay,<note place="margin">sol.</note> 
                  <hi>Why was He the last that was made?</hi> I anſwere, there be
three reaſons of it.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. It was to honour man.</item>
                  <item>2. To teach him.</item>
                  <item>3. To further him in the beſt things.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Reaſon 1.</note> it was <hi>to honour man,</hi> for it was a great honour to man, that
God did not bring him into a bare and naked world, but that hee had
firſt furniſhed it with all things needefull for mans uſe and delight.<note place="margin">Simile.</note>
Even as a king when he is purpoſed to goe to a towne, or place, his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
goeth before, all is furniſhed, and made ready before hee comes,
which makes for the honour of the King: ſo God had made all for
mans uſe, and had furniſhed the world with them, before he made man.
This ſerves for the honour of man, and therefore ſeeing God hath ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
man, let us labour to honour him againe.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Reaſon 2.</note> 
                  <hi>to teach man,</hi> that hee was not the maker of them; for
if all the creatures were made before man was made, he being the laſt,
and there found them all before, this is a plaine evidence that man made
them not: and therefore if there be any creature that is comfortable or
delightfull to us, God is to be thanked and praiſed for it, not our ſelves.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Reaſon 3.</note> 
                  <hi>to further man in the beſt things,</hi> for the Lord provided all
things for the uſe of man to delight him, that he might take the more
time to provide for heavenly things; for the richer a man is, and the
more plentifull the Lord hath provided for Him, the better heart and
encouragement hee may take to looke after the things of eternall life,
and the greater vantage hee hath in the worſhip and ſervice of God.
Therefore when as God doth give a man riches, and furniſh him with
all things needefull for his life, he ſhould not miſſpend them, neither in
wantonneſſe or prophaneneſſe, in ſwilling or drinking, and ſuch like;
but he ſhould take the more time for things of eternal life, as <hi>Deu.</hi> 10. 12.

                  <hi>the end,</hi> why God made this world, and all things: It was
for mans good, and mans benefit. It was to do good to mankinde that
God made Heaven and earth, the Sunne, Moone and ſtarres, that hee
made all the creatures. And whereas God was moſt bleſſed in himſelfe,
before there was a Heaven or earth, and needed not to have beene grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
with our ſinnes; yet notwithſtanding Hee was not content to bee
bleſſed in himſelfe, and to keepe it, but hee would communicate his

Saviour;</hi> wee beleeve that <hi>Ieſus</hi> is a Saviour, and will ſave us at the day
of death, and at the day of judgement: As <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. <hi>For the Sonne of
man is come to ſave that which was lost:</hi> And 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 15. <hi>This is a true ſaying,</hi>
ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>and by all meanes worthy to bee received, that Christ Ieſus
came into the world to ſave ſinners, &amp;c.</hi> So <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 14. <hi>And wee have ſeene,
and doe testifie that the Father ſent his Sonne to bee the Saviour of the world.</hi>
So that if hee bee the true Saviour of the world, all that will be ſaved,
muſt ſeeke to bee ſaved by him, for God ſaveth not, but by the meanes
which hee himſelfe hath appointed; therefore wee muſt ſeeke to that.
It is a rule in Divinity, <hi>That ſuch meanes as God hath appointed for the
ſaving of us,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> 
                  <hi>ſuch wee must applie our ſelves to;</hi> as God appointed an <hi>Arke</hi>
for ſaving of <hi>Noab</hi> and his family from drowning, ſo that all that would
bee ſaved muſt flie to the <hi>Arke:</hi> ſo likewiſe if any were ſtung with the
firy ſerpents, hee had appointed a braſen ſerpent, that if any, bitten
with the firy ſerpent, looked up, they ſhould bee holpen; and if any
were ſtung, and did not looke up, and caſt up their eyes there on the
braſen ſerpent, they were not helped: Even ſo God hath appointed
<hi>Ieſus</hi> to bee the meanes of ſalvation, therefore all that will bee ſaved,
muſt ſeeke to <hi>Ieſus</hi> to bee ſaved. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 37. <hi>Iohn</hi> as ſoone as hee pointed
at <hi>Ieſus,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>Behold the Lambe of God: the two Diſciples left all and
followed him:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſo wee ſhould doe, when wee heare it is <hi>Ieſus</hi> that muſt
ſave us, at the day of death and judgement, we ſhould bee contented to
leave all pleaſures,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> and profits, and our ſinnes, and whatſoever is deare
to us, to bee ſaved by <hi>Ieſus.</hi> But it is a pittifull thing that men deſire to
bee ſaved at the day of judgement, and after death to bee bleſſed, and
yet never ſeeke to Chriſt: Chriſt complaineth of this in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 40.
<hi>But yee will not come unto me, that ye might have life.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay,
yee deſire to be bleſſed, and to bee ſaved, but yee will not come to me,
to have life, and to bee ſaved. It is the ſinne of the world, that they
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:17958:42"/>
intend matters of pleaſure, and profit, and never ſeeke to Chriſt to bee
ſaved; if a ſtrange Chirurgion, or Phyſition ſhould come into the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
if wee conceive him to bee good,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> or heare hee is, O how men
will ſeeke to him, that they may be holpen of their diſeaſe, or of their
wounds, but here is the fault, that men do not ſeeke to <hi>Ieſus,</hi> who is able
to bring light out of darkeneſſe, health out of ſickeneſſe, life out of
death.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> ſeeing <hi>Ieſus</hi> is the Saviour, therefore wee muſt bring our
wives, and children, our ſervants, friends and them wee wiſh well, to
<hi>Christ Ieſus</hi> to bee ſaved. <hi>Mark.</hi> 2. 3. There was a man ſicke of the
Palſey, who becauſe hee was not able to come himſelfe, was brought
by foure men, and preſented before Chriſt, and ſo was healed; ſo wee
ſhould doe, preſent our children and friends at the feet of Chriſt by
prayer, and them wee wiſh well to, that hee may ſave and bleſſe them,
As <hi>Mark.</hi> 10. 14. <hi>They brought little children to him, that hee might touch
them:</hi> A learned man ſaith well, hee is the Saviour of little children,
therefore we muſt bring them, to Chriſt, and preſent them by prayer to
him, that he may ſave and bleſſe them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, ſeeing <hi>Ieſus</hi> is the Saviour, it ſhewes naturally, wee are
all loſt in our ſelves,<note place="margin">Vſe 3.</note> under the curſe of God, and out of the eſtate of
Salvation, and therefore muſt ſeeke to Chriſt to be ſaved, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.
11. <hi>The Sonne of man is come to ſeeke, and to ſave that which is lost:</hi> as a loſt
ſheepe is not at reſt,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> but runnes here and there and cryes to the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard,
and is not at reſt till hee bee in the fould againe: ſo wee ſhould
doe, wee ſhould cry to the ſhepheard, and never be at reſt, till wee bee
brought home to God againe.</p>
               <p>In the words of the Angell wee may obſerve three things:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Whom he ſhall ſave;</hi> his owne people.</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>By what meanes;</hi> not by ſtrong hand, or fighting for them, but
by dying and ſuffering for them.</item>
                  <item>3. <hi>From what he ſhall ſave them;</hi> from their ſinnes.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Firſt, whom he ſhall ſave.</note> 
                  <hi>whom hee ſhall ſave:</hi> he ſhall ſave his owne people; ſo that if we
bee not the people of Chriſt, we cannot bee ſaved. A number of men
thinke that ſeeing all bee ſinners, and Chriſt dyed for ſinners, therefore
all ſhall bee ſaved; but this is an error in the world, for hee ſhall ſave
none but his owne people: and therefore if wee will be ſaved, we muſt
labour to bee the people of Chriſt, obedient to his commandements, to
live under his government, and to bee guided and governed by him in
all our actions; for if wee bee not gathered home unto him, obey him,
and live under his government, we are none of his people, and then we
cannot looke to bee ſaved. It is ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18. 27. <hi>Hee will ſave the humble,
and will cast downe the proud.</hi> Now who bee the humble people, even
ſuch as bee brought low upon the conſideration of their ſinnes, and ſit
under the burthen of them at the feet of Chriſt, theſe bee the people
that ſhall be ſaved.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Secondly, bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Christ ſaves his people.</note> 
                  <hi>how hee ſhall ſave them,</hi> not by ſtrong hand, nor by fighting
for them, but by ſuffering for them; as it is ſaid, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. <hi>Behold the Lambe of
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:17958:43"/>
God that taketh away the ſinnes of the world:</hi> even as the lambe in the Law,
typified the taking away of ſinne, ſo Ieſus tooke away our ſinne. In
the Law when they brought a Lambe to offer,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> the man made confeſſion
of his ſinnes on the head of the Lambe, and put them vpon the Lambe,
the Lambe was killed, and the man went free: ſo all our ſinnes was lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on Chriſt, He was killed, and wee goe free, Ieſus ſaveth us, by giving
his life for us: as <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. 28. His patterne is propoſed unto us, <hi>Even as
the Sonne of man came not to be ſerved, but to ſerve, and to give his life for the
ranſome of many;</hi> ſo 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 24. <hi>Who his owne ſelfe bare our ſinnes in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
on the tree, that wee being delivered from ſinne ſhould live in righteouſneſſe, by
whoſe ſtripes we are healed.</hi> Ieſus did ſave us, by giving his ſoule and body
as a ranſome for us, our ſinnes were put upon him, he tooke our roome
and place, and ſo ſtood as a malefactor before God, arraigned and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
for us, and ſuffered the torment that we ſhould have ſuffered:
thus did Ieſus ſave us, by interpoſing and giving himſelfe to pay for us
whatſoever God would require at our hands, and therefore as <hi>Rebekkah</hi>
ſaid to her ſonne <hi>Iacob, Gen.</hi> 27. 12. (when he was loth to goe to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to ſteale the bleſſing) <hi>On me, my ſonne, bee the curſe;</hi> if there be any
bleſſing, or benefit to be found, on thee bee the bleſſing, but on mee the
curſe; ſo Chriſt ſaith to his people, if there be any bleſſing, or if there
be any good, or benefit, on you be the bleſſing, on you be the good, and
benefit, but on mee (my people) be the curſe. Thus Chriſt taketh the
ſowre, and leaves us the ſweet, this is the royall exchange wee make
with Chriſt. When <hi>Oneſimus</hi> was runne away from his Maſter <hi>Phile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
and had ſtolne away things from him; being converted, Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> ſent him home againe with a letter, as wee ſee <hi>Philemon</hi> 18. and
ſaith, <hi>If he hath done thee any wrong, or any injury, ſet it upon my ſcore, I will
pay thee, I Paul have written it with my owne hand:</hi> ſo Ieſus doth to us; wee
bee all runne away from God, have done injury, and wrong to him,
Chriſt meets with us, and ſends us backe againe with a Letter in our
hands to this effect;<note place="margin">Christs letter to the Father.</note> Father, if they have done thee any wrong or injury,
doe not require it at their hands, but put it on my croſſe, put it on my
ſcore, I will anſwere thee, I Ieſus have not written it with inke and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
but with my owne Blood. Therefore ſeeing he hath ſaved us by
dying for us, let us take heede wee doe not deſpiſe this great ſalvation
which Ieſus hath wrought for us; <hi>Eſay,</hi> 53. 11. it is ſaid, <hi>he ſhall ſee the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell
of his ſoule, and ſhall be ſatisfied;</hi> Chriſt hath laboured and travelled for
us, and it coſt him ſore labour too, now he hath not laboured for our
meate, money; nor our goods, but hee hath laboured for our ſoules to
bring us to repentance, to faith, and unto God; therefore if wee bee
brought to repentance, if to faith, if to God, this will ſatisfie Chriſt, this
will rejoyce him, but if he cannot ſee the travell of his ſoule, then it will
repent and grieve him, that ever he ſwet in the garden, dyed on the
croſſe for us; therefore let Chriſt ſee the travell of his ſoule, and this
will ſatisfie Ieſus: and thus Chriſt ſaved us not by ſtrong hand, by figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
for us, but by ſuffering and dying for us.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>from what hee ſaved us;</hi> He ſaved us from our ſinnes: It is a
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:17958:43"/>
ſweet thing to bee ſaved from ſickneſſe, from fire and water, from the
ſword, but it is a greater matter to be ſaved from our ſinnes, than to bee
ſaved from ſword, fire and water; for wee may bee ſaved from theſe
things, and yet our ſoules may periſh, therefore the greateſt matter is,
to bee ſaved from our ſinnes, which howſoever we doe not ſee it now,
yet one day wee ſhall; for one of theſe dayes wee ſhall dye (wee know
not how ſoone) and then we ſhall ſee what a great matter it is to bee ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from our ſinnes; and at the day of judgement when the heavens
ſhall melt with fire, and the earth ſhall bee diſſolved, and heaven open
above us, and hell underneath us, and the divell ready to accuſe us.
Then we ſhall ſee what a great bleſſing the pardon of ſinnes is: from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things therebee divers wayes and meanes to ſave us, but to ſave us
from our ſinnes there is but one meanes, and that is the blood of Chriſt,
therefore howſoever we are thankfull to God for other deliverances,
yet above all, let us be thankfull that God hath ſaved us from our ſinnes,
for he is a bleſſed man that is thus ſaved from his ſinnes, whatſoever his
eſtate be in this world. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. 1. <hi>Bleſſed is hee whoſe wickedneſſe is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given,
and whoſe ſinne is covered:</hi> he that is ſaved from his ſinnes is a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
and a happy man.</p>
               <p>There bee two dangerous things in ſinne,<note place="margin">Guilt of Sinne what.</note> 
                  <hi>the Guilt of ſinne,</hi> and <hi>the
Power of ſinne,</hi> both theſe wee are ſaved from: the Guilt of ſinne is the
binding of a man over to anſwer for it at the judgement ſeate of God;
and the Power of ſinne is the ruling and raging of ſinne in a man.
Now both theſe Chriſt ſaveth us from, from the Guilt of ſinne, and the
Power of ſinne, for hee ſaveth no man from the Guilt of ſinne, but in
ſome meaſure he ſaveth him from the Power of ſinne: it is true indeed
that therebee ſinnes and weakneſſes in the people of God, and will be
ſo long as wee carry fraile fleſh about us (for wee are regenerated but in
part) therefore if there bee a ſtriving againſt ſinne,<note place="margin">Triall.</note> if there be a hatred,
a loathing, and a diſtaſting of them, then we are in ſome meaſure ſaved
from the Power of ſinne, and from the Guilt thereof; but if wee doe
not finde this ſtriving againſt it, this hatred and loathing of it, then wee
are not ſaved as yet from the Power of ſinne, nor the Guilt thereof.
How ſhall a man know that lyeth in the jayle,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> whether his friend hath
procured a pardon from the king or no; if the Iaylor come and knocke
off the manacles on his hands, and the chaines off his feet, by this hee
ſhall know his friend hath procured a pardon for him; but if this party
lye in the jayle ſtill, bound in his fetters and chaines, then it ſhewes
there is no pardon come. So we may know when Chriſt hath procured
a pardon for us or not, if wee feele the chaines and fetters of ſinne to be
taken off from us, a hatred, and loathing of them, a ſtriving againſt
them, it is a good ſigne, but if wee finde our ſelves faſt bound in our
ſinnes, and continue in them, then as yet wee cannot aſſure our ſelves
they be pardoned.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing that is implyed in the title <hi>Ieſus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Secondly, that there is no Ieſus but our Ieſus.</note> is; <hi>That there is
no other Ieſus but this Ieſus in the matters of ſalvation and redemption,</hi> for there
is no ſalvation to bee found, but onely in him: as <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 12. <hi>Neither is
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:17958:44"/>
there ſalvation in any other, for among men there is given no other name under
heaven, whereby wee must bee ſaved.</hi> In the time of the Law there were
divers Saviours, as wee may ſee, <hi>Iud.</hi> 2. 16. it is ſaid, that <hi>the Lord raiſed
up Iudges to deliver, or to ſave them, out of their oppreſſors hands;</hi> but all theſe
Saviours were but petty Saviours in regard of <hi>Ieſus,</hi> for they could not
ſave their bodies, or their goods, but <hi>Ieſus</hi> ſaveth our ſoules: as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.
18. <hi>Behold, the eye of the Lord is upon them that feare him, and upon them that
trust in his mercy to deliver their ſoules from death,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>and to preſerve them in
famine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, theſe Saviours can but ſave us from tyrants and worldly
miſery;<note place="margin">2</note> but <hi>Ieſus</hi> ſaveth us from hell, the divell, and damnation. As
<hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 74. <hi>That we being delivered from the hands of our enemies ſhould ſerve
him without feare all the daies of our life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> they could but ſave them for a time, for when they were
dead, ſtraight way they were oppreſſed againe; but Chriſt hath wrought
eternall redemption for us: ſo it is ſaid, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 9. <hi>And being conſecrated
he was made the Author of eternall Salvation, unto all them that obey him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4</note> theſe Saviours can ſave but for one age, they could not
ſave them that were before them, nor them that come after them; but
<hi>Ieſus</hi> ſaveth men in all ages from the beginning of the world, to the
latter end of it.</p>
               <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5</note> although they ſaved others, yet they could not ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
as <hi>Ioſhua</hi> was diſcomfited when hee went to <hi>Aye:</hi> and <hi>Sampſon</hi>
had his eyes plucked out: therefore all theſe Saviours were but petty
Saviours in reſpect of <hi>Ieſus,</hi> and beſide <hi>Ieſus</hi> there is no Saviour in the
matters of ſalvation and redemption.</p>
               <p>The uſe is,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> firſt, that ſeeing there is no <hi>Ieſus</hi> can ſave us, but this <hi>Ieſus,</hi>
wee may ſee the horribleneſſe of our ſinneſ, and the grievouſneſſe of
them, for when wee have ſinned, no Angell could ſave us, no Saint nor
all the powers in heaven or earth, but it muſt caſt the blood of the
Sonne of God, it muſt be hee that muſt make atonement for us; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
(as <hi>Augustine</hi> ſaith) O man, by the greatneſſe of the price that was
paid for thee, thou maieſt conſider the greatneſſe of thy ſinnes, for it
was not a ſmall matter that made God to kill his owne Sonne; and
therefore by the greatneſſe of the price, conſider the greatneſſe of thy
ſinnes.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> ſeeing there is no <hi>Ieſus</hi> can ſave us but this <hi>Ieſus,</hi> we ſhould
be carefull to avoide every ſinne, and to decline from it; for when wee
have ſinned, there is no power in heaven and earth whereby we can bee
ſaved, but it muſt coſt the blood of Chriſt. If a man ſhould for every
lye hee told,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> or every ſinne committed, loſe but a drop of his owne
blood, how affraid would he be of ſinning? Now there is never a ſinne
that we doe commit but it hath coſt blood, either it will coſt our blood,
or the blood of the Sonne of God, and therefore how affraid ſhould we
be of ſinning againſt God, leſt we ſhould be more laviſh of the blood of
Chriſt, than we would be of our owne.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> we beleeve, that as he is Ieſus in generall, ſo he will bee our
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:17958:44"/>
Ieſus, and will ſave us at the day of death and judgement. This is our
comfort when wee are perſwaded that Ieſus is not onely a Saviour to
others,<note place="margin">Thirdly, that hee will be our Ieſus.</note> but hee is a Saviour to us. <hi>Thomas</hi> could have no true comfort,
till he could ſay, <hi>My God, and my Lord;</hi> and this it was that comforted
<hi>Iob, I know my Redeemer liveth, &amp;c.</hi> This alſo was a comfort to <hi>David,</hi>
(ſaith he) <hi>I ſhould have fainted,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iob 19.</note> 
                  <hi>but that I beleeved to ſee the goodneſſe of God in
the Land of the living:</hi> here then is the comfort of a Chriſtian, when he
can apply and appropriate Chriſt to himſelfe.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> A man can have but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
comfort of a houſe or land when hee is ſhewed it, unleſſe it bee his
owne: ſo we can have but little comfort by Chriſt, unleſſe we can ſay,
that Chriſt is as truly ours, as this houſe or land wee enjoy is ours; and
as truely may a Chriſtian ſay, that all Chriſts merits is his, as a man may
ſay his coate on his backe is his.</p>
               <p>But <hi>how ſhall we come to know that Chriſt is ours?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Quest.</note> I anſwere,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> if wee bee
his people, if we be contented to be guided and governed by him, if we
will obey his voyce, then we be his people; but if we will not be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
home unto him, to live under his government, be guided by him and
obey his voyce, we are none of his, neither can we rightly apply him to
our comfort.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing we beleeve of Ieſus is,<note place="margin">The ſecond Branch is, that Jeſus i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> that Chriſt.</note> that this <hi>Ieſus</hi> that was the
Sonne of <hi>Mary,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 2. 36.</note> and borne at <hi>Bethlem</hi> is the <hi>Chriſt;</hi> as <hi>Peter</hi> ſhewes, <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let all the houſe of Iſrael for a ſurely know, that God hath made him both
Lord and Chriſt:</hi> this is alſo the confeſſion the Diſciples made of him,
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. 69. <hi>And we beleeve and know that thou art the Chriſt, the Sonne of the
living God:</hi> and <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 22. <hi>But Saul increaſed the more in ſtrength, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
the Iewes that dwelt at Damaſcus, proving that this was the Chriſt:</hi>
and ſo the <hi>Angels,</hi> proclaime him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 10. <hi>Be not afraid,</hi> ſaith the
Angell unto them, <hi>for behold, I bring you tydings of great joy that ſhall be to
all people,</hi> That is, <hi>That unto you this day is borne in the city of David a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
which is Chriſt the Lord:</hi> ſo the Angell proclaimed that <hi>Ieſus</hi> was the
Sonne of <hi>Mary,</hi> and borne at <hi>Bethlem:</hi> the devils alſo confeſſe him to
be Chriſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4 41. ſo then there can be no queſtion of this, but that
Ieſus is the Chriſt. Now <hi>Chriſt</hi> is a Greeke word, and doth ſignifie
<hi>Anointed,</hi> as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. 15. <hi>Touch not mine Anointed, &amp;c. Anointed</hi> is as

and ſaving of man; he did not intrude and thruſt himſelfe into this
calling, but he was appointed of God unto it: ſo <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 4. <hi>And no man
taketh this honour unto himſelfe, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron: ſo
likewiſe Chriſt tooke not this honour to be high Prieſt, but he that ſaid unto him,
Thou art my Sonne, this day begat I thee,</hi> gave it him: ſo that Chriſt did
not intrude, and thruſt himſelfe upon it, but it was God that put him
upon the buſineſſe, and appointed him for the worke of redemption.
Chriſt ſaith of himſelfe, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7. 28. <hi>Yet am I not come of my ſelfe, but hee that
ſent me is true whom ye know not.</hi> And ſo <hi>Peter, Let all the houſe of Iſrael know
of a ſurety,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 2. 36.</note> 
                  <hi>that God hath made him both Lord and Chriſt.</hi> Now what may
this teach us, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> would not enter upon ſo needefull a buſineſſe,
and ſo great a worke, as the ſaving of mens ſoules, that he would not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude
or thruſt himſelfe upon it, till hee was aſſigned and appointed of
God.</p>
               <p>This therefore muſt teach us,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> that we ſhould not intrude or thruſt our
ſelves upon any buſineſſe, or upon any calling, till it bee aſſigned or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
of God unto us. This is the reaſon in the Scripture, why the
holy men are ſo carefull to approve their calling; as <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. 15. <hi>And
God ſpake further unto Moſes, Thus ſhalt thou ſay unto the Children of Iſrael;
The Lord God of your Fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Iſaak, the God of
Iacob hath ſent me unto you:</hi> ſo <hi>David</hi> confeſſes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18. 43. <hi>Thou haſt
made me the head of the Gentiles:</hi> ſo <hi>Ier.</hi> 17. 16. <hi>But I have not thruſt in my
ſelfe for a Pastor after thee:</hi> and <hi>Amos</hi> 7. 14. <hi>Then anſwered Amos and ſaid
unto Amaziah, I was no Prophet, neither was I a Prophets ſonne, but I was an
heardman, and gathered wild figgs, and the Lord tooke me, as I followed the
flocke, and the Lord ſaid unto me, Goe propheſie unto my people Iſrael.</hi> Thus wee
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:17958:45"/>
ſee that we ſhould not attempt or thruſt our ſelves upon any buſineſſe or
calling, till we be aſſigned or appointed of God to it: we read <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.
14. when the man came to Chriſt to have divided his Inheritance,
<hi>Man,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>who made mee a judge and a divider?</hi> wee ſee that Chriſt
would not intrude himſelfe into that hee was not aſſigned to. What
ſhall we ſay then to them that are ready to thruſt themſelves upon eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
matter like <hi>Peter, Iohn</hi> 21. 22. When Chriſt had told him, what
ſhould befall him, <hi>Peter ſaith to Chriſt, What ſhall this man doe?</hi> Chriſts an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
is, <hi>What is that to thee?</hi> Looke to thine owne buſineſſe, and looke
to thy owne calling: ſo when we are buſie about other mens callings or
matters, and intrude into them, not having any calling from God,
Chriſts reproofe may well be applyed, <hi>what is that to thee?</hi> meddle with
thy owne buſineſſe,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and calling. A river as long as it keepes within his
owne bankes runnes cleare; but if it ſwell and flow over the bankes, it
gathereth a great deale of ſoile, and baggage: ſo as long as a man
keepes within his bounds, and bankes, all is well, but if hee once breake
over, then hee gathereth a great deale of corruption; therefore men
muſt have wiſedome not to intrude or meddle with a buſineſſe, till they
have a calling from God, ſeeing Chriſt would not take a needefull
worke upon him, till he was appointed of God unto it.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> ſeeing God appointed and aſſigned unto Chriſt this office
of Redeeming and ſaving us, and that he is well pleaſed with him, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we ſhould ſo accept of him, and receive him: as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 12. <hi>Kiſſe the
Sonne leſt he be angry;</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, bee ready to entertaine, and to
take him as the Lord of your life: the reaſon whereof is given before,
verſe 6. <hi>Becauſe he hath ſet him as King upon Sion his holy mountaine,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we muſt kiſſe him, and ſeeke to have his favour, and to receive him
as the Lord of our life. We read <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 11. it was the ſinne of the <hi>Iewes</hi>
that <hi>Chriſt came amongſt his owne, and his owne received him not;</hi> if they had
beene ſtrangers, and had not knowne him to bee <hi>Chriſt,</hi> then the matter
had been the leſſe, but when they knew him (yet did not receive him,)
this made their ſinne the greater; ſo if wee bee ſtrangers to him, and
know him not to be the <hi>Chriſt,</hi> our ſins are the leſſe, if we do not receive
him and entertaine him; but if wee know him, that God hath made
him <hi>Chriſt,</hi> then our ſins are ſo much the greater. When <hi>Peter</hi> had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
him to be <hi>Chriſt</hi> unto the <hi>Iewes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 2. 37.</note> ſtraight way <hi>they were pricked in
their hearts,</hi> and were ready to receive him: O that this might worke
the like affection in us, that when wee heare that God hath made him
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the Lord of life, that wee might be pricked in our hearts, and
be contented to let all goe, to lay hold of him.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">The ſecond worke of Anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting was, to ſhew ſufficiencie for the worke.</note> this anointing was to be done upon the People to ſhew
that he ſo choſen, was furniſhed with all gifts and graces fit to diſcharge
the calling and worke he was aſſigned unto. For as I have ſhewed, in the
Law Anointing was an outward ſigne, that the party Anointed was
gifted and graced, and had indowments of God given him fit to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
the calling and worke hee was aſſigned unto; ſo the Scripture
ſpeaketh of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that he was <hi>Anointed,</hi> he had the gifts and graces of
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:17958:46"/>
the Spirit powred upon him, hee was not a weake one, but he was ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
of God for the worke of redemption. In <hi>Eſay,</hi> it is ſaid, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
make me no prince, nor I can be no helper, I have no bread in my
houſe, nor clothing; but <hi>Chriſt</hi> cannot ſay ſo, for God hath fitted him
with gifts and graces to doe the worke hee hath aſſigned him unto. Of
Chriſt it is ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 19. <hi>Thou ſpeakeſt then in a viſion unto thine holy
One, and ſaideſt, I have laid helpe upon one that is mighty;</hi> ſo then, it is not laid
upon one that is a weake man, to faint under the burden, but one that is
mighty, able to goe through with that he is appointed; and therefore
as mighty <hi>Sampſon roſe at midnight,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iudg. 16. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>and carried away the gates of Gaza unto
the top of an high mountaine;</hi> ſo this Chriſt the mighty one hath riſen
from death and carried away the gates of hell, and of death, and is aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
into Heaven: by reaſon whereof <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25. It is ſaid, <hi>He is able per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
to ſave them, that came unto God by him, ſeeing he liveth ever to make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion
for them:</hi> therefore wee come not to a weake man, as the other
high Prieſts were, but to a mighty One. This is a comfort unto a
Chriſtian that God hath furniſhed him with gifts and graces, and hath
enabled him to goe through this great worke of redemption, therefore
he will not leave it in the middle, but will goe through with the great
worke aſſigned him: it was the comfort of the Leper, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. when
he came to Chriſt, that <hi>if Chriſt would, he could make him cleane:</hi> ſo it is the
comfort of a Chriſtian when hee knowes there is power in Chriſt to
helpe him, that Chriſt the Lord, if hee will, can make him cleane and
ſave him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">The third uſe of Anointing, was acceptation of all he dealt with.</note> by his anointing the party was made gratefull, and accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to all that had to deale with him, as in the Law the Prieſts and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
and Kings, ſuch as were anointed, drew all to them (whom they
had to doe withall) in delight of their perſons and their ſweet anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that was powred upon them; ſo the anointing of Chriſt, and the
ſweete graces of the Spirit powred without meaſure on him, doth draw
all that have to deale with him, to delight in him. His Perſon was firſt
acceptable to God; ſecondly, to the Church.</p>
               <p>Firſt, hee was acceptable to God; as <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 2. it is ſaid, <hi>And hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
himſelfe for us to be an offering and a ſacrifice of a ſweete ſmelling ſavour to
God.</hi> When our ſinnes were upon him, they made a ſtrong and ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſmell in the noſtrils of God, the ſinnes wee live in, and be guilty of;
therefore if it were not for this ſame ſweete ointment that is powred
out on him, (the graces of his Spirit,) our ſinnes would make us odious,
and hatefull in the ſight of God, ſuch a ſtrange and ſtinking ſmell our
ſinnes have. Now as the Perſon of Chriſt was made delightfull and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to God, ſo he was acceptable to the Church: as <hi>Cantic.</hi> 1. 2. it
is ſaid, <hi>Becauſe of the ſavor of thy good ointments, thy Name is as a pretious oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
powred forth, therefore doe the virgins love thee;</hi> all that be virgins, that
have chaſt ſoules: ſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 8. All thy garments ſmell of Myrrh, Aloes and
Caſſia, therefore Kings daughters ſtand at thy right hand, and the honourable
women, the gallant people of the world, are drawne by the ſweetneſſe
of his cloathes. But it is a pitifull thing to ſee the world doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:17958:46"/>
light in the preſence of Chriſt, and are not drawne unto him: the reaſon
is, becauſe they doe not ſmell the ſweet ointment that was powred out
upon Chriſt, they ſmell a ſweetneſſe in their pleaſures, profits, and in
their ſinnes, but they doe not ſmell the ſweet ointment powred out on
Chriſt; and therefore they doe not ſeeke to him, and delight in him.
We ſee in the Goſpell that the people flocked, thronged, and followed
after Chriſt three daies journey together, what was the reaſon of it? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they had taſted of the Spirit, and had ſmelt of this ſame ſweet
ointment, which made them leave all and follow him: ſo the graces that
were powred upon him, made him delightfull to all that had to deale
with him, to God, and to the Church.</p>
               <p>The ſecond maine thing is,<note place="margin">Secondly, with what he was anointed.</note> 
                  <hi>with what he was anointed:</hi> in the Law
they were anointed with materiall oyle; As 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. <hi>Samuel powred out
an horne of oyle on Saul</hi> but Chriſt was not anointed with materiall oyle,
but with the holy Ghoſt, with the gifts of the Spirit, of which the oyle
was but a ſhadow; as <hi>Eſai.</hi> 61. 1. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, becauſe
the Lord hath anointed me;</hi> therefore the anointing of Chriſt is not by
powring out materiall oyle on him, but by powring out the gifts and
graces of the Spirit upon him; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 7. it is ſaid, that <hi>God had Anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him with the oyle of gladneſſe above his followes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the reaſon why these graces are compared to oyle is,<note place="margin">The Graces of the Spirit com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to Oyle. Firſt, Oyle ſof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens.</note> becauſe
oyle will ſoften, and make a thing ſupple; for take a little oyle and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint
any one part, and it will make that part lithy and nimble; or take
a little oyle, and put it into a locke, and it will make it nimble to ſtirre
this way, and that way: ſo if once a little of this oyle bee powred into
our hearts, it will make us quicke and nimble which before were ſlow
and dull in the ſervice of God; this is one reaſon why it is compared to
oyle. <hi>Of Sampſon Iudg.</hi> 14. it is ſaid, <hi>that the Spirit of God came upon him,</hi> and
then he was able to doe great matters; and <hi>Acts.</hi> 2. when <hi>the holy Ghoſt
came downe upon the diſciples in cloven tongues,</hi> then they were able to ſpeake
to Gods glory;<note place="margin">1 Sam. 19. 23.</note> and when <hi>the Spirit of God came upon Saul he would prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie:</hi>
ſo then wee ſee the Spirit of God will make a man fit and nimble
for any ſervice that God doth call unto; many men complaine they bee
heavy harted, and dull in the ſervice of God, and they cannot pray, let
them get but a little of this oyle, and it will make them fit for any ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
and duty that God requireth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is called <hi>the Oyle of gladneſſe,</hi> becauſe it makes every man
glad that hath it,<note place="margin">Secondly, Oyle makes cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</note> for let a man have but a drop of this Oyle and it will
make him glad, more to rejoyce than all things elſe: The worldly man
delights in his profits, the wanton in his pleaſure, but if we have but a
drop of this oyle, it will make us rejoyce in the love and favour of God.
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. 6, 7. <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Lord lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us,
this ſhall glad our hearts more, than they of their great increaſe of corne, and wine
and oyle:</hi> ſo if wee get but a little of this oyle, the graces of his Spirit it
will make us glad. <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 37. The <hi>Eunuch</hi> had but a little of this oyle, and
he went away rejoycing: the city of <hi>Samaria</hi> had but a little of this
oyle, and they received the word with great joy. There be a number
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:17958:47"/>
complaine they cannot be merry, they have joy in nothing; the reaſon
is, becauſe they want this oyle; therefore let us fling away our ſinnes
and corruptions, labour to repent of them and get of this oyle, that
makes every man glad, which made <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> ſing at midnight in a
dungeon,<note place="margin">Act. 16. 25.</note> and the three Children rejoyce in the firy furnace, and <hi>Peter</hi>
ſleepe in his chaines: what was the reaſon of this? becauſe they had
got a little of this oyle of gla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>neſſe. Therefore no marvell though men
cannot be merry if they want this oyle, for if they have it, it will make
them riſe at midnight to ſing Pſalmes, and will make them ſleepe ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the time of trouble. Therefore it is our comfort whatſoever Chriſt
hath done in the worke of redemption, God will accept of it.</p>
               <p>The third point is,<note place="margin">Thirdly, with what he was Anointed.</note> 
                  <hi>who it was that did anoint him:</hi> It was God; as
<hi>Pſalm.</hi> 45. <hi>God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oyle of gladneſſe above
thy fellowes:</hi> ſo <hi>Peter, Act.</hi> 2. 36. <hi>Let all the houſe of Iſrael know for a ſurety,
that God hath made him Lord and Chriſt:</hi> In the Law wee ſee one man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed
another, as <hi>Moſes</hi> anointed <hi>Aaron; Samuel</hi> anointed <hi>Saul,</hi> and
<hi>Elias</hi> anointed <hi>Eliſha:</hi> but it was God that did Anoint Chriſt. Of this
there be three Vſes:</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> ſeeing God hath anointed him, he is the Lords Anointed, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we muſt take heede we doe no injury and wrong to Chriſt; as <hi>Pſal.</hi>
105. 15. <hi>Touch not mine Anointed, &amp;c.</hi> if hee bee Gods Anointed take
heed we doe not wrong him. Why may a man doe wrong, and injury
to Chriſt? I anſwere with <hi>Paul, Heb.</hi> 10. <hi>He that ſinneth willingly, there is no
repentance for him, but a fearefull looking for of judgement.</hi> If men ſinne and
will not repent, but live in them without repentance, and commit ſinnes
againſt their knowledge wittingly and willingly, grieving God, tramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and treading under foot the bloud of the ſonne of God in the duſt,
and making it of none effect.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that ſeeing he is Gods Anointed take heede we doe no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
or wrong to Chriſt in his members;<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> for a man doing wrong to a
Chriſtian may doe wrong to Chriſt in his members: it is Saint <hi>Pauls</hi>
doctrine, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 12. <hi>When yee ſinne ſo againſt the brethren, and wound their
weake conſcience, ye ſinne againſt Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Vſe 3.</note> ſeeing God hath anointed him, therefore wee muſt anoint
him, our hands muſt follow the hands of God: wee ſee in the Goſpell,
the woman got a boxe of coſtly ointment, and did powre it on Chriſt aſ
he ſate at the Table: ſo we muſt doe, get a box of ointment, and powre
it out on Chriſt, and ſo anoint him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bernard</hi> ſhewes there be three ſorts of ointment.<note place="margin">1</note> Firſt, to anoint the
feete of Chriſt, as the woman that we read of <hi>Luk.</hi> 7. 46. ſo a Chriſtian
muſt begin at the feete of Chriſt firſt. And with what muſt he anoint
him? firſt, with the oyle of contrition, griefe and ſorrow for his
ſinnes, to ſit downe at the feete of Chriſt, and to lament and mourne for
them; there is no ointment that is bought at the Apothecaries ſhop ſo
ſweete to us, as this oyle of contrition is to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, wee muſt anoint the head of Chriſt; as the woman wee
read of <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 7. And with what? with the oyle of devotion, with
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:17958:47"/>
the beſt dutie and ſervice we can doe unto him: if we know any thing
that will pleaſe God beſt, that we ſhould doe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we ſhould anoint the body of Chriſt, as <hi>Ioſeph of Aramathea</hi>
did,<note place="margin">3</note> he bought a great deale of ſweete ſpices to anoint the body of
Chriſt; and ſo we muſt do: but with what ſhould we anoint the body
of Chriſt? with the oyle of compaſſion, and if there be any of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Chriſt that ſtand at need, we ſhould be ready to ſhew compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
on them, our hands muſt follow the hands of God, as hee anointed
Chriſt ſo muſt wee.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, to what end he was anointed. We all know he was anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to be a Prophet,<note place="margin">Fourthly, to what end Christ was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed.</note> a Prieſt, and a King: now there were three ſorts of
men anointed in the Law: firſt, <hi>Prophets,</hi> as <hi>Elias</hi> anointed <hi>Eliſha to bee a
Prophet in his roome, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Kings</hi> 19. 16. ſecondly, <hi>Prieſts</hi> were anointed as <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi>
and <hi>Eleazer</hi> his ſon: thirdly, <hi>Kings</hi> were anointed as <hi>Saul,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi>
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. In the time of the Law, two of theſe offices fell out to bee in
one man, as <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> was a <hi>Prieſt</hi> and a <hi>King;</hi> and <hi>David</hi> was a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi>
and a <hi>King; Ieremie</hi> was a <hi>Prieſt</hi> and a <hi>Prophet;</hi> but all theſe offices
were not in any one man untill Chriſt came: in whom theſe were fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
the other anointings were but Types and ſhadowes, he was the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance;
Chriſt was anointed to all theſe offices; He was a <hi>Prophet, to teach
us his Fathers will; a Prieſt, to make atonement for us, and intercesſion; A King,
to raigne over us, to defend and protect us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First,<note place="margin">Firſt, Chriſt is a Prophet.</note> he is a <hi>Prophet, to declare the will of God;</hi> Chriſt hath declared the
will of God to his people, and therefore he is a Prophet; ſo ſaith <hi>Peter,
Act.</hi> 3. 22. that <hi>Moſes ſaid to the Fathers, the Lord your God ſhall raiſe up unto
you a Prophet, even of your Brethren, like unto me; ye ſhall heare him in all things
whatſoever he ſhall ſay unto you:</hi> ſo ſaith the woman of <hi>Samaria, Sir, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
thou art a Prophet, &amp;c.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iohn 4.</note> All other Prophets did teach but part of
Gods will, but hee hath revealed his whole will, and therefore Chriſt
is the great Prophet of the Church; as <hi>Luke.</hi> 7. 16. when they ſaw Chriſt
had raiſed up that man that was dead, <hi>they glorified God and ſaid, a great
Prophet is raiſed up among us, and God hath viſited his people.</hi> It is ſaid, <hi>Matth.</hi>
4. 16. <hi>The people that ſate in darkeneſſe ſaw great light, and to them that ſate in
the region and ſhadow of death, light is riſen up;</hi> all the Prophets that were
before him, were as little lights to him, hee was the great light that
made all things. If a man ſet up a candle, it will give light in one roome,
ſet up a torch and it will give a greater light,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> but what are all theſe lights
to the light of the Sunne? ſo all the Prophets that were before Chriſt,
were but all little lights to this, and pointed to Chriſt, he was the great
light that made all things manifeſt.</p>
               <p>The uſe is,<note place="margin">Vſe.</note> that ſeeing Chriſt is the great Prophet of the Church,
therefore wee muſt heare him: <hi>Ast.</hi> 3. 23. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>That every
perſon which ſhall not heare that Prophet, ſhall bee deſtroyed out from among the
people;</hi> therefore he that doth deſpiſe, and will not heare him ſpeaking
unto us, that perſon ſhall be cut off and deſtroyed. So <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 21. <hi>For if the
word ſpoken by Angels was ſtedfaſt, and every tranſgreſsion and diſobedience recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
a juſt recompence of reward, how ſhall we eſcape, if we neglect ſo great ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:17958:48"/>
&amp;c.</hi> And therefore ſeeing he is the great Prophet of the Church,
we muſt heare and regard him. I ſhewed you in the morning, it was a
ſweet thought in God, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. 38. when hee had ſent his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
the prophets, they beate them and killed them, and ſtoned them,
<hi>at laſt he ſent his ſonne, It may be, ſaith he, they will reverence him;</hi> it was a
ſweet thought in God, that not withſtanding they had done all to his
ſervants they could, that God would ſend his Sonne, therefore ſeeing he
hath ſent him, wee muſt heare him, unleſſe wee will periſh. But how
can wee heare Chriſt, he is in heaven? I anſwere, two waies Chriſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
his Church here:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>By His Word.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Chriſt teacheth by the Word and Sacraments.</note>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. By the Sacraments.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt, Hee teacheth his Church by his Word; for the Word is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe but the very voyce of Chriſt; and therefore when wee read
the Word, wee ought to reverence it as the voyce of Chriſt ſpeaking
to us.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he teacheth his Church by the myſtery of the Sacraments,
which when they ſpeake to us in his name, it is the voyce of Chriſt: ſo
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 19. <hi>By the which Spirit he went &amp; preached to the ſpirits that were in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
&amp;c.</hi> Chriſt did not preach unto them in his own Perſon but by man:
ſo <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 17. it is ſaid, <hi>that Chriſt came and preached peace to them afarre
off, and to them that were neere.</hi> Now Chriſt did not preach to the Gentiles
in his owne Perſon, but by the Miniſtery of his ſervants, therefore as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
as his ſervants come to us in his name with his word in their mouths,
it is Chriſt that teacheth us, and then, ſo often as we heare, we heare the
voyce of Chriſt; as the Church ſaith in the <hi>Can.</hi> 5. 2. <hi>It is the voyce of my belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi>
The greateſt part of the world do not beleeve this,<note place="margin">Cantic. 5. 2.</note> they are not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
when the miniſter ſpeaketh unto them from the word of God,
that it is the voyce of Chriſt, therefore they condemne it and doe not
regard it, but when we know that Chriſt ſpeaketh unto us by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery
of his Word, or by his ſervants, we ſhould ſay as <hi>Samuel</hi> ſaid, <hi>Speake
Lord, for thy ſervant heareth;</hi> ſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85. <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>I will harken what God
ſaith, for he ſpeakes peace to his people:</hi> let the world ſpeake of their pleaſures,
profits, and talke what they will of me, I will hearke what God ſaith;
ſo a Chriſtian muſt doe, whatſoever the world talke and ſpeake, yet he
muſt harke what Chriſt ſpeaketh unto him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, he was Anointed to be a</hi> Prieſt, <hi>as</hi> Pſal. 110. 4. Thou art a
Prieſt for ever after the order of Melchizedech:<note place="margin">Secondly, Chriſt was a Prieſt.</note> 
                  <hi>ſo</hi> Heb. 7. 26. For ſuch an
high prieſt it become us to have which is holy, harmeleſſe, undefiled, ſeparated
from ſinners, made higher than the heavens. <hi>Of his Prieſtly office there bee
two parts:</hi>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. To reconcile and make us at one with God.</item>
                  <item>2. To make interceſsion for us.</item>
               </list>
               <p>In the Law when a man had ſinned, hee brought an offering to the
Prieſt,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> the Prieſt muſt offer for him, and ſo make reconciliation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
God and him; ſo when we have ſinned againſt God, it muſt bee
Chriſt that muſt reconcile us and make us at one againe with God. But
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:17958:48"/>
there is a great difference betweene Chriſts ſacrifice, and the Prieſts;
for the Prieſts in the Law made an atonement with the bloud of beaſts:
but Chriſt makes an atonement with his owne bloud; there was never
a Prieſt in the Law that would ſhed his bloud for the beſt of the people,
but Chriſt hath ſhed his bloud for the meaneſt of his ſervants, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we have great cauſe to eſteeme of the Prieſthood of Chriſt, for all
the joy we have in God, and hope of heaven hangs on him; for when a
man hath ſinned againſt God, there is no man dare ſtand before God,
till Chriſt hath ingaged himſelfe, anſwered God, and made him at one
with him: when a man hath ſinned againſt God, all the Angels cannot
make Atonement for him, nor all the powers in heaven and earth, all
the gold in <hi>Ophir</hi> c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ot redeeme a ſoule, but it muſt be Chriſt with his
owne blood that m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>t make reconciliation with God for us: therefore
wee are highly to eſteeme of the Prieſthood of Chriſt, for all other
comforts and joy depend on it.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Prieſtly duty is, that <hi>hee makes interceſſion for us,</hi> being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into the heavens, within the clouds to appeare before God, and to
make interceſſion for us; ſo we ſee <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 25. <hi>Wherefore he is able perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to ſave them that come unto God by him, ſeeing he ever liveth to make interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
for them:</hi> ſo <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 24. <hi>for Chriſt is not entred into places that are made
with hands, which are ſimilitudes of the true ſanctuary, but is entred into the
heavens to appeare now in the ſight of God for us;</hi> there bee two bloods that
cry unto God, the blood of the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> and the blood of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> the
blood of the Martyrs cries for to be revenged, but the blood of Chriſt
cries for mercie; it cryeth not onely from the croſſe for mercy, but it
cryeth now as freſhly within the throne, and the vaile, as ever it did; he
makes requeſt for us, and as <hi>Auſten</hi> ſaith, hee makes requeſt after this
manner; <hi>Good Lord, grant mercy to them, Father forgive them, I have bought
them with my bloud, they be my poore ſervants.</hi> Therefore here is a comfort
to us, when wee cannot pray as we ought, nor wee have none that can
helpe us, this is the comfort that we Chriſtians may have, that Chriſt
is aſcended to heaven, and makes interceſſion for us.</p>
               <p>The uſe is, that ſeeing we have ſuch a benefit by the high prieſthood
of Chriſt, it ſhould make us hold faſt our profeſſion: this is the uſe that
<hi>Paul</hi> maketh, ſaith he, <hi>Seeing then we have a great high Prieſt which is carri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>
into heaven, even Ieſus the Sonne of God; Let us hold faſt our profeſſion; Let us
therefore goe boldly to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy, and finde
grace to helpe in the time of neede:</hi> therefore let us not doubt but that wee
ſhall be ſaved. Indeede, if the matter lay in us then wee might doubt of
it, but ſeeing Chriſt hath undertaken it, we muſt not doubt, unleſſe wee
will be ſo prophane to thinke that Chriſt will faile us. I, but what may
a man doe that Chriſt may undertake the matter for him?<note place="margin">Simile.</note> he muſt doe
as a man that goeth to a Lawyer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he tels him his caſe, and he prayeth the
Lawyer to undertake the matter for him; ſo a Chriſtian muſt doe, hee
muſt goe to Chriſt, and make his caſe knowne to him, and pray him to
undertake the matter, and ſo commit it unto him, and then Chriſt will
not faile him.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the Anointing of Chriſt, there were five

is meant by the anointing: ſecondly, with what
he was anointed: thirdly, what it was that did
anoint him: fourthly, to what he was anointed:
fifthly, what benefit we have by his anointing:
He was Anointed to bee a <hi>Prophet,</hi> a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> and a

to ſhew you how he is a <hi>King,</hi> for it is nothing to admit him to bee the
<hi>Prophet,</hi> or to be our <hi>Prieſt</hi> unleſſe we admit him to be our King.</p>
               <p>Now that he is the King of the Church can no doubt; for <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.
it is ſaid, <hi>I have ſet my King upon the holy hill of Sion,</hi> and <hi>Zech.</hi> 9. he ſayes,

that Chriſt doth exerciſe towards his Church:</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">The foure Kingly Duties of Chriſt.</note> 
                  <hi>Hee doth gather and draw Subjects to himſelfe by his Word and Spirit:</hi>
it is not with the Kingdome of Chriſt, as with the kingdomes of the
world;<note place="margin">1</note> for firſt, they be conſtituted and gathered, and then they have
a king ſet over them: as we ſee in <hi>David,</hi> his kingdome was conſtituted
before hee was king; but Chriſt hath not a Subject in his Kingdome
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:17958:49"/>
but he muſt draw him, for ther is no man that is born a ſubject of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;
but he muſt draw him out of another kingdome, out of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of the divell, to make him a ſubject in his kingdome; ſo we have it,
<hi>Who hath delivered us from the power of darkeneſſe, and hath tranſlated us into
the Kingdome of his deare sonne:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Col. 1. 13.</note> we ſee that Chriſt muſt draw us out of
another kingdome to make us ſubjects in his Kingdome; <hi>Iob.</hi> 10. 16. <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſheep have I alſo which are not of this fold, them alſo muſt I bring.</hi> This is a
peece of his Kingly care, to draw aliens and ſtrangers unto himſelfe to
make them ſubjects in his Kingdome:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> we ſee in experience, if a goodly
Kingdome be ſet up, and great priviledges belong unto it, men wilſeeke
to be ſubjects of it: and yet Chriſt hath ſet up a kingdome and there
are few that ſeeke to bee ſubjects of it; notwithſtanding all the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
in this world are not like to it, in regard of the glory and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
and of the goodly priviledges that doe belong to it: yet what a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do
hath Chriſt to make men his ſubjects? he is ſomeitmes drawing of a
man twenty or thirty yeares ere he can make him a ſubject of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
Here wee are to conſider the infinite goodneſſe of God to us,
that when we were under the kingdome of the divell, at ods and war
with him, yea even when wee were at defiance with him, then hee was
not contented till he had drawne us home to himſelfe to be made ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
in his Kingdome; here wee may wonder and admire at his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
that when men were at warre and at defiance with him, hee labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
then to draw them unto repentance: as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 6. <hi>When I paſſed by
thee and ſaw thee polluted in thine owne bloud, I ſaid unto thee when thou waſt in
thy blood, Thou ſhalt live;</hi> even when we be in our ſins the Lord ſheweth
compaſſion unto us. <hi>Act.</hi> 12. 7. <hi>When Peter was in priſon and aſleepe in his
chaines, the Angell of the Lord came and ſmote him on the ſide and bad him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe;
and the chaines fell off from his hands:</hi> as the Angell brought him
out of priſon, into the City, and threw the Iron bolts from him; ſo the
Lord doth to us, wee lie in our ſinnes aſleepe, hee comes and ſtrikes
us in our conſciences, not on our ſides, brings us through the Iron gate
(places of danger) and never reſts till he have brought us into the Citty
to make us ſubjects to his kingdome, that were formerly ever ſubjects
to the divels kingdome.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Kingly duty of Chriſt is,<note place="margin">The ſecond Kingly Duty.</note> 
                  <hi>That he governs his people by juſt
and equall Lawes: Pſal.</hi> 45. 6. he ſaith, <hi>Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever,
the Scepter of thy kingdome is a Scepter of righteouſneſſe; Thou loveſt righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
and hateſt wickedneſſe, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Eſai.</hi> 7. <hi>The increaſe of his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and peace ſhall have no end, he ſhall ſit upon the throne of David, and upon
his Kingdome, to order and to eſtabliſh it with judgement, and with juſtice from
henceforth and for evermore.</hi> ſo Chriſt is our King to governe us by juſt
and equall Lawes, this is the Kingly office of Chriſt; therefore every
one that will bee a ſubject to Chriſts Kingdome muſt be ruled and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
by his Lawes: wee ſee men can be contented to be ſubjects to
his Kingdome, &amp;c. yet they will not be governed and guided by his
Lawes, for they will ſweare though Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Sweare not all:</hi> he hath
made a Law that we ſhould not lye; yet men will lye; he commanded
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:17958:50"/>
that men ſhould not prophane the <hi>Sabbath</hi> and many will prophane it;
but every one that is a ſubject to Chriſts Kingdome muſt live by the
Lawes of Chriſt; it is a great fault that men profeſſe themſelves to bee
Chriſtians and yet will not bee ruled by his Lawes. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 19. 7. <hi>The Iewes
ſaid, they had a Law, and by that Law Chriſt ought to dye;</hi> Indeed it was a
Law of their owne making, for there is no Law of God to put an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
and harmeleſſe man to death, but it was a Law of their owne; ſo
wee make a Law to our ſelves that men may ſweare or lye, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
become of our neighbours, looke to our ſelves, but it is of our
owne deviſing, it is no Law of God: the old <hi>Souldiers bowed the knee to
Chriſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 27. 26.</note> 
                  <hi>and yet they ſpit in his face, they ſet a crowne of thornes on his head and put
a reede into his hand;</hi> ſo it is with the world ſtill, though they call him
their father and king, yet they will not bee ruled by him, but even as it
were ſpit in his face, and ſet a crowne of thornes on his head; this is
that which the world cannot away with nor brooke, that he ſhould bee
their king to governe and guide them, they can be contented he ſhould
dye for them to ſave them, but cannot indure that Chriſt ſhould rule
or raigne over them. <hi>Luk.</hi> 19. aſſoone as Chriſt came amongſt them
they ſaid, <hi>Wee will not have this man to raigne over us;</hi> ſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. <hi>Let us
breake their bonds and cast away their cords;</hi> they cannot abide to bee tyed
to Chriſt, to bee tied to prayer, and to holy duties, this is ſuch a bond,
and ſuch a tye unto them, they cannot indure it.</p>
               <p>The third kingly duty is, <hi>that he turnes whole adminiſtrations to the good
of the Church.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The third King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Duty.</note> 
                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſheweth the difference betweene a king and a
Tyrant, the King he raignes for the good of his people; the Tyrant for
the good of himſelfe: now it is not for Chriſts good, that he governs
and raignes, but it is for the good of his Church: the eleventh of <hi>Eſay</hi>
is nothing but a declaration of the great good that ſhall come by his
government; ſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72. 12. <hi>Hee ſhall deliver the poore when hee cryeth, the
needy alſo and him that hath no helper; he ſhall be mercifull unto the poore and
needy, and ſhall preſerve the ſoules of the poore;</hi> it tends to the good of the
Church, the whole adminiſtration of Chriſt: we ſee many times things
goe contrary to the Church, but here is the comfort, as long as Chriſt
is the King of it, all ſhall turne to the good thereof. We ſee in a clocke
that ſome wheeles turne croſſe,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and contrary, and yet all to one end to
make the clock goe; ſo there be many things that fall out contrary and
croſſe unto us, which yet by the ſecret hand of God are turned to the
good of the Church. <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. 23. there is a ſtrange adminiſtration
ſhewed, Chriſt gets his Diſciples to Sea, and when they were in the
Ship the winds aroſe, the waues beate into the Ship, they were like to
bee drowned, and Chriſt was aſleepe; but when they came to Chriſt
and did awake him, he rebuked the waues and the Sea, and there was a
great calme; ſo Chriſt doth as it were ſet his people on a Sea, where
the winds and the Sea rage and take on, Chriſt all this while being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleepe,
but when he awakes he drives away all danger from them; this
is the ſtrange adminiſtration of Chriſts Kingdome: therefore let eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man labour to be a ſubject thereof, and then fall what will fall, come
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:17958:50"/>
what will come,<note place="margin">SER. VIII</note> it ſhall all turne to their good.</p>
               <p>The fourth Kingly duty Chriſt exerciſeth to his Church is,<note place="margin">The fourth King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Duty.</note> 
                  <hi>That he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends
and fights for them;</hi> ſo we ſee, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 3. <hi>Gird thy ſword upon thy thigh, O
moſt mighty:</hi> and <hi>Revel.</hi> 19. Chriſt is there deſcribed riding on a horſe
with his garments dipped in blood and armed ready to fight for his
Church and to defend it. Of this we have two uſes.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> a comfort to the godly, that when they bee at peace and reſt,
Chriſt is warring and fighting for them; and when they bee weeping
for their ſinnes, Chriſt is a fighting for them; as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.
<hi>Stand ſtill and behold the Salvation of the Lord, for he fighteth for you:</hi> For as
a ſubject fighteth for his country and his Prince; ſo Chriſt fighteth
for us, and ſaith to the faithfull, Bee contented, ſtand ſtill, I my ſelfe fight
for you.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> a terror to the wicked, for if a man be an enemy against
Chriſt, hee fights againſt him with all his power, and laboureth to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
him; the Aegyptians could ſay, <hi>Let us flee from the face of Iſrael,
for the Lord fighteth for them.</hi> O that the men of this world would ſay
after that manner, Chriſts fights againſt us, let us fly, we cannot prevaile,
hee will deſtroy us. Let us therefore labour to make friends with him:
<hi>Iehu,</hi> (2 <hi>King.</hi> 10. 1, 2.) <hi>ſent letters to Samaria, to this effect, Yee have your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
ſonnes, yee have with you both charets and horſes, and a defenced city; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
therefore which of your Maſters ſonnes is beſt and moſt meete, and ſet him
on his fathers throne to fight for your Maſters houſe: But they were exceedingly
affraid and ſaid, behold, Two kings could not ſtand againſt him,</hi> yea all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
that roſe up againſt him hee hath deſtroyed; <hi>therefore how ſhall wee
ſtand?</hi> ſo I ſay, how ſhal we ſubſiſt, if we fight againſt Chriſt? we ſee in <hi>Ioſua,
when he had conquered the kings, he brings them out, and cauſeth his souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and ſervants to ſet their feete on the necks of the kings;</hi> ſo Chriſt will not
reſt till he hath ſubdued all his enemies and deſtroyed them. It is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. 1. <hi>The Lord ſaid to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I
make thine enemies thy footeſtoole;</hi> which when hee hath ſubdued, hee will
ſoone like <hi>Ioſua</hi> call out his ſouldiers and his ſervants, and bid them ſet
their feete on the necks of their enemies: therefore, let us deſire to be
ſubjects to his kingdome.</p>
               <p>The fift point is,<note place="margin">The fruit and benefit of Chriſts Anointing.</note> 
                  <hi>the fruite and benefit that we have by his Anointing:</hi>
and that is twofold; firſt, <hi>we participate of the graces of Chriſt:</hi> as <hi>Act.</hi> 11.
26. <hi>The Diſciples were called firſt Chriſtians:</hi> what is that? <hi>Anointed
people;</hi> they take their name from Chriſt, for by the meanes of Chriſt,
they were anointed; for he was not anointed for himſelfe, as a private
man, but as a head for us all; for as <hi>the ointment that was powred on the head
of Aaron,</hi> did not reſt there, but <hi>ranne downe on his beard and garments
throughout, Pſal.</hi> 133. 2. ſo the ointment that was powred on the head
of Chriſt, did not reſt on him as the head, but it ranne downe to the
meaneſt of the creatures or members: therefore there is not the leaſt
member that is in Chriſt but partakes of his anointing. Let us labour
then to be in Chriſt and we ſhall ſee a derivation of the graces of Chriſt
in us:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> let a man ſet a glaſſe under a Still, and it will receive the water,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:17958:51"/>
drop by drop as the Still giveth it forth, which though it bee not full
preſently, yet in time it will: ſo let us get into Chriſt, and he will diſtill
all his graces by drops into us, although we be not full preſently, yet in
time wee ſhall: this is the firſt benefit wee have by the Anointing of
Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>we are partakers of the dignity of his Perſon;</hi> for hee draweth
all his members into the ſame dignity with him, all they participate
of his dignity: for as hee was a <hi>King,</hi> a <hi>Prieſt</hi> and a <hi>Prophet,</hi> ſo hee makes
his people <hi>Kings,</hi> and <hi>Prieſts,</hi> and <hi>Prophets,</hi> he makes them kings, not tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary
kings; for as Chriſt ſaith of himſelfe, that <hi>his kingdome is not of
this world;</hi> ſo a Chriſtians kingdome is not in this world: how then
are they ſaid to bee kings? To rule and to raigne over their owne luſts
and ſinnes;<note place="margin">Queſt. Sol.</note> as <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. 6. <hi>And hath made us Kings and Prieſts to God.</hi> This
is a Kingly power when a man hath his heart at command, ſo as his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
luſts and ſinnes beare not ſway in him, but can command them;
ſuch a one is a king, when he that goeth in ſilkes and velvets, is a vaſſall
and a ſlave to ſinne.</p>
               <p>Now we come to ſpeake of the third title; that is, that <hi>Chriſt is the
Sonne of God.</hi> Wherein there is two branches of our faith:</p>
               <list>
                  <head>We beleeve that</head>
                  <item>1. Ieſus is the Sonne of God.</item>
                  <item>2. He is the Onely Sonne of God.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">The third title is, that Jeſus is the Sonne of God.</note> we beleeve <hi>he is the Sonne of God: Pſal.</hi> 2. 7. it is ſaid, <hi>Thou art my
Sonne, this day have I begotten thee:</hi> and <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>God ſo loved the world, that
he gave his onely begotten Sonne, that whoſoever beleeved in him, ſhould not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh,
but have everlaſting life;</hi> ſo <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>But when the fulneſſe of time was
come, God ſent forth his Sonne made of a Woman, &amp;c.</hi> ſo it is cleere by the
Scripture,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> that Chriſt is the Sonne of God. And if he be the Sonne of
God, then he communicates of the ſame ſubſtance and nature, that God
the Father is of: as wee ſee in the courſe of nature, the ſubſtance the Father
is of, the ſame he communicates to his ſonne; the ſame nature and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
that is in the father, is in the ſonne; therefore if wee will looke
upon God the Father, wee muſt looke upon Chriſt: ſaith <hi>Ieſus</hi> unto
<hi>Philip,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 149.</note> 
                  <hi>Have I been ſo long time with you, and haſt not thou knowne me? he that
hath ſeene me, hath ſeene my Father:</hi> therefore if we would ſee God, let us
looke on Chriſt; for the ſame nature and ſubſtance that is in God the
Father,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> is in the Sonne. If a man hold a glaſſe in his hand; and ſet it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Sunne, and then looke in it, hee ſhall as truely ſee the body of
the Sunne, as if he looked on the Sunne; ſo it is with us, deſiring to ſee
the reflexion of God, if we looke on Chriſt, we ſhall as truely ſee God,
as if we looked on God Himſelfe; for the ſame nature that is in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
is in the Sonne. Now what bee the conſequents of this? If the
ſame nature bee in Chriſt that is in God, then Chriſt muſt be God, for
who can deny but that the ſame nature that is in God the Father, the
ſame muſt needs be in the Sonne? <hi>Augustine</hi> ſaith, that the ſonne muſt
needs be a man, ſeeing the father is a man, for the ſame nature that is in
the father, he communicates to his ſonne; ſo then the Sonne of God,
ſeeing hee is of the ſame nature and ſubſtance with the Father, hee muſt
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:17958:51"/>
needs bee God, equall with the Father: hence the inference is true,
that Chriſt is God. But becauſe the Arrians be ſomewhat buſie in theſe
dayes, who robbe Chriſt of his Godhead, therefore I will prove unto
you by foure arguments that Chriſt is God:</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Foure Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that Chriſt is God.</note> 
                  <hi>the ſame names are given to Chriſt that are given to God,</hi> and are
attributed in ſuch a manner, as never was to any but to God. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20.
28. <hi>Thomas</hi> ſaith, <hi>Thou art my God and my Lord:</hi> and <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 5. the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
ſaith, <hi>Of whom Chriſt came, who is God over all bleſſed for evermore, Amen:</hi> and <hi>Ioh.</hi> 11. 3. <hi>This is life eternall,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>that they know thee to be the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
very God, and whom thou haſt ſent Ieſus Chriſt:</hi> ſo <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 13. <hi>Looking for
the bleſſed hope and appearing of the glory of that mighty God, and of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> He was not called God by appellation, as <hi>Moſes</hi> was
called <hi>Aarons</hi> God, becauſe hee was in the roome of God to execute
juſtice and judgement; but he is called God in ſuch a peculiar manner,
as never none was, but God: therefore Chriſt is true God:</p>
               <p>The ſecond Argument is,<note place="margin">Arg. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>that the eternall properties of God are attributed
unto him;</hi> now this is one of the eternall properties of God, to bee <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,
before all beginnings;</hi> which is attributed to Chriſt, <hi>Proverb.</hi> 8. 22. <hi>The
Lord hath poſſeſſed me in the beginning of his wayes; I was before his workes of
old, I was ſet up from everlaſting, from the beginning, and before the earth;
when there were no depths, was I begotten:</hi> ſo Chriſt was eternall. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8.
58. <hi>Before Abraham was, I am.</hi> I, ſay the Arrians, in figure and type, hee
was before <hi>Abraham:</hi> but the text meaneth really; Chriſt was not in fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
and type, but in truth and in deed. Another propertie is, <hi>the Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotencie
of God;</hi> and this is aſcribed unto Chriſt; therefore he is God:
As <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. 21. it is ſaid, <hi>Who ſhall change our vile body, that it may be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhioned
like unto his Glorious body, according to the working, whereby he is able
even to ſubdue all things unto himſelfe.</hi> Againſt this the Arrians oppoſe and
ſay, he had it by donation after his reſurrection: but I ſay, Chriſt had it
eternally, before his reſurrection, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. <hi>All things are given me of
my Father.</hi> Thirdly, it is the property of God <hi>to be preſent in all places;</hi> but
Chriſt is preſent in al places, therfore he is God. Now that Chriſt is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
in all places, It may appeare by this in the Goſpell, where it is
ſaid, <hi>Where two or three be gathered together in my name I am in the middeſt of
them,</hi> and <hi>Matth.</hi> 1. 28. <hi>I am with you even unto the end of the world.</hi> Againſt
this the Arrians obiect and ſay, Chriſt is preſent in grace, but not a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
preſence: to which I anſwer, that Chriſt is realy preſent with his
people, as <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. <hi>He was in the midſt of the ſeven golden Candleſticks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third argument is,<note place="margin">Arg. 3.</note> that <hi>the proper workes that are attributed to God,
are alſo attributed to Chriſt:</hi> as the worke of creation, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 16. <hi>For by
him were all things made:</hi> ſo <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>All things were made by him, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
him was nothing made, which was made.</hi> Againſt this the Arrians ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,
it is not the worke of creation and making the world which is
there ſpoken of, but the worke of renouation, or making of his Church:
but looke into <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 10. and you ſhall ſee it is the worke of creation,
and not of renovation: For it is ſaid, <hi>That the world was made by him and the
world knew him not;</hi> that is, the wicked of the world: therefore wee
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:17958:52"/>
may ſee it is not the renovation of the Church which is there ſpoken of;
ſo <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 16. <hi>For al things were made by him, whether they be viſible or inviſible;</hi>
there the Apoſtle ſpeakes of the making of Angels; therefore it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be of the worke of renovation, for renovation is proper to men,
for none is renovated but ſuch as fell away, but the elect Angels fell
not away, and therefore needed not renovation; ſo then it muſt be the
worke of creation. Againe, ſalvation is a worke that is proper to
none but God, but ſalvation heere ſpoken of, is a proper worke of
Chriſt; therefore hee is God: ſo hee ſpeaketh in <hi>Eſai.</hi> 43. 11. <hi>Beſides
me there is none other ſaviour:</hi> ſo likewiſe it is a property of God onely to
ſearch the reines, but this property belongs to Chriſt, and therefore he
is God: ſo it is ſaid in the <hi>Revelation, And all the Churches ſhall know that I
am he, which searcheth the reines and heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fourth argument is, that <hi>the ſame honour which is given to God, the
ſame is given to Chriſt.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Arg. 4.</note> Now there be three honours due to God, all gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to Chriſt:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Adoration.</item>
                  <item>2. Invocation.</item>
                  <item>3. Faith.</item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adoration,</hi> as <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 6. <hi>When he brings his firſt begotten into the world, he
ſaith,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 7. 59.</note> 
                  <hi>And let all the Angels worſhip him. Invocation,</hi> as by <hi>Stephen, who cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
on God, and ſaid, Lord Ieſus receive my ſpirit:</hi> ſo of <hi>Saul, Act.</hi> 9. 14. it is
ſaid, that <hi>hee bound all that called on the name of the Lord. Faith,</hi> as <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.
1. <hi>Ye beleeve in God, beleeve alſo in me,</hi> to which purpoſe is that <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 3.
Therefore wee may ſee by theſe arguments that Chriſt is God, and to
take heed of this brutiſh opinion of the Arrians. Now what be the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents
of this? that he was not a bare man, but he was God alſo, who
did redeeme us.</p>
               <p>There bee divers reaſons why he onely ſhould redeeme us.<note place="margin">Why Chriſt onely muſt Redeeme us.</note> Firſt, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he that did redeem us muſt beare the burthen of al the ſins due to al men, that
hath beene, and ſhall be;</hi> now there was none that could doe this, becauſe
the wrath of God was infinite,<note place="margin">1</note> ſave Chriſt Ieſus; for let the wrath of
God come upon the Angels, they are not able to beare nor ſtand under
the burthen of it, but it will preſſe downe, and ſinke them as low
as Hell.<note place="margin">2</note> Secondly, <hi>he that ſhould redeeme us, muſt pay a price Incomparable,</hi>
better and more worth than the bodies and ſoules of all men, that ever
were; now there was none that could doe this but God, and therefore,
he muſt bee God,<note place="margin">3</note> who redeemed us. Thirdly, <hi>he that ſhould redeeme us,
muſt put on all our ſinnes;</hi> even all the ſinnes that had been committed,
and ſhall be from the beginning of the world, to the latter end, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell
himſelfe with them: but there is no man, no Angell able to doe
this, and to ſtand before God, unleſſe there be infinite goodneſſe in him,
to countervaile the juſtice of God; therefore it muſt be God that muſt
doe it.</p>
               <p>The ſecond branch is,<note place="margin">Secondly, Chriſt is the Onely Sonne of God.</note> that we doe beleeve, <hi>he is the onely Sonne of God;</hi>
not by creation as the Angels ſpoken of <hi>Iob</hi> 1. 6. nor by adoption and
grace as men, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. but by communicating his nature and eſſence to
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:17958:52"/>
him; Now this doth commend the goodneſſe, and mercy of God to
us, that when wee had ſinned againſt him and had no way to redeeme
our ſelves, he having but one Sonne and his onely begotten Sonne, yet
gave him to dye for us, ſo to redeeme us.</p>
               <p>The uſes are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> first, ſeeing Chriſt is the only Son of God, let us labour
to become one with him, and then we ſhall alſo be the ſonnes of God:
as <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 12. <hi>But as many as received him to them he gave power to be the ſonnes
of God:</hi> and <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 26. <hi>For ye are all the ſonnes of God by faith in Chriſt Ieſus:</hi>
I know there is never a one here preſent, but could be contented to be
the ſonne of God; let us then labour to bee with Chriſt, by faith,
and ſo we ſhall become the ſonnes of God; for hee draweth all his
members into the ſame dignity with him. <hi>David</hi> accounted it a great
matter to be the ſonne in law to a king; ſo <hi>Moſes,</hi> to be a ſonne to <hi>Phara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ohs</hi>
daughter, howſoever he refuſed it afterward. Now, if it bee ſuch a
great matter to bee ſonne in law to an earthly king, much more is it
to bee a ſonne to God: therefore what a comfort is this, to ſuch poore
people, that are one with Chriſt, by faith, howſoever they bee hated
and deſpiſed, at the hands of wicked men, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 1. hee bringeth it in
with an <hi>ecce, Behold, what love the Father hath ſhewed to us that we ſhould be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the ſonnes of God?</hi> All the world doth not know what a great bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
it is to be the ſonnes unto God; wee ſee how great men will talke
of their nobility and of their great deſcent, but alas, what is all this, if
we be not the ſonnes of God? therefore thinke this with thy ſelfe, I am
a great man in the world, and come of a noble blood, and a great deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
but what is this unto me, unleſſe I bee the ſonne of God? And
therefore let us labour to bee one with Chriſt, and then as Chriſt was
raiſed from the dead, ſo he will raiſe us up together with him, and wee
ſhall be found the ſonnes of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> ſeeing Chriſt is the onely Sonne of God, wee may ſee the
horribleneſſe of our ſinnes and the greatneſſe of them, that when wee
had ſinned, all the creatures in heaven and earth could not doe it, but it
muſt be the Sonne of God, he muſt come downe, take our nature upon
him, and dye for us. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, O man by the great price that was
paied for thee thou maieſt conſider the greatneſſe of thy ſinnes, that
they coſt the bloud of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> the Sonne of God. If a man ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
an offence, and all the nobles ſhould kneele on their knees before
the king for him, and could not get releaſe, but that it muſt be the kings
ſonne onely that muſt doe it, hee muſt ſhed his blood, take the place of
a malefactor, be arraigned, condemned and executed in his roome; all
men would conceive that this was a horrible fact that muſt be the cauſe
of this: this is our caſe, when we had ſinned, all the heavenly powers
could not bring us into favour againe, but it muſt be the Sonne of God,
hee muſt take our roome and place, bee arraigned, condemned and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
for us: therefore ſinne is no ſmall matter neither muſt wee
eſteeme of our ſinnes ſlightly; but conſider with our ſelves, that great
are our ſinnes, that hath brought this on Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Vſe 3.</note> we ſhould heare his voyce: it is the charge the God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:17958:53"/>
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 17. <hi>This is my beloved Sonne in whom I am well pleaſed,
heare him;</hi> and therefore it is a great ſinne to deſpiſe the voyce of
Chriſt, in the miniſtery of his Word: Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſheweth what a great
ſinne it is,<note place="margin">Heb. 1. 1.</note> ſaith he, <hi>God ſpake by the Prophets at ſundry times and in divers
manners, but now he hath ſpoken in theſe laſt times by his Sonne;</hi> and therefore
in the ſecond Chapter he exhorteth us, <hi>To take heede of it, that wee doe not
let it ſlip; for if the word ſpoken by Angels, was ſtedfaſt, and every tranſgreſſion
and diſobedience receiveth a juſt recompence of reward; How ſhall we eſcape, if
we neglect ſo great ſalvation?</hi> Therefore ſeeing Chriſt is become a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
of the Church, let us take heede we doe not deſpiſe his Word, or
voyce. It was a holy thought in God, when the Church of the Iewes
had killed the Prophets, beaten and deſpiſed them, <hi>I will ſend my Sonne,
it may be they will reverence him;</hi> it was a ſweet thought in God to doe ſo.
And therefore let us take, heed, we doe not deſpiſe the voyce of Chriſt.
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 28. it is ſaid, <hi>The dead ſhall heare the voyce of the Sonne of God;</hi> even
the dead cinders and aſhes of men that have been rotting in the graves
many thouſand yeeres, they ſhall ſtartle and ſtirre at the voyce of the
Sonne of God, ſpeaking unto them but once; and therefore how ſhall
this condemne us, that Chriſt hath ſpoken ſo many times, and yet wee
doe not once ſtirre or move at it which are living men, to goe about
our buſineſſe? therefore this ſhall condemne us, that the dead cinders
of men that have lien in their graves many a yeare ſhall ſtartle and
move, at one voyce of Chriſt, and yet wee doe not at a thouſand of his
voyces.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Vſe 4.</note> ſeeing Chriſt is the onely Sonne of God, wee muſt take
heed we doe not deſpiſe him; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. it is ſaid, <hi>Kiſſe the Sonne leſt hee bee
angry:</hi> O labour to kiſſe him, ſeeke his favour, do not grieve him; woe
be to him that ſhall lift up his hand againſt him to grieve him; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 12.
Saith the Apoſtle, <hi>Now when ye ſinne ſo againſt the brethren and wound their
weake conſciences, ye ſinne againſt Chriſt:</hi> therefore we muſt take heed wee
doe not ſinne againſt our brethren, and ſo ſinne againſt Chriſt; for the
ſinnes of us Chriſtians more grieve Chriſt than the ſinnes of the world;
becauſe wee profeſſe he is our Lord and Maſter, and will bee ruled and
governed by him and be his ſervants: therfore in this caſe when a man
ſinneth againſt him, it is more than the ſinne of a ſtranger or an alien.
Wee ſee in the Scripture how Chriſt complaines, <hi>One of you ſhall betray
me, but wee be to him that doth it;</hi> and when <hi>Iudas</hi> came to betray him, he
ſaith, To what end art thou come, art thou come to betray me? As if he
had ſaid, Why thou art a diſciple of mine, thou profeſſeſt that thou art
my ſervant, and that I am thy Lord and Maſter, and doeſt thou come to
betray me? ſo <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. it is ſaid, <hi>Hee came amongſt his owne, but his owne recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
him not:</hi> if he had come amongſt ſtrangers and aliens, and had been
ſo uſed by them the matter had been the leſſe; but ſeeing he came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
his owne, and they received him not, this it was that did grieve
Chriſt the more: ſo <hi>Hoſea</hi> 4. 12. God complaines, <hi>My people aſke counſell
of their ſtockes, and their ſtaffe declareth unto them.</hi> Wells beloved, let us
take this to heart; when a prophane man liveth in his ſinnes impenitent,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:17958:53"/>
what doth Chriſt, hee doth not ſo complaine of them. But when a
Chriſtian ſhall live in ſinne, uncleaneſſe, maliciouſneſſe, or deceite,
this it is that grieveth Chriſt, and maketh him to complaine.</p>
               <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">Vſe 5.</note> ſeeing Chriſt is the onely Sonne of God, <hi>we muſt ſhew the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
meaſure of thankefulneſſe</hi> to him; for who can ſufficiently ſpeake of
his goodneſſe, that he being the onely Sonne of God, and God over all,
would abaſe himſelfe, to take our nature upon him, and dye for us? We
have heard of the love of <hi>Rebecca</hi> to her ſonne <hi>Iacob,</hi> when ſhee gave him
counſell to goe to his father to get the bleſſing, hee was afraid his father
would have felt and handled him, and ſo in ſtead of a bleſſing, he might
have procured a curſe:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> but ſhee bids him not to feare it, <hi>On mee bee the
curſe, my ſonne;</hi> if there be any comfort, on thee be the bleſſing, but on
me be the curſe: Such and farre greater is the Love of Chriſt to us; he
ſaith, On me be the curſe my people; but if there bee any good or any
bleſſing, or comfort to be had by my ſufferings or paines, on you be the
bleſſing: therefore ſeeing Chriſt hath made ſuch a change with us,
who can render ſufficient thankefulneſſe to him for it; <hi>Nehem.</hi> 11. wee
ſee, the people bleſſed thoſe that would dwell at Ieruſalem, becauſe it
was a dangerous place;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> Now if this people thanked them that would
dwell with them, hazard and venture their lives; O how thankefull
ought we to bee unto Chriſt who hath given his life for us? and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
how are we bound in all love and thankefulneſſe to him? The late
powder treaſon that was in the yeere of our Lord, 1605. the delivery
from it, is a fruit and benefit we have by Chriſt; and therefore it was
carefully and religiouſly provided of our Magiſtrates, to ſet apart a day
to give thankes in, a ſervice to be performed for it; for he hath not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
delivered our ſoules, but alſo our bodies from the jawes of hell.</p>
               <p>Now I come to ſpeake of His dominion, which is the ſecond thing
in the dignity of His Perſon: <hi>our Lord,</hi> wherein two things are to bee
conſidered:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That he is the Lord of the World.</item>
                  <item>2. That he is our Lord.</item>

the great Lord of the world:</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Secondly, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all things ſerving Him.</note> hee is the Lord of this world in regard of ſervice, for all
things doe ſerve him whatſoeuer: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 91. <hi>They continue to this
dayly by thine ordinances; for all thy ſervants;</hi> therefore ſeeing there
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:17958:54"/>
is nothing but doth ſervice to him, he is the Lord of this world.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>there is a double ſervice:</hi> a ſervice which the godly, and a ſervice
which the wicked performe; there is a voluntary ſervice which the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
performe, and unvoluntary, which the wicked performe: as the Axe in
the hand of the hewer, doth ſervice voluntary,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſo doe the wicked,
when they doe any ſervice to God, they doe it by conſtraint, unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
all things doth ſervice unto God, either willingly or by conſtraint,
for wee cannot ſtirre a foote or a hand or doe any thing but it is by the
appointment of God. It is a good ſaying of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> Now grant
Lord, ſaith he, that we may doe the good ſervice; for whether wee bee
willing or not willing we ſhall ſerve thee, thy providence and hidden
will; if we ſerve thee unwillingly, then we ſerve thee like ſlaves, but
grant Lord, that wee may ſerve thee willingly and voluntarily, as thy
children ought to ſerve thee, and thine owne people. And thus Chriſt is
the Lord of the world.</p>
               <p>The uſe is,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> firſt, ſeeing Chriſt is the Lord of the world, it ſhall bee
well with the Church and the members thereof; and as Chriſt is the
Lord, ſo hee will order every thing to the good of them, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 96. 10.
it is ſaid, <hi>The Lord raigneth,</hi> ſurely <hi>the earth ſhall be ſtable, and not mooved;
he ſhall judge the people in righteouſneſſe.</hi> And therefore ſeeing Chriſt raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
let every man and woman rejoyce and bee glad; it ſhall bee well
with Chriſts ſervants as long as Chriſt is their Lord, for the divell can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
take a pinne from their ſleeves, nor a leafe from a tree, nor touch a
pigge in thy yard, without Chriſt permit him: it was a comfort to <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephs</hi>
brethren to heare he was the Lord of <hi>Egypt;</hi> ſo it is a comfort to
a Chriſtian to know that Chriſt our elder brother, is Lord of the
world.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> ſeeing Chriſt is the Lord of the world, we muſt take heede
we doe not reſiſt him, for ſeeing he is a Lord ſo powerfull, it is in vaine
to reſiſt him; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. 2. it is written, <hi>Bee thou ruler in the midſt of thine
enemies;</hi> therefore let us take heede we doe not reſiſt, or ſtrive againſt
him, leſt wee bee overmatched: we read 2 <hi>King.</hi> 10. 3. <hi>Iehu</hi> ſaid to the
<hi>Samaritans, Conſider therefore which of your Maſters ſonnes be beſt and moſt fit
and meete; ſet him on his fathers throne, and fight for your maſters houſe: but
they were exceedingly afraid;</hi> and ſaid, <hi>Behold, two kings could not ſtand before
him; how then ſhall we ſtand?</hi> ſo we may ſay, two kings could not ſtand
againſt him, nay all the powers that roſe up againſt him, could not ſtand
before him, how then ſhall I be able to ſtand? And therefore every one
ſhould ſubmit himſelfe unto him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Vſe 3.</note> ſeeing Chriſt is the Lord, we muſt be contented that Chriſt
diſpoſe of us and of our eſtates, whether it bee by ſickneſſe or health,
death or life, proſperity or adverſity: he is the Lord, hee may diſpoſe
of us, therefore we muſt learne to be contented with his good pleaſure:
so <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 39. 9. <hi>I was dumb and ſaid nothing, becauſe thou diddeſt it;</hi> ſo <hi>Eli</hi>
2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 18. <hi>It is the Lord, let him doe with me as it pleaſeth him beſt,</hi> or good
in his owne eyes: we finde <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. when Chriſt ſent for the Aſſe
to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>If any one aſke you what yee doe with him,</hi> tell him, <hi>The
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:17958:54"/>
Lord hath neede of him, and hee will let him goe:</hi> ſo if the Lord neede any
thing for his honour, or for the good of our brethren, we ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to let it goe, it is his owne, no body muſt check or grudge againſt
him, none muſt controule him.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Vſe 4.</note> ſeeing Chriſt is the Lord, it ſhewes that all the powers in
the world ſtand under a greater government and power; therefore we
muſt take heede we doe no injury or wrong to any, for there is no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
ſo great but he ſtands under a greater power: ſo <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 1. the Apoſtle
exhorteth them, <hi>Ye maſters doe to your ſervants that which is juſt, and equall,
knowing yee have a Maſter in Heaven:</hi> and <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith, I durſt not doe ſo
and ſo, becauſe <hi>Gods judgements were fearefull to me, and I could not bee deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Secondly, that He is our Lord.</note> 
                  <hi>wee beleeve Hee is our Lord:</hi> Hee is a Lord indeed to all the
world; but we muſt beleeve he is our Lord; we can have no true com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
till we can lay hold on Chriſt, and ſay as <hi>Thomas</hi> ſaid, <hi>My Lord, and
my God. Origen</hi> hath a pretty ſaying, What am I the better (ſaith hee)
to know that Chriſt poſſeſſeth the city or the country, unleſſe hee poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe
my heart and my ſoule, and ſet up his Lawes, and ſubdue my fleſh?
ſo wee may ſay, what am I the better to know Chriſt hath ſubdued the
world, and yet hath not ſubdued my heart, and ſet up his Lawes therein,
and ſubdued my fleſh: therefore as wee beleeve in generall, hee is <hi>our
Lord,</hi> ſo we muſt beleeve in particular he is <hi>my Lord:</hi> Now foure waies

               <list>

muſt doe him ſervice; If wee had made our ſelves, wee might have ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
our ſelves; but ſeeing Chriſt made us, we muſt ſerve him, he is <hi>our
Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Secondly, by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</note> hee is our Lord <hi>by right of Redemption;</hi> ſo <hi>Zacharie</hi> in his

he is our Lord by right of <hi>Redemption.</hi> And as one ſaith, he hath not
onely bought us with his money, but he hath bought us with his owne
blood, &amp;c. Therefore we are his ſervants, he is our Lord.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Thirdly, by free gift.</note> he is our Lord <hi>by free gift;</hi> becauſe we are given of God to
him: as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 8. ſaith God, <hi>Aſke of me, and I will give thee the heathen
for thine Inheritance, and the uttermoſt parts of the earth for thy poſſeſſions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Fourthly, by voluntary ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</note> he is a Lord <hi>by voluntary ſervice; Paul,</hi> when hee was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
<hi>Acts.</hi> 9. ſaith, <hi>Lord, what wouldeſt thou have me to doe?</hi> he was ready
to doe any ſervice that Chriſt required: ſo are other Converts, at
leaſt in reſolution and deſire. The uſes are Three:</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> ſeeing Chriſt is our Lord, wee muſt live in obedience to him;
ſervants muſt be obedient to their maſters; and therfore (as the <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans</hi>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:17958:55"/>
ſaid) to <hi>Iehu, King</hi> 10. <hi>Wee are thy ſervants;</hi> ſo wee ſhould to
Chriſt, We are thy ſervants, thou haſt made us of nothing, thou haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
us, when we were loſt by our ſins, we will therefore do whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
thou command us. It is a fearefull thing, and a high ſinne when
men profeſſe themſelves to bee ſervants to Chriſt, to take him for their
Lord, and yet live in no obedience unto him, but in uncleaneſſe, propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and in knowne ſinnes ſtill; for if Chriſt bee our Lord, let us live in
obedience.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vſe 2. Simile.</note> ſeeing Chriſt is our Lord, where his preſence is, wee muſt
labour to be; we ſee that ſervants will be with their maſter, where he is
thither will they flocke; even ſo, where we know there is a preſence of
Christ, thither we muſt flocke: <hi>Ioh.</hi> 21. 7. the Diſciples that were a fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
came ſwimming over to Chriſt, when they heard where Chriſt
was, and left all; ſo when we know there is a preſence of Chriſt, in the
houſe of preaching, wee muſt leave all and goe thither: <hi>Mark.</hi> 1. 33.
when Chriſt was in <hi>Peters</hi> houſe, all the city flocked, and thronged about
the doore,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> becauſe Chriſts preſence was there; and yet it was but a
poorefiſher mans cabbin: ſo, when wee heare there is a preſence of
Chriſt, or know it in the place of preaching, we muſt flocke, and throng
thither, whatſoever the place, and howſoever meane it be.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Vſe 3.</note> ſeeing Chriſt is our Lord, know that wee muſt give up our
accounts to him, as ſervants muſt give up theirs to their maſters; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we muſt not labour to pleaſe men, but wee muſt pleaſe Chriſt; for
he is our Lord, we muſt give up our accounts to him. If we ſhould give
up our accounts to men, to kings, or to great men, wee ſhould ſeeke to
pleaſe them: as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 9. 10. <hi>Wherefore we labour, that both dwelling at
home, and remooving from home, we may be acceptable to him; for wee shall all
appeare before the Iudgement ſeat of Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> therefore wee muſt labour
to approve our ſelves to him.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> ſaies, ſervants will labour
to pleaſe their maſters, whom if they can pleaſe they care not whether
it pleaſe others or no; ſo wee ſhould labour to pleaſe Chriſt, and care
not though all the world were diſpleaſed with us ſo he bee pleaſed, for
we muſt not give an account to the world, but to him. If a man hold
his lands and livings from any man, he will be afraid to diſpleaſe him, or
to fell a tree off his ground, leſt he make a forfeiture of his coppihold;
ſo ſeeing we hold all from God we muſt take heede, we doe not make
forfeiture, and diſpleaſe him, leſt he turne us out of all.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Vſe 4.</note> ſeeing Chriſt is our Lord, it was not a ſervant, that died for
us, but it was the Lord; If it had been a ſervant, that had died, wee had
beene bound in duty and in love to him; But ſeeing it was Chriſt, our
Lord, that died, how are we bound in love and duty unto him? <hi>Iohn</hi> 13.
when Christwashed his Disciples feete, <hi>Peter</hi> saith, inadmiration, <hi>Lord,
wilt thou waſh my ſeete?</hi> ſo wee may ſay, Lord wilt thou ſhead thy blood
for me, what ſhall I render unto thee, or what duty ſhall I performe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thee, for ſo many ſurpaſſing mercies?</p>
               <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">Vſe 5.</note> ſeeing <hi>Christ</hi> is our Lord we muſt bee carefull to render our
ſoules, &amp;c. backe againe unto him, in as good eſtate as he gave them to
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:17958:55"/>
us:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> If a man borrow any thing, it is a ſhame it hee carry it not home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
in as good eſtate as hee had it; ſo ſeeing wee have received our
ſoules from him, and they are but borrowed, wee muſt take heed wee
doe not marre them by our ſinnes, and ſo returne them worse home,
than we had them, wee ſee in experience, if a man ſhould ſend his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
to the Indies to fetch gold, give him a ſhip to fill,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and bee at great
coſts and charges twenty or thirty yeeres together, and when the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
comes there, he does not gather in gold and pearles, into his ſhip,
but gravell and ſand, muck and moulde, if this ſervant comes home, will
his maſter take it well? may hee not looke for a cold welcome home?
ſo (as it were,) the Lord hath ſent us to the Indies, for gold and pearles,
with a ſhip, and is at great coſt with us, many a yeere together; Now
the ſhip is our ſoule, and the graces of his ſpirit, are the gold and pearles,
the world is the Indies, and heere we may have the ſame gold, the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of his Spirit; if therefore wee doe not fill our ſhips, with gold, and
pearles, but with gravell and ſand, muck and mould, God will not take it
well at our hands, we may looke for a cold welcome home, when wee
come to deliver our ſhip againe.</p>
               <p>Sixthly,<note place="margin">Vſe 6.</note> ſeeing Chriſt is our Lord, we muſt leave all and be ready to
depart this life, when Chriſt will have us; for ſervants bee at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of their maſters;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> if a maſter ſend his ſervant to trade and to traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique
beyond the Sea, as long as his maſter will have him to traffique
and trade, ſo long he muſt, but when his maſter will have him to come
home, and leave all, he muſt then be ready to doe ſo: ſo ſeeing we bee
ſervants to God, and he ſends us to traffique and trade, as long as he will
have us ſtay here, we muſt be contented, but when hee will have us leave
all, and come home, we ſhould be ready to doe ſo.</p>
               <p>Seventhly,<note place="margin">Vſe 7.</note> ſeeing Chriſt is our Lord, then beleeve of all men Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
are the moſt happy; all the glory of this life, is not comparable to
that which the Lord preſents upon a Chriſtian, as <hi>Canticles</hi> 5. when the
Church was making ſuch inquiry after Chriſt, there is a queſtion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded;
<hi>What is thy beloved more than another beloved, that wee may ſeeke
Him with thee?</hi> all the happineſſe of this world, is not like to it: firſt,
becauſe Chriſt is their Protector, other protectors drop away, they dye,
and ſo leave us; but Chriſt is with us continually. Secondly, becauſe
Chriſt hath the bread of ſufficiency; as <hi>Luke</hi> 15. ſaith the prodigall
ſonne; <hi>How many hired ſervants hath my father, who have bread enough,
and I dye for hunger?</hi> And therefore this is a comfort to them, that when
other ſtarve for hunger they have bread enough; enough of all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
and contentments. Thirdly, in regard of their reward, other
kings and Lords give meane things to their ſervants, and reſerve the
chiefeſt to themſelves; but Chriſt hee beſtowes great things upon his
ſervants, and makes them partakers of the ſame glory with himſelfe:
therefore <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Thankes be to our God which hath given us victory,
through our Lord Ieſus Chriſt;</hi> when things bee at the worſt; then Chriſt
will bring them unto victory, and therefore it muſt bee our care to bee
ſervants unto him.</p>

Even as a king when hee commeth from his Royall throne, commeth
down ſtep by ſtep til he come at the laſt or loweſt ſtep;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſo the Son of God
comming downe from His Royall throne, to the eſtate of Humiliation,
deſcended by certaine ſteppes and degrees, till hee came at the loweſt
ſtep: as the Apoſtle ſheweth in this place; that <hi>he tooke upon him the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

and ſo came to the loweſt ſtep of Humiliation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The firſt degree of His Humiliation</hi> was,<note place="margin">The firſt Degree of Chriſts Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation.</note> that he became a man for us;
for howſoever wee thinke of the dignity of Chriſt, yet it was a great
abaſement for the sonne of God, to take upon him the nature of man:
what would wee thinke, if a king ſhould for the good of his ſubjects, be
made a toad or a frog,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> or the meaneſt creature, this were a great abaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
but it is a greater matter for the sonne of God to take our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
upon him, for betweene the meaneſt of the creatures and the king
there is not ſo great diſproportion; it is all one hand that made them,
they were all made of one matter, of the earth; and when they are tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to the earth againe, there is no difference betweene them: but
there is no proportion betweene the sonne of God, and the nature of
man, for the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> could ſay, <hi>There is no proportion betweene an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
thing and a finite;</hi> therefore it was a greater matter, that God would
take our nature upon him, than a king to become the meaneſt creature,
for the good of his ſubjects. We read 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8. 27. <hi>But will God indeed
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:17958:56"/>
dwell on the earth?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">SER. IX.</note> 
                  <hi>Behold, the heaven of heavens cannot containe thee, &amp;c.</hi>
If <hi>Salomon</hi> did admire and wonder, that God would dwell in the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>
which was all glorious as the wit of man could deviſe, how then
may we admire and wonder, that God would dwell in mans fraile and
weake nature, when it was fallen into diſgrace? if he had taken our
nature upon him, when our firſt parents ſtood in their innocency, when
all the Creatures did ſervice to them, then it had not beene ſo great a
matter. But when mans nature was in diſgrace, had ſinned againſt
God, and was bound over to the diuell, it was a great abaſing to the
sonne of God:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> If a man ſhould take a noblemans colours and cloth,
as long as a nobleman is in favour with the king, it were no diſgrace to
him; but if a man ſhould take his colours or cloth when hee is proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to be a Traytor, this were a great diſgrace to him; ſo when mans
nature was in favour with God, then it was not ſuch a diſgrace; but for
Chriſt to take it when it had ſinned againſt God, and when it was ſo
deformed, was a great humiliation. The Uſe is twofold.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> ſeeing the sonne of God was contented to be humbled for us
to the eſtate of a ſervant, how ſhould we be contented to be humbled
and to ſtoope to any ſervice and dutie, to become nothing to our ſelves
to doe him ſervice? The Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 12. ſaith, <hi>I have learned in all
eſtates to be contented; how to want and how to abound: In all things I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed,
&amp;c.</hi> and <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 22. 6. <hi>I am a worme and no man, &amp;c. David</hi> ſaw
the Son of God ſhould be abaſed and humbled, hence he humbleth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe:
therefore ſeeing Chriſt was contented to be humbled for us, wee
ſhould be humbled for him. It is our ſinne that we cannot abide to bee
humbled or to ſtoope to any condition of humilitie. Now if Chriſt
was contented to be a ſervant for us, we muſt be contented to be poore
for his ſake, to ſtoope to any eſtate he appoints for us.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> that ſeeing the Sonne of God was humbled for us, we muſt
be contented to be humbled one for another, which our Saviour tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth

you to waſh one anothers feete?</hi> ſo <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>Let the ſame minde bee in you,
that was in Chriſt:</hi> why what was that? <hi>Who being in the forme of God,
thought it no robbery to be equall with God, yet he tooke upon him the forme of a
ſervant, and was made like a man, and humbled himſelfe to the death of the
Croſſe.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> Thoſe that keepe ſweete wines, muſt keepe them in deepe
Cellars; and low vaults, or elſe they will loſe their good taſte, and
reliſh: ſo if we would keepe the good graces of God in our hearts, wee
muſt keepe them in a broken heart, and humble ſpirit, for if we be high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded,
then our graces will loſe their good taſte and reliſh. And
therefore we muſt lay them in humble hearts, low in our owne conceit,
as Chriſt humbled himſelfe for us, ſo we ſhould humble our ſelves one
for another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now in the firſt degree of Chriſts Humiliation, in the taking of the
nature of man upon him, we obſerve,</hi>

               <list>
                  <item>1. How farre forth he tooke mans nature upon him.</item>

3. The ſpeciall ends, why he tooke our nature upon him.</item>
                  <item>4. The manner of it.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Firſt, How farre Chriſt tooke mans nature. The firſt conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> 
                  <hi>how farre he tooke mans nature upon him:</hi> This is laid downe in two
concluſions:</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>that he tooke the nature of man wholly upon him, not a part of mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
but the whole nature of man; both a body and a ſoule:</hi> He tooke a body to
him, as <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 21, 22. <hi>And you that were ſometime alienated, and enemies
in your minde by wicked workes, yet now hath he reconciled, in the body of his
fleſh, through death, to preſent you holy, and unblameable, and unreproveable in
his ſight:</hi> ſo 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 24. <hi>Who his owne ſelfe bare our ſinnes, in his owne body on
the tree, that wee being dead to ſinnes, ſhould live unto righteouſneſſe, by whoſe
ſtripes wee are healed.</hi> Hence wee ſee, it is out of queſtion, hee had a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:
ſo alſo it is moſt certaine Hee had a ſoule, as he ſaid <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 38.
<hi>My ſoule is heavy unto death;</hi> And in another place, <hi>My ſoule is troubled
within me.</hi> ſo that he had the whole nature of man, a body and a ſoule.
The Fathers argue well againſt the heretikes in thoſe dayes; If Chriſt
had taken but one part of mans nature, then hee could have redeemed
but one part. And therefore <hi>Irenaeus</hi> ſaith well, Hee gave his body for
our bodies, and his ſoule for our ſoules: and <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> It was unpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
that if he had taken but one part, he could have redeemed us. Hee
had therefore a body to redeeme our bodies, and a ſoule to redeeme our
ſoules, ſo that he had the whole nature of man.</p>
               <p>The ſecond concluſion is,<note place="margin">The ſecond con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion.</note> that <hi>he had</hi> (not onely the whole nature of
man but) <hi>the infirmities of man, the fraileties and weakeneſſe</hi> of our nature:
ſo we read, that <hi>he was hungry, thirſty, weary, &amp;c.</hi> Here wee may wonder
at the kindneſſe, mercy, and compaſſion of Chriſt, that hee would not
take the beſt only but the worſt things, even our weakeneſſes and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities;
men can bee contented to take the honour of Chriſt, but are
loth to take his ſhame: This muſt teach us therefore, that wee ſhould
not be contented, to take the beſt things onely for Chriſt, but even the
worſt things alſo for his ſake.</p>
               <p>Now wee muſt underſtand (with a diſtinction) how Chriſt tooke
our infirmities, firſt, <hi>there be infirmities that be ſinfull;</hi> and ſecondly, <hi>that be
unblameable paſſions:</hi> Chriſt tooke not the firſt ſort of infirmities, but
the latter; of which there be two ſorts:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Some that be common to all men.</item>
                  <item>2. Some that be perſonall.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Now Chriſt tooke not our ſinfull infirmities upon him, for the ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of his nature doth exclude them;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> as water being dropped or powred
on hot coales, it doth drinke up the water; ſo the ſanctitie of his nature
doth exclude ſinne, for hee could not take our ſinfull infirmities: as
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 22. it is ſaid, <hi>Who did not ſinne, neither was there guilt found in his
mouth, &amp;c.</hi> Now penall infirmities, and ſuch as are voide of ſinne hee
tooke; whereof there be two ſorts:</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>ſome that hee common to all the ſonnes of Adam;</hi> as to be hungry,
thirſty, naked, cold, hot, and ſuch like: ſecondly, there be <hi>perſonall</hi> infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
which ariſe upon particular cauſes, as to have divers diſeaſes: now
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:17958:57"/>
hee tooke not theſe infirmities upon him: for hee tooke not any mans
perſon upon him; but the nature of man; yea, he tooke them that bee
common to the whole nature of man.<note place="margin">Quest.</note> And why did he take upon him
these infirmities? for three cauſes, as the Schoolemen ſay.</p>
               <p>First,<note place="margin">ſol.</note> 
                  <hi>for ſatisfaction ſake:</hi> that he might ſatisfie for our ſinnes: for he
that muſt ſatisfie for them,<note place="margin">1</note> muſt take the whole puniſhment for ſinne;
therefore he tooke our infirmities upon him: as we ſee in <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. 17.
<hi>Hee tooke our infirmities upon him, and bare our ſickneſſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>to ſtrengthen faith in the incarnation;</hi> that wee might know
hee was a perfect man becauſe hee was ſubject to all our infirmities, to
eate, ſleepe, bee weary and ſuch like: for if hee had not taken theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities,
was might have doubted, whether he had beene man or no;
therefore he tooke our infirmities upon him, that we might beleeve he
was a man, touching his Incarnation.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>for our example;</hi> that as hee was ſubject to hunger, thirſt and
nakedneſſe,<note place="margin">3</note> ſo we ſhould be contented with it alſo; for 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 21. it is
written, <hi>Chriſt alſo ſuffered for us, leaving us an example that we ſhould follow
his ſteps, &amp;c.</hi> Now beſides theſe three reaſons of the Schoolemen, there
is another reaſon, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 17. why hee tooke our infirmities upon him
(there the Apoſtle ſaith) <hi>Wherefore in all things it became him to bee made
like unto his brethren,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">4</note> 
                  <hi>that he might bee a mercifull and faithfull high Prieſt in
things concerning God:</hi> this was the reaſon why he tooke our infirmities
upon him, that he might be the more compaſſionate towards us. Let a
man come to one that is on his ſick bed; if he hath had the ſame diſeaſe,
he will be more compaſſionate, and pitifull, than twenty others: ſo ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Chriſt tooke our infirmities, hee will have the more compaſſion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
us, therefore as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 14. <hi>Seeing then wee have
not ſuch an high prieſt which cannot bee touched with the feeling of our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
but was in all things tempted in like ſort, yet without ſinne; let us therefore
goe boldly to the throne of grace, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the next thing that was obſerved,<note place="margin">Secondly, why Chriſt was made man.</note> were <hi>the reaſons, why he was
made man;</hi> and that in three reſpects:</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> for <hi>neceſſities ſake;</hi> for hee muſt have ſomething to offer, as the
price of ſinne: ſo <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 4. <hi>For hee were not a Prieſt if hee were on the earth,
ſeeing there are prieſts, that according to the Law offer gifts;</hi> therefore hee
that doth redeeme us, and bring us unto Gods favour, muſt have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to offer to God, as a price for ſinne, but the Godhead could not
be offered, for that cannot dye, and therefore of neceſſity, Hee muſt bee
man.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>in regard of the equity of it;</hi> for the ſame nature that had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,
muſt be puniſhed; becauſe it could not ſtand with Iuſtice, to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
ſin in another nature, which had not offended, therefore of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
he muſt bee man: for the ſame nature that had ſinned, muſt be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>in regard of the fitneſſe;</hi> for he that is the Mediator, and doth
reconcile God and man together, muſt be God to deale with God, and
man to deale with man. The <hi>Philoſophers</hi> ſay, that to bring two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:17958:58"/>
together, it muſt be done by middle things: ſo Chriſt muſt be
betweene both, the muſt be God, to deale with God, and man to deale
with man: ſo that he muſt be man, in regard of the fitneſſe of it; Hee
muſt be God alſo,<note place="margin">Thirdly, the ends why Chriſt tooke mans nature.</note> a fit Vmpire to lay his hand upon both.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the ſpeciall ends why he muſt take mans nature upon him; <hi>are five
in number:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> to redeeme man; for in the ſame nature the devill had deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
man, in the ſame nature muſt he deſtroy the worke of the devill; ſo
<hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>For aſmuch then as the children are partakers of fleſh and blood, hee
alſo himſelfe, tooke part of the ſame, that he might deſtroy him that had the power
of death, that is, the devill; and deliver them who for feare of death were all their
life time ſubject to bondage.</hi> It is a pretty ſaying of the councell of <hi>Epheſus;</hi>
even as a cunning workeman, doth not only great matters in gold, ſilver,
and precious ſtones,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> but can alſo take a peece of clay, and make ſuch a
peece of worke that may make the world to wonder at it; ſo this cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
workeman Chriſt is not onely able to the doe great workes in gold
and precious ſtones, in his Godhead; but even in a peece of clay, with
mans nature, he can deſtroy the workes of the divell.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> to reſtore the loſt Image of God in man; for <hi>Adam</hi> had
loſt it by his ſinne, and therefore he tooke mans nature to bring it to the
former eſtate againe. Saith <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> if a picture be defaced, and hath
loſt its former beauty,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> there is no way to reſtore it againe, but to get the
party that the picture was firſt drawne by, to renew it: ſo, ſaith he,
when man had defaced the Image of God in him, there was no way to
have it reſtored againe, but by bringing Chriſt into the world, from
whence this nature of man was drawne upon him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> to advance mans nature, which was ſo diſgraced by ſinne;
for mans nature was hatefull to God, even as a toade is to us; therefore
ſeeing mans nature was in diſgrace with God, hee tooke our nature to
advance it againe.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> If a towne or a city be in diſgrace with the king, if he
come againe into it, abide and reſt in it, thereby it is advanced againe; ſo
when mans nature was in diſgrace, by the reaſon of ſinne, Chriſt came
into mans nature, and this did advance it againe.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4</note> to make mans Nature dreadfull to the divell; for Chriſt
having overcome the devill in Mans nature, this made his Nature terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to him: even as a fiſh when he is nibling at the baite, and ſpieth the
bare hooke,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> is afraid to meddle with the baite after; or as a man put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his hand into a hole, if he pull out a toade, will bee afraid to put
his hand in againe; ſo the devill having beene overcome by mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is afraid of it againe; not becauſe he thinkes hee ſhall meete with
Chriſt, for he knowes he is in heaven, but becauſe hee knowes hee ſhall
meete, or is afraid that hee ſhall meete with the power of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, that his incarnation might be as a glaſſe, wherein we may ſee
the infinite <hi>Goodneſſe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">5</note> 
                  <hi>juſtice, wiſedome,</hi> and <hi>power</hi> of God. Firſt, wee may
ſee the <hi>infinite goodneſſe of God,</hi> that when wee were loſt by ſinne, there
was no way to recover us but he muſt ſend His owne ſonne to dye for
us. Secondly, we may ſee the <hi>infinite juſtice of God,</hi> that Hee would not
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:17958:58"/>
let ſinne be unpuniſhed, but would puniſh it though in his Sonne. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the <hi>infinite wiſedome of God,</hi> to deviſe a way and a meanes to ſave man,
when all the heavenly powers ſtood at a ſtand. Fourthly, the <hi>infinite
power of God,</hi> in making that puniſhment temporall that was eternall;
and man, which was as low as the earth, to make higher than the
heavens: we be contented to looke into a glaſſe, to ſee the goodly and
gay things in it; therefore wee ſhould bee deſirous to looke into this
glaſſe, wherein we may ſee the goodneſſe, the Iuſtice, the wiſedome and
power of God, in the Incarnation of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The fourth thing obſerved was,<note place="margin">Fourthly, the manner how hee tooke fleſh.</note> 
                  <hi>the manner how to tooke fleſh;</hi> expreſſed
two waies:</p>
               <list>
                  <head>In His</head>
                  <item>1 Conception.</item>
                  <item>2 Birth.</item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <hi>In his</hi> Conception, <hi>we obſerve three things:</hi>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Of what he was Conceived.</item>
                  <item>2. By what power he was Conceived.</item>
                  <item>3. What adoe there was about his Conception.</item>
               </list>
               <p>For the firſt,<note place="margin">Firſt, of what he was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</note> hee was conceived of the fleſh of the <hi>Virgin;</hi> ſo it was
not made of nothing, nor of the earth, rayſed out of that, as <hi>Adam</hi> was,
nor did hee bring his fleſh from heaven; but it was made of the fleſh
of the Virgin: as <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>But when the fulneſſe of time was come, God Sent
his ſonne made of a Woman, and made under the Law, &amp;c.</hi> ſo <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 31. ſaith
the Angell, <hi>For loe, thou ſhalt conceive in thy wombe, and beare a Sonne;</hi>
and vers. 35. <hi>That holy thing which ſhall be borne of thee</hi> (that is, of thy
ſubſtance, and of thy fleſh, ſo the Greeke word is) <hi>ſhall bee called the
Sonne of God.</hi> The <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> hold, that Chriſt brought his fleſh from
heaven:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and that as water paſſeth through a conduite pipe, ſo Chriſt
paſſed through the <hi>Virgin Mary:</hi> but we Chriſtians beleeve, that
Chriſt was conceived and made of the fleſh of the Virgin; becauſe if
he had brought it from heaven, or tooke other ſtrange fleſh, then it had
not beene fit to redeeme us; for by order of divine juſtice, the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
that had ſinned muſt ſuffer and bee puniſhed; but it was man that
had ſinned, therefore it muſt bee man that muſt be puniſhed; which is
the reaſon why he muſt take his fleſh of the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> The conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
hereof may cauſe us to think of a further point: that is, as Chriſt was
conceived in the wombe of the Virgin; ſo he muſt be conceived ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in the heart of a Chriſtian: <hi>as Paul, Gal.</hi> 4. 19. <hi>My little children, of
whom I travell in birth againe, till Chriſt be formed in you;</hi> as if hee ſhould
ſay, this I labour for, that Chriſt may bee conceived in your hearts:
therefore <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaith well, What am I the better to know that
Chriſt is conceived of the fleſh of the Virgin, unleſſe I know he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in my heart and ſoule, for wee can have no comfort in the day of
death and judgement, unleſſe he be conceived in our hearts. But how
ſhall wee know that hee is conceived in our hearts? even as a mother
knowes that ſhe is with childe by the ſtirring or moving of the childe;
ſo we may know when Chriſt is conceived in our hearts; by the ſtirring
or moving of Chriſt. And therefore we muſt get theſe two things:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:17958:59"/>
Firſt, wee muſt get the ſeede of Chriſt in us, for there is a certaine
ſeede that will breede Chriſt:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> a man that will have good plants and
trees in his garden, muſt get ſeedes and plants, to plant therein and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
them from day to day: ſo if we would have Chriſt conceived in
our hearts, we muſt get of that ſeede; for there is a certaine ſeede that
will breede Chriſt; which is the Word of God: therefore let us get
this into our hearts, and water it from day to day, by the uſe of good
meanes, and it will breede Chriſt. This is the firſt way.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is,<note place="margin">2</note> wee muſt have faith to retaine him, or elſe he will ſlip
away from us; and as <hi>Mary</hi> conceived Chriſt by faith (for aſſoone as
the Angell told her, ſhe beleeved, and ſtraightway ſhe conceived Chriſt)
ſo wee muſt conceive Chriſt by faith in beleeving the Word of God:
therfore hath God made promiſe to thee that he will not leave thee nor
forſake thee, that he will give an iſſue out of temptation, that hee will
ſave thee at the day of judgement or at the day of death, that hee will
bleſſe thee, in the uſe of good meanes, lay hold on theſe promiſes; and
this is the way to conceive Chriſt. <hi>Ephe.</hi> 3. 17. it is ſaid, that <hi>Chriſt dwels in
our hearts by faith:</hi> let us get faith and this will make Chriſt to ſtirre and
moove in us.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Secondly, by what power He was conceived.</note> 
                  <hi>by what power hee was conceived;</hi> by the power of the holy
Ghoſt, for it was not any power of nature that conceived Chriſt; but
the power of the holy Ghoſt: ſo we ſee <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 35. <hi>And the Angell an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
and ſaid unto her, The holy Ghoſt ſhall come upon thee, and the power of
the moſt high ſhall overſhadow thee:</hi> ſo <hi>Matth.</hi> 1. 20. <hi>For that which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
of her, is of the holy Ghoſt;</hi> ſo it was by the power of the holy
Ghoſt that Chriſt was conceived, not by any power of nature. Many
have a great deale of the power of nature in them, and yet Chriſt can
never be conceived in them unleſſe the power of the holy Ghoſt come
upon them: therefore 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 3. it is ſaid, <hi>That no man can ſay that Ieſus
is the Lord, but by the holy Ghoſt,</hi> wherefore if men ſtand meerely in the
ſtrength of nature they can never have Chriſt conceived in them, but it
muſt be by the power of the holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>But how was Chriſt conceived by the holy Ghoſt? Three waies:<note place="margin">Queſt. Sol.</note>
firſt, the Godhead did ſanctifie that part of the fleſh of the Virgin, that
Chriſt was made of,<note place="margin">1</note> that is,<note place="margin">How Chriſt was conceived by the holy Ghoſt. Simile.</note> he did ſever it and purifie it, from corruption
and from ſinne. As a cunning Artificer doth draw away all the droſſe
from the gold, ſo the holy Ghoſt, did purifie and ſanctifie that part of
the fleſh of the Virgin, that Chriſt was made of.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> hee did faſhion and frame that part of the fleſh of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,
that he had fanctified, and made it a fit houſe and Temple for his
Godhead to dwell in.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> he did unite and knit the humane nature to his Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and ſo made one perſon of both: what may this teach us? That as
the holy Ghoſt did fanctifie that part of the Virgin which Chriſt was
made of, and did faſhion and frame it to bee a fit Temple of God to
dwell in, ſo it muſt be the holy Ghoſt, that muſt ſanctifie our fleſh, and
make us fit temples for God to dwell in, or els we ſhall be no better than
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:17958:59"/>
ſties and ſtables, for a habitation to the divell: therefore we muſt pray
God that the holy Ghoſt may come upon us, and make us fit temples for
his Spirit to dwell in: for (as I ſhewed you in the morning) one ſparke
of the Spirit of God, is able to deſtroy a whole heape and lumpe of
corruption.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> Bring a man to a houſe full of powder, there is matter
enough to doe a great deale of miſchiefe, to blow up many cities and
townes, but bring but a little ſparke of fire and put to it, and it is all
gone with a blaſt: ſo there is power enough in the devill, in our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
and nature, to doe a great deale of miſchiefe. I, but bring to it
a little ſparke of the holy Ghoſt, and it will bring all the power of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to nothing: therefore let us heartily pray to God we may have a
little of the power of the Spirit given which is able to bring our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
nature to nothing, and ſo much the rather let us pray for this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the judgements of God, bee heavy upon the land, and upon our
neighbours; in which caſe if the Lord doe not ſanctifie our fleſh, it is
like he will deſtroy us: therefore let us pray to God that we may have
a little of the Spirit of God, to deſtroy our corruptions. But why was
Chriſt conceived by the holy Ghoſt? That he might be pure and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſinne; for all that are conceived by ordinary generation, are ſinfull;
as <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 51. 5. <hi>I was conceived in ſinne, and borne in iniquity:</hi> ſo <hi>Iob,
Wee are all corrupted;</hi> and who can bring a pure thing out of a corrupt
fountaine? why then was not Chriſt conceived ordinarily, as the ſons
of <hi>Adam</hi> are, but by the holy Ghoſt? It was that hee might bee pure
and holy. <hi>Chriſt</hi> was the firſt that purified mans nature; for ſin and it were
ſo joyned together, that none could take mans nature, but he muſt take
his ſinne; now Chriſt hee hath parted mans nature and ſinne; and all
that be in Chriſt ſhall feele this parting power of Chriſt, to part mans
nature and ſinne: theſe are ſo combined together, as we dayly ſee, that
reprove a man of any ſinne, hee will preſently anſwere, it is my nature;
I pray you beare with wee, I can doe no otherwiſe; I cannot leave it.
Now if we be in Chriſt, we ſhall feele this dividing power, to part mans
nature and ſinne. So ſaith <hi>Paul, Roman.</hi> 7. 19. <hi>The good thing that I would
doe that doe I not, and the evill thing that I would not doe, that doe I: ſo then it
is no more I, but ſinne that dwelleth in me:</hi> ſo ſinne was one thing, and mans
nature was another thing. Therefore wee muſt pray to God that wee
may have this parting power of Chriſt, that howſoever wee keepe the
nature of man, yet that ſinne may be parted from us: and this was the
reaſon why Chriſt was conceived by the holy Ghoſt. Now there is one
thing, that may be objected againſt this:</p>
               <p>How could Chriſt be free from ſinne,<note place="margin">Object.</note> ſeeing hee tooke mans nature
upon him, and was according to his humanity in the loynes of <hi>Adam;</hi>
for <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. it is ſaid of <hi>Adam, In whom all have ſinned:</hi> and <hi>Hebrew.</hi> 7. that
<hi>Levi alſo who received tithes, paid tithes in Abraham: For hee was yet in the
loynes of his father when Melchizedech met him:</hi> ſo that which <hi>Abraham</hi>
did, that <hi>Levi</hi> did being in his loynes; thus Chriſt being in his humane
nature in the loynes of <hi>Adam,</hi> how could he be free from ſinne?</p>
               <p>To this I anſwere;<note place="margin">Sol.</note> that if he had beene conceived and made by the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:17958:60"/>
power of nature, he could not be without ſin; but he was conceived by
the power of the holy Ghoſt, and ſo made by it for the power of nature
could not have brought forth Chriſt. As we ſee in nature, that the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of a chaire of State was in the tree,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and yet the Tree could not
bring forth ſuch a chaire of State fit for the king to ſit in, though it
ſhould grow a thouſand yeeres; but it muſt bee made and faſhioned out
by the ſkill and cunning of the Workeman, for it could never grow to
be one, but is made one out of a tree, by the workeman: ſo though
Chriſt were in the loynes of <hi>Adam,</hi> yet nature could never bee able to
bring forth Chriſt, but it muſt be by the power of the <hi>holy Ghoſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>what adoe there was at Chriſts conception;</hi> as (wee know) <hi>Ioſeph</hi>
could not ſleepe; <hi>Mary</hi> ſhe muſt be called in queſtion, for her honeſtie;
and the Angell muſt come downe from heaven to quiet all: ſo it is ſtil,
if Chriſt be conceived in the heart of a man, all the country muſt heare,
and ring of it, he muſt be table-talke, and they ſay, he is melancholy or
mad; there is ſuch adoe about it: yea, there was never more adoe at
the conception of Chriſt in the wombe of the Virgin, than there is at
the conception of Chriſt in the heart of a Chriſtian. Examples wee
have <hi>Act.</hi> 2. when the Spirit of God came upon the Diſciples: (who
were but poore fiſhermen) in firy tongues, how did the people wonder
and admire at it? ſome ſaid, They were drunke, ſome mad: ſo it is ſtill,
Chriſt cannot bee conceived in the heart of a Chriſtian, but the world
runnes in a rout together: and ſome ſay, the party is mad, ſome melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly,
and ſome one thing and ſome another. And thus much for the
conception of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now we come to ſpeake of his birth: wherein obſerve theſe five
things:</hi>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Of whom he was borne.<note place="margin">Firſt, of whom Chriſt is borne.</note>

               </list>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>of whom he was borne:</hi> He was borne of the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> as it is
in the profeſſion of our Chriſtian faith, and <hi>Matth.</hi> 1. 23. Hence two
things are to be obſerved:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That Chriſts was borne of a Virgin.</item>
                  <item>2. That He was borne of the Virgin Mary.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Three reaſons why Chriſt was borne of a Virgin. Reaſon 1.</note> 
                  <hi>He was borne of a Virgin.</hi> Of which there may bee given three
reaſons: firſt, that he might be freed of the guilt of ſinne, which comes
by the courſe of nature: for all that are borne according to the courſe
of nature are ſinfull, therefore Chriſt was borne of a Virgin, not by the
courſe of nature: all that were in the loynes of <hi>Adam,</hi> as he ſinned, ſo
did they; as we may ſee in another caſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. <hi>Levi</hi> paid tithes to <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedech,
when he was in the loynes of Abraham,</hi> ſo that which <hi>Abraham</hi> did,
<hi>Levi</hi> did, being in his loynes: in like manner <hi>Paul</hi> (ſpeaking of <hi>Adam</hi>)
ſaith, <hi>In whom all have ſinned, Rom.</hi> 5. 12. therefore all that were in the
loynes of <hi>Adam,</hi> as he ſinned, ſo did they. But Chriſt, that hee might
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:17958:60"/>
take mans nature upon him, and be freed from ſinne, was borne of a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin:
as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, hee tooke mans nature without ſinne, that the
purity of his birth might ſanctifie the impurity of our birth, for wee are
conceived in ſinne, and borne in iniquity: ſo <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 51.
now we are ſanctified from the impurity of our birth, by the birth of
Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Reaſon 2.</note> to fulfill the propheſies made of him; as <hi>Eſai.</hi> 7. 14. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
a Virgin ſhall conceive and beare a Sonne, and ſhall call his name Emanuel,
&amp;c.</hi> So <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. God promiſeth, that <hi>The ſeede of the Woman ſhall breake
the head of the ſerpent;</hi> therefore when there was ſuch a ſeede of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
that came without the helpe of man, it appeared this was the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
that God had aſſigned for the breaking of the ſerpents head, and this
is the note or marke that God hath given, whereby the <hi>Meſſias</hi> the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
of the world might be knowne. This was not onely the love of
God, to ſend Chriſt into the world to ſave us, but to ſet viſible markes
and notes upon him, that ſo we might know him: wee read <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 15.
<hi>The Lord ſet a marke upon Caine:</hi> and <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. the doore poſts were ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with the bloud of the <hi>Paſcall Lambe,</hi> that ſo the Augell of deſtruction
might paſſe over them; ſo alſo in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> thoſe were marked, which
did mourne for the ſinnes of the people, that they might not be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but preſerved: in like manner God hath ſet a viſible marke upon
Chriſt that he might be diſcerned; therefore ſeeing God hath ſet viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
markes and notes upon Him, that we may know him, we muſt ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
and ſo accept of Him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Reaſon 3.</note> that the ſtrangeneſſe of his birth, might awaken and ſtirre up
the world, to looke for ſtrange things by his life; which was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
why ſome of the holy people had ſuch ſtrange births, as <hi>Iſaac, Iaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kob,
Moſes, Samuel, Sampſon,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> that the ſtrangeneſſe of their
birth, might awake he world and ſtirre them up to looke for extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
matters in their lives; ſo Chriſt had a rare birth, that hee might
awaken and ſtirre up the world, to looke for ſtrange things by his life:
as at the Shepheards relation (when they had publiſhed the things that
they had ſeene by the Childe,) the people wondered; ſo wee ſhould
wonder at the rareneſſe of his birth, for there bee ſtrange things in the
birth of Chriſt; that hee muſt be ſent to earth, to bring us to Heaven;
that Hee who was uncorruptible, muſt be made corruptible, to make us
uncorruptible; that he muſt be made the Sonne of a Woman, that we
might be made the ſonnes of God. The Vſes ſhall bee two:</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> for inſtruction; ſeeing Chriſt, was borne of a Virgin without
the helpe of man, therefore that which is impoſſible by the courſe of
nature, is poſſible by the power of God: it was impoſſible by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of nature, that ever Chriſt ſhould bee borne of the Virgin without
the helpe of man, but it was poſſible to God. Wee ſee in <hi>Sarah,</hi> it was
impoſſible in nature that ſhe ſhould beare a childe, in her old age, when
her wombe was dead, and yet it was poſſible by the power of God: ſo
<hi>Moſes</hi> when hee ſtrucke the rocke with his ſtaffe, that it guſhed water,
one would have thought rather that it would have given out fire, but
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:17958:61"/>
that which was impoſſible to be effected by nature, was poſſible by the
power of God: ſo likewiſe we read 2 <hi>King.</hi> 7. when there was a dearth
in <hi>Samaria, Eliſha</hi> propheſied of a great plenty, which one Prince (who
did heare it) was ſo farre from beleeving that he ſaid, it was impoſſible
it ſhould bee, although the windowes of heaven ſhould be opened; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede
to nature it was, but not to God. Now this muſt be the reſt and
ſtay of a Chriſtian in other hard caſes; in nature it is a thing impoſſible,
that euer one that is dead and rotten ſhould riſe againe, but it is poſſible
by the power of God: ſo art thou weake, though it bee impoſſible for a
weake and fraile man to withſtand the temptations of the devill; yet
know the power of God is able to make thee ſtrong to overcome the
devill; remember therfore the power of God in all his promiſes: haſt
thou a promiſe that if thou doe repent and beleeve, thou ſhalt bee ſaved,
that he will lay no more upon thee, than thou art able to beare; that he
will raiſe up thy body at the laſt day? Conſider that which is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to nature, is poſſible to the power of God; (as the Apoſtle ſaith) <hi>He
is able to make all grace abound in us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> ſeeing Chriſt was borne of a Virgin, ſo he muſt be ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
borne in our hearts and conſciences; for I have ſhewed you before,
as Chriſt muſt be ſpiritually conceived in the heart of a Chriſtian, ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
he muſt be borne; for it is nothing to know that Chriſt was conceived
in the wombe of the Virgin, and to be borne of her, unleſſe thou know
alſo Chriſt to be ſpiritually conceived, and borne in thy heart: therfore
as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, What ſhall it profit mee to know, that Chriſt is come
in the fleſh, that hee was conceived in the wombe of the Virgin, and
borne of her, unleſſe I know Chriſt to bee conceived in my fleſh, and
borne in my heart and ſoule? ſo that it is not enough to have Chriſt
conceived in our hearts, unleſſe hee bee borne and brought forth in us;
there bee a number that (as it were) conceive Chriſt, that have good
motions and good deſires, but they doe not bring them forth, Chriſt
is not borne in them: and therefore they die; But we muſt labour to
bring him forth in our lives, and in our actions. We read of a wonder in
Heaven <hi>Revel.</hi> 12. 1. the Church is deſcribed to be travelling in paine to
bring forth Chriſt; ſo every Chriſtian muſt travell, bee in paine, and
bring Him forth in his life and in his actions: wee muſt goe to <hi>Bethlem</hi>
with the ſhepheards to finde Chriſt, and when wee have found him, wee
muſt take him and make our hearts the cradle or cratch to lay Chriſt in,
and ſay as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>The life that I now live in the fleſh I live by
faith of the Sonne of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next thing is, that <hi>hee was borne of the Virgin Mary;</hi> wherein two
things are to be conſidered:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Of what ſtocke ſhee came.</item>
                  <item>2. What was her eſtate.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Firſt, what ſtocke the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin Mary came of.</note> for her ſtocke; ſhe came of the ſtocke and lineage of <hi>David,</hi> as
<hi>Matth.</hi> 1. 20. In <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 4. it is ſaid, <hi>That Ioſeph alſo went up from Galilee a
city of Nazareth unto Iudea, unto the city of David which is called Bethlem,
becauſe he was of the houſe and Lineage of David: Ioſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> both
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:17958:61"/>
ſprang from hence: <hi>Matthew</hi> hee ſets downe, how <hi>Ioſeph</hi> came of the
race and line of <hi>David;</hi> Saint <hi>Luke</hi> ſhewes how <hi>Mary</hi> came of <hi>David,</hi>
and both to this end, to ſhew that Chriſt, is the Sonne of <hi>David,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the fleſh, and therefore the true <hi>Meſsiah</hi> and Saviour of the
world, for the true <hi>Meſsiah</hi> was to come of the houſe and line of <hi>David:</hi>
this we muſt beleeve, and confeſſe him to bee the true <hi>Meſsias</hi> and <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our:</hi>
as the blinde men in the Goſpell, when hee heard that Chriſt
paſſed by, cryed out and ſaid, <hi>O Sonne of David, have mercy upon us;</hi> ſo
we ſhould cry out to him and ſay, <hi>O Ieſus the Sonne of David have mercy
upon us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Secondly, her eſtate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>for her eſtate;</hi> She was but a poore maid matched to a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter;
who would have thought but that Chriſt would have made
choyce of ſome great Queene or noble perſonage, but he (wee ſee) was
borne of this poore and meane Virgin. Now if any doubt of this, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they were a poore couple or no, let them looke <hi>Luke</hi> 2. and there
they ſhall ſee that they brought for their offering, a paire of Turtle
doves, and two young pigeons, for <hi>Levit.</hi> 12. 8. theſe were the offerings
of the poore.</p>
               <p>Now,<note place="margin">Foure reaſons why Chriſt was borne of ſuch meane Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</note> what was the reaſon, that Chriſt was ſo poorely borne? I
anſwere, there be foure reaſons of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, that by the meaneſſe of his birth, he might ſanctifie the meaneſt
of our births;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The firſt Reaſon of Chriſts low birth.</note> 
                  <hi>therefore no man ought to deſpiſe any Chriſtian for the
meaneſſe of his birth, for if hee doe, it is like he will deſpise Chriſt: It
is ſaid,</hi> Pſalm. 113. He raiſeth the needy out of the duſt, and lifteth up the poore
out of the dunghill that he may ſet him with Princes: <hi>ſo</hi> Pſalm. 78. 70. He choſe
David his ſervant, and tooke him from the ſheepefold, even from the Ewes great
with young brought hee him, that he might feede Iacob his people, and Iſrael his
Inheritance.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Reaſon 2.</note> to pull downe the pride of this world, for a number doe
ſo ſwell with their greatneſſe as if they were little gods, Chriſt he was
borne thus meanely to pull downe their pride, in that (as he was man)
the Sonne of a poore Carpenter ſhall bee their Iudge: many an one
thinkes that he can doe any thing with his mony, but mony cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme
a ſoule, therefore Chriſt hath done more for us by his pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
than all the bagges of money and riches of this world could have
done.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Reaſon 3.</note> to teach us contentment in the eſtate that God ſhall aſſigne
us unto; for there is no man ſo poore, but Chriſt was as poore, therefore
we ſhould bee contented with what wee have. Art thou a Gentleman,
and doſt thou want living? a Scholler wanting imployment? art thou an
Artificer and a good workeman, wanting worke? remember that Chriſt
by the meaneſſe of his low eſtate hath ſanctified this eſtate to thee,
who being obedient heere to his father and content with his eſtate for
a little time, was after advanced to glory; ſo, if we be obedient to God,
and contented with the eſtate that God doth aſſigne us, wee ſhall after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
be advanced to glory with Him for ever.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Reaſon 4.</note> the more to eſteeme the greatneſſe of Gods love, that hee
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:17958:62"/>
did not onely give Chriſt for us, but gave him in ſuch a poore eſtate,
that the Angels did wonder and admire at it,<note place="margin">Reaſon 4.</note> that Chriſt was laid in
a cratch; therefore as the Lord ſaith, <hi>Eſai.</hi> 5. 5. <hi>What could I have done
more for my Vineyard that I have not done, &amp;c?</hi> So what could God have
done more for us? Suppoſe God ſhould come downe and take a man
here by the hand, and ſhould carry him into the garden, there ſhew him
Chriſt lying groveling on the ground, ſweating droppes of blood for
him; thence carry him into the judgment hall of <hi>Pilate,</hi> there ſhew
him <hi>Chriſt</hi> crowned with a crowne of thornes, his face buffeted, his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
whipped; afterwards carry him to mount <hi>Calvary,</hi> and ſhew him
Chriſt hanging upon the croſſe in paines, and torments, with his backe
whipped, his face buffeted, his ſide pierced, his hands nailed: And
there Chriſt ſhould ſay to him, all this have I undergone for thy ſake,
and yet thou art but my ſervant, and my bad ſervant too; I was conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to be borne in a ſtable, laid in a manger, ſwadled in clouts, arraigned,
condemned, before <hi>Pilate,</hi> to bee crucified on the croſſe, ſweat drops
of blood in the garden; conſider with thy ſelfe, how I have done all
this for thee and for thy ſake, and yet thou art not contented to doe any
thing for me, O thou moſt ungratefull man or woman, but rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightest
to vex and grieve me with thy ſinnes. The <hi>Papiſts</hi> take occaſion
in their fancies, exceedingly to extoll the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> calling her the
<hi>Queene of Heaven,</hi> and ſetting her throne, above the throne of Chriſt;
we doe not doubt but that ſhee was a vertuous woman in her time, and
is now at reſt with God, and was more bleſſed for bearing of Christ,
in her heart, than in her wombe; ſhee was not bleſſed becauſe ſhee did
beare Chriſt onely, but rather for beleeving in him: for ſo we read <hi>Luk.</hi>
11. 27. There was <hi>a certaine woman in the company, lifted up her voyce, and
ſaid to Chriſt, Bleſſed is the wombe that bare thee, and the paps that gave thee
ſucke: but he ſaid, yea rather bleſſed are they which heare the word of God and
keepe it:</hi> Thus <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, that ſhe was more bleſſed, for receiving the
faith of Chriſt, than for receiving the fleſh of Chriſt in her wombe:
and <hi>Epiphanius</hi> upon the ſecond of <hi>Iohn,</hi> where Chriſt ſaid to her, <hi>Woman,
what have I to do with thee?</hi> ſaith, leſt any ſhould thinke too highly of her,
he ſaith, <hi>Woman what have I to doe with thee?</hi> He ſet her in the common
rancke and order with other women; for Chriſt by the ſpirit of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie
did foreſee what would come to paſſe afterwards. And the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
<hi>Mary</hi> in her ſong ſaith, <hi>My ſoule doth magnifie the Lord, and my ſpirit
doth rejoyce in God my Saviour:</hi> Therefore it is cleere the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi>
was more bleſſed, for beleeving in Chriſt, than for bearing of Him.</p>

world, the neerer we are to the accompliſhment of Gods promiſes, and
as every day doth winde up the threed of this life, ſo wee come ſo much
neerer to our ſalvation, and the comforts and bleſſings which hee hath

<hi>Give me my wife, for I have ſerved my time;</hi> ſo a Chriſtian may ſay
unto God, Give me that which thou haſt promiſed me, for the time is
come. Particularly the time is deſcribed two wayes:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. In the daies of Herod the king; Matth. 2.</item>
                  <item>2. When Auguſtus cauſed all the world to be taxed, Luk. 2.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">The firſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular time when Herod was king.</note> 
                  <hi>Chriſt was borne when Herod was king:</hi> why doth the Evangeliſt note
this unto us? firſt, to ſhew that Chriſts kingdome is not of this world,
for Chriſt was borne when there was another king; hee was borne a
King, for the <hi>Wiſemen</hi> made inquiry, <hi>Where He is that is borne King of the
Iewes.</hi> And in another place when he was before <hi>Pilate,</hi> hee aſked him,
<hi>Whether he were a king;</hi> and he ſaid, <hi>for this cauſe was I borne, and for this
cauſe came I into the world, &amp;c.</hi> But it was of another kingdome, a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
kingdome, not of a temporary. And what may this teach us? that
we are not to looke for a worldly and a temporall kingdome, but for a
ſpirituall; therefore when a Chriſtian is under the croſſe, hee may ſay,
My kingdome is not of this world; I looke not for a temporary king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
but for a kingdome above the clouds, a kingdome of glory and
happineſſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Chriſt was borne at the loweſt ebb of the Jewiſh eſtate.</note> Chriſt was borne when the eſtate of the Iewes kingdome
was at the loweſt ebb; for <hi>Iaakob</hi> propheſied <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 10. <hi>That the Scepter
ſhould not depart from Iuda, nor a Lawgiver from betweene his feete, till Shil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
came;</hi> that is, when a ſtranger was king, when as the eſtate of the Iewes
was at the worſt. This may teach us, that the time, when Chriſt comes
in the preſence of his power and goodneſſe, is when things bee at the
worſt: ſo <hi>Ioh.</hi> 11. when did Chriſt come? when <hi>Lazarus was dead foure
daies and did ſtinke,</hi> then He came: ſo likewiſe when the Diſciples were
at ſea, in danger of drowning, and had laboured all night, then did Chriſt
come to them, <hi>in the fourth watch towards morning:</hi> ſo ſtill Chriſt comes
when things be at the worſt with us. It is not a time for Chriſt to come
till <hi>Herod</hi> bee king, till things bee at the worſt, and when we have little
hope; as ſoone as we are touched with Gods hand we would have eaſe
and helpe, but Chriſts time is not till we be paſt helpe, when things bee
at the worſt; as <hi>Iohn.</hi> 2. Chriſts time was not till all the wine was ſpent,
then it was a time for him to ſhew his power.</p>
               <p>The ſecond particular time ſet downe,<note place="margin">The ſecond par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular time.</note> 
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 2. was, <hi>when Augustus
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:17958:64"/>
Caeſar cauſed the whole world to be taxed:</hi> which was firſt to fulfill a prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,<note place="margin">The firſt cauſe.</note>
                  <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 44. it was fore-told, that God would ſet up another kingdome
in the daies of the <hi>Roman</hi> kings, that ſhould batter, breake and deſtroy all
thoſe kings, which kingdome ſhould ſtand for ever: therefore howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
we be ſubjects of another kingdome, and citizens of other cities,
yet let us labour to bee citizens of this citie, and ſubjects of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
becauſe this ſhall batter downe all other kingdomes, and ſhall
ſtand for ever. The Thiefe on the croſſe hee deſired to be a ſubject of
this kingdome, ſaying, <hi>Lord remember mee when thou comeſt into thy king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;</hi>
ſo let us pray to God, to make us ſubjects of this kingdome, ſince
this ſhall ſtand when all other kingdomes ſhall fall.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">The ſecond cauſe.</note> it was to ſhew that Chriſt for our ſakes, came under the
taxe, and not onely the money taxe, but to be taxed in his ſoule, to have
the fear full wrath and diſpleaſure of God powred upon him, and to
die for our ſinnes; as <hi>Eſai.</hi> 53. <hi>The chaſtiſements of our peace were upon
him.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> As <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 6. <hi>Abraham tooke the woode of the Aſſe, and laid it on the
ſhoulders of his ſonne:</hi> ſo we were the Aſſes that were burthened; God
was he, that tooke it off of us, and laid it on the ſhoulders of his Sonne
not only the mony taxe, but the taxe of Gods wrath and diſpleaſure.
And therefore if Christ were taxed for us, let us be contented to be tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for him; wee thinke it a great matter to bee taxed in our names, or
goods, yet this is not that by a thouſand parts which Chriſt ſuffered for
us.</p>
               <p>The third thing is,<note place="margin">Thirdly, the place of Chriſts birth.</note> 
                  <hi>the place where Chriſt was borne;</hi> in <hi>Bethlem,</hi> ſo ſaith
the Evangeliſt. It was not in the Royall citie of the kingdome, <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
but in a poore towne, a place of no great reſpect; neither was hee
borne in the braveſt houſe, but in an Inne; and not in the beſt roome
thereof, but in a ſtable.</p>
               <p>But why was Chriſt thus baſely borne,<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> ſeeing the best place had been
too baſe for him to be borne in, if we conſider the dignity of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon?</p>
               <p>I anſwere;<note place="margin">Sol.</note> firſt, to ſhew the guilt of our ſinnes which was upon
him;<note place="margin">Reaſon 1.</note> for he was no ſooner come into the world, but our ſinnes caught
hold on him, and ſtopped him of his glory, and turned him into a ſtable:
<hi>Geneſis,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> 4. ſinne is compared unto a curſt Dog, that lyeth at the doore,
that a man goes no ſooner out, but he is ready to fly upon him and rende
out his throat; ſo wee ſee, that Chriſt was no ſooner come into the
world, but our ſinnes caught hold on him, and turned him into a ſtable:
therefore hence we may ſee our guiltineſſe to be ſuch, that wee are not
worthy of the meaneſt place we live in.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Reaſon 2.</note> to procure a better place for us to bee borne in; he was
laid in a manger, that we might bee laid in our ſoft beds. It is the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſſe
of the world, to deſpiſe him, becauſe hee was poore: but
Chriſt came poore into the world, to make us rich: to which purpoſe
Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith well, Lord, (ſaith he) I am more beholding to thee,
for thy poverty in redeeming mee, than for all the riches of thy power
in creating me.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:17958:64"/>
Thirdly, that wee ſhould bee contented with any eſtate, that God
ſhould aſſigne unto us;<note place="margin">Reaſon 3.</note> let us looke on the eſtate of Chriſt, he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to be borne in a ſtable; laid in a cratch: O that the world would
thinke of their ſinnes, how that by reaſon of them they are not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of the meaneſt place they live in! and yet we murmure and grudge
againſt it, though our eſtates be better than his was; Hee was conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with his eſtate, but wee are not with our eſtates: it is our ſinne, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
we for it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Fourthly, the manner of Chriſts birth.</note> 
                  <hi>the manner of Chriſts birth:</hi> and that is to bee conſidered
three waies: firſt, <hi>after the common manner wee be borne;</hi> for when things
be extraordinary, then the holy Ghoſt doth ſet them downe in extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
termes, and when they be common and ordinary, then hee doth
uſe ordinary termes to expreſſe himſelfe by. Now in this place where
the holy Ghoſt ſpeakes of the birth of Chriſt, he doth uſe no extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
but the ſame termes, that is uſed in the birth of other of the
holy men of God; as of <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> and the reſt: therefore Chriſt was
borne, after the common and ordinary manner as wee be borne. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede
the conception of Chriſt was miraculous and extraordinary;
therefore they ſay, that Chriſt did paſſe from his Mother and came
through her, without opening her wombe; but this is a meere fancie of
theirs, the Scripture is againſt it; for <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 23. <hi>Every manchilde that firſt
openeth the wombe, ſhall beholy unto the Lord;</hi> therefore we ſee the birth of
Chriſt was ordinary; and as other children paſſe away from their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
ſo did hee: the Fathers are plaine for this, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith, this
is the wombe, for whoſe ſake it is ſaid, that every one that openeth the
wombe ſhall be holy to the Lord: and Saint <hi>Ierome,</hi> the law of firſt ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the wombe ſhall be holy to the Lord, doth moſt eſpecially belong
to Christ, yet ordinarily to others.</p>
               <p>The Papiſts object againſt this,<note place="margin">Object. Anſ.</note> and ſay, How could His mother be a
virgin, if Chriſt were borne after the ſame manner as others are? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere,
that the Scripture is plaine, that ſhee was not onely a Virgin
when Chriſt was conceived, but ſo when Chriſt was borne; as <hi>Eſai.</hi> 7.
<hi>A Virgin ſhall conceive, and beare a Sonne;</hi> ſo ſhee was a Virgin at his birth;
yea the Schoolemen ſay, that the breaking and opening of her wombe
did not take away her virginity: Hence wee conclude that Chriſt was
borne after the ordinary manner we be.</p>
               <p>The Vſe is:<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> firſt, to ſee the ſtrange humility of Chriſt, that he would be
borne as we are, and come into the world as we come, which this place
is not fit to deſcribe: but the next childe that comes into the world,
and that you are at the birth of, you may conſider it, with this ſhort
meditation; Thus was Chriſt borne in this weake manner, and ſtepped
thus low for my ſalvation, and therefore how juſtly ſhall I periſh, if I
deſpiſe this great mercy. <hi>Peter</hi> he did wonder at the humility of Chriſt,
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 13. that he wold ſtoop ſo low, as to waſh his Diſciples feet but how
may we wonder at his ſtrange humility that he would be borne, as we
are? therefore we may upon this conſideration breake forth, and ſay; O
bleſſed Lord, what am I that thou wouldeſt be borne thus for my ſake,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:17958:65"/>
that thou wouldeſt ſtoope ſo low for me! How ſhould I reſpect and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
thee?</p>
               <p>The ſecond uſe is,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> ſeeing Chriſt was contented to ſtoope to the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
of thy birth, thou ſhouldeſt be content to be borne ſpiritually:
I, but to be borne of the Spirit is tedious: why conſider with thy ſelfe,
was Chriſt contented to be borne of a Virgin, thou maieſt be contented
to bee borne of the Spirit: He ſuffered; prayed in the garden, died on
the croſſe for thee, was contented to bee borne of the Virgin, thou
mai'ſt well be contented then to be borne of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Secondly, hee was borne meanely.</note> 
                  <hi>he was borne meanely,</hi> in the pooreſt manner that might be;
and as we may ſee in this place, there was no body to give him helpe, no
light ſhining, nor Angell appearing, no fine things to put him in; but he
was ſwadled in clouts &amp; rags. This was a ſtrange humiliation of Chriſt;
to be borne ſo baſely, that all the Angels might admire and wonder at
it, and bee confounded to thinke of the baſeneſſe of Chriſts birth;
which hath made our adverſaries deviſe ſtrange ſtories to grace the
birth of Chriſt with, they ſay in the Goſpell of Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> (which is a
falſe Goſpell) that when Chriſt was borne, the whole courſe of nature
was ſtayed, that the birds that were flying in the ayre, could not ſtirre
but hung there; the goats that went to drinke, could not move their
lippes; a ſhepheard putting foorth his hooke to catch his ſheepe it hung
in the ayre, and the like fopperies; for the world was not then able to
conſider, why Chriſt was ſo poorely borne. Another tale they deviſed,
to grace the birth of Chriſt, was this: that when <hi>Ioſeph</hi> went for the
midwife, Chriſt was borne in the meane time, at which time there was
ſuch a light, as they might ſee aſwell at midnight, as at noone day: but
this could not be, for there was no light ſhining in the roome, no An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell,
none to give him helpe. The world cannot conceive it, but there
bee divers reaſons of it.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Foure Reaſons of Chriſts meane Birth.</note> 
                  <hi>to ſhew the infinite goodneſſe and love of Chriſt thus to ſtoope ſo low, to
be ſo baſely borne, to ſave me and thee:</hi> it was a ſtrange love that he would be
borne, as we are, and ſo creepe along with us, to grow as we grow, live
as we live,<note place="margin">1</note> and ſtoope to all the infirmities of our nature; yea even to
dye and to lye in the grave with us, that ſo wee might apply our ſinfull
bodies to his holy body, our impure fleſh to his pure fleſh, that ſo hee
might quicken and give us life. <hi>David,</hi> when he conſidered the worke of
creation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8. 4. burſt out into this ſpeech, <hi>Lord what is man that thou art
ſo mindefull of him, &amp;c.</hi> much more may we ſay, (admiring the worke
of our Redemption) not only what is man? But what a good Lord is
this that he would be contented to ſtoope ſo low, to be ſo baſely borne
for my ſalvation: which made holy <hi>Bernard</hi> ſay, ſo much the more ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
thou art borne, the more deare thou art to my ſoule, and to my heart
in this regard.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>to ſhew what a great matter it is to redeeme us,</hi> and how wee
are to make much of that Salvation, that Chriſt would bee ſo baſely
borne to purchaſe for us. Therefore ſeeing Chriſt was pleaſed to come
thus into the world, to ſave us, how ſhould we bee contented to be aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:17958:65"/>
now, to ſtand before God with comfort at the day of judgement?
as <hi>Paul, Phil.</hi> 3. 8. <hi>Yea doubtleſſe I count all things but loſt for the excellent know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Chriſt Ieſus my Lord: for whom I ſuffered the loſſe of all things; and

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſſe, that I might winne Chriſt,</hi> and might be
found in him: ſo <hi>Ignatius</hi> when he ſhould ſuffer, Lord, ſaith he, I care for
nothing, whether for things viſible, or inviſible, for the tearing my fleſh,
or the loſing of my members, or for all the divels can deviſe againſt
me, ſo that I may bee made any thing to be ſaved. As a cunning worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
takes a peece of clay to make a goodly jmage;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> hee tempers the
clay, changeth it into twenty ſhapes and faſhions before hee makes the
image: ſo the Lord (this cunning workeman) doth when hee would
make the picture of Chriſt in us; he doth as it were temper and change
us into twenty ſhapes, before hee makes his beautifull Image in us:
therefore wee ſhould bee contented to be diſpoſed at the good will of
God, to change us into any ſhape, ſickneſſe, poverty, want, or diſgrace,
and be made any thing to be ſaved.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>to ſhew that the greatneſſe of our ſinnes tooke hold on him;</hi> for he
was no ſooner come into the world, but our ſinnes were upon him and
put all this baſeneſſe and meanneſſe upon him. Therefore doſt thou
wonder thou art a prophane man or an Adulterer, or a drunkard, or a
Swearer, that God brings poverty upon thee, blindneſſe, lameneſſe, or
an evill name; why looke upon Chriſt, and we ſhall ſee that the guilt of
our ſinnes, being upon him, brought all this baſeneſſe and meaneſſe upon

               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4</note> 
                  <hi>that the meaneſſe and hardneſſe of Chriſts eſtate, might ſanctifie</hi>

in the ſight of God, notwithſtanding this abaſement, therefore doe
thou labour to be a childe of God, and then thou ſhalt be deare and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious

compares a good man,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> to a peece of gold, that if we take it, tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
it, and treade it in the durt, yet the gold is never the worſe; ſo (ſaith
he) let the world trample and treade upon a good man, hee is not the
worſe; he loſeth none of his goodneſſe: and theſe be the reaſons in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of God, why Chriſt was thus baſely borne.</p>
               <p>Now the reaſon in regard of the world (the Evangeliſts doe ſhew)
was, becauſe there was no roome in the Inne: this was ſtrange, was
there no roome for Chriſt in the Inne? was there never a chamber,
nor a corner of a roome for him to be borne in? There was roome I
warrant you for ſwaggerers and drunkards, for dicers and carders, for
prophane perſons, but there was no roome for Chriſt to bee borne in,
theſe had taken up all the roomes, ſo as Chriſt muſt bee turned to bee
borne in a ſtable. And I would to God it were not the ſin of the world
ſtill, that they have roome in their houſes for others, but no roome for
Chriſt: at this time, let us looke into the houſes of Gentlemen, and
great men, they have roome enough for ſwaggerers and ſwearers, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:17958:66"/>
and carders, and mummers, but no roome for Chriſt, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
prayer, or for the Bible; but Chriſt thy redeemer is as it were
turned into the ſtable: I beſeech God, that no ſuch accuſation may bee
laid to us; at the day of judgement: therefore whoſoever thou bee,
that keepeſt a roome to entertaine thy friend, bee ſure thou keepe a
roome in thy houſe to entertaine Chriſt, even his poore members to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine
Religion, prayer and all other Chriſtian duties; The <hi>Shuna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite</hi>
is commended in the 2 <hi>King.</hi> 4. 10. for keeping a chamber for the
man of God, even this ſhall be thy commendations, that thou keepeſt a
roome in thy houſe to entertaine Chriſts members, but if thou canſt not
keepe thus a chamber in thy houſe, yet keepe a little roome or corner in
thy heart for Chriſt: wee ſee a number of men, have roome in their
hearts, for every vile ſinne, and luſt, but no roome for Chriſt; whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
wee doe let us not turne out Chriſt, and let him have a roome to
ſeeke; but rather let us turne out our ſinnes, that ſo Chriſt may dwell
with us; and that we may dwell with him eternally.</p>
               <p>The laſt thing obſerved in the <hi>birth of Chriſt</hi> was, <hi>the manifeſtation
thereof:</hi> for ſeeing Chriſt was ſo obſcurely borne, in a ſtable, laid in a
cratch, we may wonder how the world came to know it: it was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted
three waies:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. By the Angels to the ſhepheards.</item>
                  <item>2. By a Starre to the Wiſemen.</item>
                  <item>3. By a ſecret motion of the Spirit to Simeon and Anna in
the Temple.</item>
               </list>
               <p>In the firſt manifeſtation of Chriſt to the ſhepheards we obſerve two
things:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>The manifeſtation it ſelfe.</hi>

               </list>
               <p>In the <hi>manifeſtation</hi> we may obſerve ſix things:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>To whom Chriſt was made manifeſt:</hi> To the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards.</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>What diſpoſition they were in upon their calling:</hi> watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their flocks.</item>
                  <item>3. <hi>By whom;</hi> by an <hi>Angell,</hi> when the <hi>Prieſts</hi> were ſilent in

               </list>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Firſt, unto whom Chriſt was manifeſted.</note> 
                  <hi>to whom Chriſt was made manifeſt,</hi> not to the great men of the
world, nor to the <hi>prieſts</hi> contemners of grace, but unto poore <hi>Shepheards:</hi>
one would have thought hee would firſt have manifeſted himſelfe to
kings and Queens, and to the great men of the land, and not unto poore
ſhepheards. Of which there be three Reaſons:</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Three Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why Chriſt was firſt knowne to the meaner ſort.</note> becauſe it was one of the parts of the degrees of Chriſts Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation,
that hee had not the great men of the world to grace him at
his birth, but onely poore ſhepheards; yea, this is a great ſtumbling
blocke ſtill, becauſe poore men receive the Goſpell, it hinders many
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:17958:66"/>
a man from receiving the truth or embracing Religion: but let no man
be offended at it, it was ſo when Chriſt came into the world. The Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
aſke the queſtion, <hi>Have any of the Rulers, or of the Phariſees beeleved on
him?</hi> thoſe that bee learned? it is but a company of poore men: and
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 26. ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>For ye ſee your calling brethren how that not
many wiſe men after the fleſh, not many mighty, not many noble are called: But
God hath choſen the fooliſh things of the world to confound the wiſe, &amp;c.</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>froe
labour to be one of Chriſts Diſciples, and he will not deſpiſe thee,
although thou be poore and meane.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> to ſhew that there is no condition, or eſtate ſo bad that can
hinder a man from Chriſt, whatſoever it be tradſeman, ſhepheard, or
how meane ſoever, he will not deſpiſe thee for thy meaneneſſe: ſome
would thinke, that ſuch great things ſhould be ingroſſed, for the great
men of this world; as we ſee that the beſt things bee gathered up all
the country over,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and ingroſſed for kings, and Queens: and becauſe
the beſt thing of all is Chriſt, therefore, that kings and Queenes ſhould
have had the chiefe ineterſt in him, and the poore have gone without,
but we may ſee that no meane condition can hinder a man from Chriſt;
but the poore man hath as great a part in him, as the rich. We read <hi>Gen.</hi>
2. 9. <hi>The tree of life ſtood in the middeſt of the garden of Paradiſe,</hi> that it
might equally impart it ſelfe to all ſorts and conditions of men; and ſo
<hi>Revel.</hi> 22. 2. In the <hi>Heavenly Ieruſalem,</hi> there is a <hi>tree of life</hi> ſaid to be in the
middeſt of the ſtreet, equally to impart it ſelfe to all ſorts poore and
rich: therefore this may bee a comfort, that no meane condition, or
eſtate, doth hinder a man from Chriſt. There bee many poore people
will not come at Church becauſe they have not good apparell; it is
good indeede that there bee, as much decencie in this as may be, that
men and women, when they come to the houſe of God, ſhould come as
comely and handſomely as they can; but if men have not decent and
comely apparell to come in, let them not refraine from comming to
the Church, becauſe they want apparell to come: but let them looke
to the heart and conſcience, and then <hi>Ieſus</hi> will be a <hi>Ieſus</hi> to them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> to ſhew that he muſt be the poore mans portion; the rich
man hath his portion in goods and in lands, but the poore mans portion
is in Chriſt: ſo <hi>Iam.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>Hath not God choſen the poore of the world, that they
ſhould be rich in faith, and heires of the kingdome which he promiſed to them
that love him?</hi> and therefore this may bee a great comfort to a poore
man although he hath not a great deale of goods and lands for his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
yet he may ſay, I thanke God, that Chriſt is my portion, his birth,
cradle, cratch, life, death, paſſion, and his merits are mine, this it was that
made <hi>Ieremy</hi> to rejoyce in his trouble, <hi>Lamen.</hi> 3. 24. <hi>The Lord is my porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
ſaith my ſoule, therefore will I hope in him;</hi> and ſo <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 16. 5. ſaith <hi>David,
The Lord is the portion of mine Inheritance:</hi> therefore thou that art a poore
man, and haſt but a little goods or lands, labour to make Chriſt thy por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
take him home into thy heart, apply him by faith, and then thou
haſt an excellent portion: if a man fall into the hands of his enemies,
or of theeves, who rob him and take away his goods, yet if he have a
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:17958:67"/>
Iewell of great price leſt about him, hee may ſay, Lord, I thanke thee,
though they have taken away my money and goods,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> yet they have left
me may Iewell: ſo, howſoever the world may take away from a man his
goods, peace, or his good name; yet a Chriſtian may have comfort and
ſay, Lord, I thanke thee, that I have ſtill my Iewell, they have not taken
away Chriſt from me.</p>
               <p>If any object and ſay,<note place="margin">Object. Sol. Simile.</note> is Chriſt the poore mans portion onely, doth
not he belong to the rich alſo? To this I anſwere, that the grace of the
Goſpell is like to a Vine, that runnes low firſt, at the bottome of the
tree, and by little and little windes and twiſts it ſelfe up, till it gets
to the top: ſo at firſt, the grace of the Goſpell, began low, it did as
it were creepe along on the ground, with poore men, and after it did
winde and twiſt up, till it came at the top, and ſo did winde within Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
and crownes of kings, which is the higheſt ſtep, that it can come to
in this world.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Secondly, in what diſpoſition the ſhepheards were found.</note> 
                  <hi>in what diſpoſition they were found,</hi> the text ſaith, <hi>they were
keeping their flockes;</hi> not Idle in their houſes, nor aſleepe in their beds, but
attending their flockes, in their callings. Here we may ſee what a good
thing it is for a man to be upon his calling: If we looke into the Bible
we ſhall ſee all the goodly apparitions that appeared, were when they
were upon their callings; when was it, that <hi>Iaakob</hi> ſaw in a viſion <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
aſcending and deſcending,</hi> when he was in his <hi>journey</hi> upon his calling?
ſo <hi>Moſes Exod.</hi> 2. when did the Lord appeare unto him; <hi>as hee was kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
his flocke?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iudg. 6. 11.</note> and ſo the Angell did appeare to <hi>Gedeon</hi> when <hi>hee was a
threſhing wheate</hi> in his calling: ſo the Lord tooke <hi>David, from following
the ſheepe great with young:</hi> And when were the Diſciples called? was it
not when <hi>they were a fiſhing</hi> in their calling, not when they were idle?
which may ſhew us, what an excellent thing it is for a man to be upon his
calling, to performe the duties of it: if there be any bleſſing ſtirring, or
any good thing, for the Angell of God to impart, hee ſhall be ſure to
have his part in it at that time: ſo ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Bleſſed is that ſervant,
who when his Maſter ſhall come,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Calvin.</hi> Dominus cum venit, inveniet melbar antem.</note> 
                  <hi>ſhall be found well doing;</hi> and it was a good
ſaying that a learned man had, when his friends told him, hee ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
too much, ſaith hee; <hi>What would yee have the Lord come and finde mee
Idle?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Thirdly, by whom Chriſts Birth was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted.</note> 
                  <hi>by whom the birth of Chriſt, was made manifeſt: by the Angels;</hi>
when the Prieſts were ſilent in the Temple, the Angels were not, they
could not keepe it: here we may ſee, how ready the Angels are, to doe
any ſervice to Chriſt, there is not an Angell nor an Archangell, but is
ready to doe ſervice to him; therefore much more ſhould men be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to ſerve and obey Him. But it is otherwiſe with us; for we be ready
to doe ſervice to ſinne, and to our luſts, rather than unto Chriſt. <hi>Matth.</hi>
21. when <hi>Ieſus rode to Ieruſalem upon an Aſſe; ſome ſtrowed garments in the
way, ſome did cut downe boughs, and branches, crying Hoſanna;</hi> there was not
a childe, playing in the ſtreets, but was ready to doe ſervice unto Chriſt:
in like manner let us ſtirre up and quicken our ſelves to doe in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of Chriſt, and not, as we were wont, give our ſelves wholly to ſin,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:17958:67"/>
to the deceitfull luſts and vaine pleaſures of this world.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Fourthly, the time of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation.</note> 
                  <hi>the time when Chriſts birth was made manifeſt: the ſame night;</hi>
an Angel came poſt from heaven, to make it knowne: it was the love of
God, that he would not hold it till day, any long time, but preſently he
makes it knowne. We read <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. of Gods love to his ſervants, ſaith
the Lord, <hi>Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I doe, &amp;c? For I
know him that he will command his children and his houſhold after Him, and
they ſhall keepe the way of the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> God would not conceale any thing
from his ſervant <hi>Abraham;</hi> ſo it was his love, that he would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale
the birth of Chriſt, but make it knowne, <hi>the ſame night.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſeeing God made haſt to ſend this meſſage, we ſhould make haſt to
receive it, as ſoone as may bee: ſeeke him, and not reſt, till wee have
found him; and as the Shepheards went out to <hi>Bethlem,</hi> to ſee Chriſt; ſo
let us go forth to ſee him, although he be not at <hi>Bethlem,</hi> yet in his word,
there we may ſee Chriſt, borne in a ſtable, laid in a cratch, praying in the
mount, ſweating in the garden, crowned with a crowne of thornes,
bleeding on the croſſe, hanging in paines and torments, and gloriouſly
ſitting on his throne, and as old <hi>Simeon tooke Chriſt in his armes and imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
him,</hi> ſo let us take him, and lay hold on him, by the hand of Faith;
and bring him into our hearts, ſo as we may ſay with <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 20. 2. <hi>The
life which I now liue in the fleſh I live by the faith of the Sonne of God, &amp;c.</hi> ſo
never part with Chriſt, till the day of death; for no man can have
comfort although hee ſhould ſee Chriſt borne in the ſtable, laid in the
cratch, ſitting in the lap of his mother, praying in the mount, bleeding
on the croſſe, ſitting gloriouſly on his throne, unleſſe hee can apply
Chriſt, and make him his owne by faith.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>the manner of the manifeſtation of his birth,</hi> by a ſpeciall meſſage;
where two things are to be conſidered:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That the Angell moveth attention.</item>
                  <item>2. The meſſage it ſelfe.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Now the Angell moveth attention two wayes:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. By remooving that which ſhould hinder attention.</item>
                  <item>2. By quickning up the affections, <hi>in this word;</hi> Behold.</item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> of the meſſage it ſelfe; <hi>which was,</hi> that the Angels did bring them ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
of great Ioy.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. It was tidings of joy.</item>
                  <item>2. Of great joy.</item>
                  <item>3. Not to one people, nor to one nation, but to all people.</item>
               </list>
               <p>And therefore ſeeing there is ſuch an excellent meſſage come, wee
ſhould attend it. Heere wee may obſerve, what is the greateſt joy that
is, that Chriſt is borne into the world; this is the joy of us Chriſtians,
to know that Chriſt is come into the world to ſave penitent and poore
ſinners, he will heare us in our troubles, releeve us when we bee poore,
give us health when we be ſicke; will be all in all unto us: O let us then
labour to joy in Chriſt, for there is no true joy but in him; therefore
howſoever the covetous mans joy is in his goods, the fleſhly mans in his
pleaſures, the uſurers in his mony; yet let the Chriſtian more joy in
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:17958:68"/>
Chriſt, than in any thing: and let every man labour to get him, make
him ſure, and then he ſhall joy in life, in death, in ſickneſſe, health, plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and adverſity.</p>

they doe not onely ſay, that <hi>Chriſt is borne,</hi> but by
way of appropriation, that <hi>Chriſt is borne to you;</hi>
you bee the men, the parties that Chriſt was
borne for. A man ſhall never have any true com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,

His death, life, paines and paſſions to us; then wee may have

but as ſoone as wee underſtand them, wee muſt bee ready to ſet them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke.
Of which there be two reaſons:</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Reaſon 1.</note> becauſe in time the devill will bee very laborious to quench
them; as <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. <hi>when the good man had ſowen good ſeede in his field, the
envious man did ſow tares;</hi> ſo when there is any good motions in us, the
devill will labour to hinder them: therefore as ſoone as may bee wee
ſhould labour to ſet them aworke.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Reaſon 2.</note> becauſe the firſt motions are the ſwifteſt and the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest;
as the Apoſtle ſaith to the <hi>Galatians, yee did runne well, what did let
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:17958:69"/>
you,</hi> at the firſt? ſo thou did'ſt runne well, the firſt motions were ſwifteſt;
therefore ſeeing they are ſwifteſt and ſtrongeſt, we muſt not let them
die, but labour to ſet them a worke.</p>
               <p>But what did they exhort one another unto? to goe to <hi>Bethlem:</hi>
and why to <hi>Bethlem?</hi> becauſe Chriſt was borne there. <hi>Bethlem</hi> was one of
the ſmalleſt townes, yet becauſe he was borne there, thither they went.
We have out <hi>Bethlem</hi> as well as they, the place of preaching, of prayer,
and the place where the Sacraments are adminiſtred, this is <hi>Bethlem,</hi>
this is the place where Chriſt was borne: therefore howſoever the
place is meane, whither we may goe, yet thither muſt we goe, howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
others goe to other cities and great places yet wee muſt goe to
<hi>Bethlem. Mark.</hi> 1. 33. <hi>All the city was gathered together at the doore of Peters
mothers houſe,</hi> and yet it was but a meane place, onely a fiſhermans cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage;
nevertheleſſe becauſe there was a healing power of Chriſt, thither
they went and reſorted: therefore howſoever the place be meane, if
Chriſt may be found there, thither let us goe; when others goe to pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of diſorder, of pleaſure, of gaming, to places of drinking and ſwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
let us goe to <hi>Bethlem,</hi> to places of preaching, prayer, where we ſhall
not onely ſee Chriſt, lying in the cratch, as the ſhepheards did, but even
in heaven gloriouſly ſitting on his throne as bleſſed <hi>Stephen</hi> ſaw him.
But why did they goe to <hi>Bethlem?</hi> the text ſaith, <hi>to ſee the things that the
Lord would ſhew them:</hi> this may teach us, when we have knowledge, to
make uſe of it, to the bettering of us in our life and converſation; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
have knowledge, but they be not bettered by it, whereof the Lord
complaineth <hi>Eſai.</hi> 42. 20. <hi>Seeing many things, but keepeſt them not:</hi> and
therefore when God doth give a man knowledge, and he be not bette<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by it, and in his life made more carefull to pleaſe God, how juſtly
may this lye upon a mans conſcience at the day of death?</p>
               <p>The <hi>ſecond effect was,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The ſecond ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect made haſt.</note> 
                  <hi>They come in haſt.</hi> for all this do you conſider how
many lets they had to hinder them: <hi>firſt,</hi> the darke night might have
hindered them: <hi>ſecondly,</hi> their flockes were in danger, ſubject to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
of wilde beaſts, there being no body to looke to them: <hi>thirdly,</hi>
there was no body that knew of it but they: <hi>fourthly,</hi> when they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into the city there was no body could tell them of Chriſt; and yet
their faith made them breake through all theſe lets. Which may
teach us, <hi>that true faith will breake through all lets;</hi> there is never a man that
heares me this day, but hee ſhall meete with lets, yet wee muſt not bee
diſhartned but ſtrive to breake through all; as <hi>Mark.</hi> 2. 4. when <hi>they
brought the man that was ſicke of the palſie, they brake through the rooffe, and
let him downe to Chriſt;</hi> ſo true faith will breake through a thouſand lets:
we ſee in nature,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> that a ſpring will breake through an heape of ſtones, or
a rocke; ſo if there be a ſpring of grace in us, we ſhall breake through all
lets unto Chriſt: therefore it muſt be our wiſedome to breake through
profits and pleaſures, and whatſoever is deare unto us, to come to
Chriſt. But <hi>why did they come in haſt?</hi> to teach us that men can never
make too much haſt to come to Chriſt. It is a great error in the world,
that men may make too much haſt to repent, to beleeve, &amp;c, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 11. 29.
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:17958:69"/>
when <hi>Lazarus</hi> was dead and Chriſt was come to the grave, <hi>as ſoone as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
heard that, ſhe aroſe in haſt, and came unto Him:</hi> ſo <hi>Ioh.</hi> 21. the Diſciples be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a fiſhing, when <hi>Peter</hi> heard it was the Lord, he leaped over the Boate
to come to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The <hi>third effect was,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The third ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, they pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed all.</note> that, <hi>They publiſhed all things abroad that they had ſeen
and heard of Chriſt;</hi> they did not keepe it, but they did make Chriſt
knowne to the world. Which may teach us when wee know any good
thing, that wee ſhould labour to make it knowne to others that they
might ſee Ieſus, and he bleſſed by him: as <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 41. ſaith <hi>Andrew, we
have found the Meſſiah, which is by Interpretation, the Chriſt;</hi> ſo <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. when
the woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> had talked with Chriſt, ſhe went into the city
and told all thoſe things ſhe had heard and ſeene; ſo <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. when
the Angels had ſhewed <hi>Mary</hi> that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was riſen, ſhee told the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples:
in like manner when wee know any thing, wee ſhould tell it to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to draw them to Chriſt.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> As in a ſhipwrack when ſome bee got to
the ſhore, or to the haven, they get into the toppes of trees, to hang
out lights, that ſo others might be directed into the haven or harbour;
ſo wee ſhould doe, when it pleaſeth God to draw any of us home to
Chriſt, wee ſhould by all meanes labour to draw others, and to bring
them home to the haven or harbour, to bring them home to Chriſt.
And what did this worke? why did the common ſort wonder and
marvell at it, yet let all goe? becauſe they were not inlightned; but of
good <hi>Mary</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>ſhe did ponder all thoſe things in her heart:</hi> when men
heare of the great and glorious things in the Goſpell they wonder and
marvell at them, as the people did <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 6. <hi>Now when this was noiſed
abroad the multitude came together, and were aſtonied, becauſe every man did
heare them ſpeake in his owne language: and they were all amazed, and marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
ſaying one to another, Behold, are not all theſe which ſpeake Galileans?</hi> and
ſo let the matter dye. But good <hi>Mary,</hi> with the people of God, ponder
theſe things in their hearts: therefore howſoever others doe wonder
and are moved for a time only, yet we ſhould gather them home to our
hearts, and ponder them in our ſoules, that ſo we may have comfort by
them in life and death.</p>
               <p>The <hi>fourth effect was,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The fourth effect, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to their callings.</note> that <hi>they did returne againe to their callings, and to
their flocks:</hi> they did not give over their callings when they had ſeene
Chriſt, but they did returne againe. But with what caution did they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
againe? the text ſaith, <hi>prayſing and lauding God, for all that they had
ſeene and heard.</hi> This muſt teach us, that when we go to the place of Gods
worſhip and ſee Ieſus, we muſt returne againe to our callings, but with
this caution, praiſing &amp; lauding God, that he hath made his birth known
unto us, his life, his death, his paines and his paſſions; and wee have
our parts in them, when yet he hath paſſed by many kings and queenes,
and great gentlemen of this world; and hath looked upon us, that bee
but poore huſbandmen, and tradeſmen, therefore let us praiſe God for
it: and although we go againe to our labours, yet let us never forget this
little Ieſus; the light that ſhone about them did vaniſh and they ſaw it
no more, but the inward joy, that tarried within in their inner houſes,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:17958:70"/>
their hearts, and was a comfort to them in ſickneſſe, and troubles, and at
their deaths: ſo wee cannot heare theſe glorious things: nor have Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
every day, yet let us get Chriſt home to our houſes, and into
our hearts, then wee ſhall have comfort in all our troubles, and at the
time of death: then whenſoever thou ſhalt ſhut up thine eyes in this
world, thou ſhalt open them in Gods kingdome. And therefore I pray
God wee may ſo ſhut our eyes up in this world, that ſo wee may open
them in the light of his bleſſed kingdome.</p>
               <p>One would wonder ſeeing Chriſt was ſo obſcurely borne, how his
Birth ſhould breake out into the world, and be knowne? There were
three waies of it:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>By the Angels to the Shepheards;</hi> of this ſpoken already.</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>By a ſtarre to the Wiſemen.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. <hi>By a ſecret motion of the Spirit to</hi> Simeon <hi>and</hi> Anna.</item>
               </list>
               <p>In the manifeſtation of Chriſt to the Wiſemen, wee obſerve two
things:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>The inquiry they made for Chriſt.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>The effects of their inquiry.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the inquiry for Chriſt obſerve:</hi>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The perſons that made inquiry: <hi>The</hi> Wisemen.</item>
                  <item>2. The place from whence they came: <hi>Out of the</hi> Eaſt.</item>
                  <item>3. The place whither they went: <hi>To</hi> Ieruſalem.</item>
                  <item>4. The end: <hi>To ſeeke</hi> Chriſt.</item>
                  <item>5. The cauſe that mooved them: <hi>It was a</hi> Starre.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>the perſons that made inquiry; the Wiſemen,</hi> or (as the Originall
hath it) the <hi>Magi,</hi> that is, learned wiſemen, men of great learning and
knowledge, the ſhepheards were poore and ſimple men, and the <hi>Magi</hi>
great learned rich men, as it may appeare by their gifts they offered to
Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Of which there are two reaſons why Chriſt appeared to the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards,<note place="margin">Two Reaſons of Chriſts mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation.</note>
and the to Wiſemen; firſt, to ſhew that the grace of the Goſpell
appertaineth equally to poore men, as well as rich, it draweth all ſorts
of men to it:<note place="margin">Reaſon 1.</note> even as the Vine that beginneth low at the bottome of the
tree,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> but at laſt doth creepe up upon the tree, till it doth winde and twiſt
it ſelfe up to the top of it; ſo the Goſpell began at poore fiſhermen,
below, but it did creepe up by little and little till it did winde it ſelfe
within the Scepters and crownes of Kings, which is the higheſt ſtep it
can come unto in this world; it did draw the poore ſhepheards out of the
field, and the Wiſemen out of the Eaſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Reaſon 2.</note> to ſhew that the great learned, and rich men of the world
have as much neede of Chriſt, as the poore; for there is not one way for
the ſaving of the poore, and another for the rich, one of ſaving the
high, and another the low, one way to ſave Princes and another ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;
but they be all ſaved one way, by Chriſt; and therfore as well the
poore <hi>Shepheards</hi> came out of the <hi>fields</hi> to ſeeke Chriſt; as the <hi>Wiſemen</hi>
out of the <hi>Eaſt:</hi> and for that end to ſuch <hi>David</hi> addreſſeth his ſpeech,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. <hi>Be wiſe now, O ye kings, and be learned, yee judges of the Earth;</hi> labour
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:17958:70"/>
to lay hold on Chriſt, and to embrace him in the armes of faith: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
whatſoever thy eſtate be, poore or rich, ſeeke after Chriſt; labour
to lay hold on him, or elſe thou art like to periſh, there is but one way
to ſave thee, whatſoever thou bee. In <hi>Leviticus,</hi> we read that in caſe of
redemption, the rich ſhould not adde any thing, nor the poore take
away, but there ſhould be all one price for rich and poore; ſo it is in the
caſe of ſpirituall Redemption, there is not a higher price for the rich,
and a lower for the poore, but onely one price for all: Chriſt is the
price of our redemption; therefore every man muſt lay hold on him
for ſalvation. <hi>Iudg.</hi> 10. 4. when the people were in diſtreſſe, and cried un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Lord, this anſwere was made them, <hi>Goe and cry unto your gods
whom ye have ſerved, &amp;c.</hi> ſo the Lord may ſay to us, in the time of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
at the day of our death, or at the day of judgement, Go and cry unto
your gods whom yee have ſerved, ſee if they can helpe you, your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
and your profits, your wealth and your luſts, whom ye have ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:
therefore whatſoever our eſtates be let us labour to lay hold on
Chriſt, and looke to be ſaved by none but by him.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Secondly, the place whence they came.</note> 
                  <hi>The place from whence they came,</hi> it is ſaid from the <hi>Eaſt;</hi>
they tooke many a weary ſteppe to ſee Chriſt: they came out of a farre
country; the ſhepheards out of the field: Of which there bee two rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
why they came ſo farre to ſee Chriſt:</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Two reaſons why the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men came ſo farre to Chriſt.</note> to ſhew that the people afarre off ſhould bee gathered to
Chriſt, as <hi>Eſai.</hi> 60. 34. this was foretold; <hi>And the Gentiles ſhall come to thy
light, and kings at the brightneſſe of thy riſing. Lift up thine eyes round about,
and ſee,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>all they gather themſelves together, they come to thee: thy ſonnes ſhall
come from farre, and thy daughters ſhall be nurſed at thy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ide.</hi> So <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. 11.
<hi>And I ſay unto you, that many ſhall come from the eaſt and from the weſt, and
ſhall ſit downe with Abraham, Iſaac, and Iaakob, in the kingdome of Heaven:
Ephes.</hi> 2. 17. It is ſaid, <hi>and came and preached peace unto you, which were afarre
off, and to them that were neere.</hi> So the <hi>Iewes</hi> were not only gathered by the
grace of the Goſpell, bur the <hi>Gentiles</hi> alſo, ſuch as were afarre off: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we are to be thankefull to God for this, for there was a time when
there was a <hi>partition wall</hi> betweene the <hi>Iewes</hi> and the <hi>Gentiles:</hi> but now
by the blood of Chriſt, the partition wall is broken downe.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> to teach us, that no labour is too much, or paines too
great, to come by Chriſt; though it coſt us many a weary journey, and
many a weary ſteppe, if we can attaine Chriſt, let us not thinke much of
it: Wee ſee the Wiſemen came many a weary ſtep from a farre coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
to ſee Chriſt; they thought no paines too great, no labour too much.
To this purpoſe our Saviour ſaith,<note place="margin">Luk. 11. 31.</note> 
                  <hi>The Queene of the South ſhall riſe up in
judgement with his generation and ſhall condemne it; For ſhee came from the
uttermoſt parts of the earth, to heare the wiſedome of Solomon; and behold,
a greater than Solomon is heere;</hi> therefore wee muſt not thinke it much to
come out of our houſes to ſee Chriſt: though the market bee a good
way off,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> yet wee goe thither to make proviſion for the body, much
more ſhould wee bee contented to come out of our houſes; to goe to
the places of Gods worſhip and ſervice, to make proviſion for our
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:17958:71"/>
ſoules: The Wiſemen came out of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> to ſee Chriſt, much more
should we come out of our houſes.<note place="margin">Object. ſol.</note> 
                  <hi>If you could ſhew us Chriſt, we ſhould bee
willing to come.</hi> Yes, that I can, and more gloriouſly than ever the Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
beheld him; and though not with the bodily eye, yet we ſhew you
Chriſt in the face of the Goſpell, to the eyes of your ſoule, not onely
lying in the cradle, praying on the mount, bleeding in the garden, dying
on the croſſe, but now gloriouſly ſitting in Heaven on his throne. If one
come into a roome where there be goodly pictures,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> if there be curtaines
drawne over them, ye cannot ſee them; but let one come and pull aſide
the curtaine, then yee may ſee the rich pictures; ſo there bee goodly
pictures and repreſentations of Chriſt in the face of the Goſpell, but
there is a veile or curtaine, that hangs before them; remoove the veile,
let the curtaine bee plucked away, and then ye ſhall ſee theſe excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of Chriſt: and if the Wiſemen came to <hi>Bethlem</hi> from a farre coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
to ſee Chriſt, much more ſhould we come out of our houſes to ſee
Him in the face of the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Thirdly, the place whither they went.</note> 
                  <hi>the place whither they went: They came to Ierſualem;</hi> not gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by a ſtarre, but led by their owne reaſon, for they thought, that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Ieruſalem</hi> was the royall city of the kingdome, and the ſeate of
kings, there they ſhould be ſure to heare of Chriſts birth. They follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
humane reaſon, and not the <hi>ſtarre,</hi> therefore they did not finde him
at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> untill they came to <hi>Bethlem;</hi> ſo long as they followed the
ſtarre, ſo long they did well, but when they left the direction of it,
and followed their own reaſon, they did amiſſe: ſo looke how long we
follow the directions of the Word, ſo long wee doe well, but if once
we leave that, to follow our owne carnall reaſon, then we doe amiſſe,
for we cannot finde Chriſt by following that: therefore as the blinde
man followes his guide through brambles and bryers,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> over hils and
dales, becauſe his owne eyes being ſhut up, hee truſted to the eyes of
his guide; ſo we muſt follow Gods directions, and then wee ſhall finde
Chriſt, but if we follow our owne reaſon, we ſhall never finde him.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Fourthly, the end of their iourney.</note> 
                  <hi>the end why they came out of their owne country; to ſeeke Chriſt:</hi> as
it was the providence of God to ſtir up theſe Wiſemen that ſo the <hi>Iewes</hi>
might alſo bee provoked to ſeeke for him; for when they did ſee theſe
Wiſemen came ſo farre, and take ſuch paines to ſeeke Chriſt, it might
much more have provoked them to ſeeke Him, ſeeing hee was amongſt
them: ſo it is now the providence of God, to ſtirre up ſuch ſtrangers
to ſeeke to this place where the Goſpell is preached, that ſo we may bee
the more provoked to ſeeke Chriſt; for if ſtrangers take ſuch paines to
come to heare, much more ſhould we; eſpecially now, when it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
us, becauſe wee have not onely a little inkling of Chriſts birth,
but we know the time of it, and wee can talke of it; therefore let us la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to ſeeke Chriſt, let the worldly man ſeeke after his profits, the
covetous after his goods, the fleſhly man after his pleaſures, the uſurer
after his mony yet let us ſeeke after Chriſt. <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 5. ſaith the
Angell to the Women, <hi>I know that yee ſeeke Ieſus which was crucified;</hi> ſo
it is a good thing, when the very lookes and behaviour of men doe
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:17958:71"/>
teſtifie that they looke and ſeeke for Chriſt; not for any worldly matter
but for Him onely.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now there be three reaſons that ſhould move us to ſeeke for Chriſt.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Three motione or reaſons to ſeeke Chriſt.</note> Firſt, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
Chriſt ſeeketh us, Luk.</hi> 19. 10. <hi>The Sonne of man is come</hi> (ſaith hee)
<hi>to ſeeke,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>and to ſave that which is loſt.</hi> Is the Lord come to ſave us? Then we
againe muſt labour to ſeeke him: we ſee if a ſheepe bee loſt, the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard
doth not onely ſeeke it,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> but it in ſome meaſure doth againe ſeeke
the ſhepheard, for it doth bleate, and is not at reſt, till it be in the fold
againe: ſo ſeeing we be like loſt ſheepe, we muſt ſeeke Chriſt and never
be at reſt, till we be in his fold; <hi>David, Pſalm.</hi> 119. <hi>ult.</hi> ſaith, <hi>I have gone
aſtray like a loſt ſheepe, ſeeke thy ſervant; for I doe not forget thy commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>becauſe of the precious and rich graces, that be in Chriſt:</hi> as <hi>Col.</hi>
1. 19. ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>For it pleaſeth the Father, that in him ſhould all
fulneſſe dwell:</hi> ſo that there is not any grace wee neede but it is to bee
found in him; he is the common treaſury of the Church, as <hi>Cantic.</hi> 6. 1.
when the Church had commended Chriſt, and had ſhewed foorth his
excellency, ſtraightway the daughters of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> demand, <hi>Whither
is thy welbeloved gone? O thou fayreſt among Women, whither is thy welbelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
turned aſide? that we may ſeeke him with thee:</hi> ſo when we heare of
the excellency that is in Chriſt, the rich graces that bee in him, this
ſhould make us inquire and ſeeke after him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>becauſe he giveth us ſalvation,</hi> therefore there is great reaſon
why we ſhould ſeeke to him, that we may enjoy eternall life, and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by him. If a man have a hundred acres of land given him, the firſt
inquiry that he makes, is, where it lyeth, which when he knoweth, then
he labours to come to ſee it;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſo muſt wee doe, God hath given us ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
when we know where it lyeth, (and it lyeth in <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi>) then we
muſt ſeeke for Him, and ſo make Him ſure to our ſelves.</p>
               <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">Fifthly, what mooved the Wiſemen to ſeeke Chriſt.</note> 
                  <hi>What moved the Wiſemen to ſeeke to Chriſt;</hi> it was but the ſight
of the ſtarre; wee would thinke that it was ſome great matter, ſhould
have mooved them to come out of their country, and take ſuch a great
journey upon them: The <hi>ſhepheards</hi> were mooved by the Angell, <hi>Sime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
and <hi>Anna</hi> by a viſion in the Temple,<note place="margin">4</note> but there was no Angell to
moove the Wiſemen, no viſion, no light ſhining, but the apparition of a
ſtarre. Which ſhould teach us, to take hold on every little meanes
which may bring us to Chriſt;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> it is the nature of the Vine, to catch
hold on every little ſticke, twig and poſt, to advance it ſelfe by; ſo
muſt we, like the Vine, catch hold on every little meanes, to bring us to
Chriſt: the <hi>Wiſemen</hi> had but one ſtarre, and we have a number of bright
ones, ſhining about us; the <hi>Bible</hi> is a ſtarre, and <hi>every faithfull Paſtor</hi> is a
ſtarre, and yet theſe cannot bring us to Chriſt. The <hi>Wiſemen</hi> ſaw Chriſt
in the cradle, wee ſee him working of miracles, changing water into
wine, rayſing of the dead cleanſing of the lepers, giving ſight to the
blinde, reſtoring of the lame, giving health to the ſicke. <hi>We have ſeene
his ſtarre in the eaſt,</hi> ſay the <hi>Wiſemen;</hi> thus they ſought Chriſt, when the
ſtarre vaniſhed away; they ſought him, not onely when they had a
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:17958:72"/>
ſtarre to direct them, but when the ſtarre was gone, and out of ſight:
which may teach us a further point of conſideration, not onely hold on
in the profeſſion of the Goſpell, and to ſeeke Chriſt, as long as all things
goe well with us, having our guides, but alſo when we have loſt them.
There is a corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the world, that as long as men have ſtars to guide
them they can keepe within compaſſe; but if they have loſt their ſtarre,
then they give over, they will ſeeke no further; as wee read in <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 24.
31. <hi>Iſrael ſerved the Lord, all the dayes of Ioſhua, and all the dayes of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
&amp;c.</hi> But when <hi>Ioſhua</hi> was gone, then they fell to their ſinnes.
Hence we may learne,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> not onely to ſeeke Chriſt, and be religious, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt
our good paſtors are amongſt us, but when they be gone and taken
from us. Now, <hi>the effect of their inquiry</hi> is twofold:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. In Herod, and the Iewes.</item>
                  <item>2. In the Wiſemen.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>In Herod and the Iewes;</hi> this was a ſtrange thing, that any man
ſhould bee troubled at the birth of Chriſt,<note place="margin">1</note> which ſhould bee the joy of
the whole world: the <hi>Angels ſung praiſes to God</hi> for it, the <hi>Shepheards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced,</hi>
and the <hi>Wiſemen ſought Chriſt; Abraham deſired to ſee his day and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced;</hi>
and yet <hi>Herod was troubled</hi> at his birth: even ſo it is ſtill, with wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
and vile men, with the <hi>Herods</hi> of this world, they be grieved to ſee
religion floriſh, the Goſpell to take rooting amongſt us: to whom is this
a trouble? to <hi>Herod,</hi> to drunkards, to covetous perſons, to vile livers;
but good people be glad to ſee the Goſpell promoted, religion to thrive
amongſt them: and therefore conſider with thy ſelfe, O man, art thou
troubled, at the ſight of Chriſt? canſt thou not away to have religion
to floriſh? then haſt thou a naughty heart, <hi>Herods</hi> heart, and <hi>Herods</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</p>
               <p>But why was <hi>Herod</hi> thus troubled?<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> there is no man the worſe for
Chriſt, but a great many the better for him, why then ſhould <hi>Herod</hi> be
troubled?<note place="margin">ſol.</note> I anſwere, he was an Vſurper, and an intruder into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
hee had a bad conſcience, this was that that troubled him; ſo, if
we come by things fraudulently, and badly, Chriſt comming will be a
trouble to us, when he ſhall come with joy to others it will be to us ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible:
We ſee in <hi>Matthew</hi> the devils inquire of Chriſt, <hi>Art thou come to
torment us, before our time?</hi> the preſence of Chriſt was a torment to the
devils; ſo if thou haſt a bad conſcience, his comming and preſence will
be a trouble to thee, when others ſhall receive comfort by it, it will be a
terrour to thee.</p>
               <p>What was the reaſon the <hi>Iewes</hi> were troubled at the birth of Chriſt?
we ſee <hi>Herod</hi> had a bad conſcience, this troubled him; but why were
they troubled? he was their Saviour and redeemer <hi>Zech.</hi> 9. 9. it is
ſaid, <hi>Rejoyce greatly O Daughter of Sion, ſhout O Daughter of Ieruſalem: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
thy King commeth unto thee, &amp;c.</hi> I anſwere, they thought that Chriſt
would not come into his kingdome, but it would coſt much hardſhip,
there would bee much trouble about it; therefore rather than they
would loſe their worldly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>aſe, or peace, they would loſe Chriſt. This is
the ſinne of the world ſtill, that if the Goſpell hinder their worldly

eaſe,<note place="margin">SER. XII</note> or peace, they had rather loſe Chriſt, and the Goſpell, than loſe
their eaſe and peace: ſo <hi>Iohn</hi> 11. 47. the <hi>Iewes</hi> holding a councell toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
how to kill Chriſt, becauſe they were afraid they ſhould loſe their
worldly eaſe, ſay they, <hi>If we follow this man, the Romans will come, and take
away our kingdome and our nation:</hi> ſo that wee may ſee, they had rather
loſe Chriſt, than loſe their worldly eaſe and peace: Of which ſinne let
us by their example and ruine learne to ſhunne and beware of the like
practiſe, which hath juſtly brought ſo long-laſting miſerie upon them.</p>

<hi>wherein three things are to be obſerved:</hi>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The endevour of the Wiſemen.</item>

               <p>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:17958:73"/>
Firſt, <hi>the endevour of the Wiſemen;</hi> when they could not finde Chriſt
at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> they ſet themſelves upon good advice to ſeeke him elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
they departed from thence, though, there were two things
that might have hindred them:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Their bad ſucceſſe.</hi>
                  </item>

                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>The firſt thing that might have hindered them,<note place="margin">Two diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the wiſemen in ſeeking Chriſt.</note> was, <hi>the bad ſucceſſe
they had of their journey;</hi> for they thought ſurely to have heard of him at
<hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> but there was no ſpeech of him, yet for all that they departed
from thence,<note place="margin">1</note> ſet themſelves with good advice to ſeeke Chriſt: which
may teach us, howſoever we finde a bad ſucceſſe on our holy labours, at
the firſt,<note place="margin">Obſerve.</note> yet to goe on, although we cannot finde mortification for our
ſinnes, and ſuch a bleſſing upon our holy labours, as we deſire, yet let us
goe on, and ſet our ſelves upon good courſes, ſtill to waite on God, till
he give us good ſucceſſe: ſo we ſee the Church doth <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 123. 2. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
as the eyes of ſervants looke unto the hand of their maſters, and as the eyes of
a maiden unto the hand of her miſtreſſe, ſo our eyes waite upon the Lord our God,
untill he have mercy on us:</hi> Shee reſolves, although thou doſt not this day,
nor the next, nor the next, yet wee will waite on thee, till thou ſhew
mercy: in like manner we are exhorted, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 9. <hi>Let us not be weary of
well doing, for in due time we ſhall reape, if we faint not.</hi> Therefore the bad
ſucceſſe wee may have, muſt not hinder us, for <hi>Cantic.</hi> 3. 1. when the
Church had loſt Chriſt, <hi>Shee ſought him in her bed by night,</hi> where when
She could not finde him, ſhe gets her out, into the lanes and ſtreets, ſhee
inquires of the watchmen; and although Shee meetes with many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements,
yet Shee never gives over untill She finde Chriſt, and
make him ſure to her ſelfe: ſo muſt we doe, if wee doe not finde good
ſucceſſe on our holy labours, nor finde Chriſt at firſt, let us never give
over, till we have found him, and ſo make him ſure. It is the impatience
of the world, that if they cannot finde a bleſſing upon them at firſt, they
will ſeeke no farther; and it was the fault of the <hi>Iewes, Hag.</hi> 1. when they
went to build the Temple and were hindred, having no good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
in their labours, they gave over; but it was their ſinne, they were
reprooved for it: ſo <hi>David</hi> in the 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 13. when hee would have
brought the <hi>Arke</hi> of God, to his citie, the Lord was angry with <hi>Vz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zah,</hi>
and killed him: therefore <hi>David</hi> was afraide to bring the <hi>Arke</hi> of
God, to his owne city; but it was his fault, and a great weakeneſſe:
therefore it muſt bee our care, although God doe not anſwere us accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as wee deſire, yet to goe on ſtill and never give over, untill wee
have found his bleſſing upon us; <hi>Gen.</hi> 26. 19. It is ſaid that <hi>Iſaaks ſervants
digged in the vale, and found a fountaine of living water;</hi> it may be they dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
a fadome and found none, it may bee two fadome, it may bee
three, it may bee ſix, and yet found no water, but they digged ſtill; at
the laſt they found a fountaine of living water: ſo wee may ſeeke com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
and it may be we ſhall not finde it, this day, nor the next day, yet
let us not give over, but goe on ſtill for at laſt we ſhall finde a fountaine
of comfort.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:17958:73"/>
Secondly, that which might have hindered them; was, <hi>the bad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
they ſaw:</hi> for the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> were learned men, ſkilfull in
the Law of God; and yet not one of them turned a foote to ſeeke
Chriſt, nor were mooved; and yet for all this theſe Wiſemen departed
away to ſeeke Chriſt: which may teach us, not to reſt on the bad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of any man, let him be what he will, for though they ſeeke not
Chriſt, nor ſtirre one foote to finde him: yet let us goe on to finde
Chriſt. Wee read <hi>Mark.</hi> 5. 18. the man out of whom the devill was
caſt, when others deſired him to depart the country, he deſired to tarry
with him ſtill; hee would not bee mooved with the bad example of
others: ſo, if thou be one out of whom Chriſt hath caſt out a devill,
caſt out thy ſinnes, thou wilt not bee moved with the bad example of
others; it was <hi>Ioſhuas</hi> reſolution, howſoever others did, <hi>yet hee and his
houſhold would ſerve the Lord;</hi> ſo <hi>Mich.</hi> 4. 5. it is ſaid, <hi>For all people will
walke, every one in the name of his god, and wee will walke in the Name of the
Lord our God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> 
                  <hi>for ever and for ever.</hi> I have ſhewed you heretofore, when a
floud commeth, it will carry away ſtraw and light ſtuffe, looſe timber,
moveable things; but if they bee rooted, then they ſtand; ſo, bad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
is like to a ſtreame, it carrieth away all looſe and moveable
things before it, but if men bee rooted in grace, then they ſhall ſtand,
when others are floating in the ſtreame of evill company; therefore if
men will periſh let them periſh, labour thou to be rooted in Grace, and
then thou ſhalt ſtand when others are carried away.</p>
               <p>Now from whence did the <hi>Wiſemen</hi> depart; from <hi>Ieruſalem:</hi> which
<hi>Ieruſalem</hi> was a great royall city of the kingdome, the glory of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
yet they departed from thence, becauſe Chriſt was not there, which
muſt teach us that let the place bee what it will, if Chriſt bee not there,
it is no place for us to reſt in. I have ſhewed you what was <hi>Iſaacks</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint,
<hi>Father,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſaith he, <hi>heere is fire, and woode, but where is the Lambe?</hi>
ſo when men remoove from one towne to another and finde there are
good grounds, ſweet waters, and other good commodities, yet let
them aſke where is the Lambe? where is the preaching of the Word?
ſo when a ſervant commeth to a houſe, he may ſay here is a good ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
and a good miſtreſſe, and good meate; but where is the Lambe?
where is prayer, religion, reading of the Scriptures, and ſuch like?
therefore as the <hi>Wiſemen</hi> from <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> (when they found not Chriſt)
departed; ſo wee ſhould depart from ſuch places, where wee cannot
finde Him, or religious dueties performed.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing was, <hi>the bleſſing of God upon their endeavours:</hi> they
ſaw the ſtarre and it was before them, and directed them to the houſe
where the Childe was:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>They ſaw the Starre.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>It was that which they ſaw in the Eaſt.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. <hi>It went before them.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>4. <hi>It went before them till it came to the very houſe, where the
Childe was.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>As ſoone as they were departed, and had put themſelves upon good
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:17958:74"/>
meanes when there was not a man to tell them, nor one that ſtirred out
to ſeeke Chriſt, God ſent the ſtarre to direct them, to the place where
Hee was: which may teach us, that if we endevour, and ſet our ſelves
upon good courſes, wee ſhall finde Gods bleſſing upon us: we ſee <hi>Exod.</hi>
13. when the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> put themſelves upon their journey,
<hi>the Lord ſent them a cloud by day, and a pillar of fire by night,</hi> to conduct and
guide them to the land of <hi>Canaan:</hi> ſo <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 28, 29. <hi>The Eunuch was
reading the Scriptures,</hi> when <hi>Philip</hi> was ſent to expound the meaning of
it to him; he put himſelfe upon a good courſe, and the Lord did bleſſe
him in it: the Scripture is plentifull for this, <hi>Mark.</hi> 16. women were
deſirous to ſee what was become of Chriſt; they ſet themſelves on a
good courſe, but they tooke care and were troubled about this, who
ſhould roule away the ſtone, and behold, an Angell came and was ſent
to roule it away: thus wee ſee, how ready the Lord is to bleſſe our
good intentions, and therefore let us ſet our ſelves upon good endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
and God will ſend a pillar or a ſtarre to direct us.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>with what affection they received it:</hi> they rejoyced exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
and that for two cauſes:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>For the appearing of the Starre.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2 <hi>For the ſtanding of the Starre.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>for the appearing of the Starre;</hi> that there was a meanes to guide
and direct them to Chriſt, whereas otherwiſe they might have wande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
up and downe, and not have found him; for they might have gone
to <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and when they were there, it may be not have found him;
therefore they rejoyced, for the appearing of the Starre, and were
glad, that there was a meanes to direct them. Which ſhould teach us
that we ſhould rejoyce and bee glad when we ſee any ſtarre to direct us
to Chriſt: now the Scripture is a ſtarre, and the faithfull Miniſters bee
Starres, therefore when wee ſee the Bible and good Preachers, wee
ſhould bee glad, and rejoyce, and bleſſe God, that he hath ſent theſe
Starres, to direct us to Chriſt; And as <hi>Eſay</hi> ſaith, <hi>they ſhall bleſſe the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers
of peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>they were glad for the ſtanding of the Starre,</hi> becauſe they
knew that Chriſt was there; for though they had ſpent a great deale of
money, and many a weary ſtep in a long journey, yet they were excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
glad that they had found Chriſt, notwithſtanding al their paines
and coſt. ſo many poore ſoules are glad after a long ſearch for Chriſt,
to finde him, and feele the power of his grace in their hearts; having a
long time ſought him in prayer, being truely humbled for their ſinnes,
if once they feele the power of his grace in their hearts, it makes them
rejoyce exceedingly, they thinke all their labour well beſtowed this
way: as <hi>Iohn</hi> 20. wee ſee how <hi>Mary</hi> ſtood by the ſepulcher, weeping
when ſhe had loſt Chriſt, but when he came to her, and ſhe had found
Him, ſhe rejoyced exceedingly, ſaying, <hi>Rabboni, O Maſter;</hi> as if ſhee
ſhould ſay,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> O maſter, I am glad that I have found thee. As Marriners
when they have beene at Sea toſſed up and downe in a ſtorme, if once
they come where they ſee the ſhore, or land, it makes them leape for
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:17958:74"/>
joy: ſo it is with a Chriſtian, when he is toſſed up and downe, if once
he can but ſee the ſhore, I meane the aſſurance of his ſalvation, if hee
(can by faith) ſpy Heaven, this will make him to rejoyce exceedingly,
and lay faſt hold on him, ſo <hi>Cantic.</hi> 3. 4. when the Church had loſt
Chriſt, ſhee ſeekes and having found him, ſhe catcheth <hi>faſt hold on him,
and would not let him goe.</hi> Now for their behaviour having found Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>they did worſhip him;</hi> which muſt teach us, that we muſt not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiſe
Chriſt for his poverty, for though they found Him in a poore
eſtate, having no court nor traine to attend him, yet they did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe
his poverty, no more muſt wee, for his poverty is our riches,
his ſhame our glory, his abaſement our exaltation, his death our life:
and as no man is to deſpiſe Chriſt for his poverty, ſo no man ſhould bee
offended at he meaneneſſe of any Chriſtian, let their eſtate and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
be what it will, if the Spirit of Chriſt and the graces of God, bee
in them wee ought to regard and honour them.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> they did not onely worſhip Chriſt, but <hi>they did offer to him;</hi>
they did impart their wealth, offer their treaſures, <hi>Gold, Frankincenſe</hi> and
<hi>Myrrh:</hi> ſo this muſt teach us not onely to worſhip Chriſt; but we muſt
be contented to part with our wealth to give unto him: as the Woman
in the Goſpell, brought her boxe of oyntment, powred it upon Chriſt,

                  </gap> wealth to the members of Chriſt; it is a great corruption that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
a man can bee contented to worſhip Chriſt, but cannot endure to
part with any goods, wealth, or to open their treaſures to Chriſt: but
we muſt not onely worſhip him, but alſo offer to him, and be contented
to part with our wealth for his ſake.</p>
               <p>I,<note place="margin">Object. Sol.</note> but ſome man may ſay, that hee would bee contented to offer to
Chriſt, but hee hath no gold, no frankincenſe to offer. I anſwere thee,
though thou haſt no gold to offer, yet thou haſt thy ſinnes, and a ſoule
and body to offer: firſt, thou haſt thy ſinnes, kill, and crucifie them,
and thy vile luſts, offer them to God; this will be an acceptable ſacrifice
to God. The <hi>Iewes</hi> did offer their cattle for ſacrifices, but offer thou thy
ſinnes; ſlay them and it will bee pleaſing to God. Secondly, although
thou haſt no gold to offer, yet thou haſt a body and ſoule to offer to
Gods ſervice; as <hi>Roman.</hi> 12. 1. <hi>I beſeech you brethren, by the mercy of God,
that you preſent your bodies a living ſacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all our members wherewith we have ſerved ſinne wee ſhould now
turne them to the ſervice of God;<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 13.</note> ſo the Apoſtle ſaith, as you have <hi>gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
your members as weapons of unrighteouſneſſe to ſerve ſinne;</hi> ſo now <hi>give
your members as weapons of righteouſneſſe to ſerve God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>the Wiſemen were warned of God in a dreame;</hi> that when they
had ſeene Chriſt,<note place="margin">3</note> they ſhould not returne and goe backe to <hi>Herod</hi> againe:
ſo we have the ſame charge ſtill; that when we have ſeene Chriſt, wee
ſhould not returne againe to <hi>Herod,</hi> that is, to our vile luſts againe. There
is a ſtrange ceremony in the Law ſpoken of <hi>Ezech.</hi> 46. 9. that when
the people went into the Temple at one doore, they were commanded
to goe out at the other doore; if they went in at the South, they muſt
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:17958:75"/>
goe out at the North doore, and if they came in at the North, they muſt
goe out at the South doore; the meaning whereof is this, that they
muſt not goe out as they came in, but they muſt bee altered and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged;
if they came covetous perſons, they muſt goe away liberall; if
ſwearers, they muſt goe away ſober and reverent ſpeakers; if unchaſt
perſons, they muſt depart chaſt; if bad livers, they might goe away
good; and ſo they muſt be altered and changed, from their ſins, to the
contrary vertues, in like manner let us doe when wee come to the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery
of the Word: and then wee ſhall be bleſſed both in life and
death. Hitherto we have heard, how the birth of Chriſt was made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt,
ſeeing Hee was ſo obſcurely borne: and that firſt by Angels to
the Shepheards; ſecondly, to the Wiſemen by a ſtarre; adding in the
third place, how <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> was affected with the brute and fame of it.
Now when Chriſt was five weekeſ old, his parents brought him into
the temple, to doe for him according to the law, then <hi>Simeon</hi> came into
the Temple by a motion of the Spirit, and tooke him into his armes
and embraced him; and thus it was made more manifeſt, at <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi>
In this manifeſtation of the birth of Chriſt to <hi>Simeon</hi> we are to obſerve
three things:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>The ſpecification of the Perſon.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>The manner.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. <hi>The effects.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>In the <hi>ſpecification of the perſon</hi> we are to obſerve three things;</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>his Name</hi> hee was called <hi>Simeon,</hi> which was a name famous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the <hi>Iewes;</hi> and therefore ſo much the fitter was hee to make
Chriſt knowne in <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>the place he dwelt in;</hi> it was at <hi>Ieruſalem;</hi> he was not a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
but one that dwelt amongſt them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> his qualitie and vertues: <hi>and they are three:</hi>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. He was a juſt man:</item>
                  <item>2. A devout religious man.</item>
                  <item>3. That he waited for the conſolation of Iſrael.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt, for <hi>his Name,</hi> it was <hi>Simeon,</hi> famous amongſt the people of <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi>
and therefore the more fit was he for the manifeſtation of Chriſt
amongſt them in his time.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>the place where he dwelt,</hi> at <hi>Ieruſalem;</hi> he was not a ſtranger
unknowne amongſt them, but ſuch an one as dwelt amongſt them, and
was of great account with them: therefore the more fitter to make
Chriſt knowne unto them. Here we may ſee the wiſe diſpensation of
God, to appoint one ſo fit for it: for if he had appointed the <hi>Shepheards</hi>
to have done it, they might have beene deſpiſed, becauſe they were
poore men; if the <hi>Wiſemen</hi> ſhould have done it, becauſe they were
ſtrangers, they would not have beene beleeved; therefore the Lord
makes choiſe of a man amongſt them, one that was not a ſtranger but a
dweller in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> for home examples are moſt fit to moove: and
therefore the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Titus</hi> becauſe he would adde weight to his
ſpeech, ſaith, <hi>One of your owne Poets ſaith ſo.</hi> Hence wee are to conſider
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:17958:75"/>
the goodneſſe of God to us, that hath not onely ſent ſtrangers to incite
and to ſtirre us up; but home examples to moove and provoke us: as
<hi>Iohn</hi> 4. the Woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> that talked with Chriſt ſhee reported
the matter to the men of the city, <hi>and many of them beleeved, becauſe of the
Womans words,</hi> and ſo to the <hi>Romans,</hi> the Apoſtle ſhewes, that <hi>their zeale
provoked many;</hi> ſo our Saviour laieth it, as a heavy burthen on the <hi>Scribes</hi>
and <hi>Phariſes,</hi> that they were not mooved to repentance by the home ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
they daily ſaw.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> One ſaith well, that home examples are like to
little forkes, and ſtaies, that beare up the young plants, till they get ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:
<hi>Heb.</hi> 11. the whole world was condemned by <hi>Noahs</hi> example, in
that he made an <hi>Arke,</hi> for the ſaving of himſelfe and his family, and yet
they were not mooved thereby; ſo the painefulneſſe of one, ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
the idleneſſe of another; the good life of one, ſhall condemne
the ignorance or bad life of another; therefore it is good to profit by
the home examples that be amongſt us.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Firſt, Hee was man.</note> 
                  <hi>his qualities and vertues;</hi> which are three: firſt, he is ſaid be
<hi>a juſt man,</hi> not a contentious man or a bad liver, but an innocent and a
juſt man; a good dealer in the world: this is the firſt title that is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
him which ſhould teach us, that if ever we deſire to ſee Chriſt, and
depart in peace, we muſt labour to be juſt men, and good dealers in the
world. This is much commended in the Scriptures <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. <hi>Noah is ſaid
to be a juſt man in his generation;</hi> and <hi>Iob</hi> 1. God ſaith to the devill, <hi>Haſt
thou not conſidered my ſervant Iob, that there is none like him in the earth; a
perfect and an upright man, fearing God, and eſchewing evill:</hi> ſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. 37.
ſaith <hi>David, Marke the upright man, and behold the juſt, for the end of that
man is peace.</hi> In 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 3. when <hi>Samuel</hi> came to reſigne his office he
ſtandeth out to cleare himſelfe to the people, and ſaith, <hi>Whoſe Oxe have
I taken? or whoſe Aſſe have I taken? or whom have I defranded? whom have
I oppreſſed? or of whom have I received any bribe, to blind mine eyes withall?</hi>
ſo when a man can ſtand out at the day of his death, and cleere himſelfe,
as <hi>Samuel</hi> did, and ſay, O Lord, I thanke thee that I have not beene a
deceiver, or an unjuſt dealer in the world, but I have dealt juſtly and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly;
this may be a comfort to him, at the day of his death: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is a good thing to be a juſt dealer.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Secondly, a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout man. <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 25.</note> it is ſaid, <hi>he was a devout man,</hi> as it is in the new Tranſlation,
the Greeke word is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> a <hi>religious</hi> man, ſuch a one as feared God: ſo we
muſt put both theſe together, he was a juſt man, and a religious man; for
it is nothing to be religious, unleſſe one be juſt, nor nothing to bee juſt,
unleſſe one be religious: therefore if thou bee religious, labour to bee
juſt alſo, if thou bee a juſt man labour alſo to bee religious; for a man
muſt ſo looke to his duties to God, as that hee doe not neglect his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to men; and ſo looke to men, as that he doe not neglect his duety
to God. It is a corruption in the world, that if a man be a good and a
juſt dealer in the world he cares not for religion, if he be religious, hee
cares not for good dealing: therefore, art thou a juſt man? make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
of religious dueties, for howſoever thou mai'ſt ſtand before
man, and bee in account with him, yet thou ſhalt not bee able to ſtand
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:17958:76"/>
before God; and art thou a religious man? labour thou alſo to bee a
juſt man; a good dealer, leſt this lye on thy conſcience at the day of thy
death, for <hi>no unjuſt man ſhall inherite the kingdome of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Thirdly, he wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation of Iſrael.</note> 
                  <hi>hee waited for the conſolation of Iſrael;</hi> which implyes two
things: firſt, that hee had laid up all his hope, joy, comfort, and conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
in Chriſt; which muſt likewiſe teach us, to lay up all our hope
and comfort in Chriſt; as <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Chriſt was to him
both in life and in death advantage;</hi> and our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8. 56. <hi>Your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Abraham rejoyced to ſee my day; and he ſaw it, and was glad:</hi> ſo alſo
<hi>Iohn</hi> 20. the Diſciples ſaid to <hi>Thomas, Wee have ſeene the Lord;</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
ſhe had laid up all her joy and comfort in Chriſt. Many now adayes
lay up their comfort in their friends, ſome in their goods and lands, or
in their money: but a Chriſtian muſt lay up all his joy and comfort in
Chriſt, and then one day hee ſhall be happy with him: let a man lay up
his comfort in any thing but in Chriſt, howſoever it may ſtand by him
in the time of peace, yet it will faile him in the time of trouble, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
it ſtand by him in life, yet it will faile him in the time of death;
but if we can lay up our comfort, joy and hope in Chriſt, then Chriſt
will looke upon us with a ſweete and comfortable face at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> hee looked every day for the time of Chriſts comming;
ſo ſhould we doe: but there is a difference, hee looked for his firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
in the fleſh, wee muſt looke for his ſecond comming; <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 22.
it is ſaid, <hi>the whole creation groaneth,</hi> waiting for the comming of Chriſt;
much more ſhould wee becauſe wee, ſhall have eſpecially the fruit and
benefit by it. <hi>Iudges</hi> 5. <hi>The mother of Siſera, looked out of a window, and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
why is his chariot ſo long a comming? why tarry the wheeles of his chariots?</hi>
So when wee looke out of our doores or windowes we ſhould long for
Chriſts comming, and ſay, when will hee come? and when will hee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare?
thus wee ſhould waite for Chriſts comming.</p>
               <p>The ſecond point is, <hi>The manner how this manifeſtation was,</hi> by a viſion,
or as the Greeke word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſignifieth, by <hi>divine inſpiration:</hi> Chriſt was
made manifeſt to the <hi>ſhepheards,</hi> by an <hi>Angell;</hi> to the <hi>Wiſemen,</hi> by a <hi>ſtarre,</hi>
and to <hi>Simeon,</hi> by a <hi>Viſion:</hi> Of which there are two parts.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>that he ſhould not dye, till he had ſeene Chriſt:</hi> Hee was an old man,
and like to drop into his grave every day, and yet he had a revelation gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him, <hi>that he ſhould not dye, till he had ſeene Chriſt:</hi> ſo we ſhould pray to
God, that we may have the ſame grace, whether we bee young or old,
that we may not dye till we have ſeene Chriſt, by the eyes of our faith;
for we have more cauſe to doe ſo, than <hi>Simeon,</hi> for if he had never ſeene
Chriſt, with the eyes of his body, he might have beene bleſſed, though
he had wanted this comfort; but if we doe not ſee him before we dye,
we are like to periſh; therefore we have much more cauſe, to deſire, and
pray God, that we may ſee Chriſt before we dye, before we bee downe
in the duſt, and ſleepe our long ſleepe: ſaith old <hi>Iaakob</hi> (when his ſonne
<hi>Ioſeph</hi> ſent for him) <hi>I will goe and ſee my Sonne Ioſeph before I dye,</hi> ſo a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
ſhould ſay, I will goe and ſee Chriſt before I dye.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:17958:76"/>
The ſecond part of the viſion was, <hi>that he muſt goe into the Temple,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
Chriſt was to bee found there; before Chriſt came there he was
in the townes; why did not <hi>Simeon</hi> goe out to meete him in the
ſtreets? or why did not he goe to <hi>Bethlehem</hi> to ſee Chriſt, as the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards
did? There be two reaſons of it:</p>
               <p>Firſt, that Chriſt might bee the more famouſly knowne: ſecondly,
to teach us that if we will ſee Chriſt we muſt come into the Temple, to
the place of preaching and prayer: for the Goſpell (as I have ſhewed
you) is a glaſſe, wherein (if we looke) wee ſhall ſee Chriſt and all his
graces; even as <hi>Simeon</hi> did come by a motion of the Spirit; ſo if wee
would come to ſee Chriſt, in the Temple, we muſt come by a motion of
the Spirit and of grace: many come to the Temple, but how come
they? by a motion of their friends, or ſome other thing that mooveth
them; but let us come by a motion of the Spirit, and then we ſhall ſee
Chriſt to our comfort.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Thirdly, the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Simeons manifeſtation of Chriſt.</note> 
                  <hi>the effects of the manifeſtation;</hi> and they are threefold: firſt,
as ſoone as he was come into the Temple, he laid hold on Chriſt. <hi>Sime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
was an old man, and had much adoe to ſcramble thither, and yet hee
was not contented to looke upon Chriſt,<note place="margin">1</note> and ſee him in the armes of
<hi>Ioſeph</hi> and in the lap of <hi>Mary,</hi> but hee gets him into his owne armes,
embraces him, and bleſſeth God, that he lived to ſee theſe happy daies;
ſo muſt wee doe, not content our ſelves to ſee Chriſt in the armes of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,</hi>
in the lap of <hi>Mary,</hi> in the armes of the Preachers, or of other
good Chriſtians; but wee muſt labour to have him in our owne armes,
the armes of our faith: for though we may ſee Chriſt in the armes of
our teachers, yet for all this wee may periſh: and therefore ſo much
the rather ought wee to receive and get him into our armes and apply
him into our hearts, becauſe hee comes to preſent himſelfe to thee and
to me; therefore if we doe not receive him, wee ſhall be guilty of his
blood.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> If we ſhould bee in a roome, and a childe ſhould cry to come
unto us, would wee neglect the childe, would not we caſt away that
which wee had in our hands, and take the childe into our owne armes?
I doe not ſay, if it were the childe of a king, we would doe ſo, but if it
were the childe of an honeſt poore man: and therefore much more
ſhould we receive the Childe Chriſt; beloved, this Chide Chriſt doth
in a ſort cry to come unto us, and ſaith as it were thus, O good people,
receive me into your hearts, receive me into your ſoules, I doe not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
it for my owne ſake, but you ſhall be the better for it; therefore O
good people, why doe ye not receive me? if we doe not, wee are like
to periſh, and we ſhall be guilty of his blood; and therefore this is our
duty when Chriſt doth offer himſelfe unto us, we ſhould bee ready to
receive him: ſo old <hi>Simeon</hi> did; for it is nothing to ſee him unleſſe wee
get him in our armes by our faith and embrace him; therefore why doe
we not fling away all things that doe hinder us, and receive him into
our hearts, and lay hold on him which is life and ſalvation offered to
us?</p>
               <p>The ſecond was, that when he had ſeene Chriſt, <hi>he praiſeth God for it;</hi>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:17958:77"/>
that although he had ſeene a great deale of trouble, and felt a great deale
of ſorrow, yet that he lived to ſee thoſe happy daies, wherein he might
ſee Chriſt: ſo, howſoever we have lived to ſee a great deale of trouble
and ſorrow, yet wee ſhould praiſe God, that hee hath let us live to ſee
Chriſt in the face of the Goſpell; therefore wee have great cauſe to
praiſe God, that hee hath let us live till this time to repent us of our
ſinnes, to get faith in Chriſt: howſoever we have had a great deale of
ſorrow and trouble in this world, yet the comfort is that we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
of our ſinnes, and lived to make heaven and happineſſe sure un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us: <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 16. ſaith our Saviour; <hi>But bleſſed be your eyes, for they
ſee, and your eares, for they heare;</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, O bleſſed be God, for
this happy time wherein we live, to ſee that wee ſee, and to heare that
which we heare: ſo <hi>Iohn</hi> 20. when the Diſciples had ſeene Chriſt, they
told <hi>Thomas</hi> of it, They were glad that after a great deale of trouble,
they had ſeene Chriſt at laſt: ſo it is ſaid, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 39. <hi>the Eunuch went
away rejoycing,</hi> when Chriſt was made knowne to him: therefore what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
wee have beene before, yet if wee can repent of our ſinnes, get
Chriſt into our hearts by faith; wee have great cauſe to praiſe and to
thanke God, that wee have lived to ſee theſe daies: haſt thou beene a
ſwearer, or a drunkard, or a bad liver, and repented of thy ſinnes? lay
hold on Chriſt, thou haſt great cauſe to praiſe God, and to thanke him,
that he hath let thee live to ſee theſe happy daies.</p>
               <p>The third effect was,<note place="margin">3</note> that he did utter theſe ſpeeches, <hi>Lord now letteſt
thou thy ſervant depart in peace, &amp;c.</hi> Now this ſaying of <hi>Simeon</hi> was the
firſt ſong in the new Teſtament, that was ſung in the Temple: wherein
foure things may be obſerved.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. His willingneſſe, and profeſſion to dye.</item>
                  <item>2. What account he made of death.</item>
                  <item>3. In what diſpoſition, he doth deſire to dye.</item>
                  <item>4. The Reaſon why he was willing to dye.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The firſt is, <hi>a profeſſion of his willingneſſe to dye;</hi> Now Lord, I am wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to dye,<note place="margin">1</note> I am well contented to depart in peace, for I have ſeene
enough, I have ſeene the Saviour and redeemer of the world; I have
embraced him in my armes, and therefore I am willing to dye now. So
when we have ſeene Chriſt, we ſhould bee willing to dye, for wee have
ſeene enough for our ſalvation; as long as God would have us live, wee
ſhould be willing to live, and when he would have us dye, we ſhould be
willing to depart: we ſee if a maſter ſend his ſervant to trade, and traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique
beyond ſea,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſo long as his maſter will have him to trade and traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique,
ſo long hee will trade, but when his maſter will have him come
home, hee will packe up all and come away: ſo, as long as God will
have us trade and traffique heere, we ſhould be content, but when hee
will have us packe up all, and come home, wee ſhould be contented to
doe ſo. In the Goſpell we finde that Chriſt fled from death and danger,
when God would have him fly; but when the time of his death came,
he went out to meete it; ſo likewiſe <hi>Moſes,</hi> hee could have beene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to paſſe over <hi>Iordan,</hi> but when God told him that he ſhould not,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:17958:77"/>
but he muſt goe and dye in the mount <hi>Nebo,</hi> hee went as willingly up as
any man goeth to a feaſt or banquet: therefore it is a pitifull thing, to
ſee how men doe hang upon the world, at that time, when God would
have them dye.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>what account he made of death:</hi> men make much adoe about
it, are afraid of it; but <hi>Simeon</hi> accounteth it, but a departing out of this
one roome into another, a departing from men to God, from earth to
heaven, from mortality to immortality; therefore wee may ſee what
account wee ſhould make of it. The <hi>Philoſophers</hi> ſay that death is the
moſt terrible thing that may be, becauſe they thinke it is an utter deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of nature: but <hi>Simeon</hi> accounts of it as of a remooving or depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
from one place to another; therefore he is not afraid of it, but em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth
it, as a doore or gate to paſſe from earth to heaven, from men to
God, from mortality to immortality; and this is the account that all men
ſhould make of death. <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 15. ſaith the Lord to <hi>Abraham,</hi> but
<hi>thou ſhalt go to thy fathers in peace, and ſhalt be buried in a good old age;</hi> ſo that
death is nothing but a going to the holy men, thoſe that have died in
faith before; and Chriſt accounts of it, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. 13. but as a going to God,
to the bleſſed Angels, and holy Spirits departed: ſo alſo <hi>Paul,</hi> in one of his
epiſtles, <hi>Nevertheleſſe wee are bold and love rather to remoove out of this body,
and to dwell with the Lord.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> 
                  <hi>Ahaſuerus, Heſter</hi> 2. 13, 14. had two houſes
for his women; one was the houſe of ſweete perfumes and odors,
that they might bee there a certaine time to be perfumed and then they
were brought to the kings houſe; ſo the king of Heaven hath two hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
(as it were) one of preparation, here in this world; the other of frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
hereafter in Heaven, therefore wee muſt live here a certaine time,
and be perfumed with the graces of Gods ſpirit, ere wee bee taken to
the ſecond houſe, a place of glory and happineſſe to live with God for
ever.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>in what eſtate hee would die in;</hi> hee would dye the ſervant of
God: ſo let us labour to dye in this eſtate, ſervants to God, for if wee
dye thus, wee paſſe from men to God, from earth to heaven, from an
eſtate of miſery, to a place of happineſſe and joy; but if wee dye the
ſervants of ſinne, then wee goe not to God, but to the devill and the
damned; therfore let us labour to be the ſervants of God, to dye in his
favour, to bee members of Chriſt, and then when our ſoules part from
our bodies, they ſhall goe to God. <hi>Deut.</hi> 34. 5. it is ſaid, <hi>So Moſes the
ſervant of the Lord died:</hi> it is the greateſt credit that may bee to dye the
ſervant of God, although we dye not worth one penny, yet we ſhall be
happy and bleſſed: <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. it is ſaid, that <hi>all theſe died in faith;</hi> they
died not all of a lingring ſickneſſe, nor in their beds, but they died all in
faith; this was their honour and glory, that they died beleevers; ſo
this is the honour and glory of a man, when he dieth in faith, the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
of God, repentant for his ſinnes: therefore whatſoever thy death
be, and whereſoever the place thereof be, yet if thou dye Gods ſervant,
if thou dye repentant for thy ſinnes, if thou dye in faith, thou art a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
man; there bee many contented to dye, but if they dye not Gods
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:17958:78"/>
ſervants thy might better a thouſand times deſire life.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>he did deſire to dye in peace: now let thy ſervant depart in peace.
Simeon</hi> deſired to dye, but how? in peace of conſcience, in the feeling of
Gods favour; there be a number deſire to dye in the world, but let them
take with them this example; let them labour to dye in the peace of a
good Conſcience, in the feeling of Gods favour, in the pardon and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe
of their ſinnes. O it is a fearefull thing when a man dieth in
his ſinnes, as our Saviour ſaith to the <hi>Iewes, Ye ſhall dye in your ſinnes:</hi> this
was a fearefull ſentence and an heavy judgement that befell the hard-hearted
<hi>Iewes;</hi> and I pray God it may be a warning unto us to make us
beware how we incurre the like, that ſo we may provide and labour to
die in peae, and in the feeling of Gods favour, in faith and repentance
for our ſinnes; and then we ſhall be happy men and bleſſed.</p>
               <p>The fourth thing was,<note place="margin">4</note> 
                  <hi>the reaſon why hee did deſire to dye,</hi> when hee had
ſeene Chriſt, <hi>for mine eyes</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>hath ſeene thy ſalvation.</hi> I have ſeene
Chriſt the Saviour and Redeemer of Mankinde, and have embraced
him in mine armes, now Lord let thy ſervant depart in peace; hee had
not alway this affection in him to deſire to dye, but when hee had ſeene
Chriſt, and imbraced him in his armes, then hee had lived long enough,
then he was willing to dye. Which ſhould teach us to know when we
ſhould be willing to dye, we have no reaſon to deſire death till we have
ſeene Chriſt, and laid hold on him by faith, and then when wee have
done ſo, wee have lived long enough: therefore wee muſt remember
that the eſpeciall end, why God doth let us live here, is not to eate and
drinke, to ſeeke our profits, pleaſures and eaſe, but to get Chriſt, to
make heaven and happineſſe ſure unto us, to repent us of our ſinnes. A
number thinke they live to no other end, but to eate and drinke, to
ſeeke their pleaſures and profits, but to ſee Chriſt and to lay hold upon
him they thinke not of; therefore as the blinde man deſired Chriſt to
open his eyes;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſo we ſhould deſire Chriſt to open the eyes of our minde
that we may ſee him by the eyes of our faith: if then this bee the end,
why he doth let us live, then it is not to eate and drinke onely, to buy
and ſell, to paſſe away our daies in joy and delight, but to repent in, to
lay hold on Chriſt, which if we doe then wee ſhall be bleſſed in it.</p>

come to ſpeake of His ſufferings; for this is the
next point in our Chriſtian faith. But here a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
may be demanded,<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> 
                  <hi>why there is mention made
of his ſufferings, and none of his miracles,</hi> ſeeing it
was the miracles that mooved the world? theſe
they did wonder and admire at, but they deſpiſed
him for his ſufferings, as <hi>Eſai.</hi> 53. 2. <hi>For hee ſhall
grow up before him as a branch, and as a roote out of a dry ground, he hath nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
forme nor comlineſſe, and when wee ſhall ſee him, there is no beauty that we
ſhould deſire him: he is deſpiſed and rejected of men, a man of ſorrowes, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with griefe, we hid our faces as it were from him; hee was deſpiſed and
we eſteemed him not:</hi> ſo <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 21. the two Diſciples that went to <hi>Emma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
thought that Chriſt ſhould have beene an earthly king, <hi>Wee truſted
that it had beene he that ſhould have redeemed Iſrael;</hi> and now his ſufferings
doth daſh all: thus Chriſt was deſpiſed for his ſufferings.</p>
               <p>To this wee anſwer two things:<note place="margin">Sol.</note> firſt, although his Miracles were
more admirable, yet his ſufferings were more profitable; for it is by
his ſufferings that wee are ſayed: <hi>Eſai.</hi> 53. 5. <hi>But hee was wounded for our
tranſgreſſions, hee was broken for our infirmities, the chaſtiſements of our peace
was upon him, and with his ſtripes we are healed:</hi> and 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 24. (ſaith hee)
<hi>Who in his owne ſelfe bare our ſinnes in his body on the tree, that we being delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from ſinne, ſhould live in righteouſneſſe, by whoſe ſtripes wee are healed:</hi> ſo
then we are ſaved, notby Chriſts walking on the water, the raiſing up of
the dead, clenſing the Lepers, caſting out of devils, but His ſweating in
the garden, bleeding on the croſſe, dying for us: ſo it is Chriſts ſufferings
his dying and bleeding on the croſſe for us, that ſaves us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:17958:79"/>
Secondly,<note place="margin">ARTI. III.</note> his Miracles were profitable chiefly to the people of that
age and time hee lived in, but his ſufferings are profitable to all the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
ages, that be to come; for to this day, we have the fruit and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of them: therefore although wee doe not ſee Chriſt, raiſing the
dead, clenſing the Lepers, caſting out of devils, healing us with a touch
of his finger, yet to this day, the ſufferings of Chriſt and his death are
ſufficient to redeeme and to ſave our ſoules: therefore let us not onely
kiſſe the Sonne of God in the cradle, as <hi>Simeon</hi> did (although it be a good
thing ſo to doe) but let us goe to the croſſe and kiſſe him there; yea
let us goe further into the high Prieſts hall, and kiſſe him there; and
ſay, Lord thy ſhame is my glory, thy paines are my eaſe, and thy death
is my life.</p>
               <p>Now in the ſufferings of Chriſt, we may obſerve theſe ſix things:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The neceſſity thereof.</item>
                  <item>2. Who it was that ſuffered:</item>
                  <item>3. For whom he ſuffered:</item>
                  <item>4. To what end:</item>
                  <item>5. By whom he ſuffered:</item>
                  <item>6. What hee ſuffered:</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Firſt, the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Chriſts Sufferings.</note> 
                  <hi>the neceſſity of his ſufferings;</hi> one would have thought it had
beene ſufficient, if he had but come into the world, tooke our nature up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, and have ſpoken, although he had not ſuffered for us, but there
was a neceſſity laid upon him, that he muſt ſuffer: <hi>Mark.</hi> 8. 31. it is
ſaid, <hi>the Sonne of man muſt ſuffer many things;</hi> ſo neceſſity is laid upon
him: now there is a twofold neceſſitie of Chriſts ſufferings.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>Neceſſitas precii,</hi> aeneceſſity of paying the price for mans ranſome,
becauſe we have ſinned againſt God;<note place="margin">Neceſſitas Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cii.</note> therefore we muſt ſuffer or Chriſt
muſt ſuffer for us, by order of divine juſtice: that as we have ſinned, ſo
we ſhould be puniſhed and ſuffer for it, in our ſelves or in another, that
is, Chriſt: for it is the nature of juſtice to bring things to an equalitie,
as much as may be; therefore inaſmuch as wee have done things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to Gods will; ſo wee ſhould ſuffer things contrary to our owne
will, at the hand of God: hence grew the neceſſity of paying the price
of mans redemption, for wee muſt ſuffer or Chriſt muſt ſuffer: but
Chriſt he ſuffered on earth, that we ſhould not ſuffer in hell; he ſuffered
a death temporall, that we might not ſuffer a death eternall; he ſuffered
at the hands of men, that wee might not at the hands of God; hee
hanged on the croſſe, that we might not hang in hell: as <hi>Ioh.</hi> 18. 8.
When Chriſt was taken of the ſouldiers; <hi>Ieſus aſked them whom they
ſought, They ſaid, Ieſus of Nazareth; Ieſus ſaid unto them, I am he; if therefore
yee ſeeke me let theſe goe free:</hi> ſo hee ſaith to God the father, O touch them
not, doe them no harme, take me, let them goe free, I am contented to
ſuffer,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and to beare whatſoever they ſhould have borne, and to bee puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
for them: in <hi>Philemon,</hi> when <hi>Oneſimus</hi> had robbed his maſter, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
come away from him, whom <hi>Paul</hi> ſent home againe to his maſter,
with a letter to this effect to receive him, if, ſaith he, <hi>hee hath done thee
any hurt, or owe thee any thing, ſet it upon my ſkore, and put it upon my accounts;
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:17958:79"/>
I Paul have written it, with my owne hand:</hi> ſo we are all runne away from
God, Chriſt he ſpies us and brings us home againe to God, (as it were)
with a letter in our hands, to this effect; Father, if they have done thee
any wrong, or ought thee any thing, ſet it on my ſkore, I will anſwer, I
Ieſus, I have not written it with inke and paper, but I have written it
with my owne blood, ſo there was a neceſſity of paying the price of
mans redemption, that Chriſt muſt ſuffer.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> it was <hi>Neceſſitas exempli,</hi> neceſſity of example, that Chriſt
muſt ſuffer becauſe hee could not enter into his glory,<note place="margin">Neceſſitas ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empli.</note> but hee muſt firſt
ſuffer; as <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 26. <hi>Ought not Chriſt to have ſuffered theſe things, and to
enter into his glory?</hi> ſo likewiſe <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 10. <hi>For it became him, for whom
are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many ſonnes to glory, that
he ſhould conſecrate the Captaine of their ſalvation, through ſufferings:</hi> and as
the Captaine of our ſalvation was conſecrated through affliction, ſo we
ſhould bee conformable to him, to ſuffer before wee enter into glory.
<hi>Act.</hi> 14. 22. the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts them <hi>to continue in the faith, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that we muſt through many afflictions, enter into the kingdome of Heaven:</hi>
And 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 12. <hi>If we ſuffer with him, wee ſhall alſo raigne with him; If
we deny him here, hee alſo will deny us hereafter:</hi> therefore that wee may
raigne with him, we muſt be contented to ſuffer with him; for no man
can enter into glory, but he muſt firſt ſuffer. We read of two Diſciples
that came unto Chriſt, who deſired the <hi>one to ſit at his right hand, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at his left;</hi> they dreamed of an earthly kingdome, of the great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and glory they ſhould have had by Chriſt; but hee ſaith to them,
<hi>Can yee drinke of the ſame cup that I muſt drinke of, and bee baptized with the
baptiſme that I am baptized:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, you dreame of earthly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
and glory that yee ſhould have by mee, but can yee drinke of the
cup, that I ſhall drinke, and can you bee baptized with the baptiſme that
I ſhall be baptized with? ſo then it was neceſſity of example that made
Chriſt to ſuffer, that as he ſuffered before hee entred into glory, ſo wee
ſhould firſt ſuffer before wee come into glory.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Secondly, who it was that ſuffered.</note> 
                  <hi>Who it was that ſuffered?</hi> It was <hi>Chriſt,</hi> (as the Text ſaith)
<hi>the juſt for the unjuſt:</hi> Now every one knoweth that Chriſt was God, ſo
it was not a naked and bare man that ſuffered, but it was God; S. <hi>Peter</hi>
preſſes the Iewes, <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 15. <hi>Ye have crucified the Lord of life;</hi> ſo it was
God that ſuffered, not in the divine nature, for that was not poſſible, that
could not ſuffer, but it was the divine Perſon; It was not a naked and a
bare man that did ſuffer, but it was God. Now if any ſhould aſke mee,
who it was that ſuffered? I would anſwere him, it was God. If hee
ſhould aſke me, in what nature? I would anſwer him, in his humane, not
in the divine nature, for that could not ſuffer; it was God that ſuffered
in the fleſh, as <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 28. <hi>Take heed therefore unto your ſelves, and to all the
flocke, whereof the Holy Ghost hath made you overſeers, to feed the Church of God,
which he hath purchaſed with his owne bloud;</hi> ſo 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 1. <hi>For aſmuch them as
Christ hath ſuffered for us in the fleſh, arme your ſelves likewiſe with the ſame
minde,</hi> &amp;c. So then it was God that ſuffered in the fleſh, not in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
nature. Of which there be three Vſes:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:17958:80"/>
Firſt, ſeeing it was God that ſuffered, and not a bare man; this may
give us comfort,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> that our ſalvation ſtandeth good and firme before God,
and that his ſufferings are more than ſufficient to redeeme us, ſeeing it
was more that God ſhould ſuffer, than if all the creatures or men in the
world ſhould have ſuffered; for it is a leſſe matter that all the creatures
ſhould be confounded and brought to nothing, than that God the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
ſhould have ſuffered but one houre.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> We ſee in nature that a wound
at the heart, although it be but with a little pin, is more dangerous than
a great cut in the thigh, arme, or any other place; ſo it is a greater mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that Chriſt ſhould have ſuffered, than if all the creatures ſhould have
ſuffered: So that the ſufferings of Chriſt, are more than ſufficient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme
us; for it is the dignity of the perſon that giveth a merit and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie
to the ſufferings: by this that hath been ſaid, is made manifeſt, that
no man need doubt but that the ſufferings of Chriſt is more worth than
all the bodies and ſoules of men in the world.<note place="margin">Quest.</note> But here may a queſtion
be moved, how the death of Chriſt which was but temporary, ſhould be
ſufficient to redeemeus,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> ſeeing we ſhould have ſuffered eternally? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
it was the dignity of his perſon, that gave power and efficacie to
it, for it was more that God ſhould ſuffer even a little, than if all the men
of the world had ſuffered for ever.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> ſeeing it was God that ſuffered, this doth ſhew the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſneſſe
of our ſinnes, that when we have ſinned, we have done that
which all the powers in heaven and in earth cannot ſatiſfie, neither <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi>
nor <hi>Archangels,</hi> but it muſt be the bloud of the Sonne of God: ſaith
<hi>Auguſtine,</hi> O man, doe but conſider by the greatneſſe of the price, the
greatneſſe of thy ſinnes: we ſee, what a ſlight matter we make of ſinne,
when we have ſworne an oath, or told alye, yet when wee have done
ſo, we have done that that all the Angels in heaven cannot make expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and ſatiſfaction for, but onely the Sonne of God muſt doe it, and
that with his owne bloud; therefore doe not thou ſell that for a toy or
a trifle, that coſt ſo great price.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Vſe 3.</note> ſeeing it was God that ſuffered, wee muſt not thinke much
that we ſuffer for our ſins; for if God would have ſpared any, he would
have ſpared his owne Sonne one would thinke, but he would not ſpare
him, though there was no inherent or reall ſinne in him, but a ſhadow
onely, and the imputation of ſinne upon him: therefore how ſhall hee
ſpare us that have ſinne inherent and reall in us? we thinke much when
our teeth or backe ake, or any other part of us, whereas wee deſerve to
be pained in all our parts: if God ſuffered, we muſt not thinke much to
ſuffer for our ſinnes; for in mans reaſon, if he would have ſpared any, he
would have ſpared his owne Sonne: <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>They
will reverence my Son:</hi> And <hi>Luk.</hi> 23. 34. he ſaith, <hi>If they doe this to the greene
tree,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> 
                  <hi>what will they doe to the dry tree?</hi> He was a greene tree full of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and full of grace; we be but dry trees, no goodneſſe nor no grace
in us: If he ſuffered ſuch things, what ſhall become of us? So <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.
21. <hi>For if God ſpared not the naturall branches, take heed alſo leſt hee ſpare not
thee:</hi> Therefore if Chriſt ſuffered, we muſt not thinke much to ſuffer.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:17958:80"/>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> For whom he ſuffered: <hi>Saint</hi> Peter <hi>ſaith,</hi> the juſt for the unjuſt:
<hi>And</hi> Rom. 5. 8. <hi>the Apoſtle ſaith,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Thirdly, for whom be ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> But God commendeth his love to us, ſeeing
that whileſt we were yet ſinners, Chriſt died for us: <hi>So then Chriſt died for us
in our place and roome. The Vſes are:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> ſeeing Chriſt ſuffered in our roome and place, therefore this
muſt teach us, that whatſoever befell Chriſt at his ſufferings, the ſame
might juſtly have fallen upon us: for Chriſt he tooke the guilt of our
ſinnes upon him, ſuffered in our roome and place; therefore, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
befell him, the ſame ſhould have befallen us: as he was arraigned
and condemned at <hi>Pilates</hi> barre, ſo wee ſhould have beene before Gods
tribunall; as he was condemned of <hi>Pilate,</hi> ſo we ſhould have beene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
of God; as he was accuſed of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> ſo we ſhould have been
by the Devill; as he was carried out of the Citie, to the place of execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
ſo we ſhould have beene carried to hell; as he was hanged on the
Croſſe, ſo we ſhould have been tormented in hell for ever: as darkneſſe
was over his face, ſo we ſhould have had our faces overwhelmed with
darkneſſe for ever. Alas, we thinke much to ſuffer a little paine in our
heads, backes, or teeth, &amp;c. but what is this to that which Chriſt ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for us; we have our houſes to reſt in, but it is ſaid, that <hi>the Sonne of
man hath not a place to reſt his head in;</hi> He died in the fields, wee have our
ſoft beds; he amongſt his enemies, we amongſt our friends; Chriſt was
a hungry and thirſted, we have our tables filled; he was in want, and we
have plenty: therefore conſider with thy ſelfe what great things befell
Chriſt, the ſame ſhould have befallen thee; whatſoever extremitie in
ſoule or in body came to him, the ſame (nay, worſe, had not he redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
thee) would have vexed thee.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> ſeeing Chriſt ſuffered in our roome and place: this there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſhould teach us to accuſe our ſelves, becauſe wee be the cauſe of
Chriſts ſufferings; for it is our ſinnes that cauſed a crowne of thornes
to be ſet on his head, that nailed him to the croſſe, that thruſt the ſpeare
into his ſides, &amp; did crucifie him. So <hi>Eſa.</hi> 53. 16. it is ſaid, <hi>That the chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of our peace was upon him, and with his ſtripes we are healed.</hi> Therefore,
as <hi>Gen.</hi> 35. 18. <hi>Rachel</hi> named her ſon <hi>Ben-oni,</hi> the ſonne of her ſorrow, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he was borne with the death of his mother; ſo Chriſt may call us
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>nnes of his ſorrow, becauſe we be all borne with his death. There be
many that complaine of the ſouldiers, of <hi>Pilate,</hi> of <hi>Iudas,</hi> and of the <hi>Iewes,</hi>
but we ought rather to complaine of our ſelves, our ſinnes, and the vile
life we live in: therefore let us doe, as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> did goe to the
croſſe of Chriſt, as hee pulled the ſpickes out of his hands and his feet,
ſo ſhould wee in a ſpirituall manner, goe to the croſſe of Chriſt, looke
upon his body, and ſay, O bleſſed Lord, this is the head that my ſinnes
have crowned with a crowne of thornes, theſe be the hands that my ſins
have pierced, theſe be the feet that my ſinnes have nailed, this is the face
which my ſinnes cauſed to be ſpit upon, this is the backe which I cauſed
to be whipped, and theſe be the ſides that I cauſed to be wounded with
a ſpeare: thus we ſhould complaine of our ſelves, and weepe day and
night, in that we were the cauſe of his death. If a man be found dead,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:17958:81"/>
there is inquiry made in the countrey how this man came by his death:
So now that Chriſt is found dead on the croſſe,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> we muſt make inquiry
how Chriſt came to his death, upon the inquiry we ſhall finde that we
be the crucifiers of him, not the <hi>Iewes</hi> onely, but my ſinnes and thy ſins;
for as a learned man ſaith, there be two crucifiers, <hi>There bee inviſible and
viſible crucifiers;</hi> the viſible crucifiers are the <hi>Iewes;</hi> the inviſible are <hi>the
people of all ages:</hi> Wherefore, ſeeing our ſinnes have brought Chriſt to
his death,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> we ſhould the more hate and deteſt them. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, If
a man ſhould kill father or mother, would we let him lie in our boſomes,
ſet him at our table, let him be in our houſes? No, we would hate, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre,
and never abide him; why man (ſaith he) thy ſinnes have not kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
thy father and thy mother only, but thy Lord and Maſter, one that
hath done more for thee, than all the world beſides: wherefore then
wilt thou let ſinne lye in thy boſome, wilt thou nouriſh it and entertaine
it ſtill? nay, rather hate, deteſt, and ſpit at it.</p>

                  <hi>The end why Chriſt ſuffered,</hi> was either generall, <hi>to bring us

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Generall end</hi> was,<note place="margin">The generall end of his death.</note> 
                  <hi>to bring us to God,</hi> that we might have communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and fellowſhip with him, for all our happineſſe conſiſts in this bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
us to God; and all our miſery in this, that we be ſtrangers from him,
for by the reaſon of our ſinnes we have no communion with him: as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
was caſt out of Paradiſe, ſo we be all caſt from the preſence of God;
and as he ranne away from Gods preſence, hid himſelfe, and could not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide
it; ſo we are all runne away from God, we cannot abide his preſence
nor ſtand before God, nor ſpeake unto him; but Chriſt hath ſuffered to
this end, to bring us unto him, and hath appeaſed his anger ſo, that now
he doth looke after us, and we may be bold to goe to him, and ſpeake to
him in prayer. Here we may obſerve three things:</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> that we be ſtrangers from God, and dare not come into his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
but are abaſhed to ſtand before him, or ſpeake unto him, before
Chriſt hath carried and preſented us to him: As in <hi>Gen.</hi> 47. 2. when <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>
was come into <hi>Aegypt</hi> to ſee <hi>Ioſeph, he preſented five of his brethren with
his father Iacob to King Pharaoh,</hi> becauſe he was a ſtranger: ſo ſeeing we
be ſtrangers from God, who did not know us, the true <hi>Ioſeph</hi> doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
us unto him.</p>
               <p>I,<note place="margin">Object.</note> 
                  <hi>but doth not God know us?</hi> Doth he not know the creatures that he
hath made? This is a heavie thing that God ſhould not know us.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, that ſinne hath put upon us ſuch a fearfull ugly face
and ſo deformed,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> that God doth not acknowledge us to be the creatures
he made at firſt; therefore the true <hi>Ioſeph</hi> doth bring us to God, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
us in his bloud, ſaying, O Father accept of them, theſe be they for
whoſe ſake I was nine moneths in the dark wombe of the <hi>Virgin,</hi> borne
in a ſtable, laid in a manger; theſe be they for whoſe ſakes I died that
ſame curſed death on the croſſe; Father, for my ſake accept them, and
let my paines be their eaſe, my ſhame their glory, my death their life,
and my condemnation their abſolution: ſo that it is Chriſt that bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
us home unto God, which is the generall end of his ſufferings: In
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:17958:81"/>
                  <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 12. it is ſaid, <hi>Remember, that at that time yee were without Christ,
being aliens from the common-wealth of Iſrael, and ſtrangers from the covenants
of promiſe, having no hope, and without God in the world: but now in Christ
Ieſus, yee who ſometimes were afarre off, are made nigh to him, by the blood of
Christ:</hi> ſo it is the great price; that Chriſt hath paid for us, that brings
us into favour with God, even his moſt precious blood.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> herein we may ſee, the marvellous love of Chriſt, that hee
would bring us home to God, and into favour againe, and that not with
a word ſpeaking, but by dying and ſuffering for us: it had beene a great
love of Chriſt, if he had but ſpoke for us, although he had done no more,
but what a great love was this; to ſuffer ſuch great things, that it coſt him
his life and blood, hee was not at reſt till he had wrought our redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
as <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 15. ſaith he, <hi>But I have a Baptiſme to be baptized with, and how
am I ſtraightned till it be accompliſhed?</hi> And hee did it not by ſpeaking for
us, but he did it by dying and ſuffering for us; <hi>Exod</hi> 32. 32. ſaith <hi>Moſes,</hi>
pleading for the people, <hi>Yet now if thou wilt forgive their ſinne,</hi> thy mercy
ſhall appeare, <hi>But if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy booke which thou hast
written:</hi> So ſaith Chriſt, Father ſpare thy people, or elſe wipe me out
of the land of the liuing, let my life goe for theirs, ſpare them and take
me;<note place="margin">Heb. 9. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40. 6, 7. wee ſee that it is not the blood of calves and of
goates, and beaſts, that can redeeme us, but Chriſt knew it muſt bee
a more precious blood that muſt doe it; and therefore doth hee offer
his owne blood, and ſaith, take my life and my blood, and let my people
goe free. Hence wee may ſee the marvelous love of Chriſt, that hee
did not redeeme us by ſpeaking, but by ſuffering and dying for us, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſeeing he loved us, we ſhould be content to love againe, and to doe
any thing that he requires of us. Saint <hi>Andrew</hi> when he was charged of
the Gentiles, that he did not love their gods, he made this anſwer, Let
me ſee if your gods can make mee ſuch a heaven and earth, and doe ſo
much for me, as my God hath done, then I will love your gods; but if
they cannot, then they are not to bee reſpected, nor regarded: so wee
may ſay to our vile luſts and to our ſinnes, if ye can doe ſo much for me
as Chriſt hath done, then I will beſtow my love upon you, but if you
cannot, then you are not to be regarded, nor reſpected; He ſhall have my
heart, that hath done theſe great things for me.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> ſeeing Chriſt hath ſuffered to bring us to God, wee muſt
take heede, we doe not defeate him of his labour; which we doe, if we
hang ſtill in our ſinnes: <hi>Deut.</hi> 24. 15. The Lord accounts the retaining
and keeping of the labourers hire,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> a great and grievous ſinne, even a
crying ſinne; let us conſider this, that Chriſt hath laboured for us, not
for our meate nor money, but to bring us to God, to repentance, and to
heaven; but if we hang ſtill in our ſinnes, and doe not repent us of them,
nor bee brought home to God, we defeate him and will not let him have
for his labour what hee hath travelled for; as it is ſaid, <hi>Eſai.</hi> 5. 31. <hi>Hee
ſhall ſee of the travell of his ſoule, and ſhall bee ſatiſfied;</hi> Chriſt hath travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
but to what end? to bring us to God, to Repentance, to faith in
Chriſt, to make us conſcionable in our courſes, this will ſatisfie him;
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:17958:82"/>
but if men be not brought home unto God, if they doe not repent, walke
conſcionably in their courſes, it will grieve Chriſt, that ever he prayed
in the mount, ſweat in the garden, died on the croſſe: therefore ſeeing
the end why Chriſt ſuffered is, <hi>to bring us to God,</hi> let us not diſappoint
him of it. Thus much for the <hi>generall</hi> end. Now the <hi>particular</hi> end is
twofold.</p>
               <list>

               </list>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>to reconcile us to God,</hi> and to make us at one with him; ſo 1 <hi>Pet.</hi>
2. 24. <hi>Who his owne ſelfe bare our ſinnes in his body on the tree, that we being
delivered from ſinne, ſhould live in righteouſneſſe, by whoſe ſtripes we are healed;</hi>
and <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 14. <hi>Behold the Lambe of God that takes away the ſinnes of the
world:</hi> even as the Lambe in the Law tooke away ſinne, ſo doth Chriſt,
for in the Law when a lambe was to bee offered,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> for the ſinnes of the
people, they came and laid their hands upon the head thereof, confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
their ſinnes, and ſo they were put upon the lambe, which was killed,
and the man went free; ſo Chriſt doth take away our ſinnes, which are
laid upon him, he is killed and we goe free: therefore when the devill
ſhall ſtand up at the day of judgement, to accuſe us, and ſay we have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
againſt God, wee muſt not deny the matter; for then we are caſt,
and God may juſtly condemne us;<note place="margin">Plead againſt Satan.</note> but wee muſt ſay, it is true indeede
Satan, I have ſinned againſt God, I have done thus and thus againſt
Him, but I have had the Law for it, I have anſwered it: and although
not in my ſelfe, yet in Chriſt, for he ſuffered and was killed for me, and
hath borne whatſoever God could require at my hands, therefore ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Chriſt hath ſatiſfied, thou canſt not require any thing at my hands:
there is a rule in law, that if a debt be paid, they cannot require payment
thereof againe, therefore if we can prove payment of it by Chriſt, it
cannot be required of us againe.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Secondly, to abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh ſinne.</note> 
                  <hi>Chriſt died to aboliſh Sinne;</hi> for he did not onely die to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
us to God, and beare that which wee ſhould have borne, but alſo
to aboliſh and deſtroy Sinne; therefore ſeeing Chriſt died to abolish it,
wee muſt take heed wee doe not ſtrengthen ſinne, for if wee nouriſh it,
it will make all the death of Chriſt and his blood void to us: when
<hi>Ioſhua</hi> deſtroyed <hi>Iericho, Curſed</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>bee the man before the Lord, that
riſeth up and buildeth this Citie, &amp;c. Ioſh.</hi> 6. 26. So ſeeing Chriſt hath ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to aboliſh ſinne, curſed ſhall that man or that woman bee that buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
it up againe; therefore wee have great cauſe to weaken ſinne, and
to decline it, ſeeing hee had not ſuffered any thing but for it: As 1 <hi>Sam.</hi>
25. 21. when <hi>David</hi> ſent to <hi>Nabal,</hi> a meſſenger, and hee returned a chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
anſwer againe; ſaith <hi>David, Surely in vaine have I kept all that this fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
hath in the wilderneſſe, &amp;c.</hi> ſo may Chriſt ſay, if we live ſtill in our
ſinnes, and ſtrengthen them, in vaine have I ſuffered for them, in vaine
have I prayed, and died on the croſſe, and therefore if wee live in our
ſinnes, we make his death of none effect unto us.</p>
               <p>Againe, ſeeing Chriſt died to aboliſh ſinne, we muſt make this the end
of our ſufferings; for that which was Chriſts end muſt be the end of our
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:17958:82"/>
ſufferings; therefore, doeſt thou ſuffer ſickneſſe, loſſe of thy goods, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
afflictions? Let this be the end of thy ſufferings to aboliſh ſinne. Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
are called <hi>Croſſes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> becauſe (as wee know) that croſſes are to crucifie
and kill men; ſo every affliction muſt be as a croſſe to crucifie and to kill
ſinne, our vile affections, and the immoderate luſts of our fleſh; many a
man is contented to ſuffer afflictions, but to what end? to aboliſh ſinne as
Chriſt did? no, but for ſome by-reſpect of his owne; we may not doe ſo,
for if we would have comfort in our ſufferings, that which was Chriſts end
in his, muſt be ours alſo.</p>
               <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">Fifthly, of whom Chriſt ſuffered.</note> 
                  <hi>Of whom he ſuffered, of God</hi> and <hi>of man:</hi> this is a leſſon for our
learning, not onely to ſuffer at the hands of God, but alſo at the hands of
men, becauſe this is part of our conformitie with Chriſt: Ordinarily the
people of God, when they doe ſuffer of God, doe not ſuffer of men; and
when they ſuffer of men, doe not ſuffer of God; but if it fall out ſo, that
we doe ſuffer both at the hands of God and men, we ſhould be quiet and
contented with the good will of God, and ſay as <hi>Eli</hi> did, <hi>It is the Lord, let
him doe as it pleaſeth him.</hi> It is the corruption of the world that they can
be contented to ſuffer at the hands of God, but they cannot abide to ſuffer
of men, they are impatient when it is ſo: and what men muſt wee ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
of? the unjuſt, the wicked men: many can be contented to ſuffer at the
hands of good men; as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Let the righteous ſmite me, Lord;</hi> but
we muſt be contented to ſuffer of the unjuſt men, for Chriſt did not onely
ſuffer at the hands of God, but alſo of wicked men.</p>

               <list>

               </list>
               <p>The firſt thing is, the <hi>cup of Malediction,</hi> which our ſinnes tempered for
him: now ſee we what this bitter cup of Gods wrath, which Chriſt did
drinke, wrought in him: and here wee may conſider theſe three Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions:</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>Feare:</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>Hee began to be afraid;</hi> which was no ordinary or
common feare,<note place="margin">Affliction the curſe of our ſins wrought in Chriſt.</note> but a dreadfull horrible feare, ſuch a feare as <hi>Moſes</hi> had, for
which it is ſaid of him, <hi>Act.</hi> 7. 32. That <hi>hee trembled, and durſt not behold:</hi>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:17958:83"/>
And ſuch as <hi>David</hi> had, when he ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 120. <hi>My fleſh trembleth
for feare of thee, and I am afraid of thy judgements:</hi> ſo it was not an ordinary
feare, but an horrible and a dreadfull feare. At other times he was ſo full
of holy courage, and of an undaunted Spirit, that his Diſciples wonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
at it; for when they told him that the Iewes did lye in wait to deſtroy
him, he did not feare it; yet now he was horribly afraid; what was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of it? There were two things that made Chriſt ſo to feare:</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Two cauſes of Chriſts Feare.</note> becauſe <hi>he was to ſtand before God in judgement,</hi> clothed and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled
with our ſins: If he might have ſtood before God in his owne righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,
then there had beene no cauſe of feare;<note place="margin">1</note> but becauſe hee was to
ſtand before him clothed with our ſinnes, this made him afraid.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>He was afraid of death, which was neere at hand:</hi> Now he was
not afraid of death, as it was a diſſolution of nature, a ſeparation of the
ſoule from the body; but as it was joyned with the curſe of God: But let
us conſider theſe two cauſes of his feare a little better, and we ſhall finde
good matter of inſtruction in them.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> he was afraid to <hi>ſtand before God in judgement,</hi> clothed and apparel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with our ſinnes:<note place="margin">Cauſes of Feare.</note> this was a ſtrange thing, that he which was the Sonne
of God, and <hi>the brightneſſe of the glory of God,</hi> ſhould now be afraid to ſtand
before God. Now if he were afraid, how much more may we be to ſtand
before God in judgement, to come before him in prayer, to appeare in his
holy preſence? If the Sonne of God was afraid, then much more may we:
Indeed, if we have repented for our ſinnes, carried them over unto Chriſt,
and doe beleeve in him, then we may boldly ſtand before God in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and come before him in prayer, and approch into his holy preſence;
when we may ſay as <hi>David</hi> doth, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 26. <hi>Prove me, O Lord, and trie my
wayes;</hi> but if we have not repented of our ſins, nor carried them unto the
ſhoulders of Chriſt, if we doe not beleeve in him, then we have juſt cauſe
to be afraid. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. When <hi>Adam</hi> had committed but one ſinne, he was
afraid to come before God in judgement, and therefore hid himſelfe. If
<hi>Adam</hi> was ſo afraid when he had committed but one ſinne,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> how much
more ſhould we be to come before him, having committed many great
and grievous ſinnes? therefore howſoever we may carry away the matter
cloſely, and be quiet in our conſciences for a time, yet if God ſhould but
bring his judgements upon us, or death, ſo that we come to appeare before
God, then we ſhall quake and tremble; as <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. we ſee <hi>Belshazzar</hi> did,
who whileſt he was making himſelfe merry,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> drinking and abuſing the holy
veſſels of God, and the hand-writing did but appeare on the wall, quaked
exceedingly, ſo that <hi>his countenance was changed, his thoughts troubled, the
joynts of his loynes were looſed, his knees ſmote one againſt another:</hi> Even ſo,
howſoever the wicked may be at peace and quiet a little while, yet if God
ſet up a throne of judgement, then they will quake and be afraid to come
before him: In the <hi>Revelation</hi> we may ſee how the brave fellowes and gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
lads of this world, and the great captaines, howſoever they could car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
away the matter, and be at quiet for a little time; when God ſets up a
tribunall ſeat to judge them, they runne into caves and dens, and deſire
the hils and mountaines to fall upon them, to hide them from the preſence
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:17958:83"/>
of God: So howſoever we may be at quiet for a time, if we have not repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for our ſinnes; If God come to judge us, we ſhall quake and tremble,
and deſire the hils and mountaines to fall upon us, and to hide us from the
preſence of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>Chriſt was afraid of death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> which was neere at hand; So <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.
7. Chriſt is ſaid,<note place="margin">Cauſe of Chriſts Feare.</note> 
                  <hi>in the dayes of his fleſh, when he had offered up prayers and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications,
with ſtrong crying and teares unto him that was able to ſave him from
death:</hi> It appeares he was afraid of death, in that he prayed againſt it. I,
but was Chriſt afraid of death? we ſee that in the <hi>Revelation</hi> many of the
Saints of God loved not their lives, but did willingly embrace death: And
<hi>Act.</hi> 20. the Apoſtle <hi>Paul was not onely readie to bee bound for the name of
God, but to die for it:</hi> And therefore wee ſee many of the people of God
were not afraid of death how then was Chriſt afraid of it? I anſwer,
that death may be conſidered two ways:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. As it is a diſſolution of nature, and a ſeparation of the ſoule
from the bodie.</item>
                  <item>2. As it is joyned with the curſe and wrath of God.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Now Chriſt was not afraid of death, as it was a ſeparation of the ſoule
from the bodie, but as it was joyned with the wrath and curſe of God: thus
as it is a curſe, every man hath cauſe to be afraid of it, but if it be joyned
with the favour and love of God, then we have no cauſe of feare: <hi>Iohn</hi> 8.
Chriſts threatens the Iewes that <hi>they ſhould die in their ſins;</hi> Oh it is a fearful
thing when men die in their ſinnes, under the wrath and curſe of God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repentant
for them! There is a great cauſe why ſuch ſhould be afraid of
death; a number of people there be that are contented to die, and yet they
are covetous perſons, vile livers, ſwearers and drunkards; but I tell thee,
if thou haſt not repented for thy ſinnes, haſt not caried them unto Chriſt,
and applied his righteouſneſſe unto thee, thou haſt great cauſe to be afraid
of death: Pull the ſting out of the ſerpent,<note place="margin">Simile</note> and thou mayſt put him into thy
boſome, but if thou let his ſting alone, be will ſting thee: So death hath a
<hi>ſting,</hi> as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 55. which is <hi>ſinne;</hi> therefore let this ſting be taken away,
and then we have no cauſe to be afraid of death: But <hi>Revel.</hi> 20. 14. <hi>Death</hi>
is ſaid to goe before, and <hi>Hell</hi> to follow after, ſo that Hell is the tayle of
Death; and therefore wee have good cauſe to bee afraid thereof. <hi>Bernard</hi>
ſaith, If thou haſt put away all ſhame, which appertaineth to ſo noble a
a creature as thou art, if thou feele no ſorrow, as carnall men doe not, yet
caſt not away feare, which is found in every beaſt; Wee offer to load an
Aſſe,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> yet hee cares not for it, though wee weary him out, becauſe he is an
Aſſe, but if thou wouldſt thruſt him into the fire, or into a ditch, he would
avoid it as much as hee could, for that hee loveth life, and feareth death:
feare thou then, and be not more inſenſible than a beaſt; feare death, feare
judgement, feare hell.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Affliction that wrought in Chriſt,<note place="margin">2</note> was <hi>heavineſſe and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row;</hi>
and this not a common,<note place="margin">Affliction of Christ.</note> or an ordinary, but a dreadfull ſorrow. Now
what was the cauſe that Chriſt was thus ſorrowfull? I anſwer, there were
three cauſes of it:</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> becauſe he ſaw the face of God diſcomfortably to looke upon him,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:17958:84"/>
which was wont to ſhine upon him with an amiable and loving counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance;
he that was wont to looke ſo ſweetly upon him,<note place="margin">Three cauſes of Chriſts Sorrow.</note> now to ſee him as
an angry Iudge, and not as a loving Father: This was it that made him
ſorrowfull and heavie: The <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> looked upon him anger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
yet he was never moved at it; but when hee ſeeth Gods angry counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
towards him, this did more touch him, than all the bodily paines
that hee felt, for hee never complained of the ſpickes and nailes that were
thruſt into his hands and feet, nor of his whipping or buffetting, but when
he ſaw Gods angry countenance bent towards him, this made him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine
on the Croſſe, <hi>My God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> Of which wee
have two Vſes:</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> 
                  <hi>To priſe the favour of God above all things,</hi> and to joy in it, howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
men be diſpleaſed with us, to make little account of our eaſe, pleaſure,
and profits; but to priſe the love of God above all things, and to ſay with
<hi>David, Pſalm.</hi> 63. 3. <hi>Becauſe thy loving kindneſſe is better than life, my lips ſhall
praiſe thee:</hi> And <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 4. 6. <hi>Lord, lift thou up the light of thy countenance
upon us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, To <hi>mourne for the loſſe of Gods favour more than for the loſſe of
worldly friends,</hi> or for the loſſe of worldly goods or jewels: thus wee ſee
Chriſt did, he was ſorrowfull to ſee the angry countenance of God towards
him: <hi>Exod.</hi> 33. 4. we ſee when the Lord had told the people that an Angel
ſhould conduct them, but he would no more go before them, becauſe they
were a ſtiffenecked people, they <hi>were dejected, and no man put on his best ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note>
then <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid, <hi>If thy preſence goe not, carry us not hence:</hi> So a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
man muſt ſay, when he is going out of his doore, Lord, carry me not
from this place, unleſſe thy holy preſence goe with me; for if God be not
with us, we have juſt cauſe to be ſorrowfull and heavie: it is a pitifull thing
that men can weep and ſorrow for the loſſe of a wife, or a childe, or of ſome
worldly goods, but cannot weep for the loſſe of Gods favour; <hi>Iudg.</hi> 18. 24.
we ſee how <hi>Michah</hi> did weepe for the loſſe of a falſe god; when the ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
had taken away his gods, he runnes crying after them; and when they
asked him why he cried, ſaith he, <hi>Yee have taken away my gods, and now what
have I more?</hi> If <hi>Michah</hi> thus wept for the loſſe of his falſe gods, how much
more ſhould we weepe for the loſſe of the true God? And therefore men
have great cauſe to weepe when they have driven away God from them by
their ſinnes.</p>
               <p>The ſecond cauſe of Chriſts ſorrow,<note place="margin">2</note> was, <hi>To make expiation and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
for our ſinnes:</hi> becauſe all ſinnes are done and committed with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
therefore there muſt be ſorrow and heavineſſe, to make expiation
and ſatiſfaction for them; for it is a ruled caſe, That, <hi>as we doe commit ſinne
with delight,</hi> ſo <hi>there ſhould be ſorrow to make ſatiſfaction for it:</hi> therefore wee
are called often to weep and to mourne for our ſins; the greatneſſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
we may ſee, by the greatneſſe of the ſorrow that was in Chriſt; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we muſt grieve and ſorrow for our ſinnes, proportionably as Chriſt
hath grieved and ſorrowed for us; ſeeing whatſoever we ſhould have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,
he ſuffered for us.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>His ſorrow was, to leave us him for an example,</hi> that as he ſorrowed
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:17958:84"/>
for ſinne; ſo unleſſe we repent wee ſhall ſorrow and weepe too. Chriſt
ſorrowed and wept for other mens ſinnes; then wee have cauſe to ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
and weepe for our owne ſinnes, to grieve throughly for them; as
<hi>Hoſea</hi> 9. 1. ſaith the Lord,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> 
                  <hi>Rejoyce not O Israel, for joy as other people, for thou
haſt goe a whoring from thy God:</hi> So if we have ſinned againſt God, there
Is little cauſe why wee ſhould rejoyce, therefore, what muſt wee doe?
we muſt goe into the Garden with Chriſt, weepe along after him, fall
downe flat upon the ground before God, and never bee at reſt, till wee
have aſſurance to our ſoules that all our ſinnes are pardoned; for ſhall
Chriſt ſorrow for our ſins, and we never be moved? We ſee 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11.
when <hi>Vria</hi> came to <hi>David,</hi> hee bids him <hi>goe downe to his houſe and waſh his
feet,</hi> yet he would not, but ſlept at the doore of the Kings Palace; then
it was told <hi>David,</hi> who demanded of him, why hee went not downe
to his wife,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> his anſwer was, <hi>The Arke, and Iſrael, and Iuda abide in Tents,
and my Lord Ioab is in the field; ſhall I then goe into my houſe to eat and drinke?</hi>
&amp;c. So we muſt ſay, My Lord Ieſus is in the Garden, weeping, ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
ſweating, bleeding, and grovelling on the ground for my ſinnes;
and ſhall I live then in delight? Nay, I will ſorrow and weepe for them,
for ſinne will coſt ſorrow, either here, or in hell; therefore, better it
were to weepe for them here in earth, when we may have comfort and
hope, than to weepe for them in hell, where wee ſhall never have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort;
for ſinne is like to a legge that is out of joynt,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> that cannot be ſet
without great griefe and ſorrow.</p>
               <p>The third Affliction;<note place="margin">3</note> that which was wrought in Chriſt, was <hi>aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or an amazedneſſe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Affliction of Chriſt.</note> 
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 38. the Greeke word doth ſignifie, that
he was in a great perplexity, that he knew not whither to goe, nor what
to ſay, nor how to winde out himſelfe, ſuch an aſtoniſhment there was,
and ſuch amazedneſſe in the holy ſoule of Chriſt; what was the reaſon
of it? becauſe the curſe of God was to come upon him for our ſinnes.
Oh thinke of this! this was that which did ſo amaze and perplex
him; therefore if he was thus troubled and perplexed to thinke of the
curſe of God which hee was to undergoe, what ſhall become of us,
what perplexitie and amazement ſhall we be in when we ſhall ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God, we ſhall hardly know what to doe, or where to winde or turne
our ſelves, but wee ſhall deſire the hils and mountaines to fall upon us,
and to cover us from the preſence of God, and from his angrie counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance:
And therefore let every man be afraid to live in his ſinnes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
repentance, and never let him looke for hope of eaſe, unleſſe he doe
repent and turne to God; here wee have twenty trickes to put off the
Law, and to ſhift that, but when wee ſhall ſtand before God, wee ſhall
have no ſhifts to excuſe the matter.</p>

downe,</hi> but the other, that he <hi>fell downe</hi> flat upon the
ground on his face: this is a ſtrange thing, that
Christ fell downe on the ground not able to beare
our ſinnes, whereas, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 1. 1. <hi>Hee is able to beare up heaven and earth with
his mighty Word:</hi> And yet the heavie burthen of our ſinnes preſſed him
downe to the ground: Many a man makes a ſleight matter of ſinne, but
it is the heavieſt burthen that may be; for all other burthens Chriſtian
patience can beare, as blindneſſe, ſickneſſe, loſſe of goods, or ſuch like,
but the burthen of ſin maketh the ſtouteſt man to ſtoope; as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38. 4.

               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> ſeeing that ſinne is ſuch a burthen, that Chriſt is not able to
beare it, we ſhould be afraid to deale with it; and therefore before we
meddle with ſin,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> we ſhould doe as Porters doe, that are to carry a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
they will firſt peyſe it, and feele whither they be able to beare it,
and if they be not, it ſhall not come on their backes: ſo before we med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
with ſinne, wee ſhould peyſe and feele the burthen of it, and ſince it
is ſuch an intolerable burt hen: we would take heede how we meddle
with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:17958:85"/>
Secondly,<note place="margin">SER. XIV.</note> ſeeing ſinne is ſuch a heavy burthen, that it made Chriſt to
fall upon the ground;<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> not being able to ſtand under the burthen of it,
wee muſt take heed wee doe not adde to the burthen of Chriſt: now
by every ſinne we commit, we doe adde to this burthen, and when wee
ſee Chriſt lying under the burthen of our ſinnes what doe wee? doe
we ſeeke to eaſe him of his burthen? No, we commit one ſinne to day,
and another to morrow; and ſo wee adde from time to time, to make
more heavy the burthen that Chriſt bare for us; for there is great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
betweene the ſinnes that the <hi>Heathen commit,</hi> and thoſe of a
Chriſtian, for the ſinnes of Chriſtians they be upon the backe of Chriſt,
but the ſinnes that the <hi>Heathen</hi> commit, they reſt upon themſelves. <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od.</hi>
23. the Lord ſaith, <hi>that if a man ſeeth his enemies Aſſe under a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
hee is commanded to helpe him up:</hi> now if we be bound to ſhew mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to a beaſt, much more to Chriſt, therefore we muſt take heed that we
doe not adde to the burthen of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, ſeeing Chriſt was burthened with our ſinnes we muſt feele
the burthen of them too: it is a marvellous thing,<note place="margin">Vſe 3.</note> that we never feele
the burthen of them, nor be not touched for them: Of which there be
three Reaſons:</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Two reaſons why ſinne ſeemes ſo light.</note> becauſe ſinne is in <hi>ſuo loco,</hi> in <hi>the place of ſinne;</hi> for as the <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers</hi>
ſay, <hi>No Element is heavy or burthenſome in his owne place:</hi> as in the
Sea,<note place="margin">1</note> let a man bee in the bottome of it; although hee hath the whole
Sea on his backe,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> yet hee feeles it not; but let him take up a bucket full
out of the Sea, out of his place, and then he ſhall feele how heavy it is:
ſo wee doe not feele the weight of ſinne in us, becauſe this place is the
place of ſinne, but let a man be taken out of this life, let him be brought
before Gods judgement barre, and then we ſhall feele the weight and
burthen of ſinne.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>becauſe of the deadneſſe, and inſenſibility of our conſcience,
Epheſ.</hi> 2. 1. (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>Yee who were dead in treſpaſſes and ſinnes:</hi>
we know if a man bee dead,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> we may tumble a houſe downe upon him,
and he will not feele it; ſo becauſe we be dead in ſinnes and treſpaſſes,
this is the reaſon, why wee cannot feele the burthen of sinne in us, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it be a great weight and burthen.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>becauſe we looke upon the face and not upon the tayle of ſinne;</hi> upon
the pleaſures and delights of it, but not upon the tayle thereof, that is,
to the puniſhment which ſhall follow: the pleaſures of ſin may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to the ſtreames of <hi>Iordan,</hi> a pleaſant ſtreame, wherein the fiſh
tooke great delight,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> play, leape, ſkip, and friſke; but at laſt it carrieth
them into the dead Sea, and ſo are killed; ſo men delight themſelves as
it were with the ſtreames of <hi>Iordan,</hi> the pleaſures and delights of ſin, but
it carrieth them into the dead ſea, to hell and deſtruction: therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
men looke on the face of ſinne, and not on the taile therof, this is
the Reaſon why they feele it not.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing that was obſerved, was, the carriage of Chriſt in
<hi>Prayer;</hi> wherein we are to conſider two things:</p>
               <list>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:17958:86"/>
                  <item>1. What Hee praied for.</item>
                  <item>2. The limitation of his prayer.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Firſt, what Chriſt Praied for.</note> 
                  <hi>what he prayed for:</hi> that <hi>this cup might paſſe from him:</hi> we are not
to thinke, that this cup was a materiall cup, but the cup of Gods wrath
which he was to drinke, and which our ſinnes had tempered; that cup
that <hi>David</hi> ſpeaketh of <hi>Pſal.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> 75. 8. every ſinne is like a drop of poyſon,
put into this cup for Chriſt to drinke; if a childe ſhould goe into a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
and gather rue,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> wormewood, and a number of bitter things; and
temper a cup with them, and give them to his father to drinke, this
childe might bee condemned at every bodies hands; ſo we may be cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
in that we temper a cup, not for our father to drinke, but for Chriſt
our Saviour and Redeemer; the <hi>Iewes</hi> gave him gall and vinegar to
drinke, but wee give him a cup tempered with our ſinnes, more bitter
than gall: therefore we muſt pray to God to forgive us and remember
that when we ſinne, wee are tempering a cup for Chriſt to drinke; and
as Chriſt prayed, that God would take away the cup from him, ſo muſt
wee, for if it bee not taken away from us; wee are like to drinke it our
ſelves.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing obſerved in his prayer is,<note place="margin">Secondly, the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation of his Prayer.</note> 
                  <hi>the limitation of it, Father,
not as I will, but as thou wilt:</hi> Hee had a deſire indeede that the cup might
paſſe away from him, but with this limitation; if it were the will of
God, for if it had paſſed from him, it had come to thee, and to me. Now
as Chriſt prayed with limitation, ſo muſt wee doe; when wee ſee any
croſſe or affliction is ready to light on us, wee may pray to God againſt
it, but it muſt bee with limitation if it bee his good will; therefore this
doth check the world that whatſoever they pray for, they muſt have
it, without any limitation at Gods hands or elſe they are impatient.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Thirdly, the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Chriſts Afflictions.</note> wee have to conſider <hi>the wonderfull, marvellous and ſtrange ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
that it wrought:</hi> which was that the preſſure and burthen of our ſins
cauſed Chriſt to ſweat, not an ordinary ſweat as wee doe, but to ſweat
blood, and that not thinne but thick and congealed blood; beſides it
was not in a ſparing manner, but in ſuch abundance, that it came through
his garments, and left the markes and prints behinde upon the ground:
ſuch was the weight and burthen of our ſinnes, that it made him to
ſweat on this manner as we have heard; and that not when he was in the
warme houſe, but in the garden, cold ayre, on cold ground, and in ſuch
a cold time, as <hi>Peter</hi> was glad to creepe to the fire to warme him. All
this doth ſhew the ſtrangeneſſe of this effect; which made ſome thinke
it could not be true, but wee may ſee that all the ancient Fathers of the
Church read it ſo, ever from the Apoſtles time, as <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> and <hi>Athanaſius,</hi>
and divers others, as alſo it agrees with the love of Chriſt towards us;
and therefore ſeeing it hath been thus read of all the ancient Fathers in
the Church, and is agreeable to the love that Chriſt ſhewes to us, wee
are to make no doubt of it. In the ſweating of Chriſt obſerve foure
things:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Who was the procuring cauſe of it.</item>
                  <item>

2. The cariage of Chriſt in it.</item>
                  <item>3. The manner of it.</item>
                  <item>4. The end.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Firſt, the procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Cauſe.</note> 
                  <hi>what was the procuring cauſe;</hi> it was His <hi>Agonie:</hi> (Agonie doth
ſignifie in Greeke, a combate, or a conflict) now this ſame conflict
which Chriſt had, was not with any earthly power, but with God; and
this was the cauſe of his ſweating: before Chriſt had a combate with
feare and ſorrow in the garden; he had wreſtled with the devill, being
tempted by him, and with the Prieſts in the temple; now he is come to
combate and have a conflict with God. Which may teach us, that if we
live in our ſins, and doe not repent of them, and put them off to Chriſt,
we ſhall have an agonie too; for we ſhall not only have the devill, and
an evill and bad conſcience to combate with, but wee ſhall have God
himſelfe to fight againſt us:<note place="margin">Sin</note> as <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. 16. <hi>Repent or elſe I will come againſt
thee ſhortly, and will fight againſt thee, with the ſword of my mouth;</hi> ſo that if
men doe not repent, they ſhall not onely have the devill, and an evill
conſcience, to combate and conflict with, but God himſelfe: and this
is the ſorest combate that can be, to have Him to fight againſt them; it
is a great matter for one to have a combate with the devill, and for a
poore man to have a combate with a great power; but a farre greater
matter, to have a conflict with God. We ſee that a Chriſtian had neede
of a great deale of faith, wiſedome and patience; for he hath not onely
his ſinnes and the devill to conflict with, but God to fight againſt him;
therefore wee had need to take <hi>Pauls</hi> counſell, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6. <hi>To take to us the
whole Armour of God,</hi> to be armed in every part, <hi>for</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>wee wreſtle
not againſt fleſh and blood, but againſt principalities and powers, &amp;c.</hi> a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
hath not to doe with weake and fraile men onely, but with the devill,
yea and many times with the Lord himſelfe, who doth combate with
us: therefore that wee may ſtand at that houre how ought we to be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
and to have the gifts of the Spirit?</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing obſerved was,<note place="margin">Secondly, the carriage of Chriſt.</note> 
                  <hi>the carriage of Chriſt in this eſtate;</hi>
it is ſaid, <hi>he prayed the more earneſtly:</hi> the more hee felt himſelfe preſſed
and burthened with our ſinnes, the more earneſtly hee prayed. Which
may teach us that the ſorer our temptations, and the greater our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts
bee, the ſtronger muſt be our endeavour to reſiſt them, the more
earneſt our prayer; we muſt ſtrengthen our faith, and renew our repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
that ſo we may ſtand in the temptation.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> I have ſhewed you here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
that little Bees in a ſtorme or tempeſt, catch up little ſtones in
their clawes, to ballance themſelves againſt the winde and ſtorme, that
ſo they be not carried away with ſtorme or tempeſt; ſo Chriſtians muſt
do, when there is a tempeſt up, get little ſtones, as it were, in our clawes,
get faith and repentance renewed, pray the more earneſtly, that ſo wee
be not carried away with the temptation, and overcome with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict:
many a Chriſtian complaines, that he is troubled with evill moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that hee cannot reſt, nor bee at quiet; and ſome complaine of the
deadneſſe of their hearts, and inſenſibleneſſe of them; now in this caſe
what muſt bee done? the ſorer the temptation is, the greater muſt bee
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:17958:87"/>
the indeavour to reſiſt it; therefore we ſhould be the more earneſt with
God in prayer; and apply our ſelves to the uſe of good meanes, that ſo
wee may not bee carried away with the temptation: if a tree begin to
dye at the top,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> the way to helpe it is not to pick away the moulds from
the rootes, for this is the way to kill it quite, but to lay freſh moulds to
the roots: ſo if a Chriſtian begin to droope, the way to recover him is
not to withdraw himſelfe from the meanes, but to apply himſelfe to it,
to pray, read, meditate, heare the word preached, and to receive the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments.<note place="margin">2 King. 8. 29.</note>
When <hi>Iehoram</hi> was wounded of the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> he turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Iezreel</hi> to bee healed of his wounds: ſo a Chriſtian muſt doe, when
he feeles himſelfe to be wounded, in his love, faith, care, or in his pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
what muſt hee doe, but returne to the uſe of good meanes, to bee
healed againe in his love, and in his patience, and in his grace.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Firſt, He did ſweat.</note> 
                  <hi>the manner of his ſweat:</hi> and this is declared in theſe five cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances:
firſt, it is ſaid that he did ſweat; the Philoſophers ſay, that
all ſweating ariſeth from too much labour or paine, for nature being
preſſed above her ſtrength doth cauſe ſweating; therefore ſo long as a
man doth not exceede the power and ability of his nature, hee doth not
ſweat, but when hee is preſſed above his ſtrength that makes him ſweat.
<hi>Gen.</hi> 3. ſaith the Lord to <hi>Adam, Thou ſhalt eate thy bread in the ſweat of
thy face:</hi> why did not <hi>Adam</hi> labour before this? Yes, but the labour
which he had before, was a delightfull, not a painefull or penall labour;
ſo Chriſt being preſſed with the burthen of our ſnnes, and the weight
of them, this made Him to ſweat, Chriſt could have borne the heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the earth on his backe without ſweating, but our ſinnes did ſo
preſſe and burthen Him, and the weight thereof was ſo heavy that it
made him to ſweat. It is a wonderous thing, that Chriſt ſhould thus
ſweat under the burthen of our ſinnes, and wee goe away and feele no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
well, ſinne will either coſt ſweating heere, or in hell, better it
were to ſweat for them here, where wee may have an end of ſweating,
than in hell where there will be no end.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Secondly, blood.</note> 
                  <hi>He did ſweat blood;</hi> Philoſophers ſay, that a man may not
onely ſweat water but blood; as a man being ſtung with a ſerpent: but
Chriſt did ſweat blood, when there was no hand to touch him, nothing
but the ſerpent of our ſinnes to ſting Him.</p>
               <p>The uſe is,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> for our example; that if Chriſt did ſweat blood for our
ſinnes, then our conſciences ſhould bleede, in the conſideration of them:
I have ſhewed you heretofore, that if a man be ſlaine, bring the partie
that killed the dead man into the place where he is,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and his wounds will
bleed afreſh againe; now we be the men that have ſlaine Chriſt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when wee come to the Lords table, there is the remembrance of
the dead body of Chriſt; therefore although Chriſts body doe not
bleed, yet when wee come there againe, let our ſoules and conſciences
bleed, in the conſideration that our ſinnes cauſed Chriſt to ſweat blood;
<hi>Pſalm.</hi> 119. ſaith <hi>David, Mine eyes guſhed out with rivers of teares, becauſe
men kept not thy Lawes;</hi> now if <hi>David</hi> did weepe for other mens ſinnes,
how ought we to weepe for our owne?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:17958:87"/>
Secondly, in that Chriſt did ſweat bloud, it ſets forth the infinite love
of God to us,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> that hee thought nothing too deare to redeeme us with:
The Devill could ſay, <hi>Iob</hi> 2. 40. <hi>Skin for ſkin, and all that a man hath will hee
give for his life;</hi> but Chriſt was content to part with his life, to ſweat out
his heart-bloud and his life-bloud to doe us good; therefore let us not
thinke much to doe any thing that he commands us.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> that he did not ſweat thinne bloud, but it was <hi>thicke bloud;</hi>
Phyſitians ſay,<note place="margin">Thicke bloud.</note> that in ſome extremitie, a man may ſweat bloud, but it is
thinne bloud; as a man being put to a fearefull death in <hi>Paris,</hi> the feare
and horrour of it made the man to caſt forth thinne bloud: All that a
man ſuffers, is for his owne ſinnes, but the puniſhment that Chriſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,
was for the ſinnes of all:<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 1.</note> therefore, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> adviſes, <hi>Let us
caſt away everything that preſſeth downe, and the ſin that hangeth ſo faſt on,</hi> &amp;c.
Phyſitians ſay, there bee ſome things, which if a man take, they will
ſoake into the fleſh, and that they cannot be voided without ſweating;
ſo ſinne ſoakes into our fleſh, that it cannot be voided, but Chriſt muſt
ſweat bloud to drive it out;<note place="margin">Iob 15. 16.</note> and yet man <hi>drinketh in ſinne and iniquitie like
water,</hi> as <hi>Iob</hi> ſpeaketh; which may teach us, that it is a hard matter to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
and to bring a man into favour with God; there is no man able to
doe it, no not the holieſt man that is, as <hi>David</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49. 8. <hi>None
of them can by any meanes redeeme his brother, nor give God a ranſome for him,
for the redemption of their ſoule is precious.</hi> Chriſt muſt not ſweat water, but
bloud, and thicke bloud, even cloders of bloud for it, as I ſhewed you in
the morning; all the bloud of the Martyrs, and of the holy men are not
able to free us of our ſinne, if it ſhould be gathered all together in a ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
but it muſt coſt Chriſt his life and his bloud, to reconcile and bring
us into favour againe; therefore we ſee it is not a ſmall, but a great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to reconcile and free us from the leaſt ſinne.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4</note> 
                  <hi>It ran thorow his garments; Eſay</hi> 63. the Prophet wonders at
Chriſt,<note place="margin">It ran thorow his garments.</note> that he returnes from the paſſion of his ſufferings with his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
died in bloud, ſaying <hi>Who is this that commeth from Edom, with died
garments from Boſrah.</hi> Now as the garments of Chriſt were died in
bloud, ſo our conſciences muſt be waſhed and dipped in his bloud, or
elſe we are not accepted of God: <hi>Revel.</hi> 7. 13. there is an anſwer made
to a queſtion; one of the Elders aſked, <hi>Who are theſe which are arrayed in
white long Robes?</hi> Anſwer was made; <hi>Theſe are they which came out of great
tribulation, and have waſhed their long Robes, and made them white in the bloud
of the Lambe:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> So we muſt waſh our Robes in the bloud of Chriſt, and
then we ſhall be glorious and beautifull in his ſight; we reade, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.
when they killed the Paſchall lambe, they tooke the bloud thereof and
ſprinkled it on the doore-poſts,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> that when the Angell of deſtruction
ſhould come and finde the ſame on the doore-poſts, he might paſſe ouer
them: So if wee can get but a few drops of the bloud of Chriſt into
our hearts, and beſprinkle them, the Angell of deſtruction will paſſe
by us.</p>
               <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5</note> 
                  <hi>It ran downe to the ground,</hi> in a plentifull manner, ſo that if one
had come many houres after,<note place="margin">It ran on the ground.</note> he might have found the marks and prints
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:17958:88"/>
of his bloud, that one who had come after might have ſaid, Loe, here
is the place where Ieſus Chriſt, my bleſſed Saviour and Redeemer, was
humbled for my ſinnes; where he being in an agony, did ſweat bloud,
here be the markes and prints of it: All this is to give us example, that
as he left the markes and prints of his humility, wee ſhould alſo leave
markes and prints of our repentance and places of our prayer, that a man
may ſay, when he ſeeth the place againe, here I did repent my ſins, here I
prayed to God, and in ſuch a place I was humbled: thus we muſt labour
to leave markes and footings of our obedience in our houſes, gardens,
and places where we be;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> as <hi>Acts</hi> 9. when <hi>Dorcas</hi> was dead, her friends
<hi>ſhewed the garments that ſhe had made</hi> for the poore; thus ſhe left marks and
prints behinde her: so the woman in the Goſpell, ſhe brought a box of
Oyntment, and powred it on the head of Chriſt; therefore Chriſt tels
her, <hi>Whereſoever this Goſpell is preached, that ſhee hath done ſhall be ſpoken of for
a memoriall of her.</hi> A number live in the world, but where is the markes
and prints of their goodneſſe, faith, repentance? The <hi>Iewes</hi> ſaid of the
<hi>Centurion, that he did build them a Synagogue:</hi> Thus he left a print of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
behinde him. There be a number that leave markes and prints be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde
them, but what are they? of drunkenneſſe, prophaneneſſe, diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
of contention in ſetting men together by the eares: it is ſaid of the
Devill,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> that he leaves a ſtinke behinde him; ſo it may be ſaid of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
that they leave a ſtinke and a bad ſavour behinde them; but wee
muſt not leave ſuch behinde us, ours muſt be markes and prints of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and grace, of love, patience, and ſuch like.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing that Chriſt ſuffered from God was <hi>Deſertion,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The ſecond thing Chriſt ſuffered from God on the Croſſe.</note> 
                  <hi>or a
forſaking on the Croſſe;</hi> which was ſuch a griefe as made him bitterly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine;
all the other things hee ſuffered with ſilence and patience, but
this made him crie out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee?</hi> He
never complained when they crucified him, whipt him, ſet a crowne of
thornes on his head, and nailed his hands and feet on the croſſe; but
when he ſaw Gods angry countenance towards him, that God was in
ſhew departed from him, becaſue of our ſins, this made him complaine.
And this may teach us, that above all things, it is the greateſt griefe to a
Chriſtian, to finde that God is departed from him; all other troubles a
man may endure, but when God hath taken away his grace, this may
make one bitterly to complaine: So wee ſee <hi>Saul</hi> complaines of this to
<hi>Samuel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam, 28. 15.</note> (ſaith hee) <hi>The Philiſtines be come upon me, and God is departed from
me;</hi> it were nothing for to have all the world to forſake him, if God did
not; but if God forſake a man, where is his comfort? Now that which
Chriſt ſuffered of God on the croſſe, is ſhewed two wayes:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. By the Cauſe.</item>
                  <item>2. By the Effects.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The firſt <hi>Cauſe</hi> was the darkening of the Sunne upon him,<note place="margin">The firſt cauſe.</note> the <hi>Effect</hi>
was the bitter complaint that he makes, that God had forſaken him; as
if he ſhould ſay, It doth not grieve me, that my Diſciples or my kindred
(notwithſtanding the kindneſſe and love that I have ſhewed them) or
that my mother hath forſaken me; but this is that which grieved me, that
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:17958:88"/>
my good Father hath forſaken me for the ſinnes of my people. O let us
thinke of this, that it is the heavieſt diſtreſſe that can befall us, to have
God departed from us; therefore howſoever our friends forſake us, and
the world leave us, yet take heed that God doth not depart from us: It
was <hi>Davids</hi> comfort, that although his father and mother ſhould forſake
him, yet <hi>God would not forſake him;</hi> ſo this muſt uphold us, that although
our friends and kindred forſake us, yet God will not; for if God ſhould,
what comfort can we have?</p>
               <p>But what was the cauſe of it? the apprehenſion of the fearefull dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the Sunne three houres together, almoſt all the time of his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
from twelve a clocke till three. Now in this darkneſſe of the Sun,
we may obſerve three things:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The Manner of it.</item>
                  <item>2. The Cauſe of it.</item>
                  <item>3. The End of it.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>the manner of the darkneſſe;</hi> it was at twelve a clock, at the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the day,<note place="margin">The manner of it.</note> at noone time: ſecondly, it was of long continuance,
almoſt all the time of his paſſion: thirdly, it was not onely about the
Croſſe, and in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> but all the Land over. There is ſome difference
amongſt Divines about the extenſion of the darkneſſe, ſome hold it was
all the Land of <hi>Iudah</hi> ouer, ſome all the world over; <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith, that
this heavie hap, that the Sunne was darkened all the world over, (at the
time of the Paſſion of Chriſt) was put into a booke at <hi>Rome,</hi> and alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the <hi>Grecians</hi> it was ſo reported of; ſo likewiſe S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſaith,
that this darkneſſe was not in the Land of <hi>Iudah,</hi> but all over the world:
And this was the manner of the darkneſſe.</p>
               <p>Now this darkneſſe muſt put us in minde of the fearful darkneſſe that
ſhall cover the faces of the wicked,<note place="margin">Vſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> if they doe not repent; for as Chriſts
face was covered in the brighteſt time of the day, ſo ſhall their faces be
covered, when things ſhould be at the beſt with them, even when they
be at the height of their glory: <hi>Amos</hi> 8. 9. <hi>In that day, ſaith the Lord God,
I will even cauſe the Sun to go downe at noone-day, and will darken the earth in the
cleere day;</hi> ſo that in the middeſt of their joy, and in the middeſt of their
glory, the Lord will bring darkneſſe upon them, and ſo daſh all their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and joy; <hi>Prov.</hi> 13. 9. it is ſaid, <hi>God will put out the candle of the wicked.</hi>
And (for example) we ſee <hi>Haman</hi> when he was at the top of the Kings
favour, and in his chiefeſt glory, then the Sunne was darkned upon him,
he was taken and hanged on the gallowes which he had ſet up for <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decai;</hi>
ſo likewiſe, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. when <hi>Balthaſar</hi> was drinking, tipling and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſing
in the veſſels of the houſe of God, and preſently the hand-wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
appeared on the wall, and writ his deſtruction that night, hee that
was ſo merry, was killed: So, <hi>Luke.</hi> 12. 20. the <hi>rich man</hi> in the Goſpell,
hee would goe build his barnes greater, when preſently there came a
voice unto him, <hi>Thou foole, this might ſhall they take away thy ſoule;</hi> even ſo
all the wicked men of the world, that are not carefull to give glory un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God, when they be in the top of their mirth and of their pleaſure;
all their mirth ſhall be turned into ſorrow, their glory into ſhame, their
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:17958:89"/>
peace into trouble: So we ſee <hi>Herod, Act.</hi> 12. when he was in ſhining ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell,
and had made an Oration to the people, who cried out, <hi>The voice
of God, and not of man;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> becauſe he was not careful <hi>to give glory unto God, the
Angell ſtrooke him</hi> with a lothſome diſeaſe, he was eaten of wormes, and
ſo died. Thus the Lord will darken our comfort, if we doe not repent;
for if God brought darkneſſe on his Sonne, then hee will much more
bring it on the wicked for ever:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> If a poore man have an houſe; and the
Sunne doe ſhine in comfortably to refreſh him, and his children that be
about him; if the ſame man take a veile and hang betweene the Sunne
and the houſe, he doth deprive himſelfe and his children of the comfort
of the Sunne; ſo God if he doth ſhine comfortably upon us, and wee
take the veile of our ſinnes and hang up, what doe wee but deprive our
ſelves of thoſe comforts and joyes which wee might have had, and ſo
bring darkneſſe upon our ſelves. Now this darkneſſe that ſhall come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the wicked, although they may eſcape it in this life, yet they ſhall be
ſure of it at the day of Iudgement: So it is ſaid, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. <hi>Take the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
ſervant, binde him hand and foot, and caſt him into utter darkneſſe:</hi>
And therefore, howſoever the wicked may goe on in joy for a ſeaſon,
and be partakers of the light of the Sunne, of the Moone, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
comforts; yet the time ſhall come, that neither the light of the
Sunne or Moone, nor any Star or candle ſhall be any comfort to them;
as we may ſee in <hi>Exodus,</hi> what a fearefull darkneſſe there was over the
Land of <hi>Aegypt</hi> three dayes together, that they could not goe one to
another; but how much more fearefull darkneſſe ſhall that be, that ſhall
not laſt onely three dayes together, but for ever and ever: therefore let
us pray to God, and repent of our ſinnes, get faith in Chriſt, that we may
be delivered from this fearefull darkneſſe that ſhall come upon the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
and ungodly.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">The ſecond cauſe of it.</note> 
                  <hi>The cauſe of this darkneſſe;</hi> It was not by any naturall cauſe,
but by the hand of God, which I will prove by two Reaſons:</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Reaſon 1.</note> becauſe there is no eclipſe of the Sunne, but it comes by the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of the Moone, for the body of the Moone comming betweene the
light of the Sunne and us,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> makes the eclipſe; as the hand of a man being
held betweene the light of a candle and his owne eyes, doth hide away
the light of the candle from his eyes; ſo the body of the Moone com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
betweene the Sunne and us, makes the Sunne to be eclipſed: Now
the Moone comes not neere the Sunne, but when ſhee changes, but this
was when the Moone was at the full, and in a perfect diameter to the
Sunne; for we know that the Iewes <hi>Paſſeover</hi> was kept in the full of the
Moone, therefore it was no naturall cauſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Reaſon 2.</note> it was no eclipſe of the Sunne, for the Moone could take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
but part of the light, becauſe the Sunne is bigger by many degrees
than the Moone; ſo then there was no naturall cauſe of this darkneſſe,
but it was onely the hand of God that did reſtraine it, even as he did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine
the heat of the fire, when the three Children were caſt into the
firy furnace; there was fire, but God reſtrained the heat thereof, that it
could not burne; ſo, there was the Sunne at that time, but God reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:17958:89"/>
the light of it three houres together: Againe, (as the Philoſophers
ſay) the ſecond cauſe cannot work without the vertue of the firſt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if the firſt ceaſe,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> the ſecond muſt needs ceaſe; as we ſee in a clocke,
if there be a ſtand in the great wheeles, there muſt needs be a ſtay in the
leſſer, becauſe the great wheeles carry about the little ones; ſo (as I may
ſay) God is as the great wheele that carrieth about the creatures, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when there is a ſtay or an ceſſation in God, there muſt needs bee a
ſtay and ceſſation in the creatures.</p>
               <p>This therefore ſhould make us afraid to ſin againſt God and diſpleaſe
him, becauſe hee is able in a moment to deſtroy all the creatures, or to
reſtraine them; therefore wee have cauſe to be afraid to offend or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe
him:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> we ſee how afraid men be to ſinne againſt the King and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
him, who yet can but kill the body; but God is able to kill both
foule and body, and caſt them into hell fire: All the Kings are not able
to reſtraine the influence of the heavenly bodies, but God we ſee is able
to doe it; he can reſtraine (as <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith) the influence of the <hi>Pleiades</hi> and
<hi>Orion;</hi> And therefore how afraid ſhould we be to ſnne againſt him? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
ſo much the more, becauſe we have made a covenant with God of
new obedience; we ſee if a man have given one a peece of gold or ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
upon a condition, that if he doe ſuch and ſuch things, hee ſhall dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
the gold;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> if he be tempted, he will ſay, I dare not doe it, becauſe I am
bound to the contrary; ſo, if we be inticed to any ſinne, we ſhould ſay,
I dare not doe ſo, becauſe I am bound to the contrary; if a man ſet a
bowle well at the firſt, it is like to runne well, but if it be not ſet well,
it cannot poſſibly runne well; ſo if we ſet our ſelves in a good courſe at
the firſt, it is like we ſhall continue well, but if we doe not, how is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
we ſhould come in a good courſe?</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>The end of it:</hi> Some ſay the Sunne was darkened, becauſe it
was aſhamed to behold the death of the Sonne of God;<note place="margin">The end of the Darkneſſe.</note> and therefore
was darkened, even as <hi>Hagar</hi> would not ſee the death of her childe;
ſome ſay that the end was to deterre the <hi>Iewes</hi> from the death of Chriſt:<note place="margin">Simile.</note>
As a man when he would not have his ſervant to leave worke, he will
not put out the candle; ſo ſay they, it was to keepe the Iewes from ſo
vile a thing, as to kill the Sonne of God, therefore the Sunne was dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
but in my minde there is another end (howſoever theſe may bee
probable) and that is this, that ſeeing Chriſt was to ſuffer for us, and for
our ſins, therefore God did darken the Sun upon him: To teach us that
we deſerve not to have the light of the Sunne, Moone, or Stars to ſhine
on us; therefore, when as we looke upon our gardens, wives, children,
lands or goods, we muſt confeſſe and ſay, O Lord, we deſerve that thou
ſhouldeſt have wrapped up all in darkneſſe, and that we ſhould not have
any light, to have ſeene any thy bleſſings: This ſhould ſtirre us up to
be thankfull to God for the light of the Sunne, Moone and Starres, yea,
for the light of a candle, even for the leaſt light we enjoy.</p>

                  <q>And about the ninth houre, Jeſus cried with a
loud voice, ſaying, Eli, Eli, lameſabachthani, that
is to ſay, My God, my God, why haſt thou forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
mee?</q>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the Goſpell, when our Saviour had fed five
thouſand people with five loaves and two fiſhes,
he bids them gather up the fragments, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
be loſt: So we ſhould doe in the ſufferings
of Chriſt, gather them up ſo that nothing bee
loſt, never a drop of bloud that hee ſhed in the
Garden, never a ſigh or ſobbe, or word on the
Croſſe ſhould fall to the ground; this muſt bee
our care, as alſo that we get cleane hearts and ſoules to keepe all in.</p>
               <p>That which Chriſt ſuffered at the hands of God was two-fold; In
the Garden, and on the Croſſe, of which we have ſpoken.</p>
               <p>The next thing we are to ſpeake of is,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>the bitter complaint of Chriſt
on the croſſe;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The effect of Chriſts ſuffering on the Croſſe.</note> wherein two things are to be conſidered:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The time when he complained.</item>
                  <item>2. What hee complained of.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The <hi>time</hi> may be conſidered in <hi>three particulars:</hi> Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
<hi>at the ninth houre of the day,</hi> after the fearefull darkeneſſe, there
was none of the ſouldiers, that complained, nor any of the Ieweſ that
were moved with it; but we ſee Chriſt complaines, when he ſaw how
the wrath of God came againſt him for our ſinnes. Which muſt teach
us that though the world be not moved, nor touched with the preſent
judgements that bee upon them, yet wee ſhould take them to heart, and
labour to make a good uſe of them: the Prophet complaines of this;
<hi>Thou haſt ſmitten them, and they have not mourned, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Ierem.</hi> 8. 6. <hi>I.
harkened and heard, that they ſpake not aright; no man repented him of his
wickedneſſe, ſaying, What have I done:</hi> And <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>Every morning doth he
bring his judgements to light, he faileth not, but the wicked will not learne to bee
aſhamed.</hi> There is not one day that commeth over our heads; but there
is one judgment or other, that befals our ſelves, or others; therefore
howſoever others are not moved at it, nor take it to heart, yet wee
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:17958:90"/>
ſhould:<note place="margin">SER. XV.</note> there be a number of ſtrange judgements come upon us from
time to time, which though the wicked let ſlip and never regard, yet
the people of God muſt be wiſe to make a good uſe both of the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that come upon themſelves and others:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> if a man heare the kings
writs bee out againſt him; will he let the matter alone? No: but hee
will make agreement, or elſe hee knoweth it will come to a greater
charge: ſo the judgements of God are Gods writs (as it were) what,
ſhall we let them alone? No, but agree quickly, leſt it coſt us a great
deale of paines and labour afterwards.</p>
               <p>But what was it that made Chriſt complaine? It was in him the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of grace that brought it home to his heart:<note place="margin">Queſt. Sol.</note> in like manner if the
power of grace be in our hearts, it will teach us to make a good uſe of all
the judgements of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> hee complained <hi>on the croſſe,</hi> it was not in the garden; for
there was ſome diſtance of time, betweene that which Chriſt ſuffered
on the croſſe, and that in the garden, ſo that hee did not ſuffer all his
paines at one time, but there was ſome ſpace and intermiſſion betweene
them: which muſt teach us, that it is the Goodneſſe and Mercy of
God, that all our afflictions come not upon us at one time, but there is a
ſpace betweene them: this the Prophet <hi>Eſai.</hi> 57. 16. doth note as a
mercy of God; where it is ſaid, <hi>For I will not contend for ever, neither will
I bee alwaies wroth, for the Spirit ſhould faile before me, and the Soules which I
have made:</hi> all our troubles ſhall not come at an inſtant, nor all our
temptations, leſt our ſpritis ſhould faile, but there ſhall bee a ſpace and
a time betwixt them: ſo <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. it is ſaid, that <hi>the devill left Chriſt for
a ſeaſon:</hi> hence appeares not onely the goodneſſe but the mercy of God,
that the devill doth leave tempting of us, for a ſeaſon, yea, even God
himſelfe, doth leave and ceaſe to bring all his afflictions upon us at one
time, ſtill there is ſome intermiſſion and ſpace betweene them, that ſo
wee may bee quite overcome, but may have a breathing time to recover
our ſtrength againe.</p>
               <p>The third is,<note place="margin">3</note> that it was the ninth houre of the day, <hi>a little before his
death.</hi> This muſt teach us, that greateſt extremitie, for the moſt
part of a Chriſtian is, at the time of his death: ſo we ſee <hi>Eſai.</hi> 38. 12.
<hi>Hezekiah</hi> complaining, <hi>Mine age is departed, and is remooved from me like a
ſhepheards tent; I have cut off like a weaver my life: he will cut me off with pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
ſickneſſe; from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me, &amp;c.</hi> ſo in the
<hi>Revelation</hi> wee ſee, becauſe the devill hath but a ſhort time to continue,
therfore he <hi>rages</hi> and takes on the more: and bends all his forces to bring
troubles upon the people of God.</p>
               <p>There bee two eſpeciall times,<note place="margin">Two times the devill tempts buſily.</note> that the devill is buſieſt to diſturbe
Gods people: firſt, <hi>at their entrance into a Chriſtian calling;</hi> ſo <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.
no ſooner was Chriſt called to his office, but he was ſtraight-way <hi>temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of the devill;</hi> the ſame ſtill he doth to us, no ſooner are we entred into
a Chriſtian courſe or calling,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> having given our names to Chriſt, but we
are aſſailed by him. I have ſhewed you heretofore, if a priſoner breake
priſon the jaylor will lay all the country about till he hath gotten him
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:17958:91"/>
againe: and if he take him he will lay more irons upon him, and uſe him
worſe than he did before: ſo the devill doth, when a man is once con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
and brought to God, eſcaped out of his thraldome, hee will la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
by all meanes to catch hold on him againe; ſo that wee ſee at the
entrance of a Chriſtian into an holy courſe the devill will bee moſt
buſie.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>at the time our death;</hi> when becauſe <hi>the laſt enemy that
ſhall be deſtroyed is death,</hi> the devill thruſts himſelfe in with death, that he
might make death more bitter and ſtrong, thereby to deſtroy us if hee
could: <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 30. (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>for the prince of the world commeth and hath
nought in me:</hi> ſo <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. when the Sunne was downe, the fowles came,
and fell upon the carkaſſe of the beaſt, that <hi>Abraham</hi> had killed for a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice;
in like maner when ſorrow is at hand or when death is come, the
devill will be moſt buſie to hinder us: therefore being forewarned wee
ſhould labour to get faith, patience, repentance, with other graceſ fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
for a Chriſtian, that ſo we may ſtand at that time before God; and
bee able to ſay with Chriſt, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 30. <hi>The prince of the world commeth,
and hath nought in me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>what he complained of, that he was forſaken of God;</hi> it is a very
ſtrange thing that the Sonne of God ſhould be forſaken; yet very true,
in reſpect of the bitterneſſe of his paſſion, and ſenſe of his humanity, he
being oppreſſed with infinite dolour and paines; and this complaint of
his is not of deſperation and diffidence, (for he cals God, <hi>his God</hi>) but
of contention and ſtrife with his moſt bitter and ſorrowfull tentation.
This muſt teach us, that if the Sonne of God was forſaken, when hee
found ſinne upon him, though it were but imputed, then wee may bee
ſure, that if God finde ſinne upon us, he will forſake us. Here we are to
obſerve foure things:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. What it is to be forſaken.</item>
                  <item>2. How farre He was forſaken.</item>
                  <item>3. For what Hee was forſaken.</item>
                  <item>4. His carriage in this eſtate.</item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Firſt, what it is to be forſaken.</note> to be forſaken of God is nothing elſe but to want the gratefull preſence of
God in goodneſſe and grace.</p>
               <p>Now there is <hi>a twofold preſence:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1</note> there is a <hi>generall</hi> preſence to ſuſtaine
and uphold us, in our being and actions which is common to all: thus
the devill hath the preſence of God, which is that preſence <hi>Paul</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
of in the <hi>Acts: In him we live, moove and have our being;</hi> let a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter
make a houſe, and when he hath done, let him goe whether hee
will, the houſe will ſtand: but it is not ſo with us; for God when hee
hath made us, muſt uphold us, or elſe wee fall to the grave, and come to
nothing; as a ſtaffe in a mans hand, as long as he holds it: ſo long the
ſtaffe ſtands; but if hee withdraw his hand, it fals: ſo it is with the
world and all things in it. Now beſides this generall preſence, there is
a <hi>particular</hi> preſence in grace and goodneſſe; ſuch as is ſpoken of <hi>Pſalm.</hi>
145. 18. <hi>The Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him: to all that call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him in truth.</hi> So that God is not onely preſent, to ſuſtaine and uphold
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:17958:91"/>
us in the life of nature: but to be preſent with us in the life of grace: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to want the preſence of God,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> is to want the comfortable feeling
of God in grace and goodneſſe: this is meant by being forſaken of
God, to finde Gods angry countenance againſt us for ſinne.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Secondly, how farre forth God forſaken.</note> how farre forth Chriſt (<hi>and ſo a Chriſtian</hi>) may be ſaid to bee
forſaken: <hi>I anſwer two waies:</hi>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The one is in the life of nature.</item>
                  <item>2. The other is in the life of grace.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> in the <hi>life of nature,</hi> when God takes away our ſight, our ſtrength,
our health, our breath or life; and thus the deareſt ſervants of God
may bee forſaken, thus Chriſt was forſaken; and the Theefe on the
croſſe: he was not freed of his bodily paines, yea and hee loſt his life
too; but God did not forſake him, in the life of grace hee gave him his
Spirit and grace ſtill. And thus the poore Martyrs were forſaken in the
life of nature; <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. it is ſaid ſome were racked, and ſome were
ſawne aſunder: I, but God did not forſake them in the life of grace,
therefore they ſuffered willingly the ſpoiling of their goods; thus the
deareſt of Gods ſervants may be forſaken; yea this kinde of forſaking
is needefull; as in ſome diſeaſes, when a Phyſitian comes and ſeeth a man
hath abundance of blood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> whereby he is ſubject to maladies, he will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
open a veine and take away the corrupter blood; ſo God this
ſame ſkilfull Phyſitian, ſeeing that abundance of eaſe, wealth, and
health would doe us hurt, many times takes away from us, our eaſe, our
health our wealth, and our worldly comforts: ſo <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſalm.</hi>
119. 71. <hi>It is good for mee that I have been afflicted, that I might learne thy
ſtatutes;</hi> therefore although a man may be forſaken in the life of nature:
yet if hee may have the more ſtrength in the life of grace, and can feele
it ſo with him, or as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes, that <hi>although he dieth daily, yet his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
and conſolation in God increaſeth,</hi> then it is good for that man to bee
thus forſaken of God.</p>
               <p>The ſecond deſertion is,<note place="margin">The ſecond de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion.</note> in the <hi>life of grace:</hi> which conſiſts in the
power of the Spirit, and in the comfort of the Spirit: it is nothing to be
forſaken in the life of nature; to have our ſight, or our wealth, or our
health, or eaſe taken from us, if God doe not take away his Spirit; but
if God doe not onely forſake us, in the life of nature, but alſo in the
life of grace, this is the greateſt and the heavieſt conflict that may befall
a Chriſtian: and therefore wee had need pray to God for this, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he forſake us in the life of nature; yet that hee would not take
away his Spirit and grace from us; ſo <hi>David</hi> prayeth, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 51. <hi>Take not
away from mee thy holy Spirit;</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, though thou take away
from me,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> my crown, my kingdom, or my life, yet take not away from me
thy Spirit, ſo we ſhould pray to God, that although he take away from
us our health, goods, wife, children, or worldly eaſe, yet Lord take not
from mee thy Spirit. Here wee are to take notice of an errour in the
world, that if men be forſaken in the life of nature, then they complaine,
but never are mooved when God takes away ſanctified graces from
them. <hi>Saul</hi> complained when God had forſaken him in the life of nature,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:17958:92"/>
as 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28. 15. <hi>The Philiſtines make warre againſt me, and God is departed
from mee;</hi> and yet never was moved when <hi>the Spirit of the Lord departed
from him, and an evill ſpirit from the Lord was ſent to trouble him,</hi> as we may
reade, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 14. Thus we can complaine, when God hath forſaken
us in the life of nature, but are not troubled when we have loſt any ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
grace; therefore howſoever poverty, blindneſſe of lameneſſe be
upon us, yet let us pray to God as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. that <hi>Hee would not
take away from us his Spirit and grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now ſince we are fallen upon this point, how farre forth a Chriſtian
may be forſaken in the life of grace, wee will proceed in it a little far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for the ſatiſfaction of every mans conſcience; and therefore chiefly
take notice of theſe two things for the better underſtanding thereof:
That there is;</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The comfortable feeling of the Spirit.</item>
                  <item>2. The grace or power of the Spirit.</item>
               </list>
               <p>For the firſt,<note place="margin">How farre forth one may be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken in the life of grace.</note> God is ſaid to forſake a Chriſtian, when he takes away
the comfortable feeling of his Spirit: thus a Chriſtian may be forſaken,
when he feeleth not the love and favour of God on him, being ſo caſt
downe as if he ſhould never be ſaved; yet for that time he may have the
power and grace of the Spirit: Thus Chriſt was forſaken in the life of
grace, that he had no feeling of the Spirit, or of Gods favour, yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe
he had the grace and power of the Spirit. Wee have many
examples in the Scriptures, that the people of God have wanted this
ſame ſweet feeling of Gods favour; we ſee how <hi>David</hi> complaines, <hi>I
ſaid in mine haſte, I am cleane caſt out of thy ſight:</hi> So the Church in the
<hi>Canticles, Cant.</hi> 5. 7, 8. being as it were forſaken, went up and downe to
ſeeke Chriſt; yet the Church in that hard time did not want the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and power of the Spirit, though ſhe wanted the ſweet feeling ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and the joyfull and delightfull preſence of Chriſt; even ſo a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
hath not alwayes a like feeling of it, but when a man wants it, then
he muſt ſuſtaine himſelfe by faith, as we ſhall heare hereafter.</p>
               <p>Now if question be made,<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> 
                  <hi>how farre forth God may forſake a true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an?</hi>
I anſwer in knowne termes, That <hi>he doth not forſake totally and finally.</hi>
This I will firſt prove by certaine grounds;<note place="margin">Sol.</note> ſecondly, I will explaine it;
and thirdly, I will make uſe of it.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> I will prove it by theſe foure grounds:</p>
               <p>The firſt is drawne <hi>from the promiſe of God:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Foure grounds proving that a Chriſtian, or a true beleever, is neither totally nor finally forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of God.</note> There is a promiſe made,
<hi>Ioſh.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>I will not faile thee, nor forſake thee:</hi> this promiſe made to <hi>Ioſhua,</hi>
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> applyes to all the faithfull people of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. Now if
God will not forſake his faithfull people, then wee may have comfort,
that God will not forſake us, if we be faithfull.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſecond is drawne</hi> from the nature of God;<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>Now the nature of God
is not changed, for</hi> them whom he loveth, he loveth to the end, Ioh. 13. 1. <hi>And</hi>
Rom. 11. 28. The gifts and graces of God, are without repentance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The third is drawne from the power of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3</note> 1 Pet. 1. 3. We are kept by
the power of God to ſalvation: <hi>And</hi> Iohn 10. 29. My Father that gave them
me, is greater than all; and none is able to take them out of his hands.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:17958:92"/>
The fourth is, <hi>from the vertue of Chriſts Prayer, Ioh.</hi> 17. 11. <hi>Holy Father,
keepe through thine owne name thoſe whom thou haſt given me:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">4</note> So he prayed
that <hi>Peters faith might not faile him:</hi> Now as the prayer of Chriſt ſuſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and upheld <hi>Peter</hi> in his fals; ſo it ſhall uphold and ſuſtaine all the
godly in their fals; And theſe be the grounds.</p>
               <p>Now I will explaine the ſame:<note place="margin">1</note> Firſt, that in all the fals of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
they fall not totally from grace and goodneſſe,<note place="margin">They fall in part.</note> they fall but in part;
for as it is 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 9. <hi>There is a ſeed in them;</hi> a ſeed and a root of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and grace remaining in them, in all their fals; as we ſee in <hi>David,</hi>
when he had fallen grievouſly, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. <hi>Lord,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>take not thy holy
Spirit from me:</hi> And ſo in his going aſtray, he cries and cals to God, <hi>Pſal.</hi>
119. 178. <hi>I have gone aſtray like a loſt ſheepe, ſeeke thy ſervant, for I have not
forgotten thy Commandements:</hi> So, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 15. when <hi>Peter</hi> had denied
his Maſter, he crept away from the bad company, and was not at reſt till
he had <hi>wept bitterly:</hi> thus we may ſee, that God doth not totally forſake
his people:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> And therefore, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 10. as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid of <hi>Eutichus,</hi> when he
fell out at the window, <hi>Trouble not your ſelves, his life is in him:</hi> So we may
ſay, in all the fals of Gods people, trouble not your ſelves, nor be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged,
for there is life in them, there is the Spirit of grace, although
men doe not ſee it.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> though a Chriſtian fall, yet he fals not finally; he ſhall not
be forſaken for ever,<note place="margin">He fals not final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> it is but for a little time; as <hi>Eſay</hi> 54. 7. <hi>For a ſmall
moment have I forſaken thee, but with great compaſſion will I gather thee; in a
little wrath, I hid my face from thee for a little ſeaſon: but with everlaſting kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
have I had compaſſion on thee:</hi> So in another place it is ſaid, <hi>Though
heavineſſe endures for a night, yet joy commeth in the morning.</hi> I have ſhewed
you heretofore,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> that it is with a Chriſtian, as with a man in a ſwound,
bring a man then to the fire, rub and chafe him, and put a little <hi>Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitae</hi>
in his mouth, if there be any life in him, he will recover againe: So
it is with a Chriſtian in his fals; if he be brought to the meanes, to the
Word preached, to prayer, or to the uſe of the Sacraments, if there be
the life of grace in him, he will recover againe: ſo then God doth not
forſake a Chriſtian finally. The Vſes are;</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> ſeeing God doth not forſake totally and finally; wee may ſee
what a comfortable eſtate it is to be a true Chriſtian, hee may have aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
that God will not forſake him for ever: this is an excellent privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and prerogative that a Beleever hath, his friends and kindred may
forſake him, but God will never; therefore ſuch a man may ſay (by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
privately) Lord, I thanke thee, although my friends and my kindred
have forſaken mee, yet thou haſt not; on thee I will rely, and put my
whole confidence in thee, for thou haſt promiſed, that whileſt I truſt in
thee, thou never wilt forſake mee: And this is a ſweet comfort that a
Chriſtian may have; a ſervant may be forſaken of his maſter, as the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malekite</hi>
was, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30. 13. and a childe may be forſaken of his mother,
as <hi>Moſes</hi> was, <hi>Exod.</hi> 2. 3. a husband may forſake his wife, one friend ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but God will never forſake them that be his ſervants.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> ſeeing God doth not forſake his finally nor totally, let us
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:17958:93"/>
labour to be one of his ſervants, and then we have an evidence, that God
will not leave us not forſake us; a father may forſake his childe, a maſter
his ſervant, a land-lord may caſt off his tenants, but God will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
them that doe depend upon him; if wee be his ſervants, then wee
have an evidence to ſhew, whereby we may aſſure our ſelves, when all
elſe leave us, yet God will not forſake us.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Vſe 3.</note> ſeeing God will not forſake us finally and totally, it is a
ſhame for us to forſake him;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> the childe hath greater cauſe not to forſake
the mother, than the mother hath to forſake the childe; for the childe
cannot live without the mother, but it is like to ſtarve and periſh, but the
mother can live without the childe; ſo we have greater cauſe not to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
God, than he hath to forſake us, wee cannot live without him, and
he can be glorified though we were in hell. Therefore, ſeeing God hath
not forſaken us, it is a ſhame for us to forſake him.</p>
               <p>The third thing is,<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>To know what the cauſe is, that God forſakes his people:</hi>
To anſwer briefly,<note place="margin">Why God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſakes his people.</note> 
                  <hi>It is for ſinne:</hi> Why, is ſinne ſuch a great matter, that
it will make God forſake his creatures? I anſwer, it is ſinne, and nothing
but ſinne; let a mans eſtate be what it will be, never ſo rich or poore, if
hee doe not repent his ſinnes, but live in them, and commit them from
day to day, it will cauſe God to forſake him: therefore, art thou poore
or rich? doe not ſinne againſt God and live in it without repentance, for
it will make God to depart from thee: For, looke what was the cauſe
that God did forſake his owne Sonne, the ſame will make him forſake
thee: Now ſin was the impelling cauſe that made God forſake his Son,
for when he found our ſinne upon him by imputation, he forſooke him
awhile; therefore conſider with thy ſelfe, if God would not ſpare ſin,
but puniſh it upon his owne Sonne, though it were but imputed to him;
then it is ſure, if he finde ſinne upon thee, he will forſake thee, if thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
not for it; for if God ſpared not the Angels when they had ſinned,
neither ſpared his owne Sonne, when he found our ſinnes imputed unto
him, ſurely he will not ſpare thee unleſſe thou repent; howſoever thou
do not find it in time of health and peace, yet when the day of death, or
the day of judgment commeth, thou ſhalt ſee thy ſelfe forſaken of God.
O that the wicked would conſider this, that if they live in their ſinnes,
and doe not repent, God wil forſake them! It was ſinne that made God
depart away from his Temple and from his own houſe, as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 8. 6. ſaith
God, <hi>Sonne of man, ſeeſt thou not what they doe, even the great abominations
that the houſe of Iſrael committeth here, to cauſe me to depart from my Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie?</hi>
So we ſee that ſinne made God to forſake his owne houſe, and the
place that he had appointed for his owne glory, if wee provoke him by
our ſinnes, he will depart from us, unleſſe we repent.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4</note> 
                  <hi>How a Chriſtian ſhould cary himſelfe, when he finds himſelfe to be
forſaken of God:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">How we ſhould carry our ſelves being forſaken.</note> This may we ſee in the famous and memorable example
of Chriſt; for looke how Chriſt carried himſelfe when he was in ſhew
forſaken of God; ſo ſhould we carry our ſelves, when we likewiſe finde
our ſelves forſaken of him. Now Chriſt carried himſelfe;</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Mournefully,</hi> for he did in that bitterneſſe come to God.</item>

                  </gap>od, when we ſee our ſelves
forſaken of him: as 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 2. wee ſee <hi>the people of Iſrael lamented after
the Arke twenty yeeres</hi> together, all the while being without it; ſo we
ſhould weepe and lament many daies together, ſo long as we finde our
ſelves forſaken of God. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20. when <hi>Mary</hi> had loſt Chriſt, ſhee ſeekes
for him, and ſtandeth weeping by his Sepulcher: ſaith Chriſt to her,
<hi>Woman, why weepeſt thou?</hi> to which ſhe anſwered, <hi>they have taken away my
Lord, and I know not where they have laid him:</hi> I have good cauſe to weepe,
they have taken him away, or I have loſt him, in whom I have laid up all
my hope, comfort and joy; ſo a Chriſtian man or woman may ſay when
he findes himſelfe forſaken of God; I have good cauſe to weepe and
mourne, many a-day together; for I have loſt Christ, hee is departed
from me in whom all my joy and comfort was laid up.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Secondly, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently.</note> Chriſt did carry himſelfe <hi>patiently,</hi> he did not murmure and
grudge againſt God; for (as a learned man ſaith) theſe words, <hi>My God,
my God, why haſt thou forſaken me? are not words of expostulation and reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
with God, but of a mournefull complaint.</hi> As Chriſt carried himſelfe
patiently, when he was forſaken of God, ſo wee ſhould carry our ſelves
patiently in our croſſes, never murmuring nor grudging againſt God:
ſo wee ſee <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39. 9. <hi>I was dumbe and ſaid nothing, because thou
didſt it;</hi> and <hi>Mich.</hi> 7. 9. <hi>The Church ſaith, I will beare the indignation of the
Lord, becauſe I have ſinned against him, &amp;c. Augustine</hi> ſaith, The devill
is like unto a dogge, if a man be at dinner, the dogge ſits and waits to ſee
if a crumme fall downe,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> or a bone; ſo long as they give him a bone or a
crumme, the dogge will ſtill wait; one ſhall not be ridde of him, but if
you give him nothing, the dogge will be gone; ſo the divell doth with
us, he waits upon a Chriſtian when he is under affliction, to ſee whither
he will let fall a word of murmuring or grudging againſt God; if he doe,
he will wait ſtill, but if he doe not, he will be gone.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Thirdly, h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

himſelfe upon God, by faith, though he did not feele a dramme of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
ſo we ſhould carry our ſelves holily, to reſt our ſelves on God, by
faith, though we feele no comfort, as <hi>Iob</hi> did, <hi>Though thou killest me, yet will
I put my truſt in thee;</hi> ſo <hi>Ion.</hi> 3. ſaith he, <hi>out of the belly of hell I cryed unto the

patiently, but he laboured to recover himſelfe, to his former feeling of
Gods favour againe by prayer; ſo ought we not onely to reſt and rely
on God by faith,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> but labour to recover our ſelves to our former feeling
of Gods favour againe, as when trees are dead at the top, wee lay freſh
moulds to the roots to make them revive againe, ſo we ſhould labour by

to our former comforts, joy and feeling of Gods favour.</p>

                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:17958:94"/>
Thus what Chriſt ſuffered <hi>of God,</hi> we have already ſpoken of: now we
are come to ſpeake <hi>What he ſuffered of men,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Secondly, what Chriſt ſuffered of men.</note> for ſuch is the deſert of ſinne,
that it deſerveth to ſuffer of God and man, and of every power that is
able to make us ſuffer, therefore Chriſt ſtanding in our place and roome,
being our ſurety and pledge, it was needfull, that hee ſhould not ſuffer
onely at the hands of God but of man alſo; as our Saviour tels his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 17. 22. <hi>The ſonne of man ſhall be delivered into the hand, of
men, and they ſhall kill him, but the third day hee ſhall riſe againe;</hi> ſo Chriſt,
did not onely ſuffer at the hands of God but of men alſo: and <hi>as Chriſt
ſuffered for us, leaving us an example, that yee ſhould follow his ſteppes,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi>
2. 21. therefore Chriſts example muſt teach us to be contented not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to ſuffer of God, but of men alſo. This our Saviour foretels <hi>Matth.</hi>
10. 22. <hi>Ye ſhall bee hated of all men, for my names ſake:</hi> of this the Church
complaines, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 66. 12. <hi>Thou hast cauſed men to ride over our heads, wee
went through fire and water.</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 124. 2. <hi>If it had not beene the Lord who
was on our ſide may Iſrael now ſay, if it had not beene the Lord who was on our
ſide, when men roſe up againſt us, then they had ſwallowed us up quicke, &amp;c.</hi> ſo a
Chriſtian man muſt looke for this, not onely to ſuffer at the hands of
God, but of men alſo. It is a corruption in the world, that men can bee
contented to ſuffer at the hands of God, when ſickeneſſe, lameneſſe, or
blindeneſſe come, then they can ſay ſinking and ſtooping downe, that
<hi>it is the Lord, let him doe as pleaſeth him,</hi> but are impatient when they ſuffer
at the hands of men; it is not enough to be contented when God laies
any thing upon us, as ſickneſſe, lameneſſe, and the like; for wee ought
alſo to be contented to ſuffer at the hands of men, loſſe of goods, moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings,
evill ſpeakings, to be hated and deſpiſed, and to be impeached in
our good name; as thoſe Chriſtians ſpoken of <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. ſuffered with joy
cruell tortures, bonds, impriſonments, the ſpoyling of their goods, &amp;c.
To helpe us herein there are three Reaſons, that may make us conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and patient to ſuffer at the hands of men.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Three reaſons to enable us to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from men.</note> becauſe wee ſuffer nothing at the hands of men but that which
God hath appointed, decreed and determined: therefore what art thou
that reſiſteth that which God hath appointed;<note place="margin">1</note> for as the Primitive

                     </gap>rod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of Iſrael were
gathered together; for to doe whatſoever thy hand and thy counſell had determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
before to be done:</hi> and <hi>David</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 10. when <hi>Shemei</hi> curſed him,
and <hi>Abiſha</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Zerviah</hi> would therefore have taken away his
head, ſaith <hi>David, what have I to doe with you, yee ſonnes of Zerviah: So let
him curſe, becauſe the Lord hath ſaid unto him, Curſe David.</hi> So ſhould wee
ſtill, and quiet our ſelves in any affliction, with this conſideration,
What? there is not any thing that a man can ſuffer but it is by Gods
appointment.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> becauſe wee ſuffer nothing, but that we have juſtly deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in regard of God; though (it may bee) in regard of men we have
not deſerved it, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 10. 19. <hi>This is my ſorrow and I must beare it;</hi> I ſuffer
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:17958:94"/>
nothing, but that which through my owne folly and ſinne, I have
brought upon my ſelfe, it is my ſorrow, and I will beare it; and ſo in
<hi>Mich.</hi> 7. 9. <hi>I will beare the wrath of the Lord patiently, becauſe I have ſinned
againſt him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> becauſe there is nothing that wee ſuffer, but it tends to our
good; although it ſeemes to be contrary, yet by a ſecret hand of God,
it all turnes for the beſt; as <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28. <hi>And we know that all things worke
together for the beſt unto them that love God.</hi> I have ſhewed you hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that in clocks there be ſome wheeles turne one way,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſome another
way, yet all tend to make the clocke goe; ſo there be many ſtrange mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in the world, ſome runne one way ſome another, as it were againſt
us, and yet by a ſecret hand of God, that doth carry them, they tend all
to our good, by this cunning workeman God almighty. Hence wee
learne that wee muſt bee patient and contented to ſuffer at the hands of
men too.</p>
               <p>But what men did Chriſt ſuffer of? were they good men, then the
matter had been the leſſe; but he ſuffered of vile and wicked men; as
ſaint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 33. <hi>Conſider therefore him that endured ſuch contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of ſinners.</hi> Which may teach us not onely to be content to ſuffer of
good but of bad men; divers bee well enough contented to ſuffer of
good men; as <hi>David, Pſalm.</hi> 141. <hi>Let the righteous ſmite me Lord, and that
ſhall bee good for me;</hi> but for drunkards and vile perſons to doe it they
cannot endure it. Oh ſay ſome men, if they had been good men, that
had done it, it would never have grieved us, but to ſuffer of ſuch bad
men as they, this trouble us: well, but we muſt be contented to ſuffer of
the baſeſt ſort;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> wee ſee ſometimes it fals out that a noble man ſuffers at
the hand of a baſer man than himſelfe, to have his head taken off, but
he knowes that his power is directed by a greater power than his, which
makes him ſubmit himſelfe to ſuffer, ſo many times a Chriſtian may
ſuffer at the hands of one baſer than himſelfe: but hee muſt know, that
the power that he doth it by, is directed by a power farre greater than
his owne.</p>
               <p>Now that which Chriſt ſuffered of men may bee conſidered in three
things:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. His apprehenſion.</item>
                  <item>2. His arraignement.</item>
                  <item>3. His condemnation.</item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the</hi> apprehenſion <hi>of Chriſt, we obſerve foure things.</hi>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The place where.</item>
                  <item>2. The time when.</item>
                  <item>3. His preparation for it.</item>
                  <item>4. The meanes, and manner of it.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Firſt, the place where.</note> 
                  <hi>the place where</hi> Chriſt was apprehended: the text ſaith; <hi>In the
Garden,</hi> not in the city; for there is a ſpecification of the place, and that
is in the garden. Of which there be three Reaſons why Chriſt was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
in the garden.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>becauſe ſinne began in the garden;</hi> the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> did begin ſinne
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:17958:95"/>
there, that (as a learned man ſaith) <hi>where the wound began, there the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine
might begin alſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>becauſe the garden was the place, where Chriſt had prayed, and
meditated in;</hi> and therefore he would be apprehended there: teaching
us all herein this moſt excellent inſtruction, that it is a good thing, when
death or danger comes, that it findes us in the place where we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
of our ſinnes, and moſt conſtantly walked with God by holy
meditation and prayer, where we have prayed to God, and humbled our
ſelves: ſo <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. wee ſee that his accuſers, did not onely finde him in
the place, but in the act of prayer: this alſo gave comfort to Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
in his trouble, <hi>Act.</hi> 24. 18. that <hi>He was found in the Temple:</hi> as if hee
ſhould ſay, O Lord I thanke thee, that I was not found in the place of
drunkenneſſe, of diſhoneſty and prophaneneſſe, but in the Temple, the
place of prayer. When <hi>Ioſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> ſought for Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.
among their kindred,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> they could not finde him there, but they ſought
him in the Temple, and there they found him; ſo if any ſeeke for us, it
were good that we were found in the Temple, in the place of preaching,
prayer and holy duties; but I feare me, if ſome were to be ſought for,
they ſhould not finde them in the <hi>Temple,</hi> nor in the place of prayer, but
idle at home, or a ſwaggering at the alehouſe, in placeſ of drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and prophaneneſſe: when <hi>Elias</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19. was come into the
cave,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> there came a voyce unto him, <hi>What doſt thou here Elias?</hi> thou art a
Prophet of God, this is not a fit place for thee to be in; ſo, when men
are in prophane places, of diſorders, the Spirit of God comes to them,
by the motions of it; and ſaith, What doſt thou here? thou art a
Chriſtian, this is not a fit place for thee to be here; therefore as Chriſt
was found in the place of meditation and prayer, when hee was appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended,
ſo we ſhould labour to be found when death and danger comes,
in the place where we have repented of our ſinnes, and where we have
prayed in.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>becauſe it was a knowne place to Iudas;</hi> for Ieſus reſorted thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with his Diſciples; to ſhew that Chriſt went willingly to his
death, for if hee had not been willing, hee would have gone to ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
place more ſecret: at other times hee ſhunned death but now hee
was willing to dye; which ſhould teach us, that ſo long as God would
have us to live, we ſhould be contented to live, and when he would have
us to dye, we ſhould alſo be contented to dye; when wee perceive the
houre and the time is.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> I have ſhewed you heretofore that if a merchant
hath ſent his ſervant to trade and traffique beyond the ſea, ſo long as his
maſter will have him trade, hee trades, but when his maſter will have
him pack up all and come away, he doth ſo; thus muſt a Chriſtian doe,
ſo long as God will have us to trade here in this world wee ſhould bee
contented; but when he will have us pack up all and returne, we ſhould
be contented to doe ſo too.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Secondly, the time when.</note> 
                  <hi>The time when Christ was apprehended; when his houre was
come;</hi> ſo <hi>Ioh.</hi> 19. 28. <hi>When Ieſus knew all things were fulfilled of him,</hi> addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
himſelfe to dye: So hee ſaith, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 53. <hi>When I was dayly in the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:17958:95"/>
Temple yee tooke mee not, but this is your houre;</hi> hee was in danger many
times, and yet there was none that touched him, becauſe his houre was
not yet come. This is an excellent comfort to a Chriſtian, that there is
no man can doe him any harme, or take away his life, till the very time
come that God hath appointed. So ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 31. <hi>My times are in
thy hands;</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, if they were in the hands of mine enemies,
then it might come ſhortly, or if they might take me unawares; but my
time is in thy hands; therefore untill our time be come, there is no man
can doe us any harme, though they rage and take on; nay all the devils
in hell are not able to doe us any hurt; or take away our lives; till the
very houre be come that God hath appointed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Thirdly, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for it.</note> 
                  <hi>Christs preparation for it,</hi> he did prepare and ſtrengthen him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
by prayer and meditation. Now as he ſtrengthened and prepared
himſelfe for his apprehenſion, ſo wee ſhould prepare our ſelves, for the
time of our death; for if Chriſt which was the Sonne of God; prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
himſelfe, much more ought wee, for he was ſtrong, and full of holy
courage and magnanimity, wee poore and weake; and beſides that hee
knew the time when hee ſhould die, the place where, and the manner
how: but we are ignorant of all.</p>
               <p>Firſt, we know not the time when, whether in the day or night, when
we are yong or old, whether this yeere or the next. Secondly, wee
know not <hi>the place</hi> where; whether we ſhall dye amongſt our friends or
foes, whether in the fields or in the houſe, whether on the ſea or on the
land. Thirdly, we know not <hi>the manner</hi> how, whether wee ſhall dye ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainely
or of a lingring diſeaſe; of the plague, or of the feaver; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſeeing we know none of theſe, we ought to prepare our ſelves, to
repent of our ſinnes, to get faith, patience and obedience, ſo to further
our reckoning, for if Chriſt prepared himſelfe by prayer and meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
much more had wee need to prepare our ſelves. Marriners when
they ſee a ſtorme hang in the ſkie, they take downe their sailes, ſhut up
their hatches, and make themſelves fit to receive the ſtorme; ſo when
wee ſee a ſtorme is ready to light on us, wee ſhould fit our ſelves to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it. The prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 20. 1. told king <hi>Hezekiah that hee
ſhould ſet his houſe in order for he muſt dye;</hi> ſo becauſe wee know not when
it ſhall be, whether to day or to morrow, or the next day, therefore wee
ſhould be prepared for it, as Chriſt prepared himſelfe for his apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
ſo we ſhould prepare our ſelves for our death.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Fourthly, the meanes and manner.</note> 
                  <hi>the meanes and the manner how;</hi> the ſpeciall meanes was <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi>
as we may ſee in the ſecond and third verſes; other meanes there
was, as the <hi>Prieſts, Scribes</hi> and <hi>Souldiers;</hi> but <hi>Iudas</hi> was the eſpeciall
meanes. In whom we obſerve foure things:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>His condition;</hi> he was a <hi>Diſciple.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>What it was that moved him;</hi> the love of money.</item>
                  <item>3. <hi>The manner of it;</hi> it was with a kiſſe.</item>
                  <item>4. <hi>The iſſue and event;</hi> he went out and hanged himſelfe.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>his condition;</hi> hee was a <hi>Diſciple,</hi> whom Chriſt had nouriſhed in
His owne boſome, fed at his owne table, was his treaſurer, and carried
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:17958:96"/>
the bagge; and yet for all this, hee did more than <hi>Pilate</hi> and the ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
none did worſe than he: which may teach us, that there is none when
they become evill worſe than they, that have had a taſte of Religion,
take heed, that we doe not loſe our taſte; for ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.
13.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> 
                  <hi>If ſalt have loſt his ſavour, wherewith ſhall it bee ſalted?</hi> other things
though they have loſt their ſavour and ſtrength, yet they are good for
ſomething; but if ſalt have loſt his ſavour, it is good for nothing: ſo if a
man hath once had a little taſte of Religion, and hath loſt his taſte, he is
good for nothing, none worſe than hee. It is in the life of Grace, as
in the life of nature, we ſee as long as there is any life in a man, he is the
goodlieſt and beautifulleſt creature,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſo that it delights one to looke on
him, and converſe with him, but if he be once dead, he is the loathſomeſt
creature that is, wee cannot abide to looke on him: ſo it is in the life of
grace; as long as there is any life of grace in him, he is an excellent crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but if once he have a loſt his life and is dead, he is a moſt vile creature:
therefore if men have a taſte of grace and of Religion, let them make
much of it and nouriſh it; for if they loſe it, none bee ſo vile creatures
as they.</p>
               <p>Againe, <hi>Iudas</hi> was not a ſtranger, but <hi>a Diſciple and one of the twelve;</hi>
and that he ſhould betray Chriſt, this was that grieved Chriſt and pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
His holy Soule: therefore Chriſt complaines of <hi>Iudas,</hi> and not of
the <hi>Iewes,</hi> or of <hi>Pilate,</hi> or the <hi>ſouldiers;</hi> therefore this muſt teach us, that
the ſinnes of Gods people doe more grieve Chriſt, than the ſinnes of
the prophaner ſort, as <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 11. Chriſt complaines that <hi>Hee came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
his owne, and his owne received him not;</hi> if he had come amongſt
ſtrangers then it would never have grieved him; but ſeeing that hee
came amongſt his owne and they received him not, this it was that
grieved him: and ſo the Lord complaines, <hi>Hos.</hi> 4. 12. <hi>My people aske
counſell of ſtockes and ſtones, and their ſtaves teach them;</hi> therefore we that
bee the people of God, muſt bee carefull that we doe not ſinne, and ſo
grieve the holy ſoule of Chriſt, for they be not the ſinnes of the world,
that grieve Chriſt, but the ſinnes of beleeving Chriſtians.</p>

to ſpeake of) is,<note place="margin">The ſecond thing, what did moove Judas to betray Chriſt.</note> 
                  <hi>what it was that moved him to betray Chriſt
his Maſter:</hi> I anſwer, it was <hi>covetouſneſſe, and love of
money,</hi> he comes to the high Prieſts and ſaith, <hi>What will
yee give mee?</hi> This was a vile ſinne to ſell his Maſter,
but yet there was nothing ſo vile but <hi>Iudas</hi> would doe
it for love of money, and gaine, hee did that for thirty peeces of ſilver,
that a Chriſtian would not doe for a thouſand worlds, therefore when
the love of money and gaine poſſeſſeth our hearts, what is that we will
not doe? A prophane and worldly man will doe that for a penny, that
a Chriſtian adviſedly would not doe for a thouſand worlds: Hence it
was 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 10. the Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>the love of money is the roote of
all evill;</hi> for there is not any evill, but it will ſpring from this roote,
which if the devill can plant into a mans heart, there is not any ſinne or
evill, but hee will draw a man unto; therefore let us take heede of this
ſinne, for we know not what evill it will bring us unto.</p>
               <p>Now this covetouſneſſe of <hi>Iudas,</hi> is ſet out by a <hi>ſale</hi> and <hi>bargaine</hi> that
was made. In which wee may obſerve theſe foure things:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>The merchant that ſold the ware;</hi> it was <hi>Iudas.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>The chapmen that did buy it;</hi> the Scribes and Prieſts.</item>
                  <item>3. <hi>The ware;</hi> it was <hi>Chriſt the riches and glory of the world.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>4. <hi>The price,</hi> it was <hi>for thirty pence;</hi> the price of a ſlave.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Firſt, the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant.</note> 
                  <hi>Who was the merchant:</hi> it was <hi>Iudas,</hi> he did that for thirty pence,
that another would not have done for a thouſand worlds; he firſt made
a prey of his Maſters money, and then of his Maſter; he was falſe in his
Maſters money, and now he is falſe to his Maſter: therefore men had
need to beware of the beginnings of ſinne, for if we give place to ſmall
ſinnes, afterward we ſhall make no conſcience of greater: That which
the Apoſtle ſaith of one kinde of ſinne, may be ſaid of all, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 16.
<hi>Stay prophane and vaine babling<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> we may ſay of all ſinnes, ſtay the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of ſinne; we ſee in experience, when a man cleaves a blocke, hee
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:17958:97"/>
will firſt enter it with ſmall wedges, and then a greater, till at laſt hee
bring it to ſhivers;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſo the Devill doth, he firſt enters us with ſmall ſins,
and then with greater, till at laſt he workes our overthrow; for we ſee
<hi>Iudas</hi> was firſt falſe in his Maſters money, and then hee was falſe to his
Maſter.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing obſerved was,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>the Chapman that bought theſe wares;
the Prieſts,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Chapman.</note> who were covetous perſons, they would not part from a peny
for good uſes, not give a penny to cloath the naked, to feed the hungry;
as we ſee in the <hi>Acts,</hi> that a man lay at the gates of the Temple a long
time, and they did not releeve him, and yet they could part with their
money to betray Chriſt: So it is a corruption, that men are loth to part
from any thing for good uſes, and yet they will part from their money
to vex a good Preacher, or a good Chriſtian; ſo many can be content to
part with their money, to buy Cards or Dice, but they will not part
with any to buy a Bible; therefore, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 2. 9. ſaith the Lord, <hi>I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
and take away my corne in the time thereof, and my wine in the ſeaſon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and will recover my wooll and my flax,</hi> &amp;c. becauſe they beſtowed it on
<hi>Baal,</hi> on bad uſes, to ſpend it on their luſts: we ſee the <hi>bad ſervant</hi> in the
Goſpell, that <hi>hid his talent in a napkin,</hi> when his maſter came to take ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of him, there came an <hi>extent</hi> to him, to take away his talent, and
then to <hi>binde him hand and foot, and to caſt him into utter darkneſſe:</hi> Now if
this came upon him for hiding his talent, what ſhall become of thoſe
that abuſe their talents, and put them to bad uſes?</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>the ware he ſold, Chriſt;</hi> the riches and glory of the world, the
greateſt treaſure on earth,<note place="margin">The Ware ſold.</note> in regard whereof, <hi>Paul counts all things to bee
dung and droſſe,</hi> and yet <hi>Iudas</hi> ſold Chriſt for a trifle: ſo many men sell
Chriſt, the riches of the world, for a trifle, becauſe men doe not know
the true value of Chriſt and of his graces, which if they did, they would
not loſe the poſſeſſion of him for a thouſand worlds, but they would
take heed of the ſelling of Chriſt. Now this ware was unlawfull to be
ſold; for the <hi>Canon Law</hi> ſaith, that <hi>it is unlawfull to ſell a ſpirituall thing;</hi> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith to <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> when hee would have bought the
holy Ghoſt with his money, <hi>thy money periſh with thee, Act.</hi> 8. Now Chriſt
is the fountaine of all ſpirituall things, therefore to ſell him it was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the <hi>Canon Law</hi> ſaith, that <hi>it is unlawfull to ſell that of which the
right belongs to another:</hi> If a man have right unto a thing, he may ſell it, but
<hi>Iudas</hi> had no right to ſell <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for he was to diſpoſe of himſelfe; ſaith
he, <hi>I have power to lay downe my life, and I have power to take it up againe:</hi> And
therefore ſeeing hee was to diſpoſe of himſelfe, it was unlawfull for <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>
to ſell him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, as Divines ſay, there be things of ineſtimable value and priſe,
which nothing in the world can countervaile, therefore to ſell thoſe
things it is unlawfull.</p>
               <p>As firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> the gifts and <hi>graces of the Spirit,</hi> as <hi>Acts</hi> 8. <hi>Simon Magus</hi> would
have bought the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> the <hi>kingdome of heaven</hi> is unlawfull to be ſold, for <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:17958:97"/>
it is likened to <hi>a pearle, that a man goes and ſels all that he hath to buy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> the <hi>Soules of men</hi> be unlawfull to be ſold, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. it is
ſaid, <hi>What ſhall it profit a man to win the whole world, and loſe his ſoule;</hi> all the
world it not comparable to it?</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4</note> to ſell the loving favour and <hi>kindneſſe of God</hi> is unlawfull, as
in the <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63. 3. ſaith <hi>David, Thy Loving kindneſſe is better than life:</hi> to
ſell a mans life is unlawfull, for as the Devill ſaith of <hi>Iob, Skin for ſkin,
and all that a man hath he will give for his life;</hi> ſurely nothing in the world
was comparable to Chriſts life, therefore to ſell him it was unlawfull.</p>
               <p>Laſtly,<note place="margin">5</note> very nature abhorreth, that a man ſhould be ſold to <hi>puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
and paines; it had beene much if Chriſt had beene ſold for a ſlave;
but that he was ſold to the greateſt paines and torments, the paines of
the Croſſe, this was the greateſt indignitie that might bee; <hi>Iudas</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
of all men, for ſelling his Maſter for thirty pence: But, O what
doe men now, but even ſell heaven and happineſſe for a penny matter,
for a little profit and pleaſure; and although men cannot ſell Chriſt to
the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> yet they ſell their ſoules to the Devill for trifling things;
therefore when men will be readie for a little pleaſure or a little profit,
for a penny matter to ſell heaven and happineſſe, what doe they but ſell
Chriſt? Now in all our bargaines we ſhould conſider two things:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. What we gaine.</item>
                  <item>2. What we forgoe.</item>
               </list>
               <p>It may be we may gaine a little wordly eaſe and peace, and loſe our
peace with God; we may gaine favour with men, but loſe favour with
God, and then we make but a bad match, for his favour is more worth
than all the world beſides; therefore the world makes but a bad match
of this to forgoe Chriſt, heaven and happineſſe, for a little tranſitory
and fading things of this world; ſo <hi>Iudas</hi> match was but a bad one, to
forgoe his Maſter for thirty pence.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4</note> 
                  <hi>What the price was;</hi> he was ſold for <hi>thirtie pence,</hi> the price of a
ſlave; if he had ſold him for thouſands,<note place="margin">The Price.</note> the ſinne had beene leſſe; but
to ſell Chriſt, the riches and treaſure of the world, for a trifle, for thirty
pence, this made the ſinne the greater. Now theſe peeces of ſilver in
Hebrew, bee <hi>Shekels,</hi> of which there be two ſorts, the <hi>Shekels of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary,</hi>
and the <hi>common Shekels,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Diſtinction of Shekels.</note> as we may ſee, <hi>Levit.</hi> 27. 25. and <hi>Numb.</hi> 3.
47. Now the <hi>Shekels of the Sanctuary</hi> were double the weight of the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Shekels,</hi> halfe as much more; to teach us, that in all the matters of
Religion, we muſt give God down-weight; as he gives us down-weight
of his bleſſings, ſo we muſt give him downe-weight of our ſervice and
dutie that we are to performe unto him. Now the ordinary and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Shekel, was but fifteene pence; ſo the price that Chriſt was ſold
for was the price of a ſlave: And this was done to fulfill the Scripture,
<hi>Zech.</hi> 11. 12. <hi>So they weighed for my price thirtie peeces of ſilver; and the Lord
ſaid unto me, Caſt it unto the Potter, a goodly price that I was prized at of them;
and I tooke the thirtie peeces of ſilver, and caſt them to the Potter in the houſe of
the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now there be two reaſons why this price is ſpecified:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:17958:98"/>
Firſt, ſeeing Chriſt ſtood in our roome and place, and tooke on him
our ſinnes,<note place="margin">1</note> it was to teach us, that God eſteemed no better of us, than
ſlaves; therefore howſoever we ſet an high price of our ſelves, yet wee
were no better than ſlaves in Gods account.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> to ſhew the great ſinne of <hi>Iudas,</hi> that he would be ſo vile to
ſell Chriſt for a trifle. <hi>Eſau</hi> is condemned of all men, that he would ſell
his birth-right for a meſſe of pottage; <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 16. and <hi>Prov.</hi> 28. <hi>A wicked
man</hi> (ſaith <hi>Salomon) will tranſgreſſe for a morſell of bread;</hi> every little matter
will make him ſinne: I know all men condemne <hi>Iudas</hi> for ſelling his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
for a trifle; but how much may we be condemned, to ſell heaven
for trifling things: Indeed we cannot ſell Chriſt to the <hi>Prieſts</hi> for thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
peeces of ſilver, but yet wee ſell our ſoules to the devill for a penny
matter, a little pleaſure or profit; therefore, in this what doe we but as
<hi>Iudas</hi> did, ſell Chriſt for a trifle? God give us eyes to ſee it, and hearts
to abhorre it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>The manner how Iudas betrayed Chriſt; with a kiſſe,</hi> a ſigne of
great love and friendſhip; and therefore Chriſt ſaith unto him,<note place="margin">The Manner.</note> 
                  <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.
44. <hi>What doeſt thou betray the Sonne of man with a kiſſe?</hi> I would it were not
ſo ſtill, that men kiſſe religion, and yet betray their brethren; kiſſe reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
at the Church, and yet betray it at home in their bad life and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4</note> 
                  <hi>The iſſue and event;</hi> When he had ſold his Maſter, and had
but a little comfort:<note place="margin">The Iſſue and event.</note> Firſt, he bringeth the money againe to the Prieſts,
he could not abide it: which may teach us to take heed how we come
by our money,<note place="margin">1</note> if we come by it well, we may have comfort, but if bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
it will one day lye as heavie as leade on a mans heart.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>Iudas</hi> he comes and confeſſeth his ſinne to the Prieſts, and
then he went and <hi>hanged himſelfe,</hi> he thought to have carried the matter
cloſely, and now he diſcovered it in the Temple: Which may teach us,
that if we ſinne againſt God, though we thinke to carry away the matter
cloſely and cunningly, yet there will come a time when we ſhall diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the matter our ſelves, and make it knowne, and ſay, I have beene a
drunkard and a bad liver, I have beene a whoremaſter, a covetous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and a deceiver of my brethren: And as meat that is eaten by a weak
ſtomacke cannot be at reſt till it be up againe;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſo a man cannot be quiet
many times till hee have diſcovered all his ſinnes himſelfe; this is the
property of a bad conſcience, that it will egge a man to commit ſinne,
and when he hath ſinned, then it wil never be at reſt till have it brought
a man to deſperation; <hi>Revel.</hi> 20. 12. it is ſaid, that <hi>Iohn ſaw the dead both
great and ſmall ſtand before God, and the bookes were opened,</hi> that is, <hi>their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences;</hi>
For howſoever mens conſciences may be ſealed for a time, that
they cannot ſee their ſinne, yet one day they ſhall be opened, and all the
ſinnes they have committed brought before them: O what a fearefull
thing will this be,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> we ſee <hi>Iudas</hi> did but reade, as it were, a leafe or a page
of this booke, nay, he read but (as it were) two or three lines and could
not endure it, but goeth out and hangs himſelfe; if it be ſo fearefull a
thing to reade but a leafe or a page, how fearefull will it be when a man
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:17958:98"/>
ſhall reade every leafe and page in the booke? Men that be of trades,
when they come to places of ſearch, they be unpackt,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and their fardels
opened, the ſearchers come and looke upon their ware, when if they
finde any falſe ware there is a forfeiture made of it: So wee doe, as it
were, in this world packe up our wares in a fardell in our conſcience, and
when we ſhall ſtand before God at the day of judgement, then our far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels
ſhall be opened, and if there be found any falſe wares, ſinnes that we
have not repented of, we may looke for that fearefull ſentence, <hi>Goe yee
curſed,</hi> &amp;c. And therefore every one ſhould take heed what he packs up
in his fardell, ſeeing it ſhall one day be opened.</p>
               <p>Having ſpoken of the Meanes of apprehending Chriſt, wee are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to ſpeake of the <hi>Manner,</hi> which is laid downe in three Actions:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. In the taking of Chriſt.</item>
                  <item>2. In the binding of him.</item>
                  <item>3. In the leading him away; <hi>firſt to</hi> Annas; <hi>then to</hi>
Caiphas.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>the taking of Chriſt;</hi> and here two things are implied:</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Firſt, in his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, two things.</note> 
                  <hi>The marvellous obduration of the Iews,</hi> for it was a ſtrange thing that
they had the heart to take Chriſt,<note place="margin">1</note> notwithſtanding they ſaw the works
of his <hi>Power,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Iewes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duration.</note> and of his <hi>Mercie.</hi> Firſt, of his <hi>Power,</hi> for ſo ſoone as he ſaid,
<hi>I am he,</hi> they ſtraight <hi>went backward, and fell to the ground,</hi> and were fully
confounded. Secondly, the workes of his <hi>Mercy,</hi> in that whereas hee
flang them downe, yet he let them riſe againe; whereas he did but caſt
them to the ground, he might have caſt them to hell; and when <hi>Peter</hi>
had cut off <hi>Malchus</hi> eare (being the buſieſt to take Chriſt) he ſets it on
againe, and healed it, and yet for all this, they lay hold on Chriſt, as
ſoon as they were up again, although they had felt the power of Chriſt,
and had ſeene the workes of his mercy, yet they would not be ſtopped
in their courſe: Which may teach us, what a fearefull thing it is to
have a hard heart, that nothing then can ſtop and ſtay a man in the courſe
of ſinne, neither the judgements nor the mercies of God; for as we ſee
at this day, though God caſt many downe to the ground, as it were into
their ſicke beds, and hath graciouſly raiſed them up againe, and as hee
healed <hi>Malchus</hi> eare, hath healed them, yet they ſtraight-way ſtretch
out their hands to ſinne againſt God, and to grieve him: therefore wee
ſee, when a mans heart is obdurate and hardened with ſin, nothing will
doe him good; ſo it was in <hi>Pharaoh, Exod.</hi> 8. 15. <hi>His heart was hardened,
and he harkened not to them as the Lord had ſaid;</hi> ſo likewiſe, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. wee
ſee the great judgements that befell <hi>Corah, Dathan, and Abiram, that the
earth did cleave and ſwallow them up, ſo that all the people fled away at their crie,</hi>
and yet (the next day after) <hi>on the morrow, all the multitude of the children
of Iſrael did murmure againſt Moſes and Aaron,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Yee have killed the
Lords people,</hi> &amp;c. Hence we may learne, what a fearefull thing it is, to
have a hard and obdurate heart, nothing will move it, neither the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
nor the judgements of God: therefore let us pray to God to keepe
us from this fearefull condition, and to give us a ſoft heart, that when he
hath laid his judgements upon us, wee may be bettered by them, and
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:17958:99"/>
when we taſte of his mercies, we may be moved with them and brought
to repentance.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing implied in the taking of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Secondly, a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation of the laſt Iudgement.</note> is, that as he was
taken of the Iewes, ſo this ſhould put us in minde of the <hi>fearefull taking
at the laſt day;</hi> for looke how Chriſt was taken in the Garden, ſo every
unrepentant ſinner ſhall bee apprehended at the day of Iudgement, the
drunkard for his drunkenneſſe, the ſwearer for his ſwearing, the whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter
for his whoring; and ſo all unrepentant ſinners ſhall be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended,
yea, and it ſhall be in a more fearefull manner than Chriſts was;
For firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> he was apprehended of the wicked <hi>Iewes,</hi> wee ſhall bee of the
Angels: Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> he was brought before the barre of an <hi>earthly Iudge,</hi>
but we ſhall be brought before the barre of the heavenly Iudge, which
doth not only judge of the outward deeds and actions, but of our hearts
and thoughts; ſo hee ſaith, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. 23. <hi>Then all the Churches ſhall know
that I am he that ſearcheth the reines and hearts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> he was apprehended to <hi>temporall paines,</hi> but the wicked ſhall
be taken to eternall torments; as it is ſaid, <hi>Marke</hi> 9. <hi>the worme that never
dieth;</hi> there ſhall be no end of their torments: And this ſhall be the fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
apprehenſion of the wicked at the day of Iudgement: wherefore,
as the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 11. ſaith, <hi>Knowing therefore the terrour of
the Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> 
                  <hi>we perſwade men,</hi> &amp;c. So ſay I, knowing of this fearefull appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
of the wicked, at the laſt day of Iudgement, we perſwade men
to repent them of their ſins, and to pleaſe God, that So they may avoid
it: If a man heare that the Kings Writ is comming out againſt him, to
arreſt and carry him away to priſon,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> hee would ſurely make friends to
ſtay the Proceſſe and Writ; ſo, when we heare to know, that there is
a Writ againſt us from heaven to come upon us, we muſt labour to ſtop
it, and ſend up our prayers to God to ſtay his judgements, that ſo we
be not farther vexed with them: thus the taking of Chriſt, ſhould put us
in minde of the fearefull taking of the wicked at the day of Iudgement.</p>
               <p>The ſecond was,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>the binding of Chriſt;</hi> one would not thinke that the
Iewes would have bound him,<note place="margin">The binding of Chriſt: three reaſons of it, in regard of mans intention.</note> ſeeing he was ſo willing to be taken that
he offered himſelfe; yet there be divers reaſons thereof, in regard of the
<hi>Intention</hi> both of <hi>Man</hi> and of <hi>God;</hi> and firſt in regard of the <hi>Intention of
man,</hi> I will give you theſe three reaſons:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. For paine and puniſhment.</item>
                  <item>2. For caution and ſecuritie.</item>
                  <item>3. To put the more ſhame, and diſgrace upon him.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Firſt, for paine and puniſhment.</note> it was for <hi>Paine and puniſhment;</hi> ſo <hi>Paul</hi> in his perſecution bound
them that called upon the Name of the Lord, it was for puniſhment and
for paine; and ſo Chriſt was bound in regard of both: Moſt thinke they
can never be too harſh to Chriſt, and to his members, and never tender
enough to themſelves and to others; but theſe ſhall bee put to all the
paines: So we ſee, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105. 18. it is ſaid, that <hi>Ioſephs feet was in the ſtocks,
and the irons entered into his ſoule;</hi> that is, they entered into his live-fleſh;
ſo <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. it is ſaid of the faithfull, that <hi>ſome of them were ſawne in ſunder,
ſome racked, ſome were ſtoned, and put to the greateſt extremity that might bee;</hi>
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:17958:99"/>
Theeves, and murtherers and vile perſons, can finde favour and mercy,
but Chriſt and his members can finde none at the hands of the world.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Secondly, for the more ſecurity.</note> it was <hi>for caution ſake and ſecurity;</hi> becauſe they would hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him in his flight, and ſo keepe him ſafe; for this cauſe <hi>Peter, Act.</hi> 12.
had chaines laid upon him, to abate his force that he ſhould not hurt or
reſiſt them, and ſo <hi>Sampſon</hi> was bound: now none of theſe reaſons could
move the <hi>Iewes</hi> to binde <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for though he might have eſcaped, yet he
came and did offer himſelfe, and when they were downe on the ground,
Chriſt might have eſcaped and would not; therefore there was no cauſe
of feare: but this is the property of a bad conſcience to be afraid, when
there is no cauſe of feare: eſpecially of Chriſt and his ſervants.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Thirdly, to put the more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace upon Him.</note> it was <hi>to put the greater diſgrace and ſhame upon him:</hi> therefore
ſeeing Chriſt was content to have diſgrace and ſhame put upon him for
us, we ſhould be contented to ſuffer the like for him and for holy Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
now ſeeing Chriſt was contented to have diſgrace and ſhame put
upon him for us, though he was God, and wee men, he the Creator and
we the creatures, hee our Lord and we his ſervants, hee holy and we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy,
therefore let us be contented to be aſhamed and diſgraced for him;
ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, I am not aſhamed of the Goſpell of Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> So let
every one of us ſay, I am not aſhamed of Chriſtian and holy Religion:
And theſe be the Reaſons why Chriſt was bound, <hi>in regard of men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now as Chriſt was bound in regard of men,<note place="margin">Secondly, Hee was bound in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of God: for three cauſes,</note> ſo hee was bound in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of <hi>Gods intention:</hi> and that for <hi>three cauſes,</hi> firſt, <hi>To ſanctifie the bounds
of his ſervants,</hi> that if any ſhould ſuffer for his cauſe or for Religion, his
bands might bee ſanctified to them:<note place="margin">1</note> if wee ſuffer with Chriſt, then our
ſufferings become the ſufferings of Chriſt, he ſitteth at one end of the
ballance, and we at the other; <hi>Act.</hi> 26. ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>for the hopes
ſake of Iſrael</hi> I am bound with this chaine; And <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>So that my
hands in Chriſt are manifeſt in all the palace, and in all other places.</hi> This may
give comfort to man in bonds and in affliction, that by the meanes of
Chriſts bonds, they are ſanctified to him, this is the firſt cauſe why Chriſt
was bound in regard of <hi>Gods Intention.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>To teach us the deſert of our ſinnes;</hi> for as Chriſt was bound
and fettered for us, ſo wee deſerved to bee bound with the chaines of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
condemnation, and to be led away, that we ſhould never ſee God:
<hi>Eſai.</hi> 53. 5. ſaith the Prophet, <hi>The chastiſements of our peace was upon him,</hi> he
ſtood in our roome and place, and therefore looke how the <hi>Iewes</hi> tied
and bound <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſo we deſerve to be tyed and bound with the chaines
of darkneſſe for ever: wee ſee how many a man goes jeſting up and
downe, and does not conſider how Chriſt was bound and chained; but
know thou whoſoever thou art, this is thy deſert for ſinne, if God ſhould
draw out the arme of his juſtice againſt thee, and give thee thy due de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
puniſhment. It is the ſpeech of the holy man <hi>Ieremie,</hi> It is the
Lords mercy, that we are not all conſumed, it is his mercy, that we have
a houſe to put our heads in, a bed to lye in, one bit of bread to eate.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> Chriſt was bound, <hi>that wee might be looſed;</hi> his binding is our
looſing, for he was in our roome and place; now in that Chriſt hath ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:17958:100"/>
and was bound for us, wee are freed, the old debt cannot be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of us, for (as the Lawyers ſay) if the debt bee paid of the ſurety, in
good dealing it cannot bee required againe. Now there bee two kinds
of chaines, that Chriſt doth free us from.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The Chaine of Condemnation.</item>
                  <item>2. The Chaine of Corruption.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>the chaine of condemnation;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Firſt, the chaine of condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> for (as Divines ſay) the guilt of ſinne,
is the binding of a man to anſwer at Gods judgement barre for it; and
therfore every ſin that a man committeth,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> is a ſpirituall chaine, to binde
him to anſwer for it; and as poore priſoners goe bound in fetters and
chaines to anſwer at the ſeſſions, ſo a man goes bound in chaines by his
ſinnes to anſwer at Gods judgement ſeate. Now by Chriſt wee are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from theſe chaines ſo ſoone as wee are converted, and lay hold on
Chriſt: as <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1. <hi>There is no condemnation to thoſe that bee in Chriſt:</hi>
ſome paine there may bee,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> as when a jaylor comes to knock off a priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
irons, it may be he may wring him this way and that way, and that
may be more paine to him than his chaines were before; yet he is well
contented with it, becauſe it is to free him; ſo when we bee converted
to God and lay hold on Chriſt by faith, when the chaines of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
be a knocking off, we may have more trouble of conſcience than
before we had, but becauſe it is to free us, we ſhould be content with it;
it will not laſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Secondly, the chaine of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> wee are looſed from <hi>the chaine of corruption,</hi> and of our
ſinnes; for as a man that is faſt chained and bound cannot ſtirre, move,
goe,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> or doe any thing; ſo when men bee bound in their ſinnes they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
performe holy duties and ſervices to the Lord; therefore, canſt not
thou pray nor performe any good duty to God? then thou art not yet
freed of thy chaines of corruption, for thoſe that Chriſt hath redeemed,
he hath redeemed <hi>to ſerve him, in holineſſe and righteouſneſſe, Luk.</hi> 1. 51.
<hi>Rom.</hi> 6. This is alwaies a conſequent of the former, therefore if thou
bee ſtill a ſwearer, a drunkard, a deceiver, or a bad liver, thou art not
freed from the chaines of condemnation, therefore wee muſt labour to
bee freed from the latter chaine, and then wee ſhall be ſure to bee freed
from the former chaine.</p>
               <p>Againe, ſeeing <hi>Chriſt</hi> was contented to bee bound of men, wee ſhould
be contented to be bound of God; <hi>Ezek.</hi> 4. 8. ſaith the Lord, <hi>Sonne of
man,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> 
                  <hi>I will lay bands upon thee;</hi> ſo the Lord hath put bands and holy ties
upon us; for every time we goe to the Lords Table, wee binde and tye
our ſelves to the Lord in holy vowes and reſolutions to ſerve him: <hi>Pſal.</hi>
118. 27. The <hi>beaſts</hi> that were <hi>ſacrificed</hi> were <hi>bound to the hornes of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi>
that they ſhould not ſtart away for feare of the bloody knife; ſo
we ſhould be content to binde and tye our ſelves to God, by all the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bonds and ties that may bee, that wee doe not ſtart away from Gods
ſervice, in trouble and temptation.</p>
               <p>The third thing is,<note place="margin">Thirdly, Chriſts leading away.</note> 
                  <hi>the leading away of Chriſt;</hi> firſt, to <hi>Annas,</hi> then to
<hi>Caiphas.</hi> Now as Chriſt was led up and downe, and toſſed from place
to place; ſo we deſerve to be tumbled, and toſſed from place to place;
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:17958:100"/>
not to have an houſe to dwell in, nor a bed to lye in, nor to have any
reſting place, for thus was Chriſt toſſed up and downe, firſt to <hi>Annas,</hi>
then to <hi>Caiphas;</hi> and what was the manner, how did they lead him,
quietly (as his behaviour deſerved?) no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ut as <hi>Marke</hi> ſheweth, they
led him away in ſo great rage and fury, that a good man hearing of it
(being in the dead time of the night) roſe up and followed him in his
ſhirt; whom when the ſouldiers ſaw, they ſtraight-way laid hands on
him, ſo as the man loſt his ſhirt, and fled away to ſave himſelfe; which
the Evangeliſt notes to ſhew the extremitie that they uſed, they were
ſo furious, that they would not ſuffer a naked man to follow Chriſt,
but they would ſtraight-way lay hold on him: Thus we may ſee what
a deale of labour, and pain, and toile it coſt Chriſt to redeeme our ſoules,
that ſo we ſeeing it, may not ſell our ſoules to the Devill for a little eaſe,
pleaſure, or profit: Doe thou but conſider, whoſoever thou art, that
Chriſt doth ſpeake unto thee in the way of his paſſion; O man, O wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
for thy ſake was I taken of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> bound, led away to be judged,
killed and ſaid in the grave; therefore ſeeing it coſt me ſuch a deale of
paine and labour to redeeme thee, doe not ſell thy ſoule for a little mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
But in this ſtory of the naked man, foure things are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. A deſcription of the perſon.</item>
                  <item>2. A declaration of his love.</item>
                  <item>3. The rage of the ſouldiers.</item>
                  <item>4. The eſcape he made.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>A deſcription of his perſon;</hi> there is great queſtion who this young
man ſhould be,<note place="margin">1</note> ſome of the Fathers take it to be <hi>Iames,</hi> the Lords bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
becauſe he went in a linnen garment,<note place="margin">The Perſon.</note> for they ſay, he was one of the
Prieſts: To this I anſwer, that it could not be <hi>Iames,</hi> for theſe two rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons:
Firſt, becauſe in the verſe going before, it is ſaid, that <hi>all the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Chriſt fled;</hi> Now <hi>Iames</hi> was one of his Diſciples, and therefore it
could not be he: Secondly, although the <hi>Prieſts</hi> did weare linnen gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
yet they but weare them in the <hi>Temple;</hi> when they went out,
they did plucke them off, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44. 19. therefore it could not be <hi>Iames:</hi>
ſome others thinke it was the Evangeliſt <hi>Iohn,</hi> as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> and <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi>
but it could not be he, becauſe <hi>Iohn</hi> did follow <hi>Chriſt</hi> into the <hi>high
Prieſts Hall, Iohn</hi> 18. 15. But this man did flie away: And therefore I
take their opinion to be moſt probable, who thinke it was a good young
man, that dwelt thereabouts, that hearing ſuch a ſtirre and adoe about
the taking of Chriſt, did ariſe to ſee what would become of him; but
what ever he was, we finde him thus deſcribed.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> he is ſaid to be <hi>a young man</hi> that did follow Chriſt; To teach us
that young men muſt looke after Chriſt,<note place="margin">A Young man.</note> and be followers of him: So
the Wiſe-man, <hi>Eecles.</hi> 12. 13. <hi>Remember thy Creator now in the dayes of thy
youth:</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 9. <hi>Wherewithall ſhall a young man cleanſe his way? by
taking heed there unto according to thy Word:</hi> So wee ſee that young men
ſhould look after Chriſt; it is the ſinne of this age, that ſuch never looke
after Chriſt, but regard their eaſe, liberty, pleaſures and profits; they
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:17958:101"/>
care not for Chriſt, they are no followers of him; <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 12. 3. we may ſee
that <hi>Iaakob did ſtrive for the birthright in the wombe;</hi> ſo men must ſtrive to
follow Chriſt when they be young, for no man can come too ſoone;
We ſee when men ingrave letters on a tree,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> as the tree groweth greater,
ſo will the letters; ſo labour thou to put the ſeeds of grace into thy
childe when he is young, and hee will grow in grace, as hee growes in
yeeres.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> it is ſaid, <hi>A certaine young man;</hi> he was no great man of note,
there was no fame of him, he was an obſcure man; and yet he did follow
Chriſt when his Diſciples fled: Which may teach us, that if the Spirit
of grace be in us, at one time or other it will shew it ſelfe in us; <hi>Iames</hi> 2.
it is ſaid, <hi>ſhew me thy faith;</hi> for if a man have true faith, it will ſhew it ſelfe
at one time or other; this man was but an obſcure man, and yet hee fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
Chriſt when all his Diſciples were fled; ſo it falleth out ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
when great profeſſors fall away in the time of trouble, then weak
ones ſhew their religion and be followers of Chriſt; as <hi>Iohn</hi> 19. we may
ſee that <hi>Ioſeph of Arimathea</hi> was a cloſe Diſciple, and yet when all the
Diſciples fled, he goeth to <hi>Pilate boldly,</hi> and begged the body of Chriſt:
Which is an excellent comfort, that if the worke of grace be in us, it
will ſhew it ſelfe at one time or other.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>The declaration of his love,</hi> and that is ſeene in his actions:
First,<note place="margin">The declaration of his Love.</note> that he did ſtart out of his bed and come to Chriſt, for although
he were in his warme bed, in a cold night, faſt aſleepe about midnight,
when he had but a little inkling of him,<note place="margin">1</note> he ſtarts out to follow Chriſt:
Which may teach us, that if we truly love Chriſt, it is not our warme
beds that can hold us, nor our pleaſures, profits, or eaſe from following
him; ſo we ſee, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. <hi>Zacheus,</hi> when he heard Chriſt ſhould come by,
<hi>gets him up to a tree to ſee Chriſt,</hi> because of the preſſe of the people; and ſo
<hi>Mary,</hi> when ſhe heard <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the houſe, ſhe could not hold, but <hi>went
out to meet him;</hi> ſo the Church, <hi>Cantic.</hi> 5. 6. when <hi>Chriſt</hi> had given but a
knocke at the doore, ſhee runnes out after him, and could not be at reſt
till ſhe had found him: Thus where there is true grace, or love, they
will make declaration of it; and where there is a preſence of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in
grace and goodneſſe, it is not their warme beds, nor their houſes can
hold them, but they will follow after Chriſt, where his preſence is, there
they delight to be; therefore when it is not ſo with us, but every little
matter will hold us from Chriſt; this doth ſhew that our hearts are not
poſſeſſed with the true love of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Action,<note place="margin">2</note> wherein he declares his love, was, that <hi>hee fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
Chriſt;</hi> he did not follow the ſouldiers; and this his love will be
more perſpicuous, if we conſider it in theſe three circumſtances:</p>
               <p>First,<note place="margin">1</note> that he followed Chriſt <hi>when he was in bonds,</hi> when he was taken
of the high <hi>Prieſts,</hi> and of the wicked <hi>Iewes;</hi> not in the time of peace and
libertie, but in the time of trouble and danger, when the greateſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
and infamie was upon him: which may teach us, that it is an eaſie
matter to follow Chriſt in the time of peace and libertie; but to follow
him in the time of trouble and danger, this doth ſhew the true love of
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:17958:101"/>
Chriſt; <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. 8. the Church of <hi>Smyrna</hi> is commended for keeping his
Name, and that ſhee denied not the faith, even in the time of trouble,
when <hi>Antiphas,</hi> Gods faithfull ſervant was ſlaine; ſo the Church, <hi>Pſalm.</hi>
44. 17. <hi>All this is come upon us, yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we
dealt falſly in thy covenant, our heart is not turned backe,</hi> &amp;c. So it is a hard
matter to follow Chriſt in the time of trouble and danger, but eaſie to
follow him in the time of peace; we ſee when a floud comes, (as I have
ſhewed you before) it will carry away ſticks, and ſtrawes, and such like,
but ſuch things as are rooted, as trees and the like, they ſtand faſt, and
move not; ſo when trouble and perſecution comes like a floud, all that
be not rooted and grounded in the truth in carries away; but if men be
rooted and grounded in grace, then they ſtand and are not moved, nor
carried away: this commends the love of the young man to Chriſt, that
it was not in the time of peace, but in the time of trouble.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> he did follow Chriſt, <hi>when all his Diſciples fled,</hi> which were
the great preachers and profeſſours of his name: This may teach us that
although wee ſee great preachers and profeſſours fall away and decline
from God, yet we ſhould follow him and ſticke to him; therefore we
are not to depend upon any mans perſon whatſoever: For if a man have
felt the worke of Chriſt in him, though all forſake him, yet he will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
him: we ſee in the Goſpell, the man out of whom Chriſt had caſt
out a devill, when all the countrey forſooke him, yet this poore man did
follow Chriſt ſtill; ſo if Chriſt have caſt out the devill in us, though all
ſhould forſake him, yet we ſhould follow him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> he followeth Chriſt <hi>in his ſhirt,</hi> when he had nothing on but
a ſhirt or a linnen garment, and that in a cold night too, when <hi>Peter</hi> was
glad to goe to the fire; but it is our daintineſſe and niceneſſe, that wee
cannot follow Chriſt, except it be in our warme beds, and in our cloaths;
if we be puniſhed and want, then we ceaſe, every little matter will keep
us from following of him; this is the reaſon why men doe not come to
Church, in the Summer it is too hot, and in the Winter we ſtand with
Chriſt for ſmall matters, for a drop of water, when hee hath not ſtood
with us for great matters, but hath ſhed forth ſtreames of his most pure
bloud for us: thus this young man did declare his love to Chriſt, that he
was contented to follow him with any inconvenience; ſo we, if we had
taſted of the power of Chriſt, wee would be contented to follow him,
notwithſtanding any inconvenience.</p>
               <p>The third thing was,<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>The rage of the ſouldiers,</hi> that when they percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
him to be a favourer of Chriſt,<note place="margin">The souldiers rage.</note> they ſtraight-way laid hold on him:
This is the rage of the world ſtill, that if men be friends to religion and
favourers to that, they ſtraight-way lay hold on them; but let a man be
a drunkard, or a ſwearer, or a prophane perſon, they will never touch
him; <hi>Act.</hi> 9. it is ſaid, that <hi>Saul bound all them that called on the name of the
Lord;</hi> this was matter enough to binde them for: So in <hi>Tertullians</hi> time,
if men were friends to religion, O this man is a good man, this man is a
Chriſtian, a lover of religion; thus they reproched him, this is the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment,
that Chriſt and his ſervants have in this world; therefore
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:17958:102"/>
it is good to take that counſell that Chriſt gives us, that wee must doe
like the <hi>wiſe builder,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>conſider before-hand what his building will cost him;</hi> ſo we
ſhould conſider what it may coſt us when we enter upon religion, it may
be it will coſt us our libertie, our goods, our peace, nay, it may coſt us
our lives.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4</note> 
                  <hi>His eſcape, he left his garment and fled:</hi> here is a queſtion made,
whether this man did well to flie?<note place="margin">His eſcape.</note> I anſwer, he did well, for a man may
flie in two caſes:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. When he hath not a calling to ſtay.</item>
                  <item>2. When he hath not ſufficient ſtrength to ſuffer.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Now this may teach us an excellent point of wiſdome; this man
was rather contented to loſe all his garments, and flie, than to betray
Chriſt, and to loſe the peace of a good conſcience; ſo if men finde not
ſufficient ſtrength to ſuffer, rather than they ſhould betray religion, and
loſe the peace of their conſcience, let them rather loſe their coat and
ſhirt; as <hi>Ioseph,</hi> we ſee, rather than he would loſe his honeſty, he would
loſe his clothes; ſo we, rather than loſe the peace of our conſcience, let
all other things fall to the ground:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> As a man in a ſhipwracke, hee never
thinkes of his loſſes, but is well contented if hee can ſave his life, hee is
thankfull to God, and rejoyceth that he himſelfe hath eſcaped; ſo when
the time of trouble and perſecution is, let us not thinke of our loſſes, if
we can eſcape with the peace of our conſcience, let us bee thankfull to
God; it is the courſe of the world, that if any ſtrange diſeaſe fall upon
their children, or their cattell, they ſay they are bewitched, when as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it is their ſinnes that doth bewitch them; and what doe they then
ſay? they have been damnified by a bad witch, therefore they must goe
to a good witch to have helpe, and ſometimes they doe ſo, loſing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the peace of their conſciences; but rather than we ſhould doe ſo, let
us loſe children, and cattell, and all, before we loſe Gods favour and the
peace of conſcience; <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. our Saviour ſaith to his Diſciples, <hi>Bee
yee wiſe as Serpents:</hi> Now this is the wiſdome of the <hi>Serpent,</hi> that he will
take a wound any where rather than on his head, becauſe life lieth there;
ſo rather than we ſhould loſe Chriſt, let us loſe all, becauſe Chriſt is our
life: Thus this young man teacheth us wiſdome, who rather than hee
would betray Chriſt, loſt his garments, and ran away.</p>

                  <note place="margin">SERM. XVII.</note> for
though Chriſt might have beene killed in the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult,
yet he was preſerved.<note place="margin">Before whom he was Arraigned.</note> In the <hi>Arraignment of
Chriſt,</hi> we obſerve three things:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The perſons, before whom he was Arraigned.</item>
                  <item>2. The cauſes for which he was Arraigned.</item>
                  <item>3. The manner of his Arraignment.</item>
               </list>
               <p>First, <hi>The perſons before whom he was arraigned, Annas</hi> and <hi>Caiphas,</hi> the
two high Prieſts; it is worth our obſervation that theſe Prieſts were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
together <hi>early</hi> in the morning, for they could not be at reſt, till
they had apprehended and condemned him; no queſtion there were a
number of other Prieſts with them at the ſame time, who would not in
all probabilitie have beene hired for any money to come out of their
warme beds to have done good; but to condemne Chriſt they are up all
night, and that a cold night too: ſo it is a corruption ſtill, that men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
abide to ſit up about any good duties of religion, to repent of their
ſinnes, to pray to God; to ſpeake of good things, then they are aſleepe
ſtraight, but to ſit up long at dice and cards and other paſtimes, this is
their delight: <hi>Luke</hi> 5. we ſee the <hi>Diſciples,</hi> when they were fiſhing, they
could hold out and not ſleepe, but when they came to pray with Chriſt
in the Garden, they were ſtraight aſleepe, and there alſo, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>
he ſlept not, but was buſie about his market, with the <hi>Prieſts</hi> conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to take him; it is ſaid of ſuch, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 16. That <hi>they cannot ſleepe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
they have done evill, and their ſleepe departeth except they cauſe ſome to fall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this diligence in the Prieſts, ſhould teach us diligence in the
performing of good duties, for if they would ſpend whole nights to
bring their wicked purpoſes to paſſe, oh how diligent ſhould we be to
performe ſervice to God: <hi>Marke</hi> 1. 35. we ſee our Saviour <hi>aroſe early in
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:17958:103"/>
the morning to pray,</hi> and yet how ſlow are wee who cannot get up an
houre after Sunne in the morning to performe good duties?</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Secondly, the cauſes why Chriſt was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned.</note> 
                  <hi>the cauſes why Chriſt was arraigned,</hi> were three: firſt, <hi>that wee
might not be arraigned and condemned as the day of judgement;</hi> for he ſtood
in our roome, interpoſed himſelfe for us, and was contented to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of the Iewes,<note place="margin">1</note> to be led away, arraigned and condemned, and to dye
for us; therefore a Chriſtian beleever may have comfort, that ſeeing
Chriſt was arraigned for him before men, hee ſhall not be arraigned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1. <hi>There is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt
Ieſus, &amp;c.</hi> and againe in the ſame Chap. verſ. 35. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing
to the charge of Gods choſen? It is God that justifieth, who ſhall condemne?</hi> ſo
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. <hi>He that beleeveth in me ſhall not periſh, but ſhall have everlaſting life:</hi>
therefore if we beleeve, we have a certificate from God that wee ſhall
not bee condemned: when the devill is ready to accuſe us, and to ſay
thou art a vile ſinner, and thou muſt come before God, to bee arraigned
and condemned for thy ſinnes, we must not deny the matter, but ſay,
it is true Sathan, I am a great and grievous ſinner againſt God, but Chriſt
was arraigned and condemned for me, and though I ſuffer not in my
owne perſon, yet Chriſt hath for me, and therefore it ſhall not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
at my hands.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>that he might have compaſſion, and pitty on them that ſuffer, and
be arraigned for good cauſes;</hi> as <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 15. ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>For we have
not an high Prieſt, that cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but
was in all things tempted in like ſort as we are, yet without ſinne:</hi> therefore
ſeeing Chriſt was arraigned, doe not thou doubt, but if thou bee arraig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
for a good cauſe, Chriſt will releeve thee and ſhew compaſſion on
thee; as <hi>Pauls</hi> experience was 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 17. <hi>And I was delivered out of the
mouth of the Lion, &amp;c.</hi> This hath made good men confident to hold out
in trouble, as <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. when the king would have had the <hi>three Children</hi>
to have worſhipped the image, which hee had made, ſay they, <hi>we are not
carefull to anſwer thee in this matter, behold our God whom we ſerve is able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
us:</hi> ſo <hi>Act.</hi> 4. when the Apoſtles were brought before the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors,
and forbidden to preach, they ſaid, <hi>They could not but ſpeake the
things they had heard and ſeene:</hi> therefore (as Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſaith,) a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
may be killed, but cannot be overcome; becauſe he that is in them
is greater than he that is in the world.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>that we might ſet up a throne in our owne hearts, and arraigne our
ſelves of ſinne;</hi> for Chriſts arraignement must teach us to arraigne ſinne,
as he was killed, ſo we muſt kill ſinne, as Chriſt was buried, ſo wee muſt
bury ſinne, to which purpoſe it is ſaid, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 31. <hi>If we would judge
our ſelves, we ſhould not be judged</hi> of the Lord; ſo our judgement is to
prevent the judgement of the Lord. Thus many good men have in
holy Scripture arraigned themſelves,<note place="margin">Iob 9. 20.</note> as <hi>Iob, If</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I ſhould justifie my
ſelfe, yee then would condemne me: David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 17. <hi>It is I that have
ſinned, but theſe ſheepe what have they done?</hi> ſo the Church <hi>Eſai.</hi> 53. <hi>wee
are all like ſheepe, that are gone out of the way.</hi> To this purpoſe is that of <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſostome;</hi>
If thou wilt be a Iudge, ſet up a throne in thine owne heart, and
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:17958:103"/>
arraigne thy ſelfe, God hath not made thee a Iudge of another man,
but of thy owne life: thus the arraignment of Chriſt ſhould teach us to
arraigne our ſelves.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Thirdly, the manner of his arraignment.</note> 
                  <hi>the manner how;</hi> judicially under a colour of law, as if they
did intend juſtice, whereas they intended nothing leſſe, under this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
they condemne the innocent: and I would it were not ſo ſtill in the
world, that under the ſhew of law, they deſtroy the innocent: that it
was ſo of old appeares, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21. where <hi>Ahab</hi> killed <hi>Naboth</hi> under
colour of law, and <hi>Act.</hi> 7. 23. <hi>Steven</hi> was before <hi>Ananias;</hi> yea and
now alſo are there a number of ſuch <hi>Caiphas</hi>'s in the world, that will ſay
they doe nothing but law, and yet under the colour thereof deſtroy
the innocent: but this may be a comfort to a Chriſtian, that though he
be condemned in the court of man, yet hee is cleare in the great court of
God, where he ſhall be acquitted from all unjuſt taxations. Now there be
foure teſtimonies of <hi>Chriſts innocency.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First,<note place="margin">Foure teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Chriſts innocencie.</note> 
                  <hi>that they ſought picked matter againſt Him,</hi> they had none before
they had taken him, now they ſeeke matter againſt him, and therefore
they examine him <hi>of his Diſciples,</hi> and <hi>of his Doctrine;</hi> thinking thereby
to picke out ſomething that they might lay to his charge, and finde
him guilty thereupon: but hee <hi>who was the wiſedome of the Father,</hi> ſtaves
them off, and keepes them from taking any occaſion from his words, by
his wiſe and diſcreet anſwer; as ſhall appeare if we take into conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
theſe two things:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. His holy concealement.</item>
                  <item>2. His holy defence.</item>
               </list>
               <p>First,<note place="margin">First, his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealement.</note> for <hi>His holy concealement</hi> he doth not discover his Diſciples,
but anſwers onely for his Doctrine; not a word of them; hee might
have ſaid, One of them betraied him, and another had denied him, and
that they all fled from him, and ranne away; but becauſe he could not
ſpeake any good of them, therefore Hee rather would ſay nothing;
would to God men would thinke of this, when they ſpeake of their
neighbours, if they cannot ſpeake any good of them, rather not to
ſpeake at all: but it is a corruption in nature that men had rather ſpeake
of their neighbours vices, than of their vertues, contrary to that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,
<hi>Tit.</hi> 2. <hi>to ſpeake evill of no man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Secondly, his defence.</note> 
                  <hi>His holy defence,</hi> he defends his doctrine, and ſends them to al
the common people, that they might teſtifie of it; ſaith hee, <hi>I ſpake
openly to the world, I ever taught openly in the Synagogues and in the Temple,
whither the Iewes reſorted continually; And in ſecret places have I ſaid nothing;</hi>
aske them that heard me, he cared not who ſhould judge him, though
if were his enemies: which ſhould teach us that wee ſhould ſo live, as
that our enemies can have no juſt cauſe againſt us; ſo <hi>Paul</hi> carried him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 10. <hi>Yee are witneſſes, and God alſo, how holily, and justly, and
unblameably we behaved our ſelves amongst you:</hi> and the Prophet 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.
3. <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>here am I, witneſſe against me before the Lord, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his annointed, whoſe exe have I taken, &amp;c?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>that they ſought for witneſſes against him;</hi> there were enow
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:17958:104"/>
of witneſſes for him, but they ſeeke for witneſſes against him; if they
had asked <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> he could have told that <hi>no man could have done thoſe
miracles, except God were with him.</hi> So if they had asked the <hi>blinde man
Ioh.</hi> 9. 33. or <hi>the people, Mark.</hi> 7. 37. they would have told them, <hi>Hee
hath done all things well:</hi> or the <hi>officers and ſergeants,</hi> and they would
have anſwered, <hi>Never man ſpake like this man, Ioh.</hi> 7. 46. they might
have found enough to cleare Chriſts innocency, but they were bent
the other way.</p>
               <p>The third was,<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>that they got witneſſes, but their witneſſes did not agree;</hi> for
howſoever the Prieſts had plotted the matter, and put into their mouths,
yet they diſagreed; ſo let men take heed, how they bee falſe witneſſes,
they may plot the matter and yet be confounded in their ſpeech, and ſo
bring a reproch to themſelves: and let ſuch remember what is written,
<hi>Prov.</hi> 19. 9. <hi>That a falſe witneſſe ſhall not be unpuniſhed, &amp;c.</hi> Now the <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists</hi>
declare the matter further by an example of two falſe witneſſes,
that came in againſt him, the one alleaging this man ſaid, <hi>I can deſtroy the
Temple of God, and build it againe in three daies; Marke</hi> relates it, <hi>we heard
him ſay, I will destroy this Temple that is made with hands, and in three daies I
will build another made without hands.</hi> Now the Spirit of God calleth
them falſe witneſſes, for though Chriſt ſpake ſome ſuch words, yet it
was contrary to this ſenſe and meaning; for they ſpake of the materiall
Temple, and Hee of the Temple of his body. And this muſt make us
take heed how we report the words of Chriſt, leſt wee be falſe witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
againſt him, as the Papiſts are, who literally taking theſe words, <hi>This
is my body,</hi> ſay, that the bread is the reall body of Chriſt, as he was borne
of the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> Chriſt meaneth ſpiritually, that it is a ſigne of
his body; though they take it for the materiall body of Chriſt; ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
the Arrians are falſe witneſſes becauſe Chriſt ſaith, <hi>My father is greater
than I,</hi> they ſay Chriſt is not equall with the Father: but he ſpake in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of his humanity.</p>
               <p>The fourth teſtimony of his innocencie was,<note place="margin">4</note> that <hi>Hee was condemned
for the truth;</hi> for he ſaid, he was the <hi>Sonne of God,</hi> as he was indeed, and
ſo he died an innocent man. But why doth Chriſt inlarge this anſwer:
for two cauſes:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. To comfort himſelfe.</item>
                  <item>2. To terrifie his enemies.</item>
               </list>
               <p>First,<note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>to comfort himſelfe;</hi> that howſoever hee ſtood now as a poore
priſoner arraigned and condemned at their barre, yet one day they ſhall
come before him, to be arraigned of him; there he doth comfort him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
with future glory: now as Chriſt did comfort himſelfe even ſo
ſhould all Chriſtians in the time of their afflictions, when they be ſicke,
poore and in diſtreſſe, whatſoever thy eſtate be meane or poore, yet one
day thinke, I ſhall be with God, where I ſhall not want anything: thus
Chriſt comforts his Diſciples, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. <hi>Verely I ſay unto you, that when
the Sonne of man ſhall ſit in the throne of his majesty, ye which have followed mee
in the regeneration, ſhall ſit upon twelve thrones and judge the twelve tribes of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael:</hi>
ſo <hi>Stephen</hi> comforts himſelfe, when a ſhowre of ſtones came about
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:17958:104"/>
him, in that <hi>he ſaw heaven open, and Chriſt ſtanding at Gods right hand,</hi> ready
to helpe him, and receive his ſoule.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>to terrifie his enemies;</hi> for howſoever they thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
great men; yet one day they were to have Chriſt to bee their
Iudge: even this ſame poore Ieſus: O that the world would thinke of
this, that this <hi>Ieſus,</hi> whom they have deſpiſed and condemned, ſhall bee
their Iudge, at laſt.</p>
               <p>Now I thought to have paſſed over the condemnation of Chriſt, and
to have spoken little of it, but we muſt doe, as the Goldſmith, who will
not loſe the leaſt fine of his gold,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> but he will gather it up; ſo we ſhould
not loſe the leaſt thing or circumſtance touching Chriſt, but ſhould ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
all up: as in the Law wee read the Lord commanded, that the aſhes
and cinders of the burnt offerings ſhould be gathered up,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and laid in a
cleane place; in like manner wee ſhould doe, gather up the very aſhes
and cinders of the ſufferings of Chriſt, wherefore our hearts must bee
the cleane place, to lay them up in; that ſo wee may thinke of the great
love of Chriſt, to us and be provoked to love him againe, who hath lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
us, and waſhed away our ſinnes. Now Chriſt was condemned in
two courts; in the <hi>Eccleſiasticall,</hi> before <hi>Annas</hi> and <hi>Caiphas;</hi> and in the
<hi>Temporall,</hi> before <hi>Pilate;</hi> the one whereof was a forerunner of the other;
and the reaſon is, becauſe the gouernment was not in the hands of the
<hi>Iewes,</hi> who could not put any to death: but in the hands of the <hi>Romans</hi>
under whom <hi>Pilate</hi> was the chiefe governour, therefore wee will onely
ſpeake of the condemnation of <hi>Christ</hi> under <hi>Pilate;</hi> where we will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
theſe foure things:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. How many times Pilate ſought to deliver Christ.</item>
                  <item>2. What was the meanes he uſed.</item>
                  <item>3. What made him ſtand ſo ſtiffe for Christ.</item>
                  <item>4. What drew him on to condemne Christ contrary to the light of
his judgement.</item>
               </list>
               <p>First,<note place="margin">First, how often Pilate ſought to deliver Christ. The first time.</note> how many times <hi>Pilate</hi> laboured to cleere Chriſt before hee
condemned him; and that appeares to bee foure ſeverall times; firſt,
when they accuſed him, ſaying, they had found this man perverting the
people, and forbidding to pay tribute to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> ſaying that he is Chriſt
our king, <hi>Pilate</hi> asked him, ſaying, <hi>Art thou the king of the Iewes?</hi> unto
which he anſwered and ſaid, <hi>Thou ſaiest it:</hi> then ſaid <hi>Pilate</hi> to the high
Prieſts, and to the people, I finde no fault in him; indeed it is true, that
he is a king, but his kingdome hee ſaith is not of this world, therefore
<hi>Caeſar</hi> neede not to bee afraid of him, I ſee no cauſe of death in him:
you ſay hee is a king: what though? it is of no worldly kingdome, as
<hi>Caeſars</hi> is, but it is a kingdome of another world: therefore <hi>Pilate</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
to free Chriſt at this time.</p>
               <p>Now in the anſwer of Chriſt to <hi>Pilate;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1</note> we obſerve two things: First,
that <hi>hee doth profeſſe hee is a king:</hi> this is that ſame good confeſſion <hi>Paul</hi>
ſpeaketh of 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 12. who (under <hi>Pontius Pilate) witneſſed a good
confeſſion;</hi> therefore ſeeing Chriſt is a king wee muſt ſo accept of and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him, as to bee ordered by him in our life and converſation, and
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:17958:105"/>
governed by his Lawes, becauſe hee is the King of the Church, and of
all the world: it is the ſinne of the time, that men can be contented to
have Chriſt to bee their Saviour and redeemer, to ſave them by his
bloud, but they cannot abide to have him to be their King; as <hi>Luke</hi> 19.
they ſay, <hi>Wee will not have this man to rule over us;</hi> ſo men now adayes
can be contented to have Chriſt to teach and to preach to them; but
they cannot abide to have him to be their King, to rule or raigne over
them, in their life and converſation; but for this cauſe was he borne, and
for this cauſe did he die; therefore if thou wilt ever raigne with him in
the kingdome of glory, thou must be ruled by him in the kingdome of
Grace.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> he ſaith, <hi>his kingdome is not of this world,</hi> it doth not conſiſt
in the pompe and glory of this world, for Chriſts kingdome is of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
world, in heaven, a kingdome above the clouds, of glory and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse:
Which must teach us, that ſeeing Chriſts kingdome is not of
this world; they that be ſubjects of Chriſt must not looke for eſpecially
worldly matters, or preferments; therefore, in ſickneſſe, paines, troubles
and afflictions, we must ſay, my kingdome is not of this world, but above
the clouds, it is an heavenly kingdome, a kingdome of glory and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe,
my comfort is laid up there: when ſickneſſe and troubles are
come upon a man, hee muſt carry up his thoughts and ſay, though I am
ſicke, poore, in diſtreſſe and diſgrace, yet it ſhall not alwayes be ſo with
me,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> for my kingdome is not of this world: If the heire of a great King
ſhould be in a ſtrange place, and hardly uſed there, he would gather up
his thoughts and think with himſelfe, I am but a ſtranger here, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they uſe me hardly, but when I come home againe into mine owne
kingdome, then it ſhall be otherwiſe with me; ſo when wee bee hardly
uſed here, we muſt conſider that wee are ſtrangers, and therefore they
doe hardly uſe us, but when we come at our Fathers houſe, we ſhall have
more comfort than this world can afford us. Againe, ſeeing our king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
is not of this world, but a heavenly kingdome, the glory whereof
farre exceeds all the tranſitory things of this life; therefore wert thou
a ſubject of the beſt kingdome of the world, know it is nothing unleſſe
thou be a ſubject of Chriſts kingdome; it is nothing to bee a citizen of
the beſt citie in the world, unleſſe thou be a citizen of the kingdome of
Chriſt: Therefore labour to be a ſubject in the kingdome of grace, to
live by faith, to be obedient to Gods Commandements, to be patient in
troubles, and then thou ſhalt be a ſubject in the kingdome of glory: The
<hi>Queene</hi> of the <hi>South</hi> came from the uttermoſt parts of the earth to heare
the wiſdome of <hi>Salomon,</hi> which when ſhee came and heard, ſhe thought
it a great preferment to be one of his ſubjects; ſaith ſhee, <hi>Happie are thy
men,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 King. 10. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>happie are theſe thy ſervants, which ſtand continually before thee,</hi> &amp;c. Now
if it were a happie thing to be a ſubject in that kingdome, much more is
it a happie thing to be a ſubject in the kingdome of Chriſt; therefore let
us labour to bee ſubjects to Chriſt in the kingdome of grace, that wee
may be ſubjects in the kingdome of glroy.</p>
               <p>The ſecond time that <hi>Pilate</hi> laboured to free Chriſt,<note place="margin">The ſecond time.</note> and to ſet him at
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:17958:105"/>
libertie, was, after he had ſent him to <hi>Herod;</hi> it is ſaid, That <hi>he called to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
the high Prieſts, and the rulers of the people, and ſaid unto them, yee have
brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people, and behold, I having
examined him before you, have found no fault in this man, concerning thoſe things
whereof ye accuſe him;</hi> no, nor yet <hi>Herod, for I ſent you to him, and loe nothing
worthy of death is done unto him.</hi> This ye ſee is the ſecond time that <hi>Pilate</hi>
ſought to deliver Chriſt: Which may teach us to be conſtant in a good
courſe, although things doe not ſucceed well at firſt, and have the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
we deſire, yet we muſt not give over, but to it againe and againe:
It is the ſinne of the world, that if things doe not ſucceed well at the
firſt, they give over a good cauſe, and are diſcouraged; as <hi>Hag.</hi> 1. when
the <hi>Iewes</hi> were hindered from building the Temple, ſtraight-way they
left off; ſo men be quickly diſcouraged in good courſes, but it muſt be
the wiſdome of a Chriſtian, though things doe not ſucceed preſently,
yet to goe on againe and againe: This was the wiſdome of <hi>Pilate,</hi> and
muſt be our wiſdome alſo; as it is obſerved of the <hi>Spider,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Proverbs.</note> that although
ſhe be hindered in her labour, and one come with a broome and ſweepe
downe her web, ſhe will up againe the next day; ſo this muſt be the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of a Chriſtian, though he doe not ſucceed well in a good courſe,
and in his labours at firſt, yet he muſt not give over, but to it againe and
againe, as long as there is life in him.</p>
               <p>The third time,<note place="margin">The third time.</note> when he laboured to free Chriſt, was when hee joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>Barabbas</hi> together, thinking by this meanes they would
have rather freed <hi>Christ</hi> than <hi>Barabbas;</hi> nevertheleſſe, when he ſaw this
would not prevaile, he asked, <hi>But what evill hath he done? I finde no fault in
him,</hi> it is againſt my conſcience to put him to death; therefore he takes
water, and waſhes his hands, but yet he could not cleare himſelfe from
the bloud of Chriſt, all the water in the ſea was not able to waſh him
cleane: Now there be ſome that have their hands as deepe as <hi>Pilate</hi> in
the bloud of Chriſt, I doe not ſay it of my ſelfe, but the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> tels
us as much, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6. 5, 6. That <hi>they which have tasted of the good word of God,
and of the powers of the world to come; If they fall away, it is impoſſible that they
ſhould be renewed againe by repentance, ſeeing they crucifie afroſh to themſelves
the Sonne of God, and put him to an open ſhame:</hi> And <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10. 26. <hi>If we sinne
wilfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaines no more
ſacrifice for ſinne,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore if thou haſt beene inlightned, and haſt
taſted of the good Word of God, and of the powers of the world to
come; take heed how thou commit ſin wittingly and willingly, againſt
thy knowledge, judgement, againſt the light of Grace ſhining in thy
heart, and lye in it without repentance, thou doſt no better than crucifie
the Sonne of God, and ſo haſt thy hands as deepe in the bloud of <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
as <hi>Pilate</hi> had; ſo when thou liveſt in thy ſins in the light of the Goſpell,
art a drunkard, a whoremaſter, a prophane perſon, a bad liver, take heed,
thou haſt thy hands in the bloud of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The fourth time was,<note place="margin">The fourth time.</note> when they cried, <hi>Crucifie him, crucifie him:</hi> I but
<hi>Pilate</hi> would not doe it, and yet he was the Magiſtrate who had power
in his hands to doe it; which muſt teach us, that although there bee a
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:17958:106"/>
power in our hands to doe hurt unto our neighbours, yet wee muſt not
doe it; as it is, <hi>Proverb.</hi> 3. <hi>Withhold not good from them to whom it is due,
when it is in the power of thine hand to doe it:</hi> Although thou be mighty, yet
God is mightier than thou, and thou canſt not deliver thy ſelfe from
him: Now theſe foure times did <hi>Pilate</hi> labour to cleare Chriſt, which
ſhewes his innocencie, that he died an innocent man, and that not for
himſelfe, but for us; therefore never doubt, but that he hath made ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation
and ſatisfaction for thee by his death.</p>
               <p>Now there were foure particular Meanes that <hi>Pilate</hi> uſed to deliver
Chriſt;<note place="margin">2</note> but before we come to ſpeake of them,<note place="margin">The meanes uſed to deliver Chriſt.</note> we will anſwer a doubt
or two that may ariſe:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Queſt. 1.</note> Whether Pilate did well to ſeeke to deliver Chriſt, ſeeing that Peter was
reproved and reprehended for the ſame thing?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2</note> Whether Pilate did well to labour to free Chriſt, ſeeing it did croſſe
the will of God, for it was the will of God that he ſhould die?</p>
               <p>To the firſt I anſwer,<note place="margin">Anſ. 1.</note> That <hi>Pilate</hi> did well to ſeeke to deliver Chriſt;
but <hi>Peter</hi> did not well, becauſe hee did not ſeeke to deliver Chriſt by
good meanes, and in due order, but hee would have delivered him, by
reſiſting and fighting for him, therefore it was a ſinne to him; but <hi>Pilate</hi>
ſought to deliver him by good meanes and in due order, threfore it
was no ſinne in him. Againe, <hi>Peter</hi> he knew the myſtery of mans redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
therefore it was a ſinne in him, but <hi>Pilate</hi> was ignorant of it, who
tooke him to be but an innocent man, therefore <hi>Pilate</hi> did well do deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the ſcond I anſwer,<note place="margin">Anſ. 2.</note> the <hi>will</hi> of God is two-fold:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The will of his Decree.</item>
                  <item>2. The will of his Commandement.</item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <hi>The will of his Decree,</hi> is the diſpoſing of every particular man, and of
the whole world to his beſt pleaſure, and can by no meanes be reſiſted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The will of his Commandement</hi> is, what he would have us to doe: Now
it was the will of God indeed, that Chriſt ſhould die, but it was <hi>the will
of his Decree;</hi> for <hi>the will of his Commandement</hi> was, that when he brought
Chriſt into the world, all men ſhould kiſſe him, ſeeke to him for his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
and doe him all the honour that might bee; therefore <hi>Pilate</hi> did
well in endevouring to deliver Chriſt. Now to draw this downe lower
to our ſelves, it may be it is the will of God, we ſhould be poore, or that
we ſhould be rich; therefore muſt we not be idle and doe nothing, for
this is <hi>the will of Gods Decree,</hi> which is ſecret to himſelfe; but the revealed
will of God, <hi>the will of his Command</hi> is, that every man ſhould eat his
bread in the ſweat of his face, and apply himſelfe to the means notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
that God hath appointed. But to returne to the meanes that
<hi>Pilate</hi> uſed for Chriſts deliverance.</p>
               <p>The firſt meanes that <hi>Pilate</hi> uſed to deliver Chriſt,<note place="margin">1</note> was, <hi>Loquendo,</hi> by
ſpeaking for him:<note place="margin">By ſpeaking for Him.</note> And when did hee ſpeake for him? marry when all
the world was ſilent: which is a worthy example for us to follow, to
ſpeake for Chriſt, and in his cauſe for the Goſpell, though all the world
ſhould be ſilent, or elſe <hi>Pilate</hi> ſhall riſe up in the day of Iudgement and
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:17958:106"/>
condemne us; for if we be ſilent in the cauſe of Chriſt and holy reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
before men, he will alſo be ſilent, at the day of Iudgement for us,
before his heavenly Father; and if we ſpeak in the cauſe of Chriſt before
men, and in the cauſe of religion, he will alſo ſpeake for us at the day of
Iudgement before his heavenly Father. <hi>Gen.</hi> 41. wee ſee that <hi>Pharaohs
Butler</hi> did dreame a dreame, which <hi>Ioſeph</hi> did interpret, for which all that
<hi>Ioſeph</hi> did requeſt in recompence of him, was, that he would make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of him to <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> ſo our good <hi>Ioſeph</hi> hath done much for us,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and
ſhewed us great kindneſſe, for which this is all that hee deſires at our
hands, to make mention of his Name to the world, that wee ſhould
ſpeake in his cauſe and for religion: this we ſee the Apoſtles did, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.
when they were rated and rebuked for ſpeaking in the Name of Chriſt;
they made anſwer, <hi>That they could not but ſpeake of the things that they had
both ſeene and heard:</hi> ſo <hi>Hester</hi> 4. when the <hi>Iewes</hi> were in diſtreſſe, ſaith <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
If I periſh, I periſh;</hi> as if ſhee ſhould ſay, Should I forſake the cauſe?
no, whatſoever befall me, I will venture my ſelfe, <hi>if I periſh, I periſh:</hi> to
this purpoſe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4. ſaith the Lord to <hi>Moſes, Goe thy way, I will be with thy
month;</hi> from which words <hi>Augustine</hi> collects, That if a man ſpeake for
the Goſpell, and in a cauſe of juſtice, then God opens his mouth; but if
a man open his mouth to ſweare, lye, deceive, ſlander his neighbour;
or open his mouth againſt the Goſpell, then it is the Devill that doth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
his mouth; therefore it is a pitifull thing, that Chriſt, Religion and
the Goſpell is condemned, and yet men will bee ſilent at it; but doe
not thou wonder in this caſe, if Chriſt bee ſilent for thee at the day of
Iudgement.</p>
               <p>The ſecond meanes that <hi>Pilate</hi> uſed was <hi>Mittendo,</hi> by ſending Chriſt
to <hi>Herod,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2</note> for he hoped that the <hi>Iewes</hi> would not have followed him at all
to accuſe him,<note place="margin">By ſending Him to Herod.</note> or if they did, hee ſhould have found ſome favour and
friendſhip from <hi>Herod,</hi> ſeeing he was deſirous of a long time to ſee him,
not out of any love to Chriſt, to be ſaved by him, draw any grace from
him, or take good by his preſence, but out of an humour and conceit he
had, touching him, having heard of the ſtrangeneſſe of his miracles that
hee did, that hee was a Iugler, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſome cunning man, that would have
done ſeats; this it was that made him deſirous to ſee Chriſt: So there
be a number of men deſirous to ſee Chriſt, but they have divers ends,
ſome becauſe they would be fed, ſome becauſe of his miracles, ſome to
get credit and favour amongſt men, to bee well accounted of; but few
ſeeke him to a right end, to get grace and ſtrength againſt ſinne, to bee
quickened up in their affections; as <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 38. <hi>Ieſus turned about when hee
ſaw them that did follow him, and ſaid unto them, What ſeeke yee?</hi> So the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Chriſt askes us, when wee come to the miniſtery of his Word,
what ſeeke yee? if ye ſeeke for worldly eaſe, preferment, or credit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
men, then ye come to a wrong end, but if ye ſeeke to Chriſt, to
have your graces encreaſed, and to be ſtrengthened againſt ſinne, then
yee ſhall be bleſſed in your comming; therefore when we come to the
Word, we muſt ſee that we come to a right end. Now when <hi>Herod</hi> had
not that that he looked for, that Chriſt did not follow his humour, hee
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:17958:107"/>
fals a mocking of him, puts on a white garment on him in deriſion, and
ſo ſends him away: this is a ſtrange thing, that <hi>Herod</hi> had a deſire a long
time to ſee Chriſt, and now when he ſeeth him, hee makes a mock of
him, and puts a white garment upon him, though hee had done ſo much
at <hi>Iohns</hi> preaching, that he <hi>did many things wel</hi> &amp; <hi>heard Iohn gladly;</hi> yet now
he makes a mock of Chriſt: here we may ſee what a dangerous thing it
is, to nouriſh ſinne, for if a man harbor ſome ſecret ſinne, though hee
hath good affections, and good graces, it will eate out the heart of them,
ſo <hi>Herod</hi> harbord one ſinne, the taking his brother <hi>Philips</hi> wife, and the
nouriſhing of this one, eate out the heart of all his good affections.
This was the caſe of <hi>Herod,</hi> and is the caſe of thouſands in the world,
though they be hearers of the Word, and have reformed many a thing,
yet becauſe they nouriſh ſome ſecret ſinne, they fall to bee mockers of
Religion which eats out the heart of all their graces and of good affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions:
as <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. our Saviour ſhewes, that <hi>ſome ſeede fell in ſtony
ground,</hi> and ſprang up, and when the Sunne aroſe, it parched, withered,
and came to nothing,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> becauſe there were ſtones in the bottome, ſo if a
man have good affections, if hee nouriſh one ſecret ſinne, all will come
to nothing, it will eate out all the heart of his graces.</p>
               <p>The <hi>third meanes</hi> hee uſed to deliver <hi>Chriſt</hi> was,<note place="margin">Thirdly, by ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Chriſt with Barabbas.</note> 
                  <hi>jungendo,</hi> by joyning
<hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Barabbas</hi> together, for it was a cuſtome at their feaſts, to let
looſe a priſoner: now Chriſt was matched with a notable theefe, that
was in the priſon, one that was a traytor, and a murtherer; therefore
<hi>Pilate</hi> thought they would not have choſen him that was ſo vile, but
would rather have choſen Chriſt, but the <hi>Prieſts</hi> through envie ſtirred
up the people, who did chuſe <hi>Barabbas,</hi> and refuſed Chriſt: this, was a
notable policie in <hi>Pilate,</hi> and muſt teach them that have fine wits, and
politike pates to uſe them for Chriſt and not againſt him; as <hi>Levit.</hi> 2.
The Lord commands that they ſhould <hi>offer fine flowre,</hi> ſo if men have fine
wits and fine policies;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> God muſt have a handfull of them, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 22.
<hi>David</hi> deſires to be kept from <hi>the horne of the Vnicornes;</hi> why was this?
though is were a good, and ſufficient horne, yet it was a naughty head,
that did beare it; ſo learning, wit and policie is a good thing, when it is
in a good heart, but if it be in a bad heart, then we had need to pray to
God, as <hi>David</hi> did, to keepe us from the <hi>horne of the Vnicorne,</hi> keepe me
from his policie,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> his wit and learning: a man that hath a good wit, muſt
uſe it for Chriſt, and not againſt Him, for if he doe, God will deſtroy
his wit and him: In all the hiſtories of the Heathen, wee finde not the
like example to that in the Bible of <hi>Achitophel,</hi> whoſe <hi>counſell was as the
Oracle of God,</hi> and yet becauſe he uſed policie and wit againſt God, and
not for God, it was overthrowne by a plaine man; ſo, the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits</hi>
beyond ſea, are great Polititians, have fine wits, and goe far beyond
us, in their policies, yet they have been often overthrowne in their deepe
fetches and ſubtile plots, and it hath pleaſed God to bleſſe us in our ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
and weakeneſſe; the reaſon whereof is, becauſe their policie is
againſt <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> and ours is for it. Thus much for <hi>Pilate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now for the <hi>people,</hi> we ſee that they preferred <hi>Barabbas</hi> before Chriſt,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:17958:107"/>
who was a traytor and a murtherer, Chriſt being an innocent man; and
yet by the inſtigation of the Prieſts they choſe <hi>Barabbas,</hi> and refuſed
Chriſt. Now I dare ſay, there is not any here, but will be ready to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
the <hi>Iewes</hi> that they preferred <hi>Barabbas</hi> before Chriſt: but what?
doe we not as ill who preferre our vile luſts and ſinnes before Chriſt?
For (as Divines ſay) in <hi>every choiſe and election, there is a practicall diſcourſe in
the cour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of a mans conſcience, either to make choiſe of Chriſt and his graces; or
elſe of his owne ſins and his delights;</hi> there is Chriſt on the one ſide, and all
his graces, with heaven and happineſſe thereunto belonging, and on the
other hand, ſinne, and all the delights thereof, our vile luſts, pleaſures,
and profits; wee ſtand in a middle betweene them both, and put Chriſt
into the one ſcale which we have in our hands, and our ſinnes and luſts
into the other; then this queſtion is made in the court of every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
mans conſcience, which of theſe wilt thou make choiſe of? whether
Chriſt and his Spirit ſhall live in thee, or thy vile ſinnes? if we anſwer,
it is better to live in our whoredomes, in our prophanneſſe, it is better
to live in our pleaſures than to chooſe Chriſt; what doe wee elſe but
preferre <hi>Barabbas</hi> before Him: wee condemne the <hi>Iewes</hi> but wee have
much more need to condemne our ſelves, they did it in the time of
their ignorance, and we doe it in the time of our knowledge; they did it
in the time of Chriſts humilitie, and we now he is in his glory; they did it
once, but we often: and therefore if there bee a queſtion come into the
court of thy conſcience (by the hearing of a Sermon) whether the ſpirit
of Chriſt ſhall dye or thy ſinnes; when wee make choice of our ſinnes,
and let the ſpirit of Chriſt die in us; what doe wee but as the Iewes did,
preferre <hi>Barabbas</hi> before Chriſt? and therefore every one ſhould labour
to take this home to himſelfe.</p>
               <p>The <hi>fourth Meanes</hi> was,<note place="margin">Fourthly, by whipping of him.</note> 
                  <hi>Flagendo, by whipping of Christ;</hi> this was worſt
of all, and when he had ſo done, he puts on him a purple garment, and ſo
brought him forth; then <hi>Pilate ſaid unto them, Behold the man;</hi> as who
ſhould ſay, if there be pity or any mercy in you, Looke on the man, and
let it move you to let him goe: now this one word of <hi>Pilate, Looke on
the man,</hi> is good for every Chriſtian to remember, to looke upon the
man; to looke upon <hi>Christ,</hi> to conſider what a deale of paines hee hath
ſuffered, what a deale of labour it coſt to redeeme us, <hi>Ecce home,</hi> Looke
upon the man, ſee how his ſhoulders were whipped, his face buffetted,
his head crowned with thornes, how his ſides were pierced, how his
hands and feete were nailed, his body racked and tormented; all this he
hath done to redeeme thy ſoule, therefore doe not thou ſell that for a
ſmall matter, which coſt Chriſt ſo deere. Every morning, let us conſider
this one word of <hi>Pilate, Behold the man,</hi> and when wee are about our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
in the fields, when we goe to bed, looke upon Chriſt and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
what a deale of paines it coſt Chriſt to redeeme us.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we muſt looke upon Chriſt, and conſider what wee are to
looke for at the hands of the world; if Chriſt was crowned with a
crowne of thornes, then wee muſt not looke to bee crowned with a
crowne of gold: If he suffered ſuch contumelies and reproaches, then
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:17958:108"/>
wee muſt not looke to goe ſcot-free: if wee ſuffer with him, wee ſhall
raigne with him: if we would partake with him in his glorious crowne
then muſt we with him in ſome ſort be crowned with thornes.</p>

Chriſt, he uſed foure meanes to deliver Him;
firſt, by ſpeaking for Him; ſecondly, by ſending
Him to <hi>Herod;</hi> thirdly, by aſſociating him with
<hi>Barabbas;</hi> fourthly, by ſcourging him, that ſo pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
might have ſtaied the cruelty of the high
<hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Scribes,</hi> but all would not availe, their
fury preſſed on to his death: The uſes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
wee were the laſt day cut ſhort of by reaſon of the time, therefore
now we will proſecute the ſame.</p>
               <p>The firſt uſe is,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> that in looking on Chriſt, wee may ſee what we are to
looke for at the hands of the world; for if hee was crowned with a
<hi>crowne of thornes.</hi> Then we muſt not looke to be crowned with a crowne
of gold; if he was <hi>mocked</hi> and <hi>ſcoffed</hi> at, we muſt not looke to goe free;
<hi>Ecce homo, behold the man; if we ſuffer with him, wee ſhall raigne with him in
glory.</hi> And therefore doe not thou looke to partake with him in his
crowne of glory, unleſſe thou partake with him in the crown of thornes.
In the 18. of <hi>Iohn, Pilate</hi> asked Chriſt, <hi>if hee was a king:</hi> he anſwered, <hi>hee
was, but his kingdome was not of this world;</hi> even ſo a Chriſtian may ſay,
my kingdome is not of this world, but I looke for a kingdome above the
clouds, a kingdome of glory and happineſſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> a Chriſtian may comfort himſelfe in afflictions and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
by looking on Chriſt, <hi>Ecce homo, behold the man:</hi> let thy troubles
and thy afflictions be what they will be, yet they are not like to Chriſts,
he was God, we are men; he the ſonne, and wee the ſervants; he pure
and holy, we wretched and ſinfull; therefore let thy troubles bee what
they will, ſure it is, thou canſt not attaine to the halfe of Chriſts, to the
crowne of thornes, the buffettings, mockings and railings upon, to his
whippings, rackings and tormentings; therefore if wee looke upon
Chriſts wounds, we ſhall finde ours to be nothing to his; thus we muſt
comfort our ſelves in our afflictions by looking on Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Vſe 3.</note> we may comfort our ſelves in temptations, for as a Chriſtian
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:17958:108"/>
hath his <hi>Ecce homo;</hi> ſo the devill will have his time for it; when we be
ſick and like to die, then he will come and ſay, <hi>Ecce homo, behold the man;</hi>
thou haſt ſeemed to be a great profeſſor, but now death seazeth on thee,
and thou muſt be flung into the grave, and there conſumed to duſt, and
therfore what canſt thou doe for thy ſelfe? A man muſt not be diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
at this, but muſt have his <hi>Ecce homo:</hi> and ſend him backe againe to
Chriſt, and ſay, <hi>behold the man,</hi> behold Chriſt, hee hath done for me, hee
hath gone before death, hath ſeazed upon mee, he hath beene trampled
and trodden under foot of it, flung into the grave and riſen againe,
therefore ſeeing Chriſt hath gone before me, I muſt not be afraid to
follow his ſteps that he hath ſtepped in before me.</p>
               <p>The third generall point which we obſerved in the condemnation of
Chriſt is,<note place="margin">Thirdly, what made Pilate ſo ſtand for Christ.</note> 
                  <hi>what it was that made Pilate ſtand ſo ſtiffe for Christ;</hi> though after
he was drawne on to condemne him, partly through feare of <hi>Caſar;</hi> and
partly through the importunitie of the people.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now there were five reasons that made him ſtand ſo ſtiffe for Chriſt:</hi>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. His owne conſcience.</item>
                  <item>2. The admonition of his wife.</item>
                  <item>3. Christs ſtrange ſilence.</item>
                  <item>4. His holy Confeſsion and protestation.</item>
                  <item>5. His Commination.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">First, his owne conſcience.</note> 
                  <hi>his owne conſcience,</hi> for hee was perſwaded hee was an innocent
man, and delivered unto him through the malice of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> therefore
hee was loth to condemne him, and ſo ſinne againſt his conſcience; and
yet he was but a heathen man, therefore what a pitifull thing is it, when
a Chriſtian ſhall ſinne againſt his conſcience, and that ſhall ſmite him, as
it did the <hi>Lepers</hi> in the midſt of their jollity, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 7. 7. who ſaid, <hi>we doe
not well to tarry here, &amp;c.</hi> ſo when a mans conſcience ſhall tell him, O, I
doe not well to ſweare, to lye, and yet that ſame man ſhould goe on ſtill
in his wicked courſes, this is a pittifull thing, therefore a man muſt take
heed hee ſinne not againſt his conſcience; if a man ſhould have a ſnake
or a worme crawling in his body or in his bowels,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> though it ſhould bee
quiet ſometimes, yet upon every little occaſion it ſhould crawle and
ſtirre about, hee would thinke it were better to dye a thouſand deaths,
but what is this to the worme of conſcience, that will torment a man
for ever and ever and never dieth? therefore (as a learned man ſaith) all
other plagues a man may fly from, but hee cannot fly from an evill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience;
a man may fly from the plague, from famine or from the injury
of men, but he cannot fly from an evil conſcience, whither ſoever he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that will with him, if he goe into merry company, or into his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
into his cloſet, or into any roome under the earth the ſecreteſt place
that may bee, his evill conſcience will goe with him and purſue him;
like unto a man that hath an ague,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> he thinkes if he were in this or in that
place, in this roome or in that, hee ſhould have eaſe, but ſo long as hee
carrieth the matter of his owne griefe about him, he can have none; ſo a
man that hath an evill conſcience, hee may thinke to have peace in this
place, in this and that company, but as long as he carrieth about him the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:17958:109"/>
matter of his griefe, hee muſt never looke to have eaſe, therefore wee
muſt take heed of ſinning againſt our conſcience.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſecond thing,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Secondly, the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition of his wife.</note> 
                  <hi>that made</hi> Pilate <hi>ſtand ſo ſtiffe for</hi> Christ, <hi>was</hi> the
admonition of his wife, <hi>for</hi> Pilate <hi>being in the judgement ſeat, ſhee ſent
him a meſſage,</hi> Matth. 27. To have nothing to doe with that just man: <hi>in
which meſſage we obſerve divers things:</hi>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The partie that ſent the meſſage, Pilates Wife.</item>
                  <item>2. The time when ſhee ſent it; when Pilato was upon the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſeate.</item>
                  <item>3. The tenour of the meſſage; have thou nothing to doe with
that just man.</item>
                  <item>4. The reaſon, becauſe I have ſuffered many things this night in
a dreame touching Him.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Firſt, who ſent the meſſage.</note> 
                  <hi>who it was that ſent the meſſage; Pilates wife:</hi> hence obſerve, it is a
good thing for women to ſtop and ſtay their husbands in the courſe of
ſinne, they muſt labour to prevent them, by good ſpeeches and good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions,
for women were made to this end, to be helpers to their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands,
to helpe them to heaven, therefore when the wife ſhall admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
the husband, and hee doe not regard but deſpiſe and neglect it, <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi>
ſhall riſe up in judgement againſt him, and condemne him, at the day
of judgement.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Secondly, when it was ſent.</note> 
                  <hi>when it was; as he ſate in judgement,</hi> it was a very fit time, a
good ſeason; as <hi>David</hi> bad his ſervants ſay to <hi>Nabal,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. <hi>Wee
came in a good ſeaſon;</hi> ſo it is a good ſeaſon to ſtoppe a man in ſinne, when
hee is about the doing of it: ſo the Angell of the Lord ſtopped <hi>Ioſeph,
Matth.</hi> 1. when he thought to have put <hi>Mary</hi> away ſecretly, ſo <hi>Gen.</hi> 20.
when <hi>Abimelech</hi> thought to have taken <hi>Abrahams</hi> wife, ſaith the Lord
unto him, <hi>thou art but a dead man;</hi> it is a good thing then to admoniſh one
of ſinne, when they be about doing of it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Thirdly, the meſſage.</note> 
                  <hi>the tenor of the meſſage; have thou nothing to doe with this just
man.</hi> If a man be a juſt man and an innocent man, let us take heed, how
wee have to deale with him or doe him any wrong or any hurt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.
It is a note of a wicked man, that <hi>he perſecutes the godly man,</hi> for if a man
be a juſt and godly man, then there is matter enough for them; but we
muſt take heed, wee doe them no harme or wrong: a man may handle
gold,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> Oare, iron, as long as it remaines in his owne nature, but if the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of fire be put to it, then if we handle it, it will burne us; ſo we may
deale with men, as long as they remaine in their owne nature, but if once
they have the nature of God, take heed how we deale with them; leſt
it happen unto us, as <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. 5. it is ſaid of the two Prophets, that <hi>if
any man hurt them, fire ſhall come out of their mouthes and destroy them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fourth reaſon was,<note place="margin">Fourthly, the reaſon and cauſe.</note> 
                  <hi>Becauſe ſhe had ſuffered many things in a dreame tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
him,</hi> this is the property of a good conſcience, to bee moved and
ſtirred by the judgements of God: it is a wofull thing when his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
be upon us, yet we are not moved and ſtirred at them; when hee
ſhall take away our wives, our children, our cattell, or our goods, and yet
wee bee not moved at it. If a Phyſition give a man Phyſicke, the next
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:17958:109"/>
question that he will aske him,<note place="margin">SERM. XVIII.</note> when hee comes to him, is, whether his
phyſicke did worke or no? if it did not worke and ſtirre the humours,
it is twenty to one, but the party will dye; ſo the judgements of God
are his phyſicke, and if they doe move and ſtirre us, there is ſome good
hope, but if they doe not move and work upon us, there is danger, twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
to one but we ſhall be more afflicted or die; therefore it is a pitifull
thing that Gods judgements be upon us in this unſeaſonable weather,
and yet we are not moved and ſtirred by them, nor drawne unto repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
to returne to God: the Lord complaines of this, <hi>Ier.</hi> 5. <hi>Thou hast
ſtricken them, but they have not ſorrowed:</hi> And <hi>Zephan.</hi> 3. <hi>Every morning doth
he bring his judgements to light, and yet the wicked will not learne to be aſhamed.</hi>
It is a good thing to be afflicted with the judgements of God, as <hi>Numb.</hi>
21. the people come to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and deſire him to pray to God, to take
away the firy Serpents, not deſiring to have their ſins taken away; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when that judgement was at an end, they had a greater, and ſo had
no reſt, till the Lord had deſtroyed them; ſo men doe now, when the
judgements of God be upon them, then they pray to have ſickneſſe, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
ſcarcitie and unſeaſonable weather taken away from them, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
pray to God to have their ſins taken away, to give them repentance;
and therefore when one judgement is at an end, it it the beginning of
a greater, the Lord will never reſt till hee hath deſtroyed us, if wee doe
not repent us of all our ſinnes, and turne to him in the truth of our
hearts.</p>
               <p>This muſt teach Chriſtians,<note place="margin">Vſe.</note> that have more light and knowledge,
than they had, or than <hi>Pilate</hi> had, to take heed that they doe not ſinne
againſt their conſcience; <hi>Pilate</hi> had the light of Nature, wee have the
light of Gods grace; it it a fearefull thing, when a man ſhall ſinne againſt
his conſcience; though a man ſinne of weakneſſe, and of infirmity, yet let
us take heed we ſinne not againſt conſcience; for what a pitifull thing is
it that a mans conſcience ſhall ſay, as the <hi>Lepers</hi> ſaid, <hi>O, we doe not well,</hi> that
we doe ſo; I doe not well to ſin, to ſweare, to prophane the Sabbaths, I
doe not well to nouriſh any ſin, to backbite my neighbours: It is a feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
thing to ſin againſt conſcience, all other accuſers, one thing or other
will ſtop them, either bribes, or favour, or fiendſhip, or intreatie, or flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
but there is nothing that will ſtop the accuſing of evill conſcience,
neither bribes, nor flattery, nor friendſhip, nor intreaty; <hi>Revel.</hi> 20. 12.
conſcience is compared to <hi>a booke that all things are written in,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> when there
is queſtion about a debt, come to the booke and that doth manifeſt the
matter; ſo there is a queſtion, whether thou haſt sinned or not, come to
thy conſcience, and that will reſolve thee, all thy ſins are written there,
although thou doe not ſee nor feele them, yet at the Iudgement day,
when the booke ſhall bee opened, then all ſhall bee manifeſt, as if they
were but new committed.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> other accuſers doe accuſe us, but certaine times, either at
<hi>Terme</hi> time, or when anger is ſtirred, but an accuſing conſcience will
give them no peace at any time; the worme of conſcience wil torment a
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:17958:110"/>
man at all times, in the night, and in the day, when hee is in company,
and when he is alone.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> other accuſers a man may flie from, for if they be in one coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
hee may flie into another country; but there is no man can flie from
the accuſing of an evill conſcience, unleſſe a man flie from himſelfe; <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi>
ſaith, all other plagues a man may fly from, from the famine, from
the envie of man, from the peſtilence he may flie, but he can never from
an evill conſcience; Man (ſaith he) get thee into thy chamber, or into
the ſecreteſt place that may bee, and although thou ſhut the doore, yet
thou canſt not ſhut out the accuſing of an evill conſcience, unleſſe thou
ſhut up thy ſelfe: If a man were in a cloſe chamber full of ſmall lights,
and there were in the ſame roome one great light,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> though he ſhould put
out all the other, and leave but this one, yet that were ſufficient to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe,
and to lay open his ſhame; ſo in the chamber of this world, there
be a number of lights, if all ſhould be put out, and there be left this great
light of a mans conſcience, this is ſufficient to diſcover and to lay open
a mans ſhame.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>The ſtrange ſilence of Chriſt,</hi> that anſwered nothing, though
<hi>Pilate</hi> did urge him,<note place="margin">The ſtrange ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of Chriſt.</note> and it did concerne his life; therefore the more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
he ſhould have been (as one would have thought) to defend himſelfe,
for naturally men are ready to defend their lives; as the <hi>Devill</hi> ſaith of
<hi>Iob, all that a man hath will hee give for his life:</hi> But ſee, <hi>Christ</hi> was ſilent,
which ſhewes how ready he was to lay downe his life for us, and how
willingly; this was the reaſon why Chriſt was ſilent and ſaid nothing:
here we may ſee the great love of Chriſt, that whereas we ſhould have
loſt our lives, have periſhed in hell for ever, hee was contented to lay
downe his life for us. Now Chriſt hath not laid downe his life onely
that wee ſhould lay downe our lives for him againe, but that we ſhould
lay downe our ſinnes; he was willing to part with his life, and wee are
not willing to part with our ſins for his ſake; <hi>Heſter</hi> 6. when <hi>Ahaſhueroſh
could not ſleepe in the night time,</hi> he cals to a ſervant <hi>to reade in the Chronicles,</hi>
and then found what <hi>Mordecai</hi> had done in preſerving of his life,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and ſo
makes this inquiry, <hi>But what honour and dignity hath there been done to Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decai
for it?</hi> So when a Chriſtian cannot ſleepe in his bed, hee ſhould be
thinking how willing Chriſt was to lay down his life for him, he ſhould
make this enquiry, what honour and dignitie have I done unto Chriſt
for it? <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, this is the reaſoning betwixt Chriſt and us; O
man, wilt thou make a change with me, wilt thou forgoe thy ſinnes and
take my bloud, take the merit of my death, and I will take the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of thy ſinnes!</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4</note> 
                  <hi>His proteſtation and confeſsion, that hee is the Sonne of God;</hi> for
when <hi>Pilate</hi> heard that,<note place="margin">Chriſts proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> he was afraid that God was ingaged againſt him,
and to oppoſe himſelfe againſt God, he was loth; this it was that made
him to ſtop and ſtay, the reverence hee had to the name of Chriſt: O
that we Chriſtians had this reverence to the name of God, that it might
stop and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ay us in the courſe of ſinne! <hi>Pilate</hi> was ſtayed at the mention
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:17958:110"/>
of the name of God; but we heare of the name of God every day, from
day to day, and yet it cannot ſtop us in the courſe of our ſinnes; we ſee,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 39. 9. that the reverent awe that <hi>Ioſeph</hi> had of the name of God, kept
him from ſinning againſt God; ſo <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 21. 22. <hi>Becauſe I kept the
wayes of the Lord, I did not wickedly againſt my God; for all his lawes were before
me, and I did not caſt his Commandements from me:</hi> And ſo here <hi>Pilate</hi> an
Heathen did reverence the name of God, this it was that ſtopped him,
and made him ſtand ſo faſt for Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5</note> 
                  <hi>The holy commination of Chriſt,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>Hee that delivered mee to
thee, hath the greater ſinne:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chriſts Commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</note> There is no man that can have his hand in the
death of Chriſt, but he muſt needs ſinne: This was it that made <hi>Pilate</hi> a
Heathen man loth to condemne Chriſt, be cauſe he ſhould ſinne againſt
God. This muſt teach us, that when wee heare it is a ſinne to ſweare or
lye, not to doe it, though it be to ſave a mans life. Wee have heard it is a
ſinne to prophane the Sabbath, to miſpend the time wickedly, and yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe,
dare we goe on and doe it: Surely <hi>Pilate</hi> ſhall riſe up in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
againſt us at the laſt day, and condemne us for it. We ſee 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.
33. when <hi>Saul</hi> heard that <hi>the people had ſinned in eating of blood,</hi> hee laboured
to ſtoppe and to ſtay them: O that there were ſuch affection in Chriſtians
to labour to ſtoppe others, but eſpecially themſelves in the courſe of ſin!
For it is Gods great mercie that any thing comes in the way to ſtoppe or
ſtay us in the courſe of ſinne, whether it bee our conſcience, or the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions
of our wives, or any thing elſe. The <hi>Philoſophers</hi> ſay, that the
upper Heavens would ſet all the world together, if they were not ſtaid by
the nether, but whether that be true or no, this is; that there is ſuch gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe
in man to commit ſinne, that all would come to confuſion, if God
ſhould not reſtraine him: 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. 32. when <hi>David</hi> was in his heate, hee
thought to have killed <hi>Nabal,</hi> and all his houſhold; but when hee met
with <hi>Abigail,</hi> and was come to himſelfe, <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord God of Iſrael,</hi> ſaith
hee, <hi>which hath ſent thee this day to meete mee; And bleſſed bee thy advice; and
bleſſed bee thou, which haſt kept mee this day from comming to ſhed blood, and
from avenging my ſelfe with mine owne hand:</hi> So, when we be in our heate,
then we care not what we doe; but if we once come to our ſelves, then we
can ſay, O bleſſed be God for ſuch a man and ſuch a woman, that kept me
from ſinning againſt him. When <hi>Balaam went to curſe the People of God</hi> for
a bribe, if the <hi>Aſſe</hi> had not ſpoken to him and made a ſtoppe, the Angell
of the Lord had killed him: The <hi>Aſſe</hi> ſaw the danger, but hee ſaw it not;
therefore the Lord gave <hi>Balaam</hi> cauſe to bleſſe God for his Aſſe; even ſo
if there bee any thing that ſtops us from committing ſinne, and though
it be but an Aſſe, we have cauſe to bleſſe God for it.</p>
               <p>The fourth generall point that wee obſerved in Chriſts condemnation

                  <hi>What made Pilate to condemne Chriſt?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">What made Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to condemne Chriſt.</note> And that appeares to be:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The importunitie of the Iewes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. The feare of loſing Caeſars favour.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>the importunitie of the Iewes,</hi> for the more hee pleaded for him, the
worſe they were; the more they cried out,<note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>crucifie him, crucifie him.</hi> At laſt

<pb n="210" facs="tcp:17958:111"/>
him. Here we may ſee what a wicked thing it is to yeeld to any bad
thing for any importunitie whatſoever. <hi>Adam</hi> yeeldeth to his wife, and
ſo brought death upon himſelfe and his poſteritie, and was thruſt out of
<hi>Paradiſe:</hi> So <hi>Sampſon</hi> yeeldeth to <hi>Delilah,</hi> and loſt both his eyes. If a man
yeeld becauſe hee would have reſt, he ſhall bee condemned for it: If it bee
good to ſtand out in the cauſe of Chriſt, the firſt and the ſecond time, it is
good to ſtand out to the end:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> As if one be ſet to keepe away birds, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
excuſe himſelfe to ſay the birds are buſie, and I cannot make them
leave; but the more buſie the birds be the more buſie he ſhould be to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
them: So the more wee be importuned to ſinne, aud the more buſie
the Divell is to tempt us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the more buſie we ſhould be in Prayer and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation,
to ſuppreſſe the temptations of the Divell.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> It was <hi>Ioſephs</hi> glory,
that notwithstanding his Miſtris lay at him day by day, yet he yeelded not
to her: So this ſhall be the glory of a Chriſtian, that notwithstanding ghee
bee tempted to ſinne from day to day,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> hee yeelds not to it. It is noted of
Chriſt that when the Tempter ended, the Angels came and miniſtred un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him: So when wee have ſtood out in temptations, and they be ended,
the Angels will come and miniſter to us a Cup of comfort, or a Crowne
of glory. But <hi>Pilate</hi> becauſe he ſtood not out in the cauſe of Chriſt, as hee
had begunne, but yeelded; loſt all his glory; therefore, it is ſaid in our
Creede, <hi>He ſuffered under Pontius Pilate,</hi> which is a marke of diſgrace unto
him, to the Worlds end.</p>
               <p>The second thing that drew <hi>Pilate</hi> to condemne <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2</note> was <hi>feare of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
Caeſars favour:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Feare to loſe Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars favour.</note> for when the <hi>Iewes</hi> told him, that if he let him goe, hee
was not <hi>Caeſars</hi> friend, this did ſo perplexe and amaze him, that he ſinnes
againſt his conſcience, and inclines to the worſer ſide: Hee had good affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
and ſtood out in the cauſe of Chriſt, when all were againſt him, but
when it came to this, that if he ſtood out ſtill, he ſhould loſe <hi>Caeſars</hi> favor,
or elſe <hi>Gods</hi> favour; He makes choyſe of <hi>Caeſars</hi> favour: So it is with the
world ſtill, ſo long as <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Caeſar</hi> goe together, ſo long as the world and
religion goe together, ſo long they hold, but when it comes to this, that
they muſt loſe <hi>Caeſars</hi> favour, or Gods favour, they will leave God, and
chooſe <hi>Caeſars</hi> favour. But it is remarkable and worthy our obſervation,
that he that will make himselfe a friend to the world, may have indeed
<hi>Caeſars</hi> favour for a time, but he ſhall be ſure to have God his enemie, and
then perhaps <hi>Caeſar</hi> too; as we may ſee in <hi>Pilate,</hi> who laboured for <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars</hi>
favour, and chose that before Gods favour, yet through the juſt
judgement of God, he loſt <hi>Caeſars</hi> alſo, for upon complaint made he was
ſent for, and put from his Office, baniſhed the Land, and ſo through
griefe and vexation, laying hands upon himſelfe, deſperately killeth
himſelfe: Let men take heed of this, how they keepe mens favour and
loſe Gods; for if it be ſo with them, they may looke for <hi>Pilates</hi> judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to have neither of them both, becauſe the doe not chooſe Gods
favour above all.</p>

his</hi> Crucifying, <hi>wherein divers things are to bee
conſidered.</hi>

                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt, why of all other deaths, <hi>He muſt die the curſed death of the Croſſe,</hi>
for foure Reaſons:</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe of all other deaths, this was <hi>accurſed by the Law of God,</hi>
none elſe was:<note place="margin">1</note> burning, ſtoning, dying by the ſword, or any other, there
is no curſe annexed unto,<note place="margin">Becauſe it was onely accurſed.</note> but to this one onely, <hi>Curſed is every one that
hangeth on tree, Gal.</hi> 3. 13. <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. 23. So that he died not the leaſt death,
but the worſt that might be, even the curſed death of the croſſe; and it
was becauſe he would take our curſe upon him, for by reaſon of our ſins,
we deſerved to be curſed both in life and death: that we might be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in our deaths, and freed of the curſe, hee was contented to take this
ſame accurſed death upon him. Let us therefore never forget this great
love of Chriſt to us, yea, remember what Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith to <hi>Philemon,</hi>
concerning <hi>Oneſimus, If he oweth thee any thing, ſet it on my skore, I will ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
thee for it;</hi> So <hi>Chriſt</hi> doth ingage himſelfe to God for us, to take our
curſe on him, that we may be bleſſed, to die for us that we may live, to
be forſaken of God, that wee may be received of God; therefore let us
never forget this love of Chriſt to us, as <hi>Iohn</hi> 13. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> wonders
at Chriſts humility, <hi>Wilt thou waſh my feet?</hi> So we may much more won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
at the humility of Chriſt, that he that was the Sonne of God, higher
than the Angels, would die the curſed death of the Croſſe, that wee
might be bleſſed, die a death temporall, that we might not die a death
eternall.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:17958:112"/>
Secondly, becauſe of all deaths, it was a ſhamefull death, for it was
not onely a curſed death,<note place="margin">2</note> but a ſhamefull death: therefore <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,
<hi>Hebr.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Becauſe it was a ſhameful<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> death.</note> 12. 2. <hi>Who endured the Croſſe, and deſpiſed the ſhame.</hi> The reaſon why
Chriſt died this ſhamefull death, was to ſanctifie all kindes of deaths to
his dying members; ſo that let the death bee never ſo ſhamefull, if one
die in faith, or in the pardon of his ſinnes, in the feare God, his death is
ſanctified unto him: he is a happie man, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. it is ſaid of ſuch, <hi>They all
died in faith,</hi> they died not all in their beds, or of a lingering diſeaſe, but
ſome of them were racked, ſome ſtoned, ſome ſawne aſunder, but <hi>they
all died in faith,</hi> and therefore they were bleſſed men, what death ſoeuer
they died on: So let men labour to die in faith, and in the feeling of
Gods love, in the pardon of their ſinnes, then let their death be what it
will be, ſuch a one, he ſhall be an happie and a bleſſed man.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> becauſe it was one of the painefulleſt deaths that was,<note place="margin">Becauſe it was one of the paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullest d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aths. Reaſons 4.</note> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
by theſe foure reaſons:<note place="margin">1</note> Firſt, becauſe they that were to die this
kind of death were whipped and ſcourged; for ſo Chriſts bloud was ſpent
with whipping and ſcourging,<note place="margin">2</note> that hee was not able to carry his Croſſe.
Secondly, becauſe they ſuffered in the moſt ſenſitive parts, in the hollow
of the hands, and feet, for theſe places are the quickeſt and fulleſt of ſenſe;
As <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, becauſe there all the ligaments and ſinewes make a mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
therefore it muſt needes be painefull.<note place="margin">3</note> Thirdly, becauſe they that were
crucified on the Croſſe, were ſore racked; For although they had a thing
to reſt their feete on, yet they did hang by the hands, with the weight of
their whole bodies; Therefore <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. <hi>The God of your Fathers
hath raiſed up</hi> Iesus;<note place="margin">4</note> 
                  <hi>whom yee ſlue and hanged on the Tree.</hi> Fourthly, becauſe
it was a lingring death, they were two or three daies a dying. Now we may
make theſe two good uſes of this point, Chriſt dying ſuch a painful death.</p>
               <p>Firſt, to teach us that it is an eaſie matter to reconcile us to God;
when wee have ſinned:<note place="margin">Vſes 2.</note> wee thinke it an eaſie matter to bee reconciled to
God, but it coſt Chriſt a painefull death; and therefore it is not a eaſie,
but a great thing that muſt redeeme ſoules.<note place="margin">1</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, ſeeing Chriſt dyed ſuch a painefull death, and overcame that
which was ſoreſt, wee know that hee will comfortably raiſe us up from
other deaths that wee ſhall dye of; <hi>Athanaſius</hi> giveth a good reaſon why
Chriſt dyed not an ordinary death as others doe,<note place="margin">2</note> but a painefull death; he
brings it in againſt the heretikes, for they objected, Why did not Chriſt
dye an ordinary death as others doe? To this hee anſwereth, that men of
ordinary deaths dye becauſe of ordinary infirmities,<note place="margin">Why Chriſt dyed not an ordinary death.</note> that they can live no
longer; ſickneſſe and diſeaſes come upon them, which they are not able to
withſtand; but there can be no infirmitie in Chriſt, he is the eternall word,
the Sonne of God. I, but why did he not make choice of ſome other kind
of death, but would dye ſuch a painefull death? To this he anſwereth, that
if he had made choice of ſome other death, then they would have thought
that hee had not had power to overcome any other death, but that; But
now hee taking any death that they could put upon him, even the moſt
painefulleſt and ſoreſt, and having power to overcome that; it is evident,
that hee hath power to overcome any other whatſoever. And ſo gives us
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:17958:112"/>
comfortable hope that hee will raiſe us up, his members, from all other
deaths: Even as a Champion comming into the field, hee will not make
choice of the weapon, or the man hee is to fight with, but will take that
which is put upon him; ſo Chriſt doth not make choice of what death he
will dye, but hee takes that which the world puts upon him. This is the
reaſon, why hee dyed not by the ſword, as <hi>Iohn</hi> did; nor was ſawne aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
as <hi>Eſaiah</hi> was, nor knocked on the head as <hi>Amos</hi> was, but was cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied:
So that he triumphing over his death, we may know and have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
hope, that we ſhall bee rayſed from other deaths.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4</note> 
                  <hi>becauſe it was more eminent and apparent to be ſeene,</hi> for they that
were to be crucified, were lifted up, that all men might ſee them. Of which
two reaſons may be given, why Chriſt muſt dye thus aloft.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> to conquer the divell, the prince of the Ayre in his owne country,
and at his owne doore; And ſo dedicate a way to heaven, and reare a lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in his death and bloodſhed, that it might be a ſtep or a ſcaffold, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we might climbe up to heaven.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> Chriſt dyed aloft, that all the world might ſee and know hee
was the meanes of mans reconciliation and redemption; Therefore hee
dyed not in a corner, nor below, but that all men might ſee, and behold it
aloft: as good <hi>Moses</hi> ſet up a <hi>Braſen Serpent</hi> on a pole, that ſo if any were
flung with the firy ſerpent if they could but creepe to their tents, and caſt
up their eyes to the braſen ſerpent, they had helpe; ſo God hath ſet up
Chriſt on a pole on the Croſſe, that men may ſee the meanes of their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
and redemption, and ſo bee ſaved: Therefore let us doe as <hi>Mary</hi>
and <hi>Iohn</hi> did, creepe to the Croſſe of Chriſt, as neere as they could get, ſo
that they heard the words of Chriſt, ſpeaking to them upon the the croſſe; in
like manner though wee cannot heare the words of Chriſt ſpeaking from
the Croſſe, yet let us get as neare as wee can, that ſo ſome of the warme
drop of the blood of Chriſt, may fall into our hearts, to comfort and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh
us, to clenſe and to waſh away our ſinnes.</p>
               <p>The 2.<note place="margin">The ſecond point how Chriſt was led to bee cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</note> point obſerv'd in his crucifying, was <hi>how they led Chriſt to be cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied;</hi>
And to open it thrughly unto you, let us conſider theſe 2. ciru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtances:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Hee was led in his owne Garments.</item>
                  <item>2. They made him beare his owne Croſſe.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>he was led in his owne garments,</hi> they put on him a purple robe to
diſgrace him;<note place="margin">In his owne garments.</note> but it is ſaid <hi>they pluckt off that, and put on his owne garments;</hi>
and that chiefly for theſe two reaſons.
1. <hi>That he might bee the better knowne to the people.</hi>
2. <hi>To fulfill the ſcripture, that had foretold that his garments ſhuld be divided.</hi>
Wherein we may conſider, that God that a ſecret hand in it; the <hi>Iewes were
in haſt becauſe of the preparation of the Sabath,</hi> &amp; the 6. <hi>hour</hi> ere they could get
Chriſt condemned, about noone; and yet they muſt needs tarry to put off
the purple robe,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> &amp; to put on his own garments; which muſt teach us that
the wicked for all their rage, heate, and malice, can doe no more than God
hath appointed: for God doth ſo bridle them though they be brutiſh, full
of rage and runne on in their courſes, yet they can do nothing, but that <hi>God</hi>
hath appointed:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> As a blinde horſe in a Mill, hee knoweth not the end
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:17958:113"/>
of his owne motion, but his maſter doth, who hath determined it: ſo the
wicked are like blinde horſes in a Mill, that goe on and knowe not the
end of their motion, but God hee knoweth it, who hath determined what
they ſhall doe, and how farre they ſhall goe? And therefore this may be a
comfort to us, that the wicked can doe nothing, but that which hee hath
appointed them to doe.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> that the leaſt things that fall out in our eſtates, God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
and decreed even the very garments we weare; as we ſee in Chriſt,
that his garments were fore-determined that hee ſhould be led in to bee
crucified. This is a great comfort, that there is not any thing, that falls
out in the courſe of our lives, but God hath appointed what ſhall be, what
eſtate wee all liue in: yea and our Saviour ſaith, <hi>There ſhall not fall a haire
of your heads to the ground, without your Heavenly Father:</hi> Hence a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
man inferres, If the Lord hath ſuch a care of the ſuperfluities of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
that nothing ſhall fall to the ground but by his appointment; In
what great ſafetie is their ſoules in? Therefore, let a man labour to feare
God, to repent his ſinnes, and to bee in Chriſt; and then let the rage of
the wicked bee what it will, they ſhall not bee able to take a haire from his
his head, nor the meaneſt coate off his backe, without Gods permiſſion
and appointment.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>They laid his croſſe upon him;</hi> and when hee fainted vnder the
burthen of it,<note place="margin">They laid his Croſſe upon him.</note> they met with <hi>Simon of Cyrene,</hi> and compelled him to bear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
his croſſe; not for any pittie they had of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but becauſe they thought
he would have fainted and died, before hee came at the place: Here three
things may be obſerved:</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>That every one that is Chriſts Diſciple, muſt take up his croſſe and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
him:</hi> ſo if we be Chriſts Disciples, wee muſt bee carriers of the croſſe;
for Chriſt hath determined this in his owne perſon, therefore we muſt bee
contented to beare the croſſe; as it is exhorted, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 13. <hi>But rejoyce in as
much as ye are partakers of Chriſts ſufferings, &amp;c.</hi> So <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 8. <hi>If yee bee then
without correction whereof all are partakers, then are ye baſtards and not ſonnes.</hi>
Therefore every man muſt fit himſelfe to beare the Croſſe of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>we muſt be contented to carry the Croſſe to Chriſt;</hi> for can a man
ſee Chriſt fainting or groveling on the ground, and yet goe by and not be
affected therewith? No, but he muſt ſet his ſhoulders to beare it: no man
muſt make a croſſe to himſelfe, but if it be laid on him by God, hee muſt
be contented to beare it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>we muſt beare all croſſes impoſed:</hi> there bee divers croſſes in the
world.<note place="margin">3</note> Some be croſſed in their children, ſome in their ſervants, ſome in
their names, ſome in their goods: But whatſoever our croſſes be, we ſhould
be contented to beare them. But it is a corruption in the world, that wee
thinke if our croſſes were as ſuch and ſuch a mans, then wee could beare
them. Thus wee are ready to buckle and take up another mans croſſe, but
not willing to carrie our owne which Chriſt injoynes, <hi>Math.</hi> 16. <hi>Hee that
will be my Diſciple, muſt take up his Croſſe and follow me:</hi> wee muſt not take
up another mans croſſe, but take up our owne; and when wee doe ſo carry
the croſſe as well as we can, if we faint under it, God will ſend ſome <hi>Simeon</hi>
                  <pb n="215" facs="tcp:17958:113"/>
of <hi>Cyren</hi> or other to helpe us beare it; under the Law if an Aſſe was bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened
and fell under it, they were commanded to helpe him up againe?
Now if man were bound to ſhew pittie to an Aſſe, much more to Chriſt,
when fals under his burthen;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> But it is a pittifull thing to ſee that Chriſt
is as it were fallen under his loade and burthen, yet there is none that will
ſet to their ſhoulders, to helpe beare it; Wee ſee <hi>Iob</hi> complaines of it in his
time,<note place="margin">Iob. 6. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>He that is in miſery ought to be comforted of his neighbours, but men have
forſaken the feare of the Almighty;</hi> ſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69. 20, 21 <hi>I looked for ſome to have
pittie on me, but there was none; and for comfort, but I found none;</hi> therefore it
is a miſerable thing, that Chriſt now in his members is under the croſſe,
yet few there are that will helpe to beare up his croſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The third generall point was,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The third thing where Chriſt was crucified.</note> The place where he was crucified, <hi>conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered:</hi>

Heb. 13. 12. Therefore even Ieſus, that he might ſanctifie the people with his owne
blood,<note place="margin">Three Reaſons why Chriſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered without the Gate.</note> he ſuffered without the gate; <hi>and that for</hi> 3. <hi>Reaſons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt, <hi>To ſhew he was the ſinne offering of the Church;</hi> for the ſinne offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
was offered without the Hoſt; <hi>Levit.</hi> 16. 27. So Chriſt was crucified
without the gate,<note place="margin">1</note> to ſhew he was the ſinne offring of the Church, the great
propitiatorie ſacrifice thy ſhould make expiation for ſinne; therefore as
in the Law when they offered a beaſt,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> the laid their hands on the head of
the beaſt, and ſo by humble confeſſion put their ſins on it which was killed,
and they went free; ſo ſeeing Chriſt is the ſinne offering of the Church
that ſhould make expiation for our ſinnes, we muſt carry them over to
Chriſt and lay them on him: This is the deduction which S. <hi>Paul</hi> makes
of it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 12. <hi>That Ieſus might ſanctifie the people with his owne blood, Hee
ſuffered without the gate,</hi> and ſo ſhew himſelfe to be the ſinne offering of the
Church. Here wee may learne, as the people carried their ſinnes unto the
beaſt, ſo that muſt bee our wiſedome to carrie our ſinnes unto Chriſt, or
elſe wee ſhall anſwere for them. Therefore, conſider with thy ſelfe whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
thou art, what a burthen thou haſt laid upon Chriſt; it is not long
ſince thou laidſt a great burthen on him, and thou art comming with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to day and to morrow, and ſo ſhalt every day as long as thou liveſt;
and when all is together, conſider what a load it will be, I doe not ſpeake
this to forbid thee that thou ſhouldſt not bring them being paſt recovery;
for if they be on thy ſelfe, woe bee to thee, thou art like to periſh. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
lay them ſtill on Chriſt, bring to him ſtill, but doe it with the more
ſhamefaſtneſſe and humilitie:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> come with them as <hi>Noahs</hi> ſonnes did, when
they covered their father, <hi>they went backward,</hi> aſhamed to looke on their
fathers face; ſo we ſhould goe to Chriſt with the greateſt humilitie, and
the moſt ſhamefaſtneſſe: In that we be the men and women that lay ſuch a
load on him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>To teach us that if wee ſuffer with Chriſt, wee muſt goe out of the
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:17958:114"/>
gates, and out of Ieruſalem;</hi> That is, wee muſt goe out of our pleaſures and
our ſinnes, to ſuffer with Chriſt, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Chriſt ſuffered without
the gate;</hi> ſo let us goe forth of the campe bearing his reproach: many an
one can be contented to have their part in the ſinne offerings of Chriſt, but
they will not go out of the campe, out of their ſinnes, pleaſures, profits, and
be contented to beare the reproach of Chriſt. But we have heard Chriſt
ſuffered without the gate, that we ſhould follow him, and come out of our
ſinnefull pleaſures and profits; therefore let us bee obedient and doe ſo.
Wee ſee <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11. that <hi>Moſes</hi> is commended, <hi>for that he esteemed the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke
of Chriſt greater riches than the treaſures of Egypt;</hi> and therefore as
<hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> ſaid of <hi>Ziba,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19. 30. <hi>Yea, let him take all, ſeeing my Lord
the king is come againe in peace unto his owne houſe.</hi> I will never ſtrive for it,
but let him have it, it is enough for me, that the king liveth: ſo we ſhould
ſay, Let the world take their pleaſures, their profits, &amp;c. I will leave that to
the world, I will not ſtrive for that, it is enough that <hi>Christ</hi> is my glory,
and that I ſhall be partaker with him of eternall Happineſſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, to teach us, that the caſting out of Chriſt out of the earth from
Ieruſalem,<note place="margin">3</note> and out of the ſocietie of men, is the bringing of us into the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
of God and his bleſſed Angels: <hi>Christ ſuffered without the gate,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when we ſee that hee ſuffered without the gate, and was caſt out of the
earthly <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> wee muſt conſider it is the bringing of us into the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly;
for as he was caſt out of the one, ſo we are brought into the other
by the Angels at the day of Iudgement: The <hi>firſt Adam</hi> loſt the earthly
<hi>Paradiſe,</hi> and the <hi>ſecond Adam</hi> hath purchaſed for us the heavenly <hi>Paradiſe,</hi>
where we ſhall eate of the Tree of life, that is in the middeſt of it, and of the
hidden <hi>Manna,</hi> that is ſpoken of <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. as <hi>Ionah</hi> 1. 12. ſaith unto the
men that were in the ſhip in the great diſtreſſe that fell upon them, when
the Sea was troubleſome,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> 
                  <hi>Take me up, and cast me into the ſea, ſo ſhall the Sea
be calme unto you;</hi> ſo Chriſt ſaid to the Father in the great diſtreſſe of all
mankinde, Take mee and caſt mee into the Sea, away with mee unto the
croſſe, fling me into the grave, caſt me from the ſocietie of men, and ſo
ſhall heaven, and earth, and hell, be at peace with you, and God pacified
and pleaſed with you:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and as <hi>Cantic.</hi> 3. 11. <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Come forth yee
daughters of Ieruſalem, and behold king Salomon crowned with the crowne wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
his mother crowned him:</hi> ſo we are called out to behold Chriſt hanging
on the croſſe, on mount Calvary, crucified and killed for thy ſinnes.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> the particular place is <hi>Calvarie</hi> or <hi>Golgotha, the place of mens
skuls;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In Golgotha.</note> Now ſome thinke it was ſo called becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> was buried there,
where his skull being found it gave name to the place; But this opinion
Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> refutes as a fable; ſome againe thinke it was called <hi>Calvary,</hi>
becauſe it was made round like a skull; Otherſome thinke it was called
<hi>Golgotha,</hi> becauſe it was the place of execution, where commonly malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,
ſuffered, and where were left the bones and skuls of ſuch as were exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted;
which opinion I incline to. Now this wee ſee could not chuſe but
be a very infamous, loathſome, and fearefull place, in which Chriſt was put
to death: which may teach us theſe two things, the deſert of our ſinnes;
that we deſerve to die, in the infamous, loathſome and fearefull places that
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:17958:114"/>
may bee;<note place="margin">SERM. XX</note> to have all the diſgrace that can be put upon us: indeed in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of men, it may bee, wee doe not deſerve it; but in regard of God
we doe; for as <hi>Christ</hi> died in <hi>Golgotha,</hi> ſo we deſerve not onely to die in
<hi>Golgotha,</hi> but to die in <hi>Hell</hi> for ever and ever: therefore whereas wee
would have honour put upon us at our death, and deſire to be as much
graced as may be, we muſt thinke of this, that Chriſt died in <hi>Golgotha,</hi> in
a lothſome place, to ſhew the deſert of our ſinnes, that we doe deſerve
to die in the diſgracefulleſt places that may bee.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> Chriſt died in ſuch a diſgracefull place, to purchaſe and
procure a better place for us to die in; he died in the <hi>fields,</hi> that we might
dye in our <hi>beds;</hi> amongſt the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Phariſes,</hi> and his <hi>enemies,</hi> that we
might dye amongſt our <hi>friends;</hi> he on the <hi>croſſe,</hi> that wee might dye in
eaſe and comfort; for his <hi>condemnation</hi> is our acquiting, his <hi>death</hi> our
<hi>life,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> his <hi>paines</hi> our <hi>eaſe.</hi> It is an obſervation that if a Bee hath ſtung any
one thing, it can ſting no more, though it make a buzzing and a great
noyſe; ſo it is with death which having ſtung Chriſt, hath now left her
ſting in the body of Chriſt, therefore though death may keepe a buz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
and adoe about a Chriſtian, yet he can doe him no hurt, becauſe he
hath left his ſting in his ſacred body: therefore the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.
35. triumphs over death, ſaying, <hi>O death, where is thy ſting? O grave where is
thy victory? O death, I will be thy death, O grave, I will be thy destruction, Heb.</hi>
2. 14. <hi>Foraſmuch as the Children, were partakers of flesh and blood, hee alſo
tooke part with them, that hee might deſtroy through death him that had the
power of death, that is, the devill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fourth point was,<note place="margin">Fourthly, the manner of Chriſts crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> 
                  <hi>The maner how,</hi> now before they did nayle him
to the croſſe, <hi>they gave him vinegar to drinke mingled with gall,</hi> ſo Saint <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew:</hi>
but <hi>Marke</hi> ſaith <hi>they gave him wine mingled with myrrh;</hi> now how can
theſe two agree together?<note place="margin">Matth. 27. 34.</note> I anſwer, the one ſpeakes <hi>of the quality of it,</hi> and
the other <hi>of the ſubstance;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mark. 15. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>Matthew</hi> ſpeaketh of the qualitie, <hi>Marke</hi> of the
ſubſtaine, for indeed it was wine in ſubſtance, but ſowre wine, as ſowre as
vinegar, and it was myrrh, yet as bitter as gal in reſpect of the quality, for
it was a marvellous diſtaſtfull and bitter cup which they gave Chriſt to
drinke; one would not have given it to any man; what was the reaſon that
they gave him this? ſome ſay, it was to take away the ſenſe and feeling of
his paine: but it cannot be ſo, for there be two reaſons againſt it; firſt,
becauſe the <hi>Iewes</hi> had no ſuch intent, to eaſe him but rather to afflict him;
ſecondly, there is no ſuch operation in the things, for wine is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter
of the vitall ſpirits, the heart and braine: other thinke the reaſon
was to haſten his death, and to rid him quickly of his paine, for myrrh
doth open the veines; and in the margins of our <hi>Bibles,</hi> wee finde it ſo
noted: Phyſitians ſay, that wine being taken inwardly, doth open the
veines alſo, but being taken outwardly doth ſtoppe them: it is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that it was the maner of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> when they would haſten the death
of any, they gave them ſome bitter potion to drinke: but this cannot be
the reaſon why they gave it Chriſt for they did it not, out of kindneſſe
or favour, but in cruelty, as we may gather by the words of <hi>David, Pſal.</hi>
69. 21. where he ſaith, <hi>they gave me alſo gall for my meat, and in my thirſt they
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:17958:115"/>
gave me vinegar to drinke. Prov.</hi> 31. <hi>Solomon</hi> willeth us <hi>to give wine to thoſe
that are weake, and ſtrong drinke to thoſe that bee afflicted;</hi> ſo the <hi>Iewes</hi> did
give wine to Chriſt, but it was wine mingled with <hi>Myrrh,</hi> it had a
tang, and a ſowre taſt with it: ſo alſo many ſuch mingled cups, we give
to our brethren, it may bee wee releeve and helpe them, but it is with a
tang, with bitterneſſe and ſowreneſſe: it is ſaid in the Scripture that
God gives to us a pure cup of comfort, and addes no ſorrow to it, ſuch
pure cups of comfort wee ſhould give to our brother: I dare ſay there
is not any man but would bee ready to condemne the <hi>Souldiers</hi> and the
<hi>Iewes,</hi> becauſe in his extremitie, they gave him a mingled cup; But let us
looke into our ſelves, what doe we? wee give him ſuch a mingled cup;
for every ſinne we doe commit, is as a drop of poyſon put into a cup for
Chriſt to drinke; therefore whereas we ſee, that we can complaine of
the ſouldiers and of the Iewes; we had neede learne to complaine of
our ſelves much more.</p>
               <p>Now Chriſt refuſed to drinke of this. This may ſeeme a ſtrange thing
in Chriſt, ſeeing hee yeelded his backe to the whip, and his head to bee
crowned, his hands to be nailed, his face to be ſpitted on, and to bee buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feted,
refuſing none of theſe things,<note place="margin">Quest. Why Chriſt refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the bitter cup.</note> What therefore was the reaſon that
he refuſed to drinke of this? I anſwer; firſt, to teach us the true lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
and extention of Chriſtian patience; for there bee two ſorts of
<hi>paſsions,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1</note> ſome there be that be of <hi>neceſsity,</hi> and ſome <hi>voluntary or arbitrary:</hi>
now thoſe that be of <hi>neceſsity,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sol. Division of Paſſion two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold.</note> ſuch our Saviour did not refuſe, ſuch as was
needfull for the ſalvation of man: but thoſe that were arbitrary, and
voluntary, thoſe our Saviour refuſed, which may teach us this high
point of wiſedome, that thoſe paſſions that bee by authoritie, and thoſe
that come immediate from God, theſe we muſt with Chriſtian patience
beare: but if it be an arbitrary or voluntary paſſion, then we may refuſe
it: it is an opinion of the world, that a Chriſtian muſt beare any thing
that is put upon him, but we ſee in the example of Chriſt, how farre our
Chriſtian patience doth extend.</p>

a great tree in a glaſſe,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> but not in the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
that it hath as it groweth, but a great
deale leſſe, for alwayes the reſemblance is leſſe
than the thing it ſelfe that is reſembled; ſo the
<hi>Goſpell</hi> is a great glaſſe that doth ſhew unto us, the
great love of Chriſt in the worke of our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
but as reſemblances be leſſe than the things
reſembled; ſo whatſoever wee ſay of the love of Chriſt it comes farre
ſhort of the love it ſelfe, which Chriſt hath ſhewed unto us; as it will
eaſily appeare by the due conſideration of the manner of Chriſts crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
and therefore let us proceed in order from that which we left at.</p>
               <p>The laſt day we made entrance upon the point, when amongſt other
things we ſpake of that bitter cup preſented unto him, whereof hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
drinke: one reaſon whereof wee ſhewed then, which was to
teach us the extent of our Chriſtian liberty, now wee paſſe on to that
which remaines.</p>
               <p>The ſecond was,<note place="margin">2</note> that we might more ſenſibly ſee the love of Chriſt
to us: for all the ſuffering which were needfull for our ſalvation he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
not, but did with patience endure them, but whatſoever was vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
or did concerne himſelfe, thoſe he refuſed. <hi>Ionas</hi> he could not
endure the heate of the Sunne for himſelfe,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> yet hee could abide to bee
throwne into the ſea for the good of others and for their ſafety; ſo
Chriſt was contented for our good to be apprehended, condemned, and
to bee ſpet upon, to bee crowned with thornes, whipped, nailed to the
croſſe, flung into the grave; and yet he would not ſuffer any thing, that
did concerne himſelfe, but refuſed it.</p>
               <p>Now the next generall point to be obſerved,<note place="margin">Fifthly, the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying of Chriſt.</note> is, <hi>the very act of his cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying,</hi>
ſhewed but in a word, <hi>Hee was crucified,</hi> and yet there is much
paine,<note place="margin">1</note> much adoe, a great deale of torment ſhut up in the belly and bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els
of that word:<note place="margin">2</note> For, firſt, they threw downe the Croſſe upon the
ground.<note place="margin">3</note> Secondly, they drew or pulled out all the fearfull inſtruments
for that purpoſe.<note place="margin">4</note> Thirdly, they ſtripped him. Fourthly, they laid him
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:17958:116"/>
on his backe, and they ſtretched out his hands and his feet upon the
Croſſe,<note place="margin">5</note> and nailed him unto it. Laſtly, they did reare up the Croſſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the ayre, as though he were unworthy to be upon the ground. And
thus we ſee, what a deale of paine and torments, is ſhut up in the bowels
of this one word: whence for our learning we may gather theſe good
inſtructions following:</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> ſeeing Chriſt was crucified for us, this ſhould make us bewaile
our ſinnes with bitterneſſe, that we ſhould be the parties ſhould bring all
theſe pains upon Chriſt, forhe ſuffred not for his own ſins, for he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
and holy, but for my ſinnes, and thy ſinnes, which we daily live
in; <hi>Eſay,</hi> 53. the Prophet ſaith, <hi>The chaſtiſement of our peace was upon him;</hi>
and 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 24. it is ſaid, <hi>Who in his owne bodie bare our ſinnes upon the tree:</hi>
therefore ſeeing our ſins brought all thoſe paines upon Chriſt, we have
cauſe to bewaile them,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> we can bewaile the puniſhments we bring upon
our ſelves, but how much more ſhould we bewaile the puniſhment wee
bring on Chriſt; as the ſpickes and the nails being driven into the hands
and feet of Chriſt, when he was crucified, made the bloud runne out at
the holes;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſo the meditation and conſideration thereof ſhould cauſe our
conſciences to bleed. And now ſeeing our ſinnes have brought Chriſt
on the croſſe; what will we doe? mock him as the wicked <hi>Iewes</hi> and the
ſouldiers did; or be ſilent, as the Diſciples were, or ſtand ſtill? No, but
we muſt after a ſpiritual manner go to the croſſe of Chriſt and ſay, Lord,
wilt thou die for me, and ſuffer ſuch great paines and torments? <hi>I have
eaten ſowre grapes, and thy teeth are ſet on edge</hi> with them; It is I that have
ſinned, but Lord thou haſt done nothing worthy of theſe great paines;
therefore, O Lord, that I may never forget this great love of thine,
though I cannot perfume thy body, as <hi>Mary</hi> did, with ſweet ſpices, yet
will I never ceaſe to waſh it with the daily teares of true repentance for
my ſinnes: But alas, we can weepe for the loſſe of our wives, of our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
but we cannot weepe for our ſinnes; therefore we ſhould doe as
the Phyſitian,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> who when hee findeth men dangerouſly bleeding at the
noſe, lets them bloud in another place, and ſo turnes the courſe of the
bloud another way; ſo our weeping for worldly loſſes, we ſhould turne
to weeping for our ſinnes, and for the loſſe of Gods favour, that thus
Christ was crucified for them.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> ſeeing Chriſt was crucified, we ſhould labour to ſee all our
ſpirituall enemies crucified with him; for when Chriſt was upon the
Croſſe, he pulled the Devill, ſinne, death and damnation to the Croſſe
with him, and ſo alſo were crucified; ſo Chriſt was not crucified alone,
but all the enemies of mans ſalvation with him: So the Apoſtle, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi>
2. 14. ſpeaking hereof, ſaith, <hi>And putting out the hand-writing of ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
that was againſt us, which was contrary to us, he even tooke it out of the way
and faſtned it to his croſſe; and having ſpoiled the principalities and powers, hee
made a ſhew of them openly, triumphing over them in it:</hi> therefore the ſame
Croſſe that ſerved to crucifie Chriſt, the ſame hath ſerved to crucifie
our ſpirituall enemies; and though the <hi>Iewes</hi> ſaw none but Chriſt upon
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:17958:116"/>
the Croſſe, thou that art a Chriſtian muſt goe further, and ſee all the
enemies of mans ſalvation, the Devill, damnation, and ſinne, crucified
with him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Vſe 3.</note> ſeeing Chriſt was crucified upon the croſſe, we must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to crucifie our ſelves; and therefore after a ſpirituall manner we
muſt goe to the Croſſe of Chriſt, and naile our hands and feet unto the
Croſſe, that we may not move a hand or a foot, to diſpleaſe God; Nay,
we muſt goe further, and crucifie our ſinfull and carnall luſts, and inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
affections; for the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>that they that are in Chriſt have
crucified the fleſh with the affections and luſts thereof:</hi> So that there is not a
true Chriſtian, but hath beene upon the croſſe already, and hath carried
his corruptions thither to be crucified; therefore looke how buſie the
<hi>Iewes</hi> were in crucifying of Chriſt, be thou as buſie to crucifie thy ſinnes
and corruptions; howſoever men may talke of the crucifying of Chriſt,
yet if thou have no care to crucifie thy ſinnes, and thy carnall luſts, thou
canſt have no comfort by it; be ſure then, as the Iewes did apprehend
Chriſt, condemned him, ſet a crowne of thornes upon his head, ſpet on
his face, nailed him to the Croſſe, killed him, and flung him into the
grave; even ſo doe thou by thy ſinnes, labour thou to apprehend thy
ſinnes, to condemne them, ſet a crowne of thornes upon them, ſpet at
them, doe all the diſgrace that may be to them, naile them to the croſſe,
and bury them in the grave of Chriſt, that ſo they never riſe againe.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Vſe 4.</note> ſeeing Chriſt was crucified, and ſuffered ſuch extremities;
This muſt teach us to ſee what extremitie all unrepentant ſinners muſt
looke for at the day of judgement; for if Chriſt ſuffered ſuch extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
that had but the imputation of our ſinnes upon him, what ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of them that live in their ſinnes, inherit them? Our Saviour wee
know ſaith, <hi>If they doe this to the greene tree, what ſhall become of the dry?</hi> If
they did ſo to Chriſt that had no ſinne, what ſhall become of thee? I
will tell thee, if thou be found in thy ſins, and have not repented them,
thou muſt looke for no mercy; for if he ſpared not his Sonne, then look
that he will not ſpare thee: <hi>For</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 21.) <hi>if God
ſpared not the naturall branches, but cut them off, take heed leſt he ſpare not thee,
who art a wilde olive tree.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">Vſe 5.</note> ſeeing Chriſt was crucified, and ſuffered ſuch extremitie for
the ſaving of thy ſoule, then thou must be contented to ſuffer any thing
to be ſaved: For, did Chriſt ſuffer for thee? And art not thou that art
a Chriſtian contented to ſuffer any thing, that thy ſoule may be ſaved?
If men did know the true value of their ſoules, they would be contented
to ſuffer any thing to ſave them, as the Apoſtle ſsaith, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. <hi>I count all
things as dung and droſſe, to be found in Chriſt:</hi> And ſo the holy Martyrs,
<hi>Hebr.</hi> 11. it is ſaid, <hi>Some of them were racked, ſome were ſawne aſunder, and
would not be delivered, that they might obtaine a better reſurrection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third thing that the Evangeliſt ſhewes in his crucifying,<note place="margin">Of the ſtripping of Chriſt.</note> is, how
they did ſtrip him; they did pull off his clothes, we ſee, firſt they put off
the purple robes, and put on his owne garments, and now when they
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:17958:117"/>
naile him to the Croſſe, they ſtrip off his owne garments, and let him
hang naked on the Croſſe.</p>
               <p>This ſheweth the <hi>merit of our ſinnes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> that wee deſerve not the leaſt bit
of bread, nor the meaneſt coat that may be, to live or to die in; hence
we may learne that every muſt labour to finde this guiltineſſe in
himſelfe, for it is the Lords mercie that we have any thing; as Chriſt
was ſtripped at his death, ſo we deſerve to be ſtripped of all comfort at
the day of death; and as <hi>Iaakob</hi> ſaid, <hi>Lord I am leſſe than the leaſt of thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies;</hi>
ſo we may ſay, Lord I am not worthy of the leaſt bid of bread, nor
of the meaneſt coat, nor of the leaſt comfort that may be. Thus the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
declares Gods goodneſſe, <hi>Lament.</hi> 13. <hi>It is the Lords mercy that wee
are not conſumed;</hi> and it is Gods mercy that we have a coat to put on our
backes, that we have a bit of bread to put in our mouths, a bed to lye in,
an houſe to put our heads in, and if we have any thing more than others,
we muſt acknowledge it is the Lords great mercy to us, and wee are to
bleſſe God for it, that he hath made our life any way comfortable to us:
And the ſame Prophet <hi>Ieremie</hi> complaines of this neglect in his dayes,
Chap. 5. 24. <hi>Neither ſay they in their hearts, let us now feare the Lord our God,
who gave us raine both early and late, and appointed unto us the weekes of harveſt:</hi>
And even ſo the Lord beſtowes on us abundance of his bleſſings; O that
men would feare the Lord for thoſe his bleſſings, that from day to day
they live in, but we have our hearts hardened like them, who, <hi>Marke</hi>
6. 52. <hi>had not conſidered the matter of the loaves, becauſe their hearts were
hardened.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> ſeeing Chriſt was naked on the Croſſe, this muſt teach us,
<hi>how naked we are in the ſight of God;</hi> that wee have not a ſpirituall grace to
cover our ſoules with, for Chriſt was not ſo naked in the ſight of men, as
we be naked in the ſight of God; every man can ſee the nakedneſſe of
his bodie, and can complaine of that, but they cannot ſee the nakednesse
of their ſoules; according to that which the Spirit of God ſaith, <hi>Revel.</hi>
3. 17. <hi>Thou ſayest I am rich and incloſed with goods, and have no need of any
thing, and knoweſt not that thou art wretched, and miſerable, and poore, and blind,
and naked.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Vſe 3.</note> ſeeing Chriſt was naked on the croſſe, this his nakedneſſe
doth ſerve <hi>to purchaſe and procure clothing for thee;</hi> therefore Chriſt was
naked on the croſſe in the ſight of men, that thou ſhouldest not be found
naked in the ſight of God, but that thou mayeſt ſtand with comfort be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God at the day of judgement, covered with the righteous robe of
<hi>Chriſt Ieſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fourth thing obſerved in the manner of Chriſts crucifying,<note place="margin">Next crucified betwint two theeves.</note> was,
That <hi>he was crucified betweene two theeves, and he was numbred amongst the
wicked;</hi> they did hang him in the middle, as if he were the chiefe of them:
Whereby we learne,<note place="margin">1</note> firſt, as it was the portion of Chriſt to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and numbred amongſt the wicked; ſo it is the portion of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to be numbred amongſt the wicked ſtill to this day.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> ſeeing Chriſt was crucified betweene two theeves, this
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:17958:117"/>
muſt teach us wiſely to diſtinguiſh betweene the croſſe of Chriſt, and the
croſſes of the theeves, for although the puniſhment was alike, yet the
cauſe was not alike, for Chriſt he died an innocent man, but they died
worthily, for that which they had done, and even ſo heere wee muſt
learne to diſtinguish betweene the puniſhment of the godly, and of the
wicked, for many times taſte of the ſame puniſhment, but the cauſe
is not alike. Yet let us beware of Popish ſuperſtitions which ſo admire
the croſſe outwardly that they eate out the life of all internall devotion
thereby:<note place="margin">Five falſehoods of popiſh Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixes.</note> and to this end let us take notice of theſe five falſehoods in
their Crucifixes.</p>
               <p>First, they picture Chriſt <hi>hanging on the croſſe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1</note> whereas he ſtood on his
feet, and wee have great authority for it, as <hi>Irenaeus, Iustine Martyr,
Gregory,</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine;</hi> all theſe affirme hee did not hang on the croſſe,
but ſtood: this is the firſt falſehood.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> they affirme and make <hi>the wound to bee on the right ſide of
Chriſt,</hi> whereas it was on the left ſide, for when the ſouldlers pierced
him, water and blood came out of it, now there is water no where about
a man but at the heart, for that onely wants cooling, which is the office
of the water about it; therefore in probability it was on the left ſide,
that being neerer the heart: and this is a ſecond falſehood.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, they naile his feet but <hi>with one naile,</hi> whereas Chriſt had two
nailes,<note place="margin">3</note> in each foot one: the Heathen could ſay, Away with him to the
croſſe, two nailes to naile his hands, and two nailes to naile his feet; and
every man cannot chuſe but thinke more than one naile was needfull to
naile his two feet. A great <hi>Ieſuite</hi> was the firſt inventor of this doctrine,
and hee pictured <hi>Chriſt</hi> with one naile in his feete: this is the third
falſehood.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4</note> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>Doth not even nature it ſelfe teach
you, that if a man weare long haire it is a ſhame to him?</hi> It was not lawfull for
a man to weare long haire, except he were a <hi>Nazarite;</hi> but they picture
Chriſt with <hi>long ſhag haire.</hi> Now we are to thinke, that Chriſt would
not ſinne againſt nature, for there was no ſinne found in him; againe he
was no <hi>Nazarite</hi> after the cuſtome of the Law, (though hee were of
<hi>Nazareth</hi> or a <hi>Nazarene,</hi> by reaſon of habitation or the place where hee
dwelt) for he did drinke wine and ſtrong drinke, which was not lawfull
for the <hi>Nazarite</hi> to doe: therefore it is very probable, (if not certaine)
that Chriſts haire was ſhort: this is the fourth falſehood.</p>
               <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5</note> all the Evangeliſts ſay, that the titles that were ſet over the
head of Chriſt, were written, in <hi>Hebrew, Greeke,</hi> and <hi>Latine;</hi> but in their
crucifixes, it is written in Latine onely; this is the fifth falſehood. So
that wee ſee, they are ſo farre from the true power and vertue of the
croſſe of Chriſt, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> they have not a true forme of it; therefore doe thou
whoſoever thou art, leaving theſe dead images, labour in the croſſe of
Chriſt to crucifie the immoderate care of the things of this life, thy
covetouſneſſe, thy impatience, thy ſinfull anger, thy uncleaneneſſe, and
though thou have no woodden croſſe, nor no ſtone croſſe, as the Papiſts
have, yet this croſſe ſhall be thy comfort and joy in life and death.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:17958:118"/>
The fifth point is, <hi>The behaviour of Chriſt on the croſſe,</hi> which of all other
is moſt worthy to be conſidered,<note place="margin">Fiftly, Chriſts Behaviour on the croſſe.</note> for though he did cary himſelfe holily
and patiently, the graces of God being fully ſeen in him in his life time,
yet eſpecially they did ſhine moſt bright and cleerely when he came to
dye; for as the ſtarres doe ſhine brighteſt in the darkeſt nights, ſo the
vertues and graces of Chriſt did ſhine brighteſt, when he was upon the
croſſe. Now this carriage of Chriſt upon the croſſe, muſt teach us
eſpecially to looke to our behaviour in our croſſes, for although a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
mans ſpeeches, actions, and behaviour, ſhould be ſeemely and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
at all times, there being no time wherein wee ſhould not walke wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of a Chriſtian calling, yet eſpecially when hee is upon the croſſe, as
it were, then he muſt ſhew all his Chriſtian vertues and holy graces, for
(ſaith one) ſuch as a man is in trouble, ſuch he is indeed, becauſe then for
the moſt part he cannot deiſſmble, when trouble is upon him, as he may
at other times,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> when he is in peace; let one put water into a glaſſe, if
the water be cleere, ſhake and joggle the glaſſe, and there is nothing but
cleere water ſeene, but if there bee mud or dregges in the bottome, if
then you ſhake it, it will flie all abroad and eaſily appeare: ſo if a mans
affections be pure, ſtirre and ſhake him, and there will nothing appeare,
but that which is pure, but if there bee dregges or mud in the bottome,
ſinnes or corruptions, then ſhake and ſtirre him, and all will fly about
and be ſeene. I have ſhewed you heretofore that the devill is like a dog,
whoſe quality is, if a man let fall a bone or give him any thing, when hee
is at meat with him,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> then the dogge will wait for more, but if hee give
him nothing, let fall no bone or crumme, the dogge will waite no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
he will ſeeke him a new maſter; ſo the devill doth; if a man bee
in trouble, afflicted with croſſes, hee will waite to ſee if a bad word or
action doe eſcape, if wee let fall any, then he will waite ſtill, but if none
fall, the devill will ſeeke him a new maſter: therefore as every man
ſhould looke to his behaviour at other times, ſo eſpecially hee ſhould
when he comes to the croſſe and in affliction.</p>
               <p>Now the carriage of Chriſt on the croſſe is ſeene in the ſeven laſt
words of Chriſt which he uttered on the croſſe.<note place="margin">The ſeven last words of Christ upon the croſſe. The first word of Christ on the croſſe.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The first is, <hi>Father forgive them, for they know not what they doe.</hi> Here
we may ſee, the love of Chriſt, that he prayeth for his enemies; and
for ſuch kinde of enemies as were his ſoreſt and greateſt, ſuch as did not
take away his garments onely, but tooke away his life; and that hee
prayed at ſuch a time, when the blood ranne downe his hands and feete,
when his ſhoulders were rent and torne with whipping, and his face
was ſwelled with buffeting. Now from theſe firſt words of Chriſt on
the croſſe we may obſerve theſe foure things:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Whom it was he prayed for;</hi> for <hi>his enemies,</hi> his greateſt and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt

that they might not anſwer for them, at the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</item>

                     <pb n="225" facs="tcp:17958:118"/>
3. <hi>The time when he prayed,</hi> at that inſtant when the action was a
doing, at that time when <hi>he did hang on the croſſe,</hi> when the
blood ranne from his hands and feete, when his ſhoulders
were rent and torne with whipping, when his face was ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with buffeting.</item>
                  <item>4. <hi>The reaſon why hee prayed,</hi> that God would forgive them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<hi>they knew not what they did.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>First,<note place="margin">First, for whom Christ prayed.</note> 
                  <hi>whom it was that he prayed for;</hi> it was, <hi>for his enemies;</hi> not ſuch as
did take away his garments onely, but ſuch who tooke away his life alſo
in the greateſt extremity that might bee. Which teacheth us two
things:</p>
               <p>First,<note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>to love our enemies, and to pray for them, that hate and perſecute us,</hi>
ſuch as doe not onely take away our garments, but our lives in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
extremity that may be; ſo we ſee 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 21. <hi>For even hereunto were
yee called, becauſe Chriſt alſo ſuffered for us, leaving us an example, that wee
ſhould follow his ſteepes;</hi> and <hi>Col.</hi> 3. ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>forbearing one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and forgiving one another, even as Chriſt forgave you ſo doe yee:</hi> this is
the firſt leſſon that Chriſt taught us on the croſſe, for as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith,
<hi>Christ made a pulpit of the croſſe,</hi> and the leſſon that he taught us was, <hi>that
we ſhould love our enemies.</hi> But in theſe daies of ſinne and corruption, we
are ſo farre from loving our enemies, that we can hardly love our friends
whom we are bound to love, both by the Law of nature and Religion,
therefore how farre are we from that example of Chriſt, which ſhewes
that every one is bound to love his enemies, and pray for them: I know
a man ſhall have much adoe to bring his heart to doe this; neither am I
a <hi>Pope</hi> to give you a diſcharge if you doe it not; but this I ſay, that if
you will take no more upon you than comes eaſily, yee ſhall never bee
true Chriſtians,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> nor truely religious: a man muſt force and dreſſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
againſt the haire (as they ſay) againſt his nature; we ſee naturally
water will runne downe the hill, but to make it runne up wee muſt force
and drive it up by violence; ſo we muſt force our ſelves, and goe againſt
nature,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> againſt the haire as it were if wee would come to heaven: if a
man come into a ſtrange country, where he can have nothing but wine
to drinke, if his ſtomacke will not beare it, the cuſtome is to allay it with
a little water; ſo ſeeing heere is in us a great heate of ſinne, that wee
can hardly love our friends and our enemies, wee muſt therefore labour
to allay this heate in us, that ſo we may not onely love our friends, but
our enemies alſo:<note place="margin">Five Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to move us to love our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</note> and that we may doe this, there bee five conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to helpe us and to further us.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>the commandement of Chriſt, Math.</hi> 5. 44. <hi>But I ſay unto you, Love
yor enemies, bleſſe them that curſe you, doe good to them that hate you, and pray
for them that perſecute you:</hi> I say unto you, I that am your Lord, I that am
your Saviour, <hi>love your enemies,</hi> and although you cannot love them for
your owne ſake, yet love them for the Lords ſake, as <hi>Luk.</hi> 5. 4. Our
Saviour bids <hi>Peter,</hi> caſt downe his net into the ſea; ſaith <hi>Peter, wee have
travelled all night and caught nothing;</hi> as if hee ſhould ſay, it is againſt the
haire, we are like to doe no good of it, it is in the night time, yet at thy
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:17958:119"/>
commandement I will doe it: So ought we to obey the command of
Chriſt, how unlikely ſoever the iſſue be, God will reward it, wee ſhall
have an happie end and iſſue.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>The example of God, Matth.</hi> 5. 45. <hi>Hee maketh the Sunne to
ſhine on the evill and on the good,</hi> and the raine to fall on the juſt and on the
unjuſt: So becauſe Gods generall goodneſſe comes to all ſorts men alike,
to good and to bad, our goodneſſe muſt extend it ſelfe to all ſorts of
men, good and bad; if we be the children of God, we muſt be like him;
<hi>Balaam</hi> could ſay,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> when he was ſent for to curſe the people of God, <hi>How
can I curſe them, whom God hath bleſſed?</hi> So if God bid us bleſſe them, we
muſt not curſe them, unleſſe wee will bee worſe than <hi>Balaam.</hi> Againe,
<hi>though they be our enemies, yet they may be Gods friends,</hi> and them which hee
loveth; as alſo it is a gift that God doth beſtow upon his children, to love
their enemies.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>Becauſe it is the greateſt love, to love that which is not capable of
love:</hi> It is nothing for a man to love his friends, but it is a hard matter to
love our enemies:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> The <hi>Philoſophers</hi> could ſay, that which is the hotteſt
fire burnes up that which is not capable to burne as we ſee in the Kings,
The fire that burned the ſacrifices, <hi>did licke up water,</hi> and conſumed that
which was not capable to burne; ſo that is the greateſt love, which
workes upon an object where there is leaſt matter of love, as the love
of God to us was.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4</note> 
                  <hi>Becauſe it is the beſt way to make our enemies love us;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> as wee
cannot quench fire with fire, but muſt quench it with water; ſo wee
muſt overcome enemies with kindneſſe, as the Apoſtles counſell is, <hi>Rom.</hi>
12. <hi>Be not overcome of evill, but overcome evill with goodneſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5</note> 
                  <hi>Becauſe if it doe not bring a bleſsing upon them, yet it will bring a
bleſsing upon our ſelves;</hi> as <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. our Saviour bids his Diſciples, when
they come to an houſe,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> they ſhould ſay, <hi>Peace be in this houſe;</hi> and if it did
not reſt on the houſe, yet it ſhould returne to them againe; ſo, when we
pray for our enemies, and bleſſe them, if it doe not reſt on them, it ſhall
returne to us againe.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">The ſecond Leſſon.</note> 
                  <hi>Seeing Christ loved his enemies, and prayed for them, much more
will hee love and pray for his friends, ſervants and people.</hi> But how doe wee
prove that?<note place="margin">Quest. Sol.</note> 
                  <hi>Becauſe he loved his enemies,</hi> and prayed for them: The chiefe
Butler forgot <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> when he was lifted up and reſtored to his Office a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine:
But <hi>Chriſt</hi> will not forget his ſervants and his people; but even
as good <hi>Ioſeph</hi> when he was exalted in <hi>Aegypt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> his father and brethren
being in diſtreſſe, he goeth to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and ſaid, Sir, I have a poore father
in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and eleven brethren; there is a famine in the Land,
and they are like to ſtarve;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> Sir, you have bread and corne enough, I pray
you let me ſend for them, and let them dwell in thy countrey and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
even in the Land of <hi>Goſhen:</hi> So Chriſt ſaith to his Father; Father,
I have a great many of poore diſtreſſed ſervants in the world, afflicted
and troubled with the temptations of the Devil, and their owne corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and with wicked and bad men; Father let us ſend for them, let
them be in thy countrey, and come into thy kingdome, let them be in
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:17958:119"/>
joy, and in all that glory which thou haſt prepared for them: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
labour thou to bee one of Gods ſervants and friends, and then
thou mayeſt aſſure thy ſelfe, that Chriſt loveth, and prayeth for thee
every day and houre, when thou art dead-hearted and heavie, and
canſt not pray, then Chriſt prayeth for thee, this may give thee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>What he prayeth for,</hi> for the pardon of their ſinnes, that God
would not lay them to their charge at the day of judgement?<note place="margin">What Chriſt prayes for.</note> Now the
pardon of our ſins is the greateſt bleſſing that we can have in this world;
this it was that Chriſt prayed for.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>When he prayed for his enemies,</hi> even in the very act, when they
drove the nailes into his hands and feet,<note place="margin">When hee prayed for them.</note> when the bloud did trickle
downe, when his ſhoulders were rent and torne with whipping, when
his face was ſwelled with buffetting, even when all his paines were upon
him: In which obſerve two things:</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> that it was in the heat of ſin, when admonition and good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell
would doe no good to them, then he prayed for them: which muſt
teach us, when we ſhould pray for our enemies, when admonition and
good counſell can doe them no good:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> When a clocke runs ryot, what,
will a man goe and pull downe the plummets? No, then it may be, he
may have his load, even to lay all on his head, but they will goe to the
great maſter-wheele that ſtirres all; So we ſhould doe when we ſee men
goe head-long to ſinne, that nothing will ſtay them, we muſt not runne
to the plummets to ſtay them, to the men, but we muſt goe to the great
maſter-wheele of the clocke, to him that carries all things and ordereth
all things, that is, to God, as 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> we ſee in the example of <hi>Abigail.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> in the very act of his crucifying, when they were in the
very heat of their malice, when the bloud did trickle downe from his
hands and feet, then he prayed for them: It may be ſome can pray for
their enemies when the heat is over, and there is a calme, but ſee, Chriſt
prayeth in the very act of their malice; ſo <hi>Act.</hi> 7. <hi>Steven</hi> did, in the very
act, when a ſhowre of ſtones came about his eares, hee kneeled downe
and ſaid, <hi>Lord, lay not their ſinnes to their charge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, the reaſon why Chriſt prayed for his enemies, becauſe
they did they knew not what. Now the words were;</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Words of Compaſsion.</item>
                  <item>2. Words of Extenuation.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>of Compaſsion,</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, <hi>Lord, they know not what
they doe;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Of Compaſſion.</note> for if they knew what an high ſinne, and great offence it were
to kill the Sonne of God, they would not doe it; ſo wee may ſay, when
we ſee men runne into all kinde of ſinnes, of drunkenneſſe, breaking the
Sabbaths, ſwearers and whoremongers, &amp;c. Alas, they know not how
highly they ſinne againſt God, for if they did they would not doe ſo,
they doe not know that it is the Devill that blindeth them, and leadeth
them downe to hell by theſe meanes, therefore good Lord ſpare them,
good Lord forgive them.</p>
               <p>

of Chriſt on the Croſſe, many teſtimonies hee
ſhewed in his life time, of faith, humility, patience,
and of pietie, but eſpecially when he came to die,
and was upon the Croſſe, then all his graces did
ſhine forth moſt cleerely; which carriage of his

when we are under the croſſe, in any affliction

is under the croſſe, in trouble and in affliction, then he muſt ſhew all his
Chriſtian graces and vertues, as <hi>Iob</hi> did, <hi>Iob</hi> 1. 22. when hee was on the

               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>The occaſion of the ſpeech,</hi> was, that hee being on the Croſſe, ſaw
his <hi>Mother,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Occaſion of the ſpeech.</note> and <hi>Iohn</hi> the Diſciple whom hee loved; for when others
fled away from Chriſt, theſe tarries with him, and followed him to the

               </list>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Firſt a Morall.</note> the <hi>Morall</hi> uſe, that as <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> gathered to the croſſe of
Chriſt, when he came to ſuffer; So we ſhould gather to our good friends
when they be in any trouble or affliction, eſpecially when they be in
their laſt extremitie, ready to die, that we be there to helpe and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
them: It is <hi>Ioſephs</hi> bleſſing, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 46. 4. That he ſhould put his hands
upon his father <hi>Iacobs</hi> eyes, that is, that hee ſhall not leave them in the
time of death: It is the tenderneſſe of many, that they cannot abide to
bee with their friends at the time of death, but wee that bee Chriſtians
muſt labour to overcome this, and performe this good duty, to helpe
and comfort them, as much as we can: It is ſaid of <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 19. 16.
That when the Angels came to his houſe, and were to goe from him, he
brought them on the way: the conſideration of which dutie, ſhould
put us in minde to performe another, namely, that when wee ſee them
readie to depart, we ſhould attend them, with good ſpeeches, with our
prayers, and never leave them, till we have brought them as farre as we
can: we reade 2 <hi>King.</hi> when God would take away <hi>Elias, Eliſha</hi> would
not leave him,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> but attended him till a firy chariot came, and tooke him
away, and ſo carried him to heaven; ſo we ſhould not leave our friends
and neighbours, but attend them with good ſpeeches and prayers, till
God hath received them into heaven, a place of glory, the very ſeat of
God.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Secondly a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall uſe.</note> the <hi>Spirituall</hi> uſe is, that as <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> gathered to the
Croſſe, as neere him as poſſibly they might; ſo every man ſhould gather
to the Croſſe of Chriſt, as neere as poſſibly he can, that when others at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
their pleaſures, profits and their ſins, yet thou mayeſt get as neere
the croſſe as thou canſt, and joyne thy ſelfe <hi>to Chriſt,</hi> that every drop of
bloud there may fall upon thy ſoule and conſcience:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> If a man come
where there is a fountaine of water, if he be a-thirſt, he will make way
to it, upon his hands and knees; ſo ſeeing God hath opened a fountaine
for us in the bloud of his Sonne, as it is, <hi>Zech.</hi> 13. 1. If we be a-thirſt we
will creepe upon our hands and knees, to make way to this fountaine
and drinke of it, that ſo wee may be nouriſhed to eternall life: The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
run to <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> to ſee the woodden croſſe of Chriſt, which when
they have done, they are never a whit the better for it; but doe thou la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to mortifie thy ſinnes in the croſſe and death of Chriſt, joyne thy
ſelfe to him by a true faith, and then thou ſhalt partake of his croſſe, eat

his body to live eternally, and to drinke his bloud to thy everlaſting
comfort. Thus much for the ſpirituall uſe.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing that was obſerved,<note place="margin">2</note> is, <hi>The ſpeech of Chriſt,</hi> wherein
wee obſerve two things:<note place="margin">The Speech it ſelfe.</note>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The tenour of his ſpeech.</item>
                  <item>2. The time of it.</item>

               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>The tenour of it,</hi> is, <hi>Woman, behold thy Sonne,</hi> and to his Diſciple,
<hi>behold thy mother,</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, take this man for thy ſonne, and hee
ſhall performe the duty of a ſonne unto thee in my roome, take him to
be thy ſonne, and take this woman to be thy mother.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>The time when hee ſpake it,</hi> when hee was in paines and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
upon the croſſe; wherein divers things are to be obſerved.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> we may ſee the care of Chriſt for his mother, that he provides
carefully for her, and therefore commends her to <hi>Iohn:</hi> Which muſt
teach us to be carefull to provide comfortably for thoſe we leave be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde
us in this world, our wives and our children; wee reade to this
purpoſe, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11. 21. that <hi>Iaakob bleſſed both the ſons of Ioſeph, by faith, when
he was a dying;</hi> It is a heatheniſh ſaying, when I am dead let heaven and
earth run together; ſuch care for no body but themſelves; but we who
are Chriſtians muſt have a care of the good of thoſe we leave behind us:
So <hi>Iſaak</hi> did, <hi>Gen.</hi> 27. 2. <hi>I am old</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and know not the day of my death,
come and let me bleſſe thee before I die:</hi> So likewiſe <hi>Elias</hi> ſaith to <hi>Eliſha,</hi> when
he was to aſcend in a firy chariot, <hi>What ſhall I doe for thee before I bee taken
from thee?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Object. Sol.</note> I, but ſome may ſay, I have no body to commit my wife and
children to, I have no friend nor kinſman: I anſwer, If thou have no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to commend them to, neither friend nor kinſman, then commend
them to God, and he will provide for them; if thou layeſt them downe
in the armes of God, he will keepe them: So ſaith our Saviour Chriſt,
<hi>Iohn</hi> 17. 11. having none but God to commend his Diſciples to, when he
was to depart this world, (ſaith he) <hi>And now I am no more in the world, but
theſe are in the world, and I come to thee; holy Father, keepe them in thy Name:</hi>
So <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 20. 32. when he had no body to commend the people to,
he commends them to God, when he was to depart from them, (ſaith
he) <hi>And now brethren, I commend you to God, and to the Word of his Grace,
which is able to build you up further, and to give you an inheritance amongſt all
them who are ſanctified:</hi> Therefore, if wee have no friend nor kinſman to
commit thoſe we leave behinde to, we muſt commit them to God, and
he will provide for them; this muſt be our care, when we are to depart
this world.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> this care of Chriſt may teach us, that hee is not onely the
Saviour of our ſoules, but of our bodies; therefore <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 35. our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
ſaith to his Diſciples, <hi>When I ſent you out without bagge, and ſcrip, and
ſhoes, lacked ye any thing? And they ſaid, nothing:</hi> ſo we ſee Chriſt did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for the body and ſoule: this is the reaſon why Chriſt did not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
teach the people, but he did feede them too, to ſhew that he was not
onely the Saviour of the ſoule but of the body too, hee did not onely
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:17958:121"/>
take care of their ſoules but of their bodies alſo: this meetes with the
common corruption of theſe dayes, in that men commit the care of
their ſoules to God, but they are afraid they ſhall want food, rayment,
and things needfull for this life, therefore they will take care for their
bodies themſelves; but it is certaine, that if Chriſt have care of our
ſoules which is the greater, hee will have a care of our bodies which is
the leſſer, this Chriſt teaches us in reaſon, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. <hi>Is not the life more
worth than meate, and the body more worth than rayment;</hi> and is not the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of glory more worth than the things of this life; therefore if he
give the greater, let us not doubt he will ſtand for to give us the leſſer,
which are the things of this life.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> this care of Chriſt muſt teach us that we muſt ſo performe our
duety to God, as we doe not neglect it to men, and we muſt ſo performe
our duety to men, that wee doe not neglect it to God; therefore the
Lord hath joyned both together, as <hi>Mic.</hi> 6. 8. <hi>He hath ſhewed thee, O man,
what is good: and what the Lord requireth at thy hand, ſurely to doe juſtly and
to love mercy, and to humble thy ſelfe, to walke with</hi>

               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Order of our Duty.</note> wee muſt doe our duety to God, then wee muſt doe it to men;

did ſubmit himſelfe to the will of his father,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and was obedient to the
death of the croſſe, after that he was carefull for his mother: ſo we muſt
doe, when we have done our duety to God, we muſt be carefull to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
duety of love and kindneſſe one to another.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4</note> if Chriſt were carefull for his mother, let us not doubt but
that he will be carefull for his church; <hi>Ioſeph</hi> when he was in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and
his father in <hi>Canaan,</hi> ſaith unto <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> Sir, I have a poore father, and
eleven brethren, that are like to ſtarve, you have corne enough, I pray
Sir,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> let mee ſend for them, and let them dwell in the land of <hi>Goſhen,</hi> ſo
Chriſt ſaith to God his father, I have a company of poore diſtreſſed ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
in the world, afflicted and troubled, I pray thee ſend for them,
bring them home unto thee, that they may behold thy glory. I but,
ſome men may ſay, indeed Chriſt was carefull for his mother, becauſe
ſhe was his mother, and his good mother too;<note place="margin">Object.</note> but what is that to me?
How may I aſſure my ſelfe, that he will be carefull for me too? To this
I anſwer,<note place="margin">Anſ.</note> that if we doe the will of God, then wee are his brother, his
ſiſter, and his mother, ſo Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. <hi>For whoſoever ſhall doe
the will of my heavenly father, he is my brother, my ſiſter, and my mother,</hi> ſo if
we doe the will of God, wee are his brother, his ſiſter, and his mother;
and as he was carefull of his mother, and did commend her to <hi>Iohn</hi> when
hee was to depart this world, ſo hee hath given a charge to this whole
world concerning his church, to heaven and earth hee hath given a
charge; to his Angels, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91. 11, 12. <hi>For hee hath given his Angels charge
ever thee to keepe thee in all thy wayes, they ſhall beare thee in their hands, that

thou hurt nor daſh thy foot againſt a ſtone.</hi> Which although it be eſpecially
ſpoken of Chriſt, yet there is not a member of Chriſt, but it concernes
too; ſo hee hath given a charge to the whole world concerning his
Church, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 105. 15. <hi>Touch not mine annointed, and do my Prophets no harme:</hi>
ſo alſo hee hath given particular men a charge to doe us good, even a
number we know not of,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> as 1 <hi>King.</hi> 17. 8. When <hi>Elias</hi> was in diſtreſſe at
the river and wanted meate and drinke, the river being dryed up, <hi>The
word of God came unto him, ſaying, ariſe, get thee to Zarephath, which is in Sidon,
and remaine there: Behold, I have commanded a widdow there to ſuſtaine thee:</hi>
ſo God hath given a charge to a number of men we know not of to
feed us, and ſuſtaine us; therefore as <hi>Chriſt</hi> commended his mother to
<hi>Iohn;</hi> ſo God hath given a charge concerning his Church, to Angels,
to the whole world, to particular perſons.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Secondly, the time when he ſpake.</note> 
                  <hi>the time when he ſpake,</hi> when hee was in paines and in tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

                  </gap> himſelfe to doe good; I know through frailety of
the fleſh,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> we ſhall have little minde to thinke or to ſpeake of any good,
but Chriſtians muſt not give place to the fleſh, but ſtirre up the graces of
God, which is in them; ſo <hi>Steven Act.</hi> 7. comming neere his death,
when a ſhower of ſtones came about his eares, kneeled downe, and called
upon the Name of God; old <hi>Iaakob</hi> alſo when he came to dye he gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
up himſelfe, <hi>and worſhipped towards the end of his ſtaffe,</hi> and bowed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe;<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 21.</note>
ſo a Chriſtian muſt reare and ſtirre up the ſpirit of grace which is
in him; if a man fill a bottle of ale, and fling it into the ſea, howſoever
a man may pull downe the bottle, it will riſe againe, if it be not held by
plaine ſtrength; ſo howſoever a Chriſtian man may bee held downe
through the paines that be upon him, yet as long as there is a Spirit of
grace in him, it wil ſhew it ſelfeat one time or other.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Thirdly, the effects of his ſpeech.</note> 
                  <hi>The effects of the ſpeech,</hi> that <hi>from that time forth hee tooke her
home to himſelfe,</hi> that is, hee tooke her for his mother, which muſt teach
us,<note place="margin">1</note> that every one muſt bee carefull to performe the will of the dead:
if it be the will of the dead, we muſt be carefull to doe it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 15. (ſaith
<hi>Paul) Though it is a mans teſtament, yet if it be confirmed, no man does abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
it, or adde any thing to it;</hi> ſo the will of a dead man is not to be diſanul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led:
and this is ſeated in nature, that it is an injury and wrong to a
dead man when they doe not performe his will, as <hi>Ier.</hi> 35. 6. <hi>And I ſet
before the children of Rechab, bottles full of wine, and ſaid unto them, Drinke
wine: But they ſaid, We will not drinke wine; for Ionadab our father comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
us, ſaying, Yee ſhall drinke no wine, you nor your ſonnes fo ever;</hi> which
they obſerved onely, becauſe it was the will of their dead father: much
more we that be Chriſtians, how carefull ſhould we be to performe the
will of the dead, ſeeing wee beleeve the Reſurrection, that we ſhall all
riſe againe? and then with what faces can we looke on them at that day?
with what face can the wife looke on her huſband, and the childe on his
father, and one brother on another, when we have not done their wils,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:17958:122"/>
but have rather done injury and wrong to them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as <hi>Iohn</hi> was obedient to Chriſt, in the eſtate of his humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
when he was upon the croſſe, much more we ſhould be to him, in the
eſtate of his glory: let us bee carefull to remember his will and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,
and doe them, for although he hath not laid, it may be, the
care of wife, or of children on thee, or of ſervants, yet he hath laid the
care of the preſerving of thy owne ſoule, and conſcience; take heed
therefore, doe not ſtarve or famiſh it, for if we doe neglect thar he puts
us in truſt to doe, how ſhall wee looke upon him at the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
we ſee in experience, if a man commit a childe to one to nurſe,
if ſhe ſhall neglect, ſtarve, and famiſh the childe, how can ſhe looke on the
party that did put the childe to her? ſo it is a greater ſinne, to ſtarve
thine owne ſoule, for this is the laſt charge that Chriſt gave to us to
feed and to nouriſh our ſoules, but if we neglect, ſtarve and famiſh them,
how ſhall we be able to looke on him at the day of judgement?</p>
               <p>Now we come to <hi>the third ſpeech of Chriſt on the croſſe,</hi>

                  <hi>the occaſion of the ſpeech;</hi> it was concerning the converſion of
the Theefe: for there were two theeves crucified with him, of whom
the one blaſphemed and rayled on Chriſt, becauſe hee would not ſave
his body nor aſſwage or mitigate his paines; the other applied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
to Chriſt for the ſaving of his ſoule, and did not care what became
of his body, ſo his ſoule were ſaved hee did not pray Chriſt, to pull out
they ſpickes out of his hands and feet, nor to aſſwage his paines, but his
prayer was for the ſaving of his ſoule. In which two are figured out all
men when the come to die, ſome deſire to have their body ſaved, and to
have paines mitigated, to be reſtored againe to their health, and becauſe
they be not, ſome of them murmure againſt God, the other ſort deſire to
have their ſoules ſaved, and care not what become of their bodies, ſo
their ſoules may bee ſaved, they deſire not ſo much to have health and
eaſe, but let all goe, ſo they may have their ſinnes pardoned, and have the
ſalvation of their ſoules, to come into Gods kingdome.</p>

                  <hi>the party that was converted,</hi> it was a <hi>Theefe,</hi> a notorious offender
and a bad liver, and a naughty man, all his life time, yet now he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
unto God, and ſaved, therefore let no man deſpaire of Gods
mercies, whatſoever thy sinnes be, it may be thou haſt been a vile liver
all thy life time, haply thou haſt lived a whooremaſter, a drunkard,
haply thou haſt been a ſcoffer of Religion, a hater of good things, a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous

mercy, if thou canſt repent, and turne to God, thou shalt be ſaved: ſo
<hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>that it is a worthy ſaying, and worthy of all men to be embraced, that
Chriſt came into the world,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>to ſave ſinners; of whom I am the cheife:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſeeing Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners, no man muſt
exclude himſelfe from Gods mercy; ſo likewiſe <hi>Ier.</hi> 3. 1. ſaith the Lord,
<hi>If a man put away his wife, and ſhee goe from him, and become another mans,
ſhall he returne againe unto her? ſhall not that land be greatly polluted? but thou
haſt played the harlot with many lovers, yet returne againe to me ſaith the Lord:</hi>
In like manner, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 20. The Prophet ſpeaketh unto the people,
<hi>Feare not, yee have done all this wickedneſſe, yet depart not from following the
Lord, but ſerve the Lord with all your hearts, &amp;c.</hi> So howſoever men have
lived wickedly, and done badly, yet let them not turne away from ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Lord, but let them be deſirous to pleaſe him, to repent of their
ſinnes, and they ſhall finde mercy with God; when <hi>Caine</hi> had killed
<hi>Abel,</hi> he cryes out, <hi>My puniſhment is greater than I can beare:</hi> upon which
words <hi>Auguſtine,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou lyeſt Caine, the Lords mercy is greater than any mans
ſinnes, if he can repent. Bernard</hi> ſaith well, We know right well, O Lord,
thou doſt not reject the <hi>Theefe</hi> that confeſſed, the <hi>ſinfull woman</hi> that wept
unto thee, nor the <hi>Canaanitiſh</hi> woman, that did humble herſelfe before
thee; nor the wicked <hi>Adultreſſe</hi> brought unto thee, nor the <hi>Toller or Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
gatherer</hi> that did follow thee, nor the <hi>Publicane</hi> that repaired unto
thee, nor the Diſciple that denied thee, nor <hi>Saul</hi> that did perſecute thee,
nor thy <hi>Tormentors</hi> that did nayle thy ſacred body to the croſſe; O
Lord, all theſe are fragrant fruits of thy moſt ſweete mercy, and by the
ſent of theſe ſweet ointments, we runne unto thee and doe follow thee.
And from hence wee conclude, that no man muſt wilfully exclude him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
from Gods mercy.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Secondly, the time when he was converted.</note> 
                  <hi>The time when he was converted,</hi> which is to be conſidered in
three circumſtances: firſt, <hi>it was when others did ſcoffe and ſcorne Chriſt,</hi>
and when the Iewes did mocke, raile and revile at him, with his fellow
theefe,<note place="margin">1</note> then at that time hee was converted: This ſhould teach us, that
we be not carried away with the bad examples that be amongſt us, that
although others ſet not a flye by Chriſt, nor care for his preciouſ blood
which hee hath ſhed for us, but rather deſpiſe it, yet wee muſt regard it,
and ſet it at a high price, and deſire to have our parts in him, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.
the Lord ſaid unto <hi>Noah, Make thee an Arke,</hi> when the world attended
their pleaſures and profits, and did what they would, hee provided an
Arke; ſo doe thou, make thee an Arke, labour to repent thee of thy
ſinnes, and to turne unto God, and to get faith in Chriſt, that thou maiſt
be ſaved though all the world does otherwiſe: wee ſee (by experience)
when a flood comes,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> looſe things, and ſuch as are not rooted, and unſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
or light things are carried away with the ſtreame, but ſuch as are
rooted and ſetled theſe remaine, the poore theefe was then converted,
when others did mocke at Chriſt, railing at him and reviling him.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> when Chriſt was on the croſſe, in his greatest humility
and abaſement, not when he was walking on the ſea, or on the water, or
working of miracles, giving ſight to the blind, making the dumbe to
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:17958:123"/>
ſpeake, the deafe to heare, cleanſing of Lepers, caſting out devils, raiſing
the dead; not when hee was giving life to others, but when others
were taking life from him, even then the theefe was converted: Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith well, <hi>Moſes</hi> beleeved God, but when was it? when
he ſpake out of the firy Mount; and <hi>Abraham</hi> was obedient to God,
to goe out of his countrey, and from his kindred into a ſtrange land,
when God ſpake from heaven; the <hi>Patriarches</hi> beleeved when he ſpake
in dreames and viſions; the <hi>Diſciples</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> ſaw the wonderous mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles;
the <hi>Centurion</hi> he was converted and beleeved, when the <hi>veile</hi> of
the <hi>Temple</hi> rent, when the <hi>rockes</hi> did flye aſunder, and when the <hi>graves</hi>
did open; but the poore <hi>Theefe</hi> hee was converted, when hee ſaw none
of theſe wonders, but when Chriſt was in the greateſt abaſement that
might be: now if the Theefe was converted to God when Chriſt was
on the croſſe, in his humility and abaſement, how ſhall wee anſwer to
God at the day of judgement, that we are not converted to him, now he
is in his glory? As <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 41. our Saviour ſaith,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> 
                  <hi>That the Ninivites
ſhall riſe up in judgement and condemne the Iewes, becauſe they repented at the
preaching of Ionas, and behold, a greater than Ionas is here:</hi> they would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
at Chriſts preaching: ſo ſay I, the Theefe ſhall riſe up in judgement
and condemne this world, in that he repented, and turned to God, when
Chriſt was in his abaſement, on the croſſe, and they have not repented
and turned to God now he is in his glory.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> hee was converted at the laſt houre of the day, when hee
came to dye, all his life time he had neglected it, and had not a thought
(it may be) of it, yet now at the laſt gaſpe hee did repent him of his
ſins, and turned to God: which may teach us, howſoever we have neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
our repentance and converſion in our life time, and have not loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
after it, and it may be, we had not a thought that way, yet when wee
come to dye, it is high time to looke after it then or never: but I dare
not wiſh any man to deferre his repentance till the laſt gaſpe, for that is
dangerous, but the beſt way is to repent as ſoone as may be: the reaſons
I will not ſtand to ſhew now, becauſe I have ſufficiently ſpoken of them
heretofore: the world abuſes this example of the Theefe, and will
therefore deferre their repentance till the laſt gaſpe that they come to
die, and ſo make of a precious oyntment, ranke poyſon. Now that it is a
dangerous thing for a man to deferre his repentance till the laſt houre,<note place="margin">Danger of late Repentance.</note> I
make it cleare, firſt, becauſe <hi>this is a ſingular example;</hi> for there is but this
one in all the Booke of God, that repented at the time of death, of ſo
many thouſand ſpoken of that have died without repentance; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this is a dangerous preſident for any man to follow: ſaith one,
<hi>There is but one example that no man may preſume, and there is one, that no man
may deſpaire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>hee repented no ſooner, becauſe he was called no ſooner;</hi> for if he
had beene called ſooner in probability, he would have repented ſooner
and turned to God: as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, no man muſt defer his repentance,
for hee that was called the firſt houre of the day, came the firſt houre,
and hee that was called the ſecond houre of the day, came the ſecond
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:17958:124"/>
houre, and he that was called the ſixth houre, came the ſixth houre; and
ſo he that was called the firſt houre did not deferre his comming till the
fourth houre, nor he that was called the ſixth houre, did not ſtay till the
laſt houre, but they came at the ſame houre of the day, that they were
called. Which muſt teach us that when God calleth us, we muſt not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
the time or delay it, but ſtraightway turne to God; ſaith <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome,</hi>
God hath promiſed the pardon of thy ſinnes, if thou doe repent,
not when wee will, but when God will give it thee: and to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<hi>Heb.</hi> 3. it is ſaid, <hi>To day if ye will heare his voyce, harden not your hearts,
&amp;c.</hi> never deferre it till to morrow, nor while the next day, for it is a
dangerous thing to deferre repentance, but more dangerous to deferre
it till the laſt gaſpe.</p>
               <p>

               </p>

                  <item>1. He reproves his fellow theefe.</item>

                  <item>3. His apologie, and defence for Chriſt.</item>

                  <item>1. Of what he reprooved him.</item>

                  <item>3. With what affection he reprooved him.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>for what he reprooved him;</hi> for the want of the feare of God,
ſaith he,<note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>feareſt thou not God?</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, if thou did'ſt feare God,
thou durſt not ſpeake as thou doſt, nor doe as thou doſt, it is the want of
the feare of God, that makes thee doe ſo: hence we collect the reaſon,
why men runne into all diſorder and ſinne, becauſe they want the feare
of God, therefore men ſweare, be drunken, runne into all prophaneneſſe
and vileneſſe, becauſe they are not afraid of the power of God, nor of
his wrath, they thinke not of condemnation or of hell; for if they
were afraid of theſe things, they durſt not ſo doe: therefore it is that
the want of the feare of God, makes men runne into all diſorder: of
ſuch <hi>Paul</hi> complaines <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 15. <hi>Their feet are ſwift to ſhed blood:</hi> and
a number of other ſinnes he reckons up that men runne into for want of
this feare, which the Apoſtle ſets downe as a cauſe of all; <hi>the feare of
God is not before their eyes, ver.</hi> 18. for where this feare is not, there is no ſin
ſo vile but men will be ready to runne into it: ſo <hi>Deut.</hi> 25. 17. ſaith the
Lord, <hi>Remember what Amaleck did unto thee, in the way when yee were come
out of Egypt: how he met thee by the way, and ſmote the hindmoſt of thee, even
all that were feeble, faint and wearie amongſt you: and he feared not God:</hi> ſo it
is the want of the feare of God, that makes men runne into all diſorder;
therefore it is a good ſigne, when men bee afraid to ſinne againſt God,
afarid of his power, wrath, diſpeaſure, hell, and damnation; but when
men thus feare God, this ſtops them in ſinne; ſo <hi>Nehem.</hi> 5. 15. ſaith hee,
<hi>I durſt not doe as the governours before me did, becauſe of the feare of God:</hi> we
read <hi>Iob.</hi> 31. 19, 20. the holy man making his Apologie, thus, <hi>If I have
ſeene any periſh, for want of clothing, or any poore without covering: if his
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ynes have not bleſſed mee, and if hee were not warmed with the fleece of my
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:17958:124"/>
ſheepe; If I have lift up my hand againſt the fatherleſſe, when I ſaw my helpe in
the gate; Let mine arme fall from my ſhoulder-blade, and my arme bee broken
from the bone:</hi> and preſently hee giveth a reaſon of it, <hi>For deſtruction
from God was a terrour to mee; and by reaſon of his highneſſe I could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure:</hi>
Therefore it is a good thing to be afraid to diſpleaſe God. A man
that dwels by the ſea ſide,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> as long as there is a wall or a banke, though
it flow fearefully, yet thinkes himſelfe ſafe, ſo long as the wall holds, but
if it be once broken downe, then he thinks himſelfe in danger of drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
ſo, as long as we have the feare of God, to be a banke or a wall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
us, we be ſafe, but if wee once breake this wall, we are ready to be
drowned with ſinne and all diſorder; therefore it is good and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to have the feare of God alwayes before our eyes.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>On what ground he reproved him;</hi> becauſe hee was readie to
die, aſwell as he, and yet it was not long before they ſhould both come
before God in judgement, to anſwer for all their ſinnes; therefore now
it is high time to feare God: In like ſort, although our caſe bee not yet
come to that extremitie as theirs was, that we are readie to die preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
yet becauſe ſentence is paſſed upon us; for as the Apoſtle ſaith,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>The body is dead becauſe of ſinne;</hi> let us, though death hath not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
taken the caſtle and tower of our hearts, yet ſeeing hee is entered
within the walls and ſuburbs of the citie; let us, I ſay, therefore be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to feare God, and to walke conſcionably before him; for we know
not how ſoone death will take the tower and the caſtle of our hearts,
and then we muſt come to judgement: This uſe <hi>Iſaak</hi> made of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaintie
of life;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> 
                  <hi>I am old</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>and I know not the day of my death,
come and let my ſoule bleſſe thee before I die;</hi> ſo because wee know not the
time of our deaths, how ſoone we muſt come to judgement; therefore,
before we ſtirre or move a foot, let us labour to repent us of our ſinnes,
and convert and turne to God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Out of what affection he did it;</hi> out of love to doe good to him,
for this is the nature of one that is truely converted, to draw others to
Chriſt: So we ſee, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 41. <hi>Andrew</hi> ſaid to <hi>Simon, We have found the
Meſſias, which is by interpretation, the Chriſt;</hi> And <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 28. <hi>The woman of
Samaria,</hi> when she had beene talking with Chriſt, <hi>goeth into the Citie and
ſayth to the men, Come, ſee a man which tould me all things that I ever did; Is not
this the Chriſt?</hi> and ſo many came to be beleevers. In nature we ſee all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
things deſire to make other things like themſelves, as fire doth
deſire to make all thigns that comes neere it fire,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſo water; and other li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
things, when they be come to ſtrength of nature, then they beget
things like unto themſelves, as a man, to beget a man, a beaſt, a beaſt like
to himſelfe; even ſo it is with a Chriſtian, he will labour to make others
like to himſelfe, when he comes to his ſtrength and ripeneſſe; indeed in
his weakneſſe he doth not, but when he commeth to his ſtrength he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
to make others like to himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>The confeſſion of his ſinne, and the puniſhment due thereunto;</hi> for
firſt,<note place="margin">His confeſſion of ſinne and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment due thereunto.</note> he doth not ſay, thou art here juſtly to receive things worthy of
that thou haſt done;<note place="margin">1</note> but hee brings or takes in himſelfe; <hi>Wee are indeed
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:17958:125"/>
righteouſly here, for we receive the due reward of our deeds:</hi> This is a note of
a man truely converted to God, to confeſſe his ſinnes, to ſhame himſelfe
and give glory to God: So if men be converted to God, they will not
talke of other mens ſinnes, but they will incloſe themſelves with others,
and make confeſſion of their owne ſins alſo; therefore when men cloake
and hide their ſinnes, it is a ſhrewd ſigne that they are not ſoundly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> he confeſſes that all theſe puniſhments and judgements of
God are juſtly upon them; this is a good ſigne of a man that is truly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
to God, to cleere the juſtice of God: as the Church, <hi>Micha</hi> 7. 9. <hi>I
will beare the wrath of the Lord, becauſe I have ſinned againſt him, untill he p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>d
my cauſe, &amp;c.</hi> So <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20 43. ſaith the Prophet ſpeaking of ſound conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<hi>And there ſhall ye remember your wayes, and your workes, wherin ye have bin
defiled, and you ſhall loath your ſelves in your owne ſight, for all th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> evils which ye
have committed.</hi> So we muſt labour to cleere the juſtice of God, in all our
puniſhments that befall us; therefore when men will wrangle and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute
with God, and doe not labour to beare with patience the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God that doe befall them, it is a ſigne that ſuch an one is not
rightly converted unto God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>His apologie and defence for Chriſt; But this man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>hath
done nothing miſſe:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His apologie and defence for Chriſt.</note> when every man was againſt him, the Governour,
ſouldiers, and Iewes, this poore Theefe could not be ſilent: This is a
ſigne of true converſion, when men can beare any thing, concerning
themſelves, with patience and ſilence, but if it be against God, and his
honour, they cannot beare it: this affection was in <hi>Moſes,</hi> for it is ſaid,
that <hi>hee was the meekeſt man on earth,</hi> when things concerned himſelfe;
but when the people committed idolatry, <hi>hee brake the Calfe in peeces and
ſtamped it,</hi> and made them to drinke of it, and he commanded every man
to put his ſword by his ſide and to kill his brother: Which muſt teach
us, that every man in his owne quarrell muſt bee ſilent: But when the
cauſe concernes God, then ſilence is dangerous, and a very great ſinne
againſt God.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4</note> 
                  <hi>The prayer that hee made,</hi> was, <hi>Lord remember mee when thou
commeſt into thy kingdome:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The prayer which he made.</note> The other theefe deſires to have his body ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
to have his paines aſſwaged and mitigated; of which, becauſe hee
was not eaſed, hee railed on Chriſt; but this Theefe did not deſire to
have his body ſaved or his paines mitigated, or to have the nailes and
ſpickes pulled out of his hands and feet, but he was contented to ſuffer
any paine, he cares not what become of his body, ſo his ſoule may be
ſaved, and he may come into Gods kingdome: Which muſt teach us,
that when we come to die, wee ſhould not take care of our bodies, but
for our ſoules, <hi>Lord remember my ſoule,</hi> I beſeech thee give mee the truth
of thy faith, give me patience, let my body feele and ſuffer what it may,
yet let my ſoule be ſaved, and bring it into thy kingdome, and then no
matter what become of my body, any thing ſhall content me.</p>

we will not now repeate, but come directly unto that which followes.</p>
               <p>The fourth thing wee began to ſpeake of was,<note place="margin">Fourthly, the theeves prayer.</note> 
                  <hi>his prayer hee made unto
Chriſt</hi> in that extremity: wherein two things are to be conſidered:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The ground of his prayer.</item>
                  <item>2. The prayer it ſelfe.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The ground of his prayer is threefold, firſt, that hee was perſwaded
he had a kingdome prepared for him,<note place="margin">1</note> howſoever hee did hang on the
croſſe baſely, and contemptibly; and that he had the diſpenſation and
diſpoſing of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="240" facs="tcp:17958:126"/>
The ſecond is, a perſwaſion that he will not keepe it to himſelfe, but
that he will impart it unto others.<note place="margin">2</note>
               </p>
               <p>The third is,<note place="margin">3</note> that he will impart it to others who are poore penitent
ſinners, not onely to the juſt, but to the penitent, and this was the ground
of his prayer. Now every one of us muſt lay this ground of prayer.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> he muſt be perſwaded that Chriſt hath a kingdome, and that he
was come into it, and hath the power and diſpenſation of it; ſo <hi>Matth.</hi>
28. 18. <hi>All power is given wee in heaven, and in earth;</hi> ſo <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 22. <hi>For
the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgement to the Sonne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> a perſwaſion, that he will not keepe it to himſelfe, but will
impart it to others; even as a conduite receiving water, doth not keepe
it to it ſelfe,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> but conveies it to others; ſo Chriſt received this kingdome,
not to keepe it to himſelfe, but to convey it unto us: as <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 29.
therefore <hi>I appoint unto you a kingdome, as my Father hath appointed unto me:</hi>
ſo Chriſt doth not retaine it to himſelfe, but hee doth impart it to all
others.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> that he will impart it to poore penitent ſinners; <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.
13. our Saviour ſaith, that <hi>he came not to call the righteous but ſinners to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;</hi>
and therefore if men will repent of their ſinnes, let them not
feare but that Chriſt will beſtow it on them, for he will not beſtow his
kingdome on the juſt onely, but on poore penitent ſinners: this is the
ground of his prayer.</p>
               <p>Now for the prayer it ſelfe, and herein wee obſerve two things:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. What he prayed for.</item>
                  <item>2. The time when hee prayed.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Firſt, what he prayed for.</note> 
                  <hi>for what he prayed:</hi> hee prayed to bee remembred when <hi>Chriſt</hi>
came into his kingdome, hee did not pray Chriſt to pull the nailes and
ſpickes out of his hands and feet, to have his body ſaved, or his paines
mitigated or aſſwaged, but he deſires to be remembred when he comes
into his kingdome, ſo he lets all the care of his body goe, and applyeth
himſelfe to have his ſoule ſaved, to be remembred when Chriſt comes
into his kingdome. Now with the other, all his care was for the ſaving
of his body and to have his body eaſed of his paines, which becauſe
Chriſt would not aſſwage, he railes on him; but this man is contented
to let all goe, ſo his ſoule may be ſaved: now in theſe The<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ves are figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
out all the men in the world, when they come to dye, with ſome all
their care is to have their life prolonged, their bodies ſaved, to have
their paines aſſwaged and eaſed; ſo wee ſee it was the care of <hi>Ahaziah</hi>
king of Iſrael, <hi>ſhall I recover my fall?</hi> all his care was to know whether he
ſhould recover of a bodily cure; ſo it is with the world, all their care is
to know whether they ſhall recover or no; but the Saints care not ſo
much for the ſaving of their bodies, as their ſoules; let the body ſuffer
what it will, they are contented to ſuffer any paines, ſo they may have
their ſoules ſaved: I have shewed you heretofore, that if an houſe bee
on fire,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> they will fetch out all the beſt things, ſo that if any periſh, it
ſhall bee the worſt, becauſe if all cannot bee ſaved, it is wiſdome to ſave
the beſt; ſo if our ſoules and bodies bee in danger, that wee cannot ſave
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:17958:126"/>
both, let us labour to ſave the beſt, which is our ſoules, as this theefe did,
not deſire to have the ſpickes pulled out of his hands and feet, to have
his paines aſſwaged and eaſed, but his deſire is to bee remembred, ſo
what paines ſoever wee endure, we muſt ſay, I am contented to beare it,
ſave my ſoule onely. If a man by a ſhipwracke bee caſt into the ſea, a
planke comming to him,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> will hee not let goe his gold and ſilver and
catch hold on the planke to ſave his life? ſo we are all floating in the ſea
of this world, ready to be drowned with the pleaſures and profits ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
ready to be ſunke as low as hell, therefore how much more had we
need to caſtaway every thing that doth hinder us, and take hold on the
meanes that God hath appointed for ſaving of our soules.</p>
               <p>I,<note place="margin">Object.</note> but what is it that he prayes for? he prayes to be remembred: why
ſhould he be remembred? hee was a theefe, a bad liver, a notorious fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
one would have thought, hee would have deſired <hi>Chriſt</hi> to have
forgotten him.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, that there be two kinds of Remembrances.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1 Remembrance of God in Iudgement.<note place="margin">Ans.</note>
                  </item>
                  <item>2 Remembrance of God in Mercy.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>there is a remembrance of God in judgement;</hi> as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9. 12. <hi>For when
the Lord maketh inquiſition for blood,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>he remembreth them: he forgetteth not
the complaint of the poore.</hi> So likewiſe in <hi>Hos.</hi> 7. 2. <hi>And they conſider not in
their hearts, that I remember all their wickedneſſe.</hi> The Lord remembreth
all the others they have ſworne, all the lyes they have told, all the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths
they have prophaned, all the houres they have miſpent; and ſo
all their ſinnes the Lord remembreth to puniſh them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>there is a remembrance of God in mercy,</hi> as <hi>Gen.</hi> 8. it is ſaid, <hi>The
Lord remembred Noah:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2</note> that was in goodneſſe and mercy; <hi>Pſa.</hi> and 132. 1.
<hi>Lord remember David, and all his afflictions,</hi> and ſo the Theefe deſired to
be remembred, not in judgment but in mercy; in like manner, <hi>David</hi>
deſired not to be remembred in judgment; where he ſaith, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 3. 25. <hi>Lord,
remember not the ſinnes of my youth, nor my rebellion;</hi> hee deſires God to
remember him in his tender mercy, and his loving kindneſſe; as alſo
here the Theefe prayed Chriſt not to remember him in his ſinnes,
and in his tranſgreſſions, but to remember him in the multitude of his
mercyes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>the time when he prayed;</hi> and it was, when hee was upon the
croſſe in paines and torments, ready to dye, then he ſtirred up himſelfe
to prayer: and this muſt teach us that when wee come to dye, wee
muſt ſtirre up our ſelves to prayer, and to repentance, and to other
Chriſtian duties: I know when paines be upon us, wee ſhall have little
minde to ſpeake, or to doe any thing, but wee muſt then ſtirre up our
ſelves to prayer, and gather up our ſelves; ſo wee ſee <hi>Stephen</hi> did, in
the 7. of the <hi>Act.</hi> even when a ſhoure of ſtones came about him, then he
ſtirred up himſelfe, and called on the name of God.</p>
               <p>Now the next thing we are to ſpeake of is, <hi>the Anſwer of Chriſt:</hi> and
that is a <hi>Promiſe,</hi> wherein we obſerve foure things.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1 Vpon what his promiſe was made.</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="242" facs="tcp:17958:127"/>
2 Vnto whom it was made.</item>
                  <item>3 What was promiſed.</item>
                  <item>4 When he would performe his promiſe.</item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1</note> upon what he made his promiſe: upon his prayer, <hi>which may teach us,
that,</hi> true prayer ſhall not want his due fruit; <hi>ſo</hi> Matth. 18. 32. <hi>ſaith the
lord,</hi> I forgave thee thy debts, becauſe thou didst pray me. <hi>And</hi> David Pſal.
120. 1. I called upon the Lord in the time of my trouble, and hee heard me: <hi>ſo</hi>
Pſal. 11. I love the Lord, becauſe hee hath heard my voyce, &amp;c. <hi>This is a great
incouragement for a Chriſtian man to pray unto God, becauſe prayer
ſhall not want his due fruit, but the Lord will heare him, and make a
ſupplie of his wants, as ſhall be meet for his glory and our good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>to whom he made his promiſe:</hi> to a poore penitent <hi>Theefe,</hi> one
that was a vile liver. This is a ſweet comfort and incouragement that
Chriſt will promiſe heaven to a poore penitent ſinner, upon his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and put him in poſſeſſion of it. All the comforts and commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in this life, all pleaſures and delights cannot doe it; let the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons
ſet their minions before them, the worldly man his goods, the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous
man his money, the hatefull man his reuenge, and the proud
man his fine apparell, all theſe cannot doe it; but upon repentance
Chriſt promiſes heaven, and puts us in poſſeſſion of it: nay, the kings
favour cannot doe it, hee may put us in poſſeſſion of lands and goods
while we live here, after death he cannot: but repentance will put one
in poſſeſſion after death.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Thirdly, what hee promiſed.</note> 
                  <hi>what he promiſed:</hi> he promiſed two things:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1 Paradiſe.</item>
                  <item>2 His owne companie.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Firſt, Paradiſe.</note> 
                  <hi>hee promiſed Paradiſe:</hi> there were two Paradiſeſ ſpoken of in
Scripture; an earthly, and an heavenly Paradiſe: now it was not the
earthly paradiſe, for that was laid waſte many thouſands yeeres before
Chriſt was borne; but it was the heavenly Paradiſe, of which <hi>Paul</hi>
ſpeaketh 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 2. <hi>I knew a man in Christ above foureteene yeeres <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
whither in the body or out of the body, I cannot tell, God knoweth which was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up into the third heavens.</hi> Hence ariſe two points of inſtruction:</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Firſt, inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> 
                  <hi>wee may ſee what a goodly change a Christian makes at the time of
death;</hi> for all the while he liveth here he hangeth on the croſſe, (as the
theefe did) in trouble and affliction, in paines and in ſickneſſe, but when
death comes it ſets an end of all; it takes a man off the croſſe, it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
a man into heaven; therefore a Chriſtian hath no cauſe to bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
of death; for if a man be prophane and live in his ſinnes, he hath
cauſe to be afraid of death, becauſe it is an ugly gate to let him into hell;
but if hee be a man of repentance then death is onely a gate to let him
into heaven: therefore a Chriſtian hath no cauſe to bee afraid of it. If
a King ſhould promiſe one that if he would come unto him hee would
beſtow ſome great office,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> or place upon him, if there ſhould bee at the
palace gate an ugly and griſly Porter to let him in, he would not caſt his
eye on the ugly porter, but upon the Kings palace; even ſo death is as this
ugly and griſly porter, to let a man into heaven, let us not therefore
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:17958:127"/>
looke upon the ugly face of death, but upon heaven, the place we are
going to. We ſee when <hi>Elias</hi> was taken up into heaven, there came <hi>a
firy chariot,</hi> and horſes of fire to fetch him, and yet he was not afraid, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it was the chariot and horſes that ſhould carry him to heaven;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> So
death, though it came like a firy chariot, and bring horſes of fire with it,
yet let us not be afraid of it, becauſe it is the chariot and horſes which
ſhall carry us to heaven.</p>
               <p>The ſecond inſtruction is,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>That a Chriſtians eſtate is better than Adams
was in the time of his innocencie;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Inſtruction.</note> for he had an earthly Paradiſe, but a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
ſhal have an heavenly Paradiſe: therefore ſeeing we would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to take any paines, to be put into poſſeſſion of the earthly Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe,
if it were poſſible; how much more then ſhould wee labour and
take paines to be put into poſſeſſion of the heavenly Paradiſe?</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>He promiſes him his company,</hi> that he ſhall fare no worſe than
he fares,<note place="margin">His owne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</note> and ſhall goe where he goes: And this is a ſweet comfort to a
Chriſtian, that Chriſt hath made ſuch a promiſe, that he ſhall have his
company; as <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. 24. <hi>Father, I will that they which thou haſt given mee,
be with me, even where I am, that they may behold my glory:</hi> So <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 3. <hi>And
if I goe and prepare a place for you, I will come againe, and receive you unto my
ſelfe, that where I am, there you may be alſo:</hi> Therefore let a man labour to
be joyned to Chriſt here in the uſe of good meanes, in the kingdome of
grace, and he ſhall be joyned to him in the kingdome of glory, he ſhall
goe where Chriſt goes, ſhall fare as Chriſt fares, and ſhall bee where
Chriſt is.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4</note> 
                  <hi>The time when he promiſeth Paradiſe, and his company; This day,</hi>
he would not deferre it,<note place="margin">The time of ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie.</note> for moneths and for yeares, but <hi>This day:</hi> Which
may teach us, that the ſoules of the faithfull, when they die, goe into
heaven immediately; the Papiſts ſay, that there is a middle place, that
their ſoules muſt go to, where they muſt ſtay a time, til they be through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
purged from their ſinnes; but this errour is refuted in the example of
the <hi>Theefe,</hi> for when he died, his ſoule went into Paradiſe immediately.
I, but ſome object and ſay, that this was a ſpeciall priviledge of the <hi>theefe,</hi>
and to none other.<note place="margin">Object. Sol.</note> To this I anſwer, that the ſame priviledge is to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
faithfull man; as we may ſee, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 22. when <hi>Lazarus was dead, hee
was carried by the Angels into Abrahams boſome,</hi> into a place of reſt and joy:
And the <hi>Rich-man</hi> when hee died, was carried into hell, a place of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
there are but theſe two places to goe to, when a man is dead, that
the Scripture makes mention of, there is no middle place; when men
die, they goe either to <hi>Heaven</hi> or to <hi>Hell,</hi> for we know that all men that
die in the ſtate of repentance, goe to heaven; they which die impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
to hell: and therefore it is a vaine thing to pray for them, for their
eſtates cannot be altered.</p>
               <p>I,<note place="margin">Queſt. Sol. Object.</note> but is there any hurt to pray for our dead friends? I anſwer, if thou
knoweſt not, I will tell thee what hurt there is by it; it ſhewes thy infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
and unbeleefe, that thou doeſt not beleeve the Scriptures. I, but
may I not ſpeake of my dead friends, would you have me ſay nothing
of them? If thou doeſt not know what to ſay of them,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> ſay as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:17958:128"/>
of the godly, that <hi>they are aſleepe in the Lord;</hi> ſo we ſee what we may ſay
of our friends, that they be now aſleepe in the Lord: Or as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith,
that <hi>the remembrance of the juſt are bleſſed,</hi> ſuch an one is of holy remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,
ſuch an one was an holy man.</p>
               <p>The uſe of this point is,<note place="margin">Vſe.</note> ſeeing after death the godly goe to heaven,
a place of glory and happineſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we therefore muſt labour to be obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to God to doe his will, and to be content to endure the troubles of
this life with patience; as the children of Iſrael walked in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
forty yeares together, following God in a cloud by day, and a pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
of fire by night, enduring many troubles and afflictions till they
came to the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> ſo we muſt follow God, labour to doe his
will, and be contented to endure the troubles and afflictions of this life,
be it forty or fifty yeares together, till wee come to this heavenly
<hi>Canaan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>fourth words of Chriſt on the Croſſe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 27. 46.</note> were, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt
thou forſaken mee?</hi> But having ſpoken of theſe words not long ſince, I
ſhall not need to ſpeake of them againe at this time: Onely I will give
you the heads of them, which are foure:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. What it is to be forſaken of God.</item>
                  <item>2. How farre forth a true Chriſtian may be forſaken.</item>
                  <item>3 What a grievous thing it is to be forſaken of God.</item>
                  <item>4. How a Chriſtian ſhould carry himſelfe, when hee is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>What it is to be forſaken of God,</hi> that is to want the gratefull and the
acceptable preſence of God, which is two-fold: Firſt, <hi>There is a preſence
of God in power,</hi> to uphold his creatures, and to give a being to them. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
<hi>There is a preſence of God in goodneſſe and grace;</hi> to want this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
is to be forſaken of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>How farre forth a true Chriſtian may be forſaken;</hi> In the life of
nature he may be forſaken; in the life grace he cannot finally or totally,
for <hi>there is the power of grace,</hi> and <hi>there is the comfortable feeling of grace.</hi> Now
every true Chriſtian hath the power of grace, but many times want the
comfortable feeling of it: and ſo farre a true Chriſtian may be forſaken.
Thirdly, <hi>What a grievous thing it is to be forſaken of God,</hi> for if he have forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
us whom ſhall we make our moane to it was the complaint of <hi>Saul,</hi>
that <hi>the Philiſtines were come upon him, and God was departed from him:</hi> wee
count it a great matter to be forſaken of our kindred, or of our friends;
O but it is a far greater matter to be forſaken of God: therefore though
our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ndred, our friends, and the world forſake us, yet pray to God that
he doe not forſake us. Fourthly, <hi>How a Christian is to carry himſelfe when
he feeles himſelfe forſaken;</hi> which was ſhewed in the example of Chriſt:
Firſt, <hi>he carried himſelfe mournefully:</hi> Secondly, <hi>he carried himſelfe holily:</hi>
he reſted himſelfe on God by faith. Thirdly, <hi>he laboured to recover him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
by prayer.</hi>

our conſideration, all that Chriſt did upon the

Chriſtian vertues: therefore looke how Chriſt
carried himſelfe when hee was on the Croſſe, ſo
we muſt carry our ſelves, when we be under our

Chriſt ſhewed in his life time, of love, patience, humilitie, zeale,

So, howſoever a Chriſtian is to ſhew many teſtimonies in his

               <p>Now the Holy carriage of Chriſt is ſeene in the ſeven laſt words of

<hi>the care he had of his friends.</hi> The third, <hi>the promiſe he made the theefe upon
his converſion at the houre of his death;</hi> whereby all the people of God
have aſſurance of a bleſſed and a happie change after death, though they
hang on the croſſe, in trouble and affliction, in paines and in ſickneſſe

them from men to God, from earth to heaven; from mortalitie
to immortalitie, from paines to eaſe, from ſorrow to joy, from ſhame
to glory; and as he ſaid to the Theefe on the Croſſe, <hi>This day thou ſhalt be

of the fourth, <hi>His deſertion;</hi> when hee cried out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt

               <p>Firſt, <hi>What were the cauſes of his thirſt,</hi> and they were two:</p>

               <p>The <hi>Naturall cauſes</hi> were theſe:<note place="margin">1</note> The firſt was <hi>long abſtinence from meat

                  <note place="margin">The naturall cauſe of it.</note> hee was a whole night and day without any refreſhing; Hee
never ate bit from the time hee ate the <hi>Paſſeover,</hi> till this time; this was
a great matter eſpecially in that Country: for we read, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13. 15. <hi>How the
Iewes did looſe their Oxen and their Aſſes on the Sabbath, and had them to the
water,</hi> they could not well tarrie a day without drinking; therefore it was
a great matter for a man to tarrie without meate and drinke ſo long, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
being ſo toſſed and tumbled as Chriſt was; indeede if he had beene
idle and done nothing, he might the better have borne it: But Chriſt was
in action and in imployment, for they puld him in the Garden, from
thence hurried him to <hi>Annas,</hi> and from <hi>Annas</hi> to <hi>Caiaphas;</hi> and in the
morning from <hi>Caiaphas</hi> to <hi>Pilate,</hi> from <hi>Pilate</hi> to <hi>Herod,</hi> from <hi>Herod</hi> backe
againe to <hi>Pilate,</hi> and then to the <hi>Croſſe.</hi> So Chriſt was in action and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and yet all that while tooke no ſuſtenance, he was without any refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing;
this could not chuſe but make him thirſty.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> When <hi>Sampſon</hi> had
killed a thouſand <hi>Philistins,</hi> hee cried out, <hi>give me water, or I ſhall die for
thirſt:</hi> ſo when Chriſt had encountred not with the <hi>Philistins,</hi> but with
our ſpirituall enemies, the <hi>Divell, Sinne, Death, Hell</hi> and <hi>Damnation,</hi> and
had overcome them all, he cried out, <hi>I thirſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond reaſon was,<note place="margin">2</note>

theſe were the <hi>Naturall cauſes</hi> of his thirſt: All which was to ſhew that it

and ſorrow.<note place="margin">The Morall cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Chriſts thirſt.</note> Therefore we muſt take heed we doe not caſt away that for a

               <p>
                  <hi>The Morall cauſes were:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1</note> Firſt, <hi>hee thirſted that we might not thirſt;</hi> for
ſuch is our ſinfulneſſe, that we deſerve not when wee lie on our ſicke beds

<pb n="247" facs="tcp:17958:129"/>
of wine to refreſh us, nor of cold water to coole us: wee that have ſo many
pots to drinke by the pound, or by the dozens, by the yard, the time may
come that we cannot have a drop of water to coole us with. We ſee the
<hi>rich gluiton</hi> that in all probability had his taſters, and all varietie of dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieſt
diſhes and rareſt wines to pleaſe his palate in this life, being in Hell,
deſires but a droope of water to coole him and could not have it; and
this is the deſert of our ſinnes. But Chriſt thirſted, that wee might not
thirſt: And therefore wee may ſay, O bleſſed bee God for the thirſt of
Chriſt, for it hath procured many a ſweete drop for us.</p>
               <p>The ſecond cauſe that Chriſt thirſted was <hi>to fulfill a Scripture.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2</note> This is
a point very obſervable,<note place="margin">To fulfill a ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> that all that Christ did was to fulfill the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
which is a phraſe very common through the whole Booke of
God: I will inſtance onely in the Goſpell by Saint <hi>Matthew;</hi> Chriſt was
<hi>borne of a Virgin,</hi> to fulfill the Scripture, chap. 1. 22. So alſo he was borne at
<hi>Bethlehem,</hi> chap. 2. 5. <hi>He dwelt in Nazareth, vers. ult. Went and dwelt in Caper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>um,</hi>
chap. 4. 13. onely to fulfill the Scripture: and ſo in many other
places both of this and the other Evangeliſts, it is ſaid, Chriſt did ſo and
ſo, that the Scriptures might bee fulfilled: whence wee learne this point
of inſtruction; <hi>That all that Chriſtians doe, muſt be to fulfill a Scripture:</hi> wee
muſt not looke to our owne eaſe, and to our owne content, but wee muſt
carrie our eye to the Scripture to fulfill that. This muſt be the reaſon why
we read, why wee heare the Scriptures, or come to heare the Word prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
why we pray and come to Church, why we doe give to the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of the Saints, and why we doe the duties of our Callings; all to fulfill
the Scriptures. As Marriners when they be at Sea, howſoever the windes
blow here and there, yet looke to their Card and Compaſſe, and eye that,
becauſe it is their direction; ſo Chriſtians muſt doe, how ever the winds
blow here and there, yet they muſt eye the Scriptures, becauſe it is their
direction, and keepe cloſe to them, when prophane wretches, the ſons of
<hi>Belial,</hi> be ſwilling and drinking; doe they eye the Scriptures? doe they
that they doe to fulfill the Scriptures? No verily, except it be this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in the 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 10. 7. <hi>They ſate downe to eate and drinke, and roſe up to
play:</hi> or this, <hi>Iob</hi> 21. 13. <hi>They ſpend their dayes in wealth, and ſuddenly goe
downe to the grave;</hi> ſo they ſhall have but ſmall comfort of ſuch fulfilling
the Scriptures. But let us fulfill the Scriptures, as Chriſt did, and then wee
ſhall have comfort in life and death. He fulfilled many Scriptures before,
and had but this one to fulfill; ſo that hee could not be at reſt till hee had
fulfilled it: So when we have fulfilled many Scriptures, and be upon our
ſicke beds, if there come one more into our mindes, there is ſuch a Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to be fulfilled, ſuch a neighbor to be reconciled unto, or there is ſome
wrong to be righted, we ſhould not bee at reſt till wee have done it. It is
the manner of the World, if they have fulfilled one or two Scriptures,
they take a diſpenſation for the reſt, if they come to Church in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone,
they thinke they neede not come in the afternoone; If they pray
in the morning, they may live looſely all the day after; If they have done
one dutie or two, they have done enough? But a Chriſtian muſt doe all
the Scripture commands, and have an eye to all the commandements of
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:17958:130"/>
God, to doe them: As <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>I have reſpect to all thy Commandements,</hi>
and <hi>Pſa, lme</hi> 18. for ſaith he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>His Lawes are before mee, and I did not caſt away
his Commandements:</hi> Therefore if a man hath done a number of good du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
that the Lord commands him, and he remembers one thing that hee
hath not done, he muſt labour to doe it; for we muſt not make conſcience
of ſome duties, and neglect others; but ought to make conſcience of all
the Commandements of God.</p>
               <p>The third cauſe is,<note place="margin">3</note> that by <hi>his thirſt,</hi> wee might <hi>learne to be a thirst;</hi> for
all the Actious of Chriſt on the Croſſe,<note place="margin">That by his thirſt, we might learne to thirſt.</note> are for our example: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as Chriſt thirſted for water, ſo we ſhould thirſt for the Spirit of grace.
As he ſaid, <hi>I thirſt,</hi> ſo a Chriſtian man muſt ſay, O good neighbour <hi>I thirſt;</hi>
but what doſt thou thirſt for? not for wine and ſtrong beare, but I thirſt
for <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> for ſanctified graces, faith, repentance, the pardon of my
ſinnes, for Heaven and happineſſſe, and for Gods favour. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith,
there be divers thirſts in the world, ſome thirſt after wine &amp; ſtrong drink,
ſome after goods and lands, ſome after honour and preferment, ſome
after pleaſure, and ſome after blood: But thou O man, doe thou thirſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Heaven and happineſe; be athirſt for Gods favour, for the pardon of
thy ſinnes and for righteouſneſſe, and then thou ſhalt bee ſatiſfied; for
our Saviour ſaith,<note place="margin">Math. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Bleſſed are they that hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſſe,
for they ſhall be ſatiſfied.</hi> Indeede there bee a number of Chriſtians in the
World, every one of whom hath his thirſt; the <hi>covetous</hi> man after his
goods, the <hi>hatefull</hi> man for revenge; but the Chriſtian man he muſt thirſt
for Gods favour. So <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>My ſoule thirſteth after thee, &amp;c.</hi> therefore
howſoever the men of the world thirſt after lands and livings, thou that
art a Chriſtian, muſt thirſt after <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> and for the <hi>pardon of thy ſins,</hi>
and thou ſhalt bee ſatiſfied, when they with the <hi>rich glutton</hi> in Hell ſhall
thirſt, and have not a droppe of water to refreſh them or coole them.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>how Chriſt carried himſelfe in his thirſt,</hi> hee complained and
cryed out and ſaid,<note place="margin">Chriſts carriage in his thirſt.</note> 
                  <hi>I thirſt:</hi> which may teach us, that <hi>the people of God are not
ſtockes and blockes, but they have ſenſe and feeling of their wants.</hi> We ſee Chriſt
complained of his thirſt, ſo we may complaine to God of our wants: And
is it not alſo as lawfull to complaine to men? Yes, but wee muſt be ſure to
uſe no unlawfull meanes to eaſe our ſelves, but wait on God where we may
ſee the difference between a true chriſtian and a man of this world<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> for the
one may deſire peace, eaſe, wealth and ſuch like, but there is a moderation
in their deſires, not to have it with any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition, but by good means; which
if they thus obtaine not, they can reſt contented with the good wil of God;
ſo we may deſire theſe things, but not againſt the peace of conſcience; but
the other, the men of this world care not what means they uſe, to have their
deſires, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. when Chriſt was hungry, the devill came to him, and
bade him <hi>turne ſtones into bread;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſo the devill doth ſtill, when Chriſtians
are in want and neceſſity he will come to them, and bid them turne ſtones
into bread; that is, uſe unlawfull meanes, put themſelves upon bad cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
to come out of it; but wee muſt take heed of this, if wee have not our
deſires, yet wee muſt waite on God and be contented with his good will:
So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 123. the Church doth, <hi>As the eyes of a ſervant looke to the hands of his
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:17958:130"/>
master, and as the eyes of a maiden to the hands of her miſtris, ſo our eyes waite on
the Lord our God till he have mercy on us.</hi> In like manner if we be in want or
in any trouble we may deſire to come out of it, but we muſt uſe no unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
meanes, only waite we muſt on God, and be contented with his good
will whatſoever it be, in the uſe of good meanes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>the time of his complaint; When all things were accompliſhed,</hi> when
he had loſt a great deale of blood, and indured a great deale of paine; All
this time he held it to himſelfe till he had ſet mans ſalvation in ſafetie, and
made that ſure, he never complaines of his thirſt. Wherein we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
the marvellous love of Chriſt, that till hee had made mans ſalvation
ſure, did not looke to himſelfe; ſuch a carefull eye he carried for our good,
and ſafetie: Which love of Chriſt to us, muſt teach us to ſhew the like
love to him againe, to forget our owne eaſe, profit and pleaſures, that wee
may doe ſervice to him: as <hi>Io<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> did, <hi>I have</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>preferred the words of his
mouth before my appointed food:</hi> So <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. Chriſt being weary ſet himſelfe
downe on a Well when his diſciples were gone into the citie to buy meat;<note place="margin">Simile.</note>
in which time came a woman to draw water, whom hee did convert, after
which when his diſciples came againe with meat, and would have had him
to eate, he made this anſwere, <hi>That it was meate and drinke to him to doe his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
will:</hi> He had not ſo much regard to himſelfe as to his Fathers will; ſo
it muſt bee with a Chriſtian, hee muſt paſſe by himſelfe, and care not what
become of him, ſo God may have glory: Wee may ſee a worthy example
hereof in <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſervant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. 33<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who being ſent to get a wife for his

                  </gap>et before him, he could not eate till
he had done his buſineſſe he came about: Now if a ſervant have ſo much
care of his maſters buſineſſe, that hee would not eate or drinke till hee had
done it, much more ſhould we be carefull to do Gods will; therefore when
men have ſo much regard to their owne caſe, and profit, and paſſe by that
which tends to Gods Glory, this doth ſhew that there is not the like love
to Chriſt, we ſee in experience, if a childe fall into the fire, or water, if the
mother heare of it,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> what buſineſſe ſoever ſhe hath, ſhee lets all alone, and
cannot be at reſt, till ſhe hath ſet her childe in ſafetie againe; ſo it was with
Chriſt, he forgate himſelfe till hee had ſet our ſaluation in ſafety, and then
he did thirſt; and we ſhould ſhew as neere as may be the like love to Chriſt
againe.</p>
               <p>The fourth was,<note place="margin">4</note> 
                  <hi>The Event of his thirſt;</hi> Chriſt being on the croſſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines
of thirſt;<note place="margin">The event of his thirſt.</note> Now is there any that brings him wine, to comfort him,
or drinke to refreſh him, or water to coole him? No, but <hi>they give him
vinegar to drinke:</hi> And becauſe it was not afflictive enough, they gave him
it with <hi>Hyſſope</hi> to make it more bitter and ſowre. Here we may ſee the vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the ſouldiers to give ſuch a draught to Ieſus Chriſt, our Lord and
bleſſed redeemer in his extremity, we are all ready to condemne them, and
that juſtly for it, but I pray God we be not the men and women, that doe
the like. For as Chriſt ſaid vpon the croſſe, <hi>Sitio, I thirſt;</hi> ſo be ſaith now
to all the men and women by his ſpirit in the world, <hi>Sitio, I thirſt,</hi> what wilt
thou ſtand ſtill and gaze upon him, or wilt thou not regard him? I dare
lay, that there is never an one here but would be ready to ſay, Lord, what
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:17958:131"/>
wouldſt thou have, what is it thou thirſteſt for? Why, I thirſt not for the
wine, nor for the ſtrong drinke, nor for thy honey or thy milke; But, O
man, I thirſt for thy ſalvation, thy converſion, thy Repentance, and for thy
faith. And therefore ſeeing we heare that Chriſt doth thirſt, what wilt thou
doe, O man, wilt thou give him vinegar to drinke, as the ſouldiers did? or
wilt thou give him wormewood to drinke, or temper a cup of poyſon and
give him? Now the truth is, There is no wormewood or gall ſo bitter to
our taſte,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> as thy impenitencie, hard-heartedneſſe, and the ſinnes thou liveſt
in are unto Chriſt, for every ſinne we commit, we doe as it were, put a drop
of poyſon into a cup for Chriſt to drinke; therefore whereas we condemne
the ſouldiers, we had neede condemne our ſelves, and come home to our
ſelves; Let us therefore temper a better cup for Chriſt to drinke on than
this, let us repent us of our ſinnes, convert and turne to him, this will ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
Chriſt. Wee reade in the Engliſh Chronicles of a Monke, that got a

Liege-lord to drinke; Now I dare ſay there is never an one here but doth
deteſt the fact. But the truth is, every ſinne we commit, we doe, as it were,
temper ſuch a cup of poiſon for Chriſt our bleſſed Saviour and Redeemer;
therefore I pray God, whereas we condemne them for this vile fact, that
there be not juſt cauſe to condemne our ſelves.</p>

                  <hi>what he meant, when he ſaith, It is finiſhed:</hi> The full meaning is not
expreſſed in this place, but it was ſome ſecret and cloſe action, that was in
the minde and thought of Chriſt, that he had an eye to the perfecting and
fulfilling of. Now what was that all theſe Scriptures ſhew us, <hi>Luk</hi> 19. 10.
<hi>The Sonne of man is come to ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>The Sonne of man came not to be ſerved, but to ſerve, and to give his life for the

                     </gap>alves;
but by his owne blood, entered he once into the holy place, and obtained eternall ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
and redemption for us:</hi> theſe were in the heart and minde of Chriſt,
therefore it is out of queſtion, that Chriſt, by ſaying <hi>It is finiſhed,</hi> meant the
finiſhing and perfecting of the great worke of mans Redemption, which
the Apoſtle intimates, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10. 14. <hi>With one oblation and offering hath bee
conſecrated for ever them that are ſanctified:</hi> Alluding to this very action of
Chriſt; ſo that by this ſaying of Chriſt, <hi>It is finiſhed;</hi> is to bee underſtood
the finiſhing and perfecting of mans ſalvation and redemption. Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
this conſummation or finiſhing, there is another conſummation, that
is ſpoken of <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. <hi>Thus the heavens and the earth were finiſhed and all the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oſt
of them;</hi> which finiſhing is of the <hi>worke of Creation,</hi> but what comfort could
a manhave, that God hath made the heavens to cover us, and the earth to
beare us, ſea and land to feede us, the ſunne and moone and the ſtarres to
give us light, if Chriſt alſo had not finiſhed and perfected mans ſalvation
and redemption on the croſſe.</p>
               <p>There is alſo another conſummation and finiſhing, which is ſpoken of,
<hi>Revel.</hi> 10. 7. <hi>That the myſterie of God ſhall be finiſhed, as he hath declared to his
ſervants the Prophets.</hi> Now what is this myſterie of God? It is the end of
the world. But alas, what availes it us for the world to have an end, if this
redemption and ſalvation be not finiſhed and perfected by Chriſt; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all other conſummation is nothing without this: for what is it to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
a great building, or to finiſh ones eſtate in greatneſſe, or to finiſh all
his dayes in joy and delights, unleſſe hee have finiſhed his ſalvation, and
applied Chriſt unto himſelfe? This is the happieſt conſummation that is,
this is the joy and content of a Chriſtian when he lyeth on his death-bed;
he can ſay, Lord I thanke thee, I know my ſalvation is finiſhed in Chriſt,
I have applied him unto my ſelfe, and I finde by the merit of his death
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:17958:132"/>
and paſſion my ſalvation to be perfected: Therefore, into thy hands will
I commend my ſpirit, ſtedfaſtly beleeving, that at the latter reſurrection
I ſhall enjoy the bleſſed preſence of my Lord and Saviour Ieſus Chriſt.
Happie, yea thrice happy is the eſtate of ſuch a man that ſhall thus depart
in the Lord. The uſes to be made hereof are theſe following.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> ſeeing our ſalvation and redemption is perfected and finiſhed in
Chriſt, as the Apoſtle concludes, Rom. 8. 1. <hi>There is no condemnation to
thoſe that be in Chriſt Ieſus:</hi> Why? becauſe Chriſt hath anſwered the juſtice
of God, and hath beene condemned already; therefore, hee that is in
Chriſt, ſhall not be condemned: As <hi>Eſay</hi> 53. 5. <hi>It is ſaid the chastisements
of our peace is upon him, and with his ſtripes we are healed;</hi> and <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. <hi>All wee
like ſheepe have gone astray, we have turned every one to his owne way, and the
Lord hath laid upon him the iniquitie of us all.</hi> Wee ſee <hi>Iohn</hi> 18. when the
ſouldiers came to take Chriſt, ſaith he, <hi>If yee ſeeke for me, let theſe goe:</hi> let
me ſuffer, and let theſe goe free: So Chriſt doth interpoſe himſelfe to the
Iuſtice of God, and ſaith, Father, let my people goe free, let me ſuffer that
which they ſhould ſuffer, and beare that which they ſhould beare. Thus
we ſee our ſalvation is made ſure in the holy Perſon of Chriſt, and there is
no condemnation belongs to them who are in him; therefore let us labor
to be in Chriſt, that wee may ſay with the Apoſtle, <hi>The life which I live
now in the fleſh, I live by the faith of the Sonne of God,</hi> &amp;c. and then there is
no condemnation belongs to us, but life and ſalvation is ſure, becauſe all
is finiſhed in the holy perſon of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> ſeeing our ſalvation is perfected and finiſhed in Chriſt, all
our care muſt be to apply and to lay hold on Chriſt; for though hee hath
purchaſed ſalvation for us, yet if wee doe not apply him, and lay hold on
him, we are never the better for it. If a man ſhould ſtand in the cold ſtarke
naked,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and one come by and ſee him, who ſhould ſhow compaſſion to
him, and get clothes and put it to make for him; how would this man
carry his eye all the while to the workeman; and when hee ſaw it all was
finiſhed, would lay hold of it with both his hands, and put it on his backe
to cover his nakedneſſe: so we ought to carr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e our eyes on Chriſt, ſeeing
<hi>ſalvation</hi> is wrought in the midſt of us; as the Pſalmiſt ſaith, therefore we
ought to put forth both our hands, and to lay hold on this ſalvation fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
and perfected by Chriſt. It is a ſtrange corruption, that many know
it and heare of it, that it is finiſhed; but they ſo attend their pleaſures,
profits, and eaſe, that they never regard it. Therefore, it muſt bee every
mans care, ſeeing ſalvation is finiſhed by Chriſt, to apply and lay hold
of it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Vſe 3.</note> ſeeing ſalvation and redemption is finiſhed and perfected by
Chriſt, we may ſee what a hatefull and a deteſtable doctrine, the doctrine
of Poperie is: for they ſay that every one may finiſh his redemption
without Chriſt, and merit ſomething at the hand of God by his owne
workes: Notwithſtanding, all the paines that Chriſt ſuffered to redeeme
man, and ſo they make the worke of mans redemption of none effect; nay
the moderateſt of them ſaith that ſalvation is begunne in Chriſt, but they
muſt finiſh and perfect it in themſelves; whereas the Scriptures doth at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:17958:132"/>
all to Chriſt onely, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25. <hi>Wherefore he is able alſo to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt
to ſave them, that come unto God by him, ſeeing he ever liveth to make
interceſſion for them:</hi> and <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 14. <hi>For with one offering hath he conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for ever them that are ſanctified:</hi> ſo then wee may ſee that Chriſt is a
perfect Saviour.<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> But why then are we commanded to worke out our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
with feare? I anſwere,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> Chriſt hath <hi>wrought</hi> ſalvation by himſelfe
alone, but we muſt apply it. Secondly, <hi>the time when he ſaid it is finiſhed;</hi>
which is to be conſidered <hi>in two circumſtances:</hi> Firſt,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>when hee was ready to
die,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The time when he ſaid it is fini<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſhed.</note> and to part with this world, then he ſaid, <hi>It is finiſhed,</hi> and never till
then; as if he ſhould ſay, all this while it hath beene a working, and a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and now by my death it is finiſhed.<note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>Foure thouſand yeeres</hi> the World
was in expectation of it; all the <hi>Patriarkes</hi> and <hi>Prophets</hi> have looked for it;
and thirtie three yeeres hee himſelfe upon earth was a working of it, and
never till now when he comes to die, to the cloſing of his life, did he crie
out, <hi>It is finiſhed.</hi> Thus wee may ſee what a deale of labour and paines it
coſt Chriſt to redeeme us: He was foure thouſand yeeres a preparing it,
and he was three and thirtie yeeres a working it; which doth ſhew what
a great worke the worke of mans redemption was. God was but ſixe daies
a making the World, but he was three and thirtie yeeres, a long time of
redeeming it. Hence let us bee inſtructed, that when wee have ſpent our
dayes in Prayer, in hearing of the Word, reading of the Scriptures, in
meditation, and in much labour and toyle; If wee can ſtand before God
with comfort, and ſay at the laſt gaſpe, Lord, I thanke thee; my ſalvation
and redemption is finiſhed and perfected in Chriſt, I have laid hold on
him, my ſalvation is ſure, then wee may have much comfort. Therefore,
ſhould we not thinke much though we ſpend all our life time in labor and
paines, if we can ſay at the laſt gaſpe, <hi>It is finiſhed:</hi> for all our paines then
are well beſtowed.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> We ſee the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> wandred up and downe
in the Wilderneſſe forty yeeres together; ſometimes in the day, and
ſometimes in the night; ſometimes they wanted bread, and ſometimes
water; and they met with fierie Serpents by the way which did ſting
them, yet they went on ſtill till they came to the land of <hi>Canaan:</hi> ſo wee
ſhould bee contented much more, though wee live in much trouble and
affliction, and doe travell in the Wilderneſſe of this World, twentie or
fortie yeeres together, till we be brought to the heavenly <hi>Canaan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> when <hi>he had encountred with our ſpirituall enemies,</hi> with sinne,
the Divell, Death, Hell and damnation, and had overcome them, had
made mans ſalvation, and had finiſhed it, though all the world were in a
conſpiracie againſt him, and hee had many combates with the Divell, yet
he overcame all; and at the laſt gaſpe crieth out, <hi>It is finiſhed.</hi> Which muſt
teach us, that although all the men in the world ſhould conspire against
us, and though wee endure many temptations, of the Divel, yet we should
breake though all, and apply Chriſt to our ſelves. ſo <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. <hi>Hee that
over commeth ſhall not be hurt of the ſecond death;</hi> and <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 12. <hi>Hitherto
the kingdome of Heaven ſuffers violence, and the violent take it by force:</hi> So
that none but violent people can have Heaven; this is a Metaphor taken
from Souldiers that ſeeke to enter in upon a Towne,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> that though the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:17958:133"/>
come and beate them downe upon their hands and knees, yet they
will up againe,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and never give over, till they have gotten their purpoſe:
So ſuch violent people onely take the kingdome of Heaven, that though
they bee caſt downe upon their hands and knees, by the temptations of
the Divell, yet they ſhould get up againe, and never give over till they
have gotten the kingdome of Heaven.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>By what actions it was finiſhed.</hi> Now it hath not relation to that
which went before the giving of him vineger to drinke,<note place="margin">By what actions all was finiſhed.</note> but to the action
immediately following; and how was it finiſhed? <hi>In the death of Chriſt;</hi>
So there is the conſummation and finiſhing of mans ſalvation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
according to the teſtimonie of the Scriptures; <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch
then as the children were partakers of the fleſh and blood, he alſo himſelfe
likewiſe tooke part with them, that he might destroy through death him that had
the power of death, that is, the Divell; and that he might deliver all thoſe who for
feare of death, were all their life time ſubject to bondage.</hi> And againe, <hi>the ſame
Apostle, Rom.</hi> 5. 10. <hi>For if when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by
the death of his Sonne; much more being reconciled, we ſhall be ſaved by his life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now although the Scriptures doe attribute mans ſalvation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
to the death of Chriſt, yet we are not to exclude his life, for hee
was a working of it all his life time, even from his very birth to his death.
So we ſee <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>He tooke upon him the forme of a ſervant, and was made
in the likeneſſe of men; and being found in faſhion as a man, he humbled himſelfe,
and became obedient unto the death, even the death of the croſſe.</hi> All his life long
was a preparatory and a working of it: And by his death it was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed
and finiſhed; as a man filling of a cup, firſt, by a quart, then by an
halfe,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and ſo till the laſt drop come, and make the cup runne over; ſo Chriſt
all his life time, by little and little, finiſhed mans Redemption, and by his
death he did perfect it, which was as the laſt drop, for all the ſufferings of
Chriſt were for mans ſalvation. And his death was that which did finiſh
all. The uſe is twofold.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Vſe.</note> that ſeeing our Redemption and ſalvation is finiſhed in the death
of Chriſt, <hi>we ſhould be thankefull for it;</hi> for it is a great mercy that God hath
made us reaſonable creatures, and hath given us eyes to ſee withall, hands
to handle, and feete to goe with, but it is a greater mercy, that God hath
redeemed us by his Sonne, not onely by his life, but by his death alſo: And
therefore (as S. <hi>Andrew</hi> ſaith) I am more beholding to thee, O Lord, for the
worke of my redemption, by the death of thy Sonne, than for the power by
which I was created; therefore if a man ſhould be thankfull for his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
much more ſhould he be for the worke of his redemption, for it was a
marvellous love of Chriſt, the hee tooke our nature upon him, to come
into the world, to worke our redemption, to loſe his life, to finiſh and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
it, and therefore how thankefull ought we to be for ſo great a mercy.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> ſeeing our redemption and ſalvation is perfected and finiſhed
by the death of Chriſt, wee may ſee the grievouſneſſe and greatneſſe of our
ſinnes, that when we had ſinned againſt God, all the powers in heaven and
earth could not doe it, but it muſt bee Chriſt, that eternall Sonne of God,
and it was not with his life only, but with his death: wee thinke much of
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:17958:133"/>
ſuffering any little affliction or trouble;<note place="margin">SER. XXV.</note> but Chriſt muſt die to expiate
ſinne and to aboliſh it, whereas neither Angels nor Archangels, nor all the
Saints and holy men in the world could have done it, therfore ſeeing
Chriſt paid ſo deare for it, we muſt take heed we doe not account it a light
matter to ſinne. Therefore let us take heed how we grieve him by our ſinne,
ſeeing hee was contented to loſe his life, and to ſhed his heart blood for
us.</p>

Reſignation of the ſoule and ſpirit of Chriſt into
the hands of his Father: wherein ſomething in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall,
and ſomething in particular is to bee conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>
               <p>The <hi>generall</hi> is this, <hi>That all the ſpeeches and words
that Chriſt did ſpeake on the croſſe</hi> (from the firſt to
the laſt) <hi>were holy and good:</hi> ſo hee did not onely begin well, but did end

An Archer though hee ayme and draw well<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet if hee in the looſe let his

and ayme well yet if we ſtart aſide or ſinke downe, when wee come to die
wee loſe all our glory: therefore it muſt bee our care, not onely to begin
but to end well alſo: It is in ſanctified motions, as it is with wheeles that
bee ſwifteſt at the firſt and afterwards ſlower and ſlower, till the wheele
ſtand ſtill; ſo it is in ſanctified motions, they bee ſwiftest at the firſt, and
afterward by little and little they abate, till at laſt they dye, if they bee not
ſupplied by good meanes; therefore it is good not onely to begin well,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:17958:134"/>
but alſo to end well too, when we breathe out our laſt breath, <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. Chriſt
ſet out the beſt wine at the laſt; But quite contrary, it is the manner of the
world to bee beſt at firſt, and worſt at laſt, with the people of God it muſt
not be ſo, for if there bee any worſt it muſt bee the firſt, and the beſt at the
laſt. Indeed it is the faſhion of the world to begin well, and to end ill, but
the people of God muſt not doe ſo, they muſt not onely begin well, but alſo
continue well and end well, and ſo make an holy cloſe of their life, when
they breathe out their laſt breath, and when they ſhut up their eyes from
the light of this world, they may ſee the kingdome of heaven. The next
thing to be conſidered is the practice of Chriſt when hee came to dye. In
which obſerve five things:</p>

                  <item>4. <hi>Vpon what ground he commended his ſpirit:</hi> upon a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion
that he was his Father.</item>
                  <item>5. What comfort wee may have by the commending of his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
into the hands of his Father.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>to whom hee commended his ſpirit:</hi> the Text ſheweth, <hi>to his Father:</hi>
When we be alive we commend our ſelves,<note place="margin">To whom Hee commends his ſpirit.</note> to our friends in hope of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
but when we come to die, we muſt commend ourſelves to God only;
therefore as Chriſt when hee came to dye, ſhut up his eyes, and did not
looke upon his mother, nor his diſciples, nor upon any beloved: but hee
did wholly commend himſelfe into the hands of his Father, in hope of
comfort;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſo when wee come to dye, wee muſt ſhut up our eyes, and not
comfort our ſelves in our wives, children, friends, and thoſe we love deare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest:
but we muſt commend our ſoules into the hands of God: Yea, the
people of God have good cauſe to doe ſo, in regard he is all in all to us, as
<hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 25. <hi>Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
earth that I deſire beſides thee;</hi> therefore hee caſt himſelfe upon God, in
hope of comfort, ſo a man while he liveth, may have many friends to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
himſelfe to, but when hee commeth to dye, there is none but God
that we can commend our ſoules to.</p>
               <p>Therefore, ſeeing no man hath any body to commend his ſoule to at
laſt but God onely; it muſt be our wiſedome to keepe God our friend: for
if we deſpiſe him in our health, it is juſt with him to deſpiſe, and reject us
when we come to die.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> We read <hi>Iudg,</hi> 10. 14. when the Children <hi>of Iſrael,</hi>
had forſaken the Lord, and followed <hi>Baalam</hi> and <hi>Astaroth,</hi> and ſerved
them, in their diſtreſſe when they came and cried to God to ſave them
out of the hands of their enemies, the Lord ſaid unto them, <hi>Goe and crie
unto the gods whom ye have choſen: Let them ſave you in the time of your tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation.</hi>
In like manner the Lord will ſay to us, when wee have deſpiſed
him in the time of our health, and have followed our pleaſures, profits, and
our old ſinnes, goe and crie unto the gods whom yee have ſerved; ſee if
your money will ſave and helpe you; you that have made your pleaſures,
your belly, and your ſinnes your God; now ſee if theſe will helpe you: for
if ye deſpiſed God in your life time, it is juſt with God to deſpiſe you when
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:17958:134"/>
you come to die; therefore it is good to make God our friend whileſt we
be alive: This is the counſell that <hi>Chriſt</hi> giveth us, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 9. <hi>Make to your
ſelves friends of the Mammon of unrighteouſneſſe;</hi> the Fathers take it for the
poore, that wee ſhould make friends of the poore: But the meaning is,
that we ſhould make God our friend in our life time, that we may have a
friend of him, when we come to die: therefore becauſe every man muſt
commend himſelfe to God when he dies, it is good to pleaſe him, and to
walke holily in all our courſes that we may commend with boldneſſe our
ſoule to him at the laſt gaſpe.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Secondly, what he commended.</note> 
                  <hi>what it was bee commended into the hands of God, His Spirit:</hi>
his body he left to <hi>Pilates</hi> mercy, but all his care was for his ſoule,
therefore he commends that into the hands of God: which may teach
us two things; firſt, though our bodies dye, yet our ſoules doe live; all
the Scriptures ſhew this,<note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>Eccles.</hi> 12. 7. <hi>Then ſhall the duſt returne to the
earth as it was, and the Spirit ſhall returne to God who gave it:</hi> ſo <hi>Revel.</hi> 6. 9.
<hi>And when hee had opened the fifth ſeale, I ſaw under the Altar the ſoules of them
that were killed for the Word of God, and for the Teſtimonie which they maine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained;</hi>
ſo alſo <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 22. <hi>For yee are not come to the mount that might bee
touched, &amp;c. but yee are come to the mount Sion, and to the city of the living
God, the celeſtiall Ieruſalem, and to an innumerable company of Angels, and to
the congregation and Church of the firſt borne whoſe names are written in heaven,
and to God the judge of all, and to the ſpirits of just men made perfect.</hi> So it is a
plaine truth in Chriſtianity that though our bodies dye, our ſoules are
immortall, therefore ſeeing our ſoules never dye, but ſhall live for ever,
how carefull ought we to be for them, and to paſſe our time in holineſſe
and feare before God, as they may live with God for ever in heaven?
Indeed if our ſoules might dye, our care might bee the leſſe, but ſeeing
they ſhall never dye, it is a wondrous corruption amongſt moſt to ſee
how<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they cloath the body, feed and phyſick that, runne from market to
market, to make proviſion for it which yet muſt dye, and their immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
ſoules they take no care for; therefore one ſaith well, O man, of
all thy parts take care of thy immortall part that which never dieth.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> it teacheth us, that ſeeing Chriſt commended his Spirit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the hands of God, wee ſee what the eſpeciall care of a Chriſtian
ſhould bee, not to care ſo much what become of his body, ſo his ſoule
may be ſaved: <hi>Chriſt</hi> he left his body to <hi>Pilates</hi> mercy, but he commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
his ſoule into the hands of God; ſo a Chriſtians care muſt be eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
that his ſoule may be ſaved, that it may come ſafe into the hands
of God, what ſoever become of the body; this was the care of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
theefe, <hi>Lord remember mee when thou commeſt into thy kingdome;</hi> all his
care was for the ſaving of his ſoule, it being provided for, hee cares not
what become of his body: we ſee when a mans houſe is on fire, if he have
a pretious jewell, he will labour to ſave that, though the reſt periſh; ſo
ſeeing the ſoule is the moſt pretious jewell, whatſoever thy labour and
paines be, labour to lay up thy ſoule ſafe, in the hands of God; as <hi>Steven</hi>
did, when a ſtorme of ſtones came about his eares, hee bowed himſelfe
downe and ſaid, <hi>Lord Ieſus receive my ſoule,</hi> all his care was for the ſaving
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:17958:135"/>
thereof; that it might come ſafe into the hands of God; as if he ſhould
ſay, Lord, receive my ſoule, I care not what becommeth of my body, ſo
that thou ſave my ſoule all ſhall be well, this will content me.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Thirdly, the time when he commended his ſoule to God.</note> 
                  <hi>the time when he commended his Spirit;</hi> at the <hi>time of his death,</hi>
which was the very cloſe of his life: when he was ready to breathe out
his laſt breath: which may teach us that every man ſhould make this
his practiſe when hee comes to dye, to bee ſure to make a holy cloſe of
his life, then it is a time to commend his ſoule to God: Now there bee
other times for a man to commend his ſoule to God, as firſt in the <hi>time
of danger and perill,</hi> ſo <hi>David</hi> did, when he was in perill of <hi>Saul, Pſalm.</hi> 31.
5. ſaith he,<note place="margin">Firſt, danger.</note> 
                  <hi>Lord into thy hands doe I commend my ſpirit,</hi> becauſe I have no
body elſe to commend it to, nor no body to truſt it with, in aſſurance of
ſafety, therefore Lord into thy hands I commend it; likewiſe <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 10.
14. <hi>the poore committeth himſelfe unto the Lord;</hi> ſeeing no man regards
him, nor cares for him, hee commends himſelfe to the care of God, ſo
that the time of diſtreſſe and danger, is a time to commend our ſoules to
God. There is alſo another time that wee ſhould commend our ſoules
to God,<note place="margin">Secondly, dayly.</note> and <hi>that is daily,</hi> becauſe our life is uncertaine, therefore wee
ſhould every morning when we doe riſe, and every night when we goe
to bed, (not knowing not what will befall us in the day,) commend
our ſoules to God: there bee a number of men in the world, that bee
greatly overtaken in this, they never commend their ſoules into the
hands of God; if a nurſe goe abroad and leave her childe, and doe not
commit it to the care of ſome body to keepe,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and to looke after it, if the
childe catch any hurt, they will blame the nurſe for it; ſo, if wee doe
not commit our ſelves, our wives and children to God, in the morning
and at night, if any hurt befall them, we may thanke our ſelves for it, the
blame lieth upon our ſelves; 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. 28. we ſee when <hi>David</hi> came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the hoſt to his brethren, they asked him this queſtion; <hi>with whom haſt
thou left thoſe few ſheepe?</hi> So we ſhould commend our temporall eſtate to
the keeping of ſome body, where it may be ſafe; and if we ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
that to keeping, much more muſt we commend ourſoules to God.
Now as at theſe times wee ſhould commit our ſoules to God, yet more
eſpecially we muſt doe it, when we come to dye, becauſe the devill will
then bee buſie, and wee have a long journey to goe; if a man were to
paſſe into <hi>France,</hi> and to carry all his goods with him that hee hath ſcra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
together all his life time,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> hee would looke into what ſhip hee did
commit his goods, and if hee had a rotten bottome hee would beware
how he committed his goods to it, ſo ſeeing we are to paſſe from earth
to heaven, a long journey, we muſt take heed wee doe not commit our
ſoules to a rotten bottome, but bee carefull to lay them up into the
hands of God that ſo they may remaine ſafe there.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>upon what ground he commends his ſoule into the hands of God,</hi>
upon a perſwaſion of the <hi>Fatherly</hi> care of God, that God was <hi>his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi>
this made him bold to commend his ſoule into the hands of God,
and may teach us, that all that commend their ſoules to God, muſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
them upon a good ground; we muſt not commend them upon a
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:17958:135"/>
merry conceit without a ground, but wee muſt have a ground for it.
Now there bee three grounds, upon which a man may comfortably
commend himſelfe to God.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Three Grounds whereon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our ſoules to God.</note> 
                  <hi>becauſe he is the Father of Spirits,</hi> and the God of all mens ſoules;
our bodies wee have mediately from our parents, but our ſoules im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
from God; therefore he is called the <hi>Father of Spirits, Heb.</hi>
12. and <hi>Eccles.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1</note> 12. it is ſaid, <hi>The ſoule goeth to God that gave it:</hi> therefore,
ſeeing God gave them and made them, wee may bee bold upon this
ground, to commend our ſpirits backe againe unto him: for every
workeman will preſerve his owne worke, therefore let us commend
our ſoules to God, as a faithfull Creator, for ſeeing he made them, he
will preſerve them, if we will commit them to him.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> a perſwaſion that <hi>God is our Father, by the meanes of Christ;</hi>
if God be our Father, we may be bold to commend our ſoules to him,
for with whom may one bee bold, if a childe may not with his father;
therefore as hee is the Father of Christs, ſo labour to make him thy
Father, and then mayſt thou with comfort commend thy ſelfe into the
hands of God, <hi>Chriſt</hi> when hee would comfort his <hi>Diſciples,</hi> ſaith to

<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> your God;</hi> when we can finde this, that hee is not onely the Father of
Chriſt, but my Father, we may be bold to commend out ſoules into his
hands upon this ground.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> we may be bold to commend our ſoules to God, <hi>upon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
experience we have had of Gods favour and mercy towards us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> this made
<hi>David</hi> bold to commend himſelfe to God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31. 5. <hi>Into thy hands Lord,
I commend my ſpirit;</hi> becauſe <hi>thou haſt redeemed my ſoule, O Lord God of
truth;</hi> I have had experience of thy love and mercy, therefore into thine
hands I commend my ſpirit: In like manner, when we have experience
of Gods goodneſſe and mercy, it makes us bold to commend our ſoules
into the hands of God. And theſe be the grounds, for we muſt not doe
it of nothing, or of a meere conceit, but of a good ground, as Chriſt
did, ſo muſt we.</p>
               <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5</note> 
                  <hi>What comfort we may have by the practiſes of Chriſt in commending
his ſoule into the hands of God?</hi> I anſwer,<note place="margin">What comfort we may have by Chriſts commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his ſoule to God.</note> we may have a two-fold comfort.</p>
               <p>Firſt, as Chriſt did not commend his owne ſoule only into the hands
of God, but my ſoule, thy ſoule, and all the ſoules of the faithfull men in
the world, becauſe all the ſoules of the faithfull are bound in a bundle
with his,<note place="margin">1</note> therefore depoſing and laying downe his ſoule in the hands
of God, all the ſoules of the faithfull are depoſed and laid downe with
it;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> for as his body was a pawne and a pledge for our bodies, ſo his ſoule
is a pawne and a pledge for our ſoules: therefore <hi>Athanaſius</hi> ſaith well,
Our Lord Ieſus when he did commend his ſoule into the hands of God,
he did not onely commend his owne ſoule, but with it, all the ſoules of
the faithfull men in the world, for as they die in Chriſts death, and riſe
in his reſurrection, and aſcend by his aſcenſion; ſo by his depoſing and
laying downe his ſoule into the hands of God, hee doth with it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
all the ſoules of the faithfull men in the world: which may be a
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:17958:136"/>
great comfort to a Chriſtian at all times, that his ſoule is ſafely depoſed
in the hands of God when he dies.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> ſeeing he laid downe his owne ſoule in the hands of God,
and with it our ſoules; therefore when men die, their ſoules doe not
ſleepe in their bodies, nor wander about the graves, nor paſſe up and
downe in the world, nor are in a place of torment, as the Papiſts ſay,
but they be in the hands of God. I think there is no man here, but takes
this ſpeech to be a metaphor and borrowed ſpeech, for God hath no
hands, but by hands is meant that they are under Gods protection, in
ſafetie and ſecuritie:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> For as a man that hath a Iewell will not lay it down
at his friends feet, but he will put it into his hands for the more ſafetie;
ſo Chriſt hath put all the ſoules of the faithfull into the hands of God,
to bee kept in ſafetie till the reſurrection, and the laſt day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
<hi>Act.</hi> 5. Wee may ſee when <hi>the people had ſold their poſſeſsions, they
laid downe their money at the Apostles feet;</hi> but the ſoules of the faithfull ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of God, are not laid downe at the feet of God, but are put into the
hands of God for more ſafety and ſecuritie; as <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. it is ſaid, that
<hi>Chriſt holds the ſeven Stars in his right hand;</hi> to ſhew that he that puls away
a preacher, he muſt pull him out of the hands of God; and ſo, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10. 29.
ſaith Chriſt, <hi>My ſheepe heare my voice, and I know them, and they follow me,
and I give unto them eternall life, and they ſhall never periſh, neither ſhall any
plucke them out of my hands;</hi> neither wicked man nor devill, no power
can plucke them out of my hands; therefore it is a ſweet comfort, that
when a Chriſtian dies, his ſoule goeth into the hands of God; if it were
in our owne keeping, then it were ſubject to the temptations of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill,
and a number of troubles, and much hurt; but being in the hands of
God, they ſhall be kept from all danger, all the powers in heaven and
earth ſhall not be able to hurt them. And thus wee have heard briefly,
and with a great deale of weakneſſe, the ſeven laſt Words of Chriſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,
which he ſpake on the Croſſe.</p>

                  <hi>Why it was needfull Chriſt ſhould die;</hi> of which there was three
cauſes that made a neceſſitie of his death:<note place="margin">Why it was needful that Chriſt ſhould die.</note> First, <hi>To ſatiſfie the juſtice of God
for mans ſinne;</hi> for ſuch was the hainouſneſſe of mans ſinnes (ſentence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
paſſed) that heaven and earth could not reverſe it; therefore, either
we muſt die in our own perſons, or Chriſt muſt die for us, he took our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
upon him, died for us, and ſo gave ſatisfaction to the juſtice of God.
In the Law we ſee,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> when lots were caſt for the Goats, he that the lot fell
on was killed, and the other eſcaped; ſo there were lots caſt whether
we ſhould die or he; it pleaſed God that the lot fell on Chriſt, hee was
killed and we eſcaped: wherein we may ſee the infinite love of Chriſt,
that died to ſatiſfie the juſtice of God, that we might not die; we reade,
2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 33. <hi>David</hi> cried out, <hi>O my ſonne Abſalom, my ſonne, my ſonne Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalom,
would God I had died for thee, O Abſalom, my ſonne, my ſonne;</hi> wherein
he ſhewed the true affection of a father: Now that which <hi>David</hi> deſired
for his ſonne, Chriſt hath performed for us; and therefore when wee
thinke of the death of Chriſt, we may thinke of the infinite love of God
to us:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> If one ſhould commit ſuch a fault againſt the King, that he ſhould
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:17958:137"/>
loſe his head or his eye, or ſome part of him, how farre ſhould a man goe
to finde ſuch a friend, to take his puniſhment upon him, and ſo free him?
But Chriſt doth more for us than this, he hath not only loſt an eye or an
hand for us, but hee died for us; therefore as often as wee thinke of the
death of Chriſt, ſo often wee ſhould thinke of the love of God: The
<hi>Centurion, Luke</hi> 7. ſent the <hi>Elders</hi> of the <hi>Iewes</hi> to Chriſt, to tell him <hi>of one
that loved their nation, and builded them a Synagogue;</hi> but Chriſt hath done
more for us, than to build a Synagogue, for he hath loved us, <hi>and wiſhed
away our ſinnes in his bloud,</hi> as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. 5. And therefore as
often as we thinke of the death of Chriſt, ſo often let us thinke of the
infinite love of Chriſt, that he would die for us, to ſatiſfie the juſtice of
God for ſinne.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> it was needfull that Chriſt ſhould die, <hi>that our ſinnes might
die in his death;</hi> for he tooke all our ſinnes upon him, as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith,
<hi>Who in his owne body bare our ſinnes upon the Croſſe;</hi> when he went to die on
the croſſe, all our ſinnes were bound unto him, who carried them up
with him unto the croſſe, that they might be crucified with him, and die
in his death: this was another thing that made a neceſſity of the death
of Chriſt; therefore if we live in ſinne, what doe we but pull downe our
ſinnes from the croſſe of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> bring them to the fire, rub and chafe
them, as it were, put <hi>Aqua-vitae</hi> into the mouth of them, that they may
live againe: <hi>Ioſua</hi> 7. we read, that <hi>Achan ſtole away a wedge of gold, and
a Babyloniſh garment,</hi> of the ſpoile, when <hi>Iericho</hi> was deſtroyed, and that
proved his owne deſtruction in the end;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſo if wee ſteale our ſinnes
from the croſſe of Chriſt, notwithſtanding Chriſt died, that ſin might
die with him, then theſe ſame ſtolne ſinnes will be our deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> it was needfull that Chriſt ſhold die, <hi>to ſeale unto true beleevers,
the promiſes that God hath made in the Goſpell;</hi> God hath bequeathed life
everlaſting, and Chriſt heaven and happineſſe to thoſe that repent and
beleeve. In the law there is nothing but death and deſtruction promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to thoſe that did tranſgreſſe and breake it, but in the new teſtament
God hath promiſed to them that repent and beleeve, life and ſalvation,
heaven and happineſſe; Therefore that theſe promiſes might be ſealed
and confirmed, Chriſt muſt die, for as long as the teſtator liveth the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament
is of no force, As it is <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 16. <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the testament is
confirmed when men be dead, becauſe it is of no force, as long as he that made it
is alive;</hi> therefore that the promiſes of God might ſtand good unto us,
it pleaſed the ſonne of God to die for us, and to ſeale it with his blood:
all which is to ſuſtaine and comfort us, for although wee have nothing
here, but miſery and trouble, yet one day we ſhall bee put in poſſeſſion
of heaven and happineſſe:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> as a man that hath a patent or a ſealed deed,
that hee ſhall have ſuch lands and livings one day, though hee have not
any thing to help himſelfe, yet he wil comfort himſelfe with that which
is to come; ſo though we be put in poſſeſſion on theſe promiſes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently,
yet let us comfort our ſelves, that one day, they ſhall be verified
unto us, and although wee endure troubles and afflictions in this world,
yet we may bodly ſtand up and ſay, Lord I thanke thee, I have a ſealed
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:17958:137"/>
deed to ſhew, that one day I ſhall enjoy the promiſes that thou haſt
made in the Goſpell; here we ſee for the comfort of a Chriſtian, it was
needfull for Chriſt to die, and to ſeale with his blood the promiſes that
are made in the Goſpell.</p>

and never till then: ſo it is ſaid of <hi>David, Act.</hi> 13. 36. <hi>After he had ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
his generation, by the counſell of God, he fell on ſleepe, and was laid unto his

be gathered unto thy people:</hi> in like manner we muſt doe the will of God,
and fulfill the worke he ſent us to doe, and then we ſhall be willing to
dye,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and never till then. If a maſter ſhould ſend his ſervant beyond ſea
to deale for him in his buſineſſe, if hee come home and doe the halfe
onely, and leave the other halfe undone, hee muſt looke for a cold wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
home; ſo God hath ſent us into this world, to doe his buſineſſe,
whereof if we doe but the halfe, leaving the reſt undone, we may looke
for a cold welcome when wee come to dye: 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19. 4. we read that
<hi>Elias laid him downe under a Iuniper tree,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> 
                  <hi>and deſired that he might die, ſaying,
it is enough, O Lord, take away my life, for I am no better than my fathers:</hi> at
which time an Angell came unto him and ſaid, <hi>Vp Elias, eate and drinke,
for thy journey is too great for thee:</hi> ſo many times a Chriſtian may have a
deſire to dye, when troubles and griefes are upon him, but the Spirit of
God comes unto him, and bids him ariſe, for God hath another ſervice
for him to doe. We ſee Chriſt was not willing to dye, till he had done
the worke of God which he came for; and what was that? the worke
of mans ſalvation and redemption; Chriſt if he had pleaſed, he might
have dyed at the very inſtant as ſoone as hee was on the croſſe, but hee
would not, becauſe hee had not done that hee came for: which may
teach us the time when we ſhould be willing to dye; and that is when
we have finiſhed and perfected the worke of our ſalvation and redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and have made that ſure, when we have repented of our ſinnes, and
laid faſt hold on Chriſt, then we ſhould be willing to die, and never till
then: we ſee a number of men are contented to creepe out of the world,
but if they have not firſt finiſhed their ſalvation, and made that ſure to
themſelves, and repented of their ſinnes, they can have no comfort, for
it is a fearefull thing for a man to dye in his ſinnes, as our Saviour threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens
the <hi>Iewes, Ye ſhall dye in your ſinnes:</hi> O, it is a fearefull and lamentable
thing, when men doe thus dye, as wee heard in the forenoone, out of
<hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 41. that <hi>the men of Nineve ſhall riſe up in judgement to condemne
the Iewes, becauſe they repented at the preaching of Ionas,</hi> when as the <hi>Iewes</hi>
did not repent at the preaching of <hi>Christ;</hi> for if we doe not profit by the
preaching of the word, and by the good meanes amongſt us, even dead
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:17958:138"/>
men that have lyen rotting in their graves an hundred yeeres together,
ſhall riſe up in judgement againſt us, and condemne us, therefore it is a
fearefull thing for a man to dye in his ſinnes: old <hi>Simeon</hi> had a deſire to
live till he had ſeene Chriſt,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and when he had ſeene him, and embraced
him in his armes, then he ſaith, <hi>Lord, now lettest thou thy ſervant depart in
peace, for mine eyes have ſeene thy ſalvation;</hi> ſo wee ſhould have a deſire to
live till wee had ſeene Chriſt, and made heaven and happineſſe ſure to
our ſelves, and then when we have ſeene Chriſt by the eyes of our faith,
and embraced him, we may bee willing to dye, and to ſay as old <hi>Simeon</hi>
ſaid, now Lord let thy ſervant depart in peace.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Thirdly, the manner of His death.</note> 
                  <hi>The manner of his death;</hi> which may bee conſidered two
wayes:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That it was a violent death.</item>
                  <item>2. That he dyed willingly.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> that it was <hi>a violent death,</hi> hee dyed not an eaſie death, but a
very painefull one: now there be divers reaſons, why Chriſt dyed ſuch
a painefull death; which I have handled before, and therefore will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat
in this place onely the heads, thereby to imprint them the better
into your mindes.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Foure reaſons why Chriſt died a painefull death.</note> 
                  <hi>To teach us, that it was not an eaſy matter to redeeme man;</hi> for Chriſt
muſt therefore dye, not an eaſie, but a violent, a painefull death to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme
us; therefore Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> ſaith well, that a man of all wounds,
will take heed of ſuch as one as will aske much adoe to heale;<note place="margin">1</note> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſeeing ſin makes ſuch a wound, that Chriſt muſt dye to heale it, and
that ſuch a violent and painefull death, wee ſhould bee carefull to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
it.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>To ſhew the deſert of our ſinnes;</hi> for when we come to dye,
wee deſerve to dye the violenteſt, and painefulleſt death that may bee;
wee doe not deſerve to dye in our beds, but on the croſſe, not amongſt
our friends, but amongſt our enemies; therfore looke what death ſoever
we dye on, the moſt painefull and moſt grievous, yet we may ſay, as the
Theefe ſaid, <hi>We ſuffer things worthy of that we have done,</hi> we deſerve all the
extremities in death that may be.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> Chriſt dyed ſuch a painefull death, <hi>to purchaſe a more eaſie
death for us;</hi> hee dyed on the croſſe, that wee might dye in our beds;
amongſt his enemies, that we might dye amongſt our friends; with all
extremity and paine, that we might have eaſe and comfort in our deaths,
therefore looke what eaſe and comfort we finde in our deaths, it is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed
to us by the painefull death of Chriſt; for there was a deadly
cup of poiſon of Gods wrath put into our hands to drinke, and Chriſt
hath taken all the malignity and ſowreneſſe out of it, and hath given us
the ſweet.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4</note> 
                  <hi>To ſanctifie all kinds of deaths to his dying members;</hi> for if any
one ſhould have dyed an eaſie death, then we might have thought that
hee onely had beene the holy man that died ſuch a death; but Chriſt
dyed a painefull death to ſanctifie all kinds of deaths to his dying mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers;
ſo that let the death be what it will be, if one dye in Gods favour
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:17958:138"/>
and in the pardon of his ſinnes, hee is a bleſſed and happy man, as <hi>Heb.</hi>
11. it is ſaid, <hi>All theſe dyed in faith,</hi> they dyed not all in their beds, ſome
were ſtoned, ſome ſawne aſunder; yet becauſe they dyed all in faith,
they were all happy men; ſo let us looke to our conſcience, and to our
cauſe, and then let the death be what it will be, we are happy men: the
heathen men could ſay, we would not dye on ſea, nor ſuddainely, nor of
ſuch or ſuch a diſeaſe; but thou that art a Chriſtian, let thy death bee
what it will, if thou dye in the favour of God, penitent for thy ſinnes,
thou art a bleſſed and an happy man: it is reported of the beaſts
of the wilderneſſe,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> that they are afraid to drinke of the waters, becauſe
they have poyſon in them, till the Vnicorne come and waſh his horne
in it; ſo men were afraid to drinke of the bitter waters of death till
this ſame true Vnicorne Chriſt Ieſus, had waſhed his bleſſed body in
this ſame painefull death. And theſe be the chiefe reaſons why Chriſt
dyed ſuch a painefull death.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> he <hi>died willingly,</hi> for he did not only dye, but it was alſo wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly,
as is ſhewed by two actions;<note place="margin">He died wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly.</note> Firſt, in that <hi>hee bowed downe his head,</hi>
and then <hi>gave up the ghost.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1</note> Men when they dye, doe firſt give up the ghoſt,
and then they bow downe their heads; But Chriſt quite contrary, hee
firſt bowed downe his head, even ready to meete with his death, and then
he gave up the ghoſt; ſo it was a voluntary death that Chriſt died.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> in that <hi>he cryed with a loud voyce;</hi> When men dye they lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
by little and little, their ſpeech failes them, they rattle in the throate,
and ſo weakeneſſe comes upon them by little and little, till their breath
be quite gone; But Chriſt at his death <hi>cryed with a loud voice,</hi> ſo that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of his ſtrength was abated: to ſhew, hee dyed voluntarily, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly:
as <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. 17, 18. <hi>I lay downe my life, that I might take it up againe:</hi>
No man taketh it from me.<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> But why did Chriſt dye a voluntary death?<note place="margin">Sol.</note>
That it might be the more <hi>gratefull and acceptable to God.</hi> For actions that
be done in obedience to God and voluntarily, are gratefull, acceptable, and
more pretious than thoſe we doe nill we will we, againſt our mindes and
intentions; therefore that Chriſts death might bee the more acceptable
to God, he died voluntarily and willingly: which muſt teach us, that if we
would have our actions gratefull and acceptable to God, we muſt do them
willingly and voluntarily, and if we would have our deaths acceptable to
him, wee muſt bee willing to dye, when God would have us; and to live,
when God would have us to live, therefore it is a pittifull thing to ſee how
men hang on the world, when God would have them to die: It is ſaid,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 116. 5. <hi>Pretious in the ſight of the Lord is the death of all his Saints,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when we die willingly, it is pretious in the ſight of God, when one is
not only contented to part with his pleaſure, goods, lands, wife &amp; children,
but alſo is contented that his ſoule and his body ſhould part; therefore if
we would dye well, we muſt dye voluntarily and willingly in obedience to
God: As two ſubjects beyond ſea, the king ſends for them home, the one
he meaneth ſhal attend upon him, upon whom he will beſtow ſome honor,
and the other he will keepe in perpetuall impriſonment: both theſe come
home, but there is great difference in their comming, for the one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:17958:139"/>
home joyfully, but the other ſorrowfully and heavily, and would ſhift
the matter if he could; ſo the wicked and the godly live both in this world,
when the Lord ſends for them they come both, but there is a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
in their comming, for the one when he dyes, hee dies with comfort,
becauſe he knowes that God will beſtow a crowne of life on him, hee ſhall
be in heaven and happineſſe for ever; but the other though hee come, yet
it is unwillingly, if he could ſhift the matter he would, becauſe hee know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
hee ſhall goe to a place of torment; therefore if wee would dye well,
we muſt be carefull to live well.</p>
               <p>The fourth thing was,<note place="margin">4</note> 
                  <hi>the manifestation of his death,</hi> ſet forth unto us by
two evidences,<note place="margin">The manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſts death.</note> which with your p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tience I will now handle, becauſe all
hope of ſalvation hangeth on the death of Chriſt. Firſt, that when the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
had taken the legges of the theefe,<note place="margin">1</note> and broken them, they came to
breake Chriſts, but did not becauſe he was <hi>dead before they came.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that a mad fellow one of the ſouldiers ſtanding by,<note place="margin">2</note> did thruſt a ſpeare
through the ſide of Chriſt, &amp; forthwith there came forth blood and water;
ſo that if there had been left any little life in him, they had done enough to
have taken it away; For it is a rule in Phyſicke, that if a man be pricked in
the heart with the leaſt pricke of a pin, it is preſent death. Therefore it was
a plaine evidence to the world, that Chriſt was truely and really dead.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Why did they not breake Chriſts legs,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Quest.</note> 
                  <hi>as they did the theeves?</hi> I anſwer,
for two reaſons:</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Sol. Of the Paſchall Lambe.</note> to fulfill a Scripture, that ſaith, <hi>that a b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>e of him ſhall not be broken,
Pſal.</hi> 34. 20 to ſhew <hi>that he was the true paſcall Lambe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, the <hi>Paſcall Lambe</hi> was male without blemiſh, to ſhew that Ieſus
Chriſt,<note place="margin">1</note> he that ſhould redeeme us ſhould bee without any ſpot of ſinne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> as they did keepe the blood of the <hi>Lambe</hi> in a Baſon, and did
ſprinkle it on their doore poſts, that ſo the Angell of deſtruction might
paſſe over their houſes: So we ſhould get the blood of Chriſt, and ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle
our conſciences with that, that ſo the Angell of deſtruction might
paſſe over us.<note place="margin">3</note> Thirdly, the Iewes when they did eate the Lambe, put
away Leaven from them, and this muſt teach us to put all maliciouſneſſe
from us.<note place="margin">4</note> Fourthly, they did eate the Lambe with ſowre hearbes, to teach
us that Chriſt will never bee truly ſweete to us, unleſſe wee eate him with
griefe and ſorrow for our ſinnes.<note place="margin">5</note> Laſtly, they did eate the Lambe with
their ſtaves in their hands, their loynes girded, their ſhoes on their feete;
they did eate it in haſte, readie to take their journey: so we muſt eate of
Chriſt alſo, that we may take our journey to Heaven, and therefore muſt
take our dinner and Supper often in this kinde, feeding on him by faith.</p>
               <p>Secondly, to teach us that the wicked <hi>Iewes</hi> could not doe any thing to
Chriſt, but by Gods appointment: They tooke Chriſt, and did crucifie
him, but they could not breake a bone of him; and this is a comfort to a
Chriſtian, that howſoever the wicked rage and take on, yet they cannot
breake a bone without Gods appointment, they cannot do the leaſt thing
that may be to him.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ecauſe all the hope of ſalvation dependeth
on the death of Chriſt,<note place="margin">SERM. XXVII.</note> as being the price to
ſatiſfie the juſtice of God for mans ſinne: It
pleaſed God therefore, to ſhew two eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to the World, that Hee was really and
truly dead.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that the <hi>Souldiers did not breake the
leggs of Chriſt,</hi> as they did of the Theeves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they found him dead before they came;
for if hee had not beene dead, then as they
did breake the legges of the theeves, ſo they would have broken the legs
of Chriſt: but in that they did not, it was a plaine Evidence that Chriſt
was truely dead, ſo that his greateſt enemies gave an evidence to the
World that he was truly and really dead.</p>
               <p>The ſecond was, that a barbarous Souldier finding Chriſt dead, takes
a Speare and <hi>thrusts into his ſide</hi> neere his heart; ſo that if there had beene
but a little life left, this had beene enough to have bereft it; for all know
that a wound at the heart is deadly, if it bee but with a pricke of a pin; for
the blood and water comming forth of the ſide of Chriſt, did ſhew that
the <hi>Pericardium</hi> was wounded, and his heart pierced. Some of the ſchool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
cannot tell from whence this blood and water ſhould come, as being
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:17958:140"/>
ignorant of <hi>Anatomie;</hi> others take it to bee a miraculous thing, as <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Aquinas,</hi> for he ſaith in other dead bodies it is not cleare blood that
commeth from them, but their blood is congealed, and cleare water doth
not run from other dead bodies, but it is mixt with blood; and therefore
miracles did not ceaſe in the dead body of Chriſt: But wee neede not
doubt but it is a naturall thing that blood and water did come from the
ſide of Chriſt, onely the manner was miraculous in it: There was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that was <hi>naturall,</hi> and there was ſomething that was <hi>miraculous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which was <hi>Naturall</hi> was that blood and water that came out of
the ſide of Chriſt:<note place="margin">1</note> for as <hi>Phyſitians</hi> ſay, there is a filme containing water
about the heart, which ſerves to coole it and keepe it in temper, which
they call <hi>Pericardium;</hi> therefore Chriſts heart being wounded, there came
forth blood and water: blood from the wound in his heart, water from
the <hi>Pericardium</hi> or filme involving the heart, wherein is contained wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>That which was <hi>Miraculous,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2</note> was that the blood flowed apart by it ſelfe,
and the water apart without any mixture together; therefore, ſeeing the
heart was wounded, it is an Evidence to the World, that Chriſt was tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and really dead: and yet theſe two things had a further myſtery and
meaning.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> whereas we ſee the legges of Chriſt was not broken, as the legges
of the theeves were; this was to teach us that all the wicked of the World
could doe no more to Chriſt than God had appointed; they could take
him, and buffet him, and whip him, and crowne him with Thornes, and
naile him to the Croſſe, and kill him at laſt, but yet they could not breake
a bone of him. Hence wee may learne for our owne comfort, that all the
wicked in the World can doe nothing to a Chriſtian without Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment;
they may trouble and moleſt them, but they cannot breake a
bone of them. so we ſee, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. 20. <hi>Many are the troubles of the righteous;</hi>
good people may have many troubles, and they may put them on the
Croſſe, but they cannot breake a bone of them; <hi>For the Lord keepeth all
his bones, ſo that not one of them ſhall be broken.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> there was not a bone of him broken, to ſhew he was the true
<hi>Paſchall Lambe:</hi> As 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 7. <hi>Chriſt our Paſſeover is ſacrificed for us,</hi> as the
<hi>Paſſeover</hi> did keepe the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> from the ſtroke of the devouring Angell;
ſo this ſame true <hi>Paſchall Lambe</hi> doth keepe us from the wrath of God,
falling upon us at the day of Iudgement; and as the Lambe was taken up
foure dayes before they killed him; So we ſhould labour to get Chriſt into
our hearts before death commeth.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Evidence is, that water and blood did flow out of the dead
body of Chriſt, to teach us that God hath opened a fountaine of grace
and life, as <hi>Zecharie</hi> had foretold, <hi>for ſinne and for uncleaneſſe.</hi> But what
comfort have we by it?<note place="margin">Zech. 13. 1.</note> Is there any power or vertue in the dead body of
Chriſt? I, ſaith the Lord, there is power and efficacie in it; or from theſe
two ſtreames that iſſued out of the dead Body of Chriſt, there is infinite
comfort that doth ariſe, as 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 6. ſaith hee, <hi>This is that Ieſus Chriſt,
that came by water and blood, not by water onely, but by water and blood.</hi> There
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:17958:140"/>
were two ſtreames that did iſſue out of the dead Body of Chriſt; there
iſſued a ſtreame of <hi>pure blood</hi> to waſh away the <hi>guilt</hi> of ſinne, and a ſtreame
of <hi>cleare water</hi> as cleare as <hi>Chrystall,</hi> to waſh away the <hi>filth</hi> of our ſinnes:
for theſe bee two maine things that trouble the people of God.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The guilt of ſinne, binding us to puniſhment.</item>
                  <item>2. The filth of ſinne, making us hatefull and loathſome in the eyes
of God.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> therefore doſt thou feele thy heart troubled with the <hi>guilt of ſinne?</hi>
runne unto the Croſſe of Chriſt,<note place="margin">For the guilt of ſinne.</note> and catch hold of ſome of the droppes
of blood that came from the ſide of Chriſt; offer them to God and ſay in
thy meditation, Lord, behold the blood of thy Sonne; and ſprinkle it by
the hand of faith upon thy Soule and Conſcience, and God will bee plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
and pacified with thee.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> If thou be troubled with the <hi>filth of thy ſinne,</hi> runne unto the
Croſſe of Chriſt,<note place="margin">The filth of ſin.</note> and get of the water that iſſued out of the ſide of Chriſt,
and beſprinkle thy ſoule and conſcience by the hand of faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo thou
ſhalt bee cleane in Gods ſight. To make this plaine, ſuppoſe there were a
man that had a foule yard, who laid ſtones and gravell on it, yet ſtill it
remained durty;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> in which time there came a friend to him, who ſeeing
him labour in vaine to make his yard cleane, gave him this Counſell, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nig,
you have a Spring in your yard, open it, and it will carry all your ſoile
and baggage away, and ſo your yard will bee cleane: So if wee finde our
hearts uncleane, wee muſt get to one of theſe ſame Springs that come out
of the dead body of Chriſt, and this will carry away all the baggage and
ſoile: this is the benefit wee have by the dead body of Chriſt; therefore,
bleſſed be God that hath opened ſuch <hi>a Fountaine for ſinne and for unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;</hi>
and as <hi>David longed for the waters of the Well of Bethel,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 15.
much more ſhould wee long for the blood and water that did iſſue out of
the ſide of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and labour for it, although it be with the hazard of our
peace, and loſſe of our lives.</p>
               <p>The next thing we are to ſpeake of is,<note place="margin">5</note> 
                  <hi>Of the power of Christs death;</hi> for
although there ſeemed to be nothing therein but weakneſſe,<note place="margin">The power of Chriſts death.</note> yet there was
power in the death of Chriſt: for <hi>the veil of the temple was rent in twain from
the top to the bottome,</hi> without any hands: <hi>The earth did quake, and the ſtones
rent in ſunder:</hi> Hammers and other inſtruments could not doe it, but the
death of Chriſt did it: <hi>The graves did open, and the dead bodies of the Saints
did riſe, and did goe into the holy Citie, and ſhewed themſelves to many.</hi> ſo we
ſee there was great power in the death of Chriſt; as great Princes, and
Kings, and great Monarches when they live, are able to doe great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
but when they dye, there is no power nor might in them, they are
able to doe nothing, never a Cloud will moove, a Stone ſtirre, or Grave
open at their deaths; but at the death of Chriſt they did: Therefore,
this doth ſhew there is great power in the death of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> it is ſaid, that <hi>the veile of the Temple did rent in twaine from the
top to the bottome:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Temple veilerenting.</note> 
                  <hi>Chriſt</hi> did hang in <hi>Mount Calvary</hi> dead, and yet the
power of his death did pierce into the Citie and <hi>Temple,</hi> and did rent the
veile without hands from the toppe to the bottome. Now they which

know the Scripture, know that the Temple was divided in two parts, in

the <hi>Holy place;</hi> and in the other was the <hi>golden Cenſer, the Arke of the

which had <hi>Manna,</hi> and <hi>Aarons rod</hi> which had budded, and the <hi>Tables of

the <hi>Mercy ſeat;</hi> which two places were ſeparated by a <hi>veile:</hi> Now at
the death of Chriſt this ſame veile was rent in twaine from the top to
the bottome; whereof there be divers Reaſons:</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Reaſon 1. Of the veile of the Temple reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</note> 
                  <hi>That an entrance might be made into heaven by his death;</hi> for this was
the golden Key that did open heaven to all true beleevers, our ſins did
ſhut up heaven, but the death of Chriſt is as a Key to open heaven: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
bleſſed be God for the death of Chriſt, becauſe he hath made hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
open to us: <hi>Act.</hi> 7. 56. <hi>Steven</hi> before his death <hi>ſaw heaven open, and
Chriſt ſtanding at his right hand ready to receive him:</hi> So it is a ſweet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
to a Chriſtian, when he comes to die, that hee ſeeth heaven open,
and Chriſt ſtanding at Gods right hand ready to receive him: If a man
ſhould come to a Kings Palace,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and finde all the doores ſhut and locked
up faſt, and a friend ſhould come and put into his hands a key that hee
might goe from chamber to chamber, till hee came to the Kings Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
this would be a great comfort; So the death of Chriſt is as a gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
key to open heaven to us, that wee may come into the Preſence-chamber
of God; therefore bleſſed be God for the death of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Reaſon 2.</note> it was to ſhew that <hi>the Ceremoniall Law was abrogated by the
death of Chriſt;</hi> The Prieſts muſt not offer any more ſacrifices, for now
all the ceremonies had an end, and by his death is cancelled the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing
that was againſt us; as it is, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 14, 15. <hi>He is our peace, who hath
made both one, and hath broken downe the middle wall of Partition betweene us;

Holy Ghoſt and us, to lay no other burthen upon you than that which is neceſſary;</hi>
therefore it is a dangerous thing to bring in the Leviticall ceremonies
againe. Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> ſaith well, Thou ſayeſt that it is not a dangerous
thing to bring in the <hi>Leviticall</hi> ceremonies, but I tell thee, and proclaime
againſt thee, that that man which ſhall bring in theſe ceremonies, hee
caſteth himſelfe head-long into the pit of hell. The Schoole-men doe
diſtinguiſh the Ceremonies into three times; Firſt,<note place="margin">Three times of Ceremonies.</note> (as <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi>
ſaith) there was a time when the ceremonies were profitable, and that
was before Chriſt,<note place="margin">1</note> becauſe they were commanded of God. Secondly,
after Chriſts death they were dead,<note place="margin">2</note> but not deadly till the <hi>Goſpell</hi> was

our ſinnes,</hi> that made a ſeparation betweene God and us, that wee could

he will not heare:</hi> Now they are taken downe, and he hath hanged up an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
veile in the roome thereof, that though our ſinnes have hid Gods
face from us, yet in the death of Chriſt they are taken downe, he having
hanged up another veile in place of the other, to looke thorow and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
us, <hi>the veile of his fleſh,</hi> as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10. 20. for when God
looked on us, he looked thorow the veile of Chriſts fleſh, or elſe if he
had looked upon us in our ſelves, there is ſuch a deale of ſinne and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
that it would have made God to abhorre us, and to that end
Chriſt with the veile of his fleſh hath covered all our ſinnes, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>David</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85. 2. <hi>Thou haſt forgiven the iniquities of thy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and covered all their ſinnes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fourth Reaſon was to ſhew,<note place="margin">Reaſon 4.</note> that <hi>the veile of ignorance was taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
in the Law,</hi> for the Law was covered with a veile, which was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
why <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſes face was covered with a veile,</hi> as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 13.
but by the death of Chriſt this veile is taken away in the preaching of
the Goſpell: And therefore ſeeing this veile is taken away, if men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
ignorant, how will they anſwer it at the day of judgement? The
Papiſts hang up another veile, and what is that but the veile of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne
tongue, they reade the Scriptures to the people in a tongue they
doe not underſtand, and ſo ſet up the veile againe that Chriſt hath taken
downe; therefore let them looke how they will anſwer this to Chriſt
at the day of Iudgement.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing is the rending of the ſtones,<note place="margin">2</note> how <hi>the ſtones did cleave
aſunder</hi> at the death of Chriſt,<note place="margin">The rending of the ſtones.</note> which hammers and other inſtruments
could not cleave; therefore we may ſee what ſtupiditie and hardneſſe
of heart there is in us, that the ſtones did cleave, and the earth quake at
the death of Chriſt, and yet we are never moved nor ſtirred at it; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let us pray to God that the death of Chriſt may bee powerfull to
move and to ſtirre up our hearts.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>The graves were opened, and the bodies of the Saints which ſlept a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe
and went into the holy Citie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The graves ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> 
                  <hi>and appeared to many:</hi> even men that had
been dead along time, that were diſſolved to duſt and aſhes, by the
power of Chriſts death the graves did open, and they did riſe againe,
to ſhew us, that all the Saints one day ſhall riſe by the power of Chriſts
death, the graves ſhall open, Death cannot keepe them downe, but they
ſhall riſe againe; which is an excellent comfort to a man in miſery, all
that the world can doe is to take away life, which when it is gone they
turne to duſt and aſhes, yet a time will come when the Saints ſhall be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to joy and glory, the graves ſhall be opened by the power of Chriſts
death;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> for as <hi>Ionas was three dayes and three nights in the Whales belly,</hi> and
then was caſt upon the drie land, when the Lord ſpake unto the Whale;
ſo Chriſt will ſpeake to the earth, to the ſea, and to the beaſts that have
devoured men, and they ſhall give up their dead; and as the graves did
open by the power of the death of Chriſt, ſo all the people of God at
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:17958:142"/>
the time that God hath appointed ſhall have their graves opened by his
power and death, and their bodies ſhall riſe by the power of Chriſts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
to everlaſting happineſſe and glory.</p>
               <p>The next thing is,<note place="margin">6</note> 
                  <hi>The effects and fruits of Chriſts death;</hi> whereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I have ſpoken often heretofore,<note place="margin">The effects of Chriſts death.</note> I may bee the ſhorter in it at
this time. The firſt is, that <hi>Chriſts death doth free us from eternall death;
Iohn</hi> 3.<note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Sonne to die for us;
that whoſoever beleeved in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life:</hi> So
alſo, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 24. <hi>Verily, verily I ſay unto you, he that heareth my Word, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth
in him that ſent me, hath everlaſting life, and ſhall not come unto condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation:</hi>
And therefore howſoever a Chriſtian may be condemned in the
court of man, yet he ſhall not be condemned in Gods court; this may be
the ſtay of a Chriſtian, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>There is no condemnation
to thoſe that be in Chriſt;</hi> ſo if a man be in Chriſt, he is freed from eternall
death.<note place="margin">2</note> Secondly, <hi>The death of Chriſt hath freed us from the ſting of death;</hi>
for (as we have heard) ever man hath a deaths cup put into his hands,
but Chriſt hath taken the ſowre out of our cups, and put it into his owne,
and we have the ſweet. Thirdly, <hi>He hath altered the nature of death;</hi> for
it was a curſe unto us,<note place="margin">3</note> and now he hath made it a bleſſing; as in the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,
Bleſſed are they that die in the Lord, for they reſt from their labours,
and their workes follow them.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">4</note> Fourthly, <hi>We are freed from the power of death;</hi>
it was ſeize upon us for a little ſeaſon, but it cannot keepe us under; it is
impoſſible that death ſhould hold him under; ſo it is ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>Act.</hi>
2. 24. <hi>He hath looſed the ſorrowes of death, becauſe it is impoſſible he ſhould be hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
of it.</hi> So it ſhall be with every true Chriſtian, death ſhall not hold
them.<note place="margin">5</note> Fifthly, <hi>By his death he hath deſtroyed the Devill, ſinne, hell, damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and all other ſpirituall enemies,</hi> and hath not onely conquered them for
himſelfe,<note place="margin">Ioſua 10. 24.</note> but for us; therefore, as <hi>Ioſua,</hi> when he had conquered the five
Kings, he called his ſervants, and made them <hi>ſet their feet in their neckes:</hi>
So Chriſt will call forth his ſervants to ſet their feet on the neckes of
their ſpirituall enemies, and ſo make them conquerours: Therefore let
us lay hold on Chriſt, if we have him, we have all things, and if we want
him, we lacke all things; let us roll and wrap up our ſelves in the death
of Chriſt, and then his paines ſhall be our eaſe, his ſhame our glory, his
life our death.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Now in the buriall of Chriſt we obſerve divers particulars:</hi>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. What were the cauſes why he was buried.</item>
                  <item>2. Who were the parties that buried him.</item>

                  <item>5. The fruits and effects of it.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The <hi>reaſons</hi> why Chriſt was buried are in number foure:<note place="margin">Firſt, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why Chriſt was buried, are foure.</note> firſt <hi>to give
us further aſſurance of the death of Chriſt,</hi> becauſe all the hope of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
dependeth on his death, as being the very price to ſatiſfie the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
of God for mans ſinne; and it is (as wee heard) the golden key to
open heaven to the true beleevers;<note place="margin">Reaſon 1.</note> therefore there muſt be undoubted
evidence of his death; and what better can there bee than this, he was
buried? for let a man be dead and ſtraight way they bury him, if Chriſt
had beene alive, <hi>Pilate</hi> would not have given leave to <hi>Ioſeph</hi> to have taken
him downe: and therefore before he would give licence to bury him,
he enquired of the <hi>Centurion</hi> to know whether he were dead or not; and
finding that hee had beene dead an houre, <hi>Pilate</hi> gave leave to <hi>Ioſeph</hi> to
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:17958:143"/>
take him downe: and againe, if Chriſt had not beene dead, <hi>Ioſeph</hi> would
not have buried him, becauſe hee was a friend to Chriſt, if there had
beene but a ſparke of life in him, hee would not have buried him, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this is another evidence that Chriſt was truely dead, for men (if
there bee any humanity or compaſſion in them) doe not uſe to bury
living men but dead men: therefore <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaith in <hi>Gen.</hi> 21. <hi>Give
mee a place that I may bury my dead in:</hi> ſo that <hi>Ioſephs</hi> burying of Chriſt
was an evidence that Chriſt was truely dead, and Gods juſtice fully ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
death and hell conquered, the devill ſubdued, and God pacified
and pleaſed. <hi>Matth</hi> 12. our Saviour ſaith, <hi>that he will be the ſigne of the
Prophet Ionas to them;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> Now what was that? when they were at ſea there
aroſe a great ſtorme, and the men were in danger of drowning, ſo that
they were faine to caſt out their goods, but when that would not doe,
they tooke <hi>Ionas</hi> and caſt him into the ſea, and there was a great calme:
ſo in the generall diſtreſſe of mankinde we were all like to periſh, till
Chriſt was killed and caſt into the grave, and then heaven and earth
were at peace, God was pacified and pleaſed: therefore in all the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes
of a Chriſtian let him goe to the grave of Chriſt, behold him
killed and crucified for thy ſinnes, this will make feare to fly away, and
comfort will ſpring from it.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Reaſon 2.</note> 
                  <hi>that hee might conquer death in his ſtrongeſt hold,</hi> even in the
cabbin and <hi>houſe of death;</hi> as <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith <hi>Chap.</hi> 17. 13. for the grave is the
houſe of death; and there bee the chambers and roomes of death, and
there is the greateſt power that death hath to ſubdue mortall men;
therefore Chriſt was buried that hee might conquer death in his ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt
hold.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> Brave Conquerours and Captaines are not contented to
overcome their enemies in the field, but they will purſue and follow
them into their ſtrongeſt holds and caſtles, and ſo will conquer them
there, thereby to make their victory the greater; ſo Chriſt did not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conquer death on the croſſe, but followed him into his denne, and
ſtrongeſt hold and overcame him there.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> 
                  <hi>Sampſons</hi> victory was the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that he ſuffered his enemies to binde him, and then did breake in
ſunder his bands and overcame them; ſo this made the victory the
greater that Chriſt would ſuffer himſelfe to be bound with the chaines
of death, and to be laid in the ſtrongeſt hold of death, yet there to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
him. Now as Chriſt conquered death, ſo muſt every Chriſtian
conquer death, not by flying and avoiding it (for that we cannot doe)
we may not looke to doe as <hi>Henoch</hi> did, goe to heaven without death,
but we muſt goe to the place of death, and into his dens and conquer
him there.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Reaſon. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>to ſanctifie and to ſweeten the grave for us;</hi> for in it ſelfe it is a
place of rottenneſſe and filthineſſe; and therefore <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 59.
that <hi>their throates are an open ſepulcher,</hi> even like an open grave, a ſtinking
place, a place of rottenneſſe; and <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 27. our Saviour ſaith, that
<hi>the Phariſees were like painted graves,</hi> that looke gloriouſly without, but
within were lothſome and filthy; therefore becauſe the grave is the
lothſommeſt and filthieſt place in it ſelfe, Chriſt was buried that hee
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:17958:143"/>
might perfume and ſweeten our graves: ſo wee ſee that Chriſt hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
the nature of the grave, for that whereas it was a place of rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
now he hath made it a ſweet reſting place to his ſervants: <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome</hi>
ſaith well,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> that which was a priſon houſe of a ſevere Iudge he hath
made a ſtorehouſe to lay up his treaſure in; for the grave was a priſon
houſe, wherein men lay bound under the chaines of death untill the day
of judgement, now hee hath made it a ſtorehouſe to treaſure up his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
till the time of Reſurrection, as <hi>Eſay.</hi> 57. 2. ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Hee
ſhall enter into peace; they ſhall reſt in their beds, every one that walketh before
me:</hi> ſo the grave is as the bed for his ſervants to reſt in till Chriſt bring
them to glory and happineſſe.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> If a man were to paſſe into another
countrey, and muſt goe through dennes, graves and hollow places in the
earth, if one could eſpy the footſteps of one of our deare friends that
had paſſed that way, this would give a man comfort to follow after; ſo
wee are to paſſe into another countrey, to heaven, and wee muſt goe
through the dennes, caves and hollow places of the earth, if wee can
ſee by the eye of faith that Chriſt hath gone the ſame way, there bee
footſteps and markes that he hath left behinde him, this will give a man
courage and comfort; therefore howſoever death may be terrible and
dreadfull to the eye of ſenſe, and to be trodden and trampled under feet
of death is a fearefull thing, yet by the eye of faith wee may ſee that
Chriſt hath perfumed the grave, and made it a ſweete reſting place to
his ſervants, and therefore this may comfort us.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Reaſon 4.</note> 
                  <hi>that wee might have power and ſtrength to bury ſinne;</hi> for wee
muſt not onely have power to kill ſinne, and worke the death of it,
which is much;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> but there muſt alſo bee (as it were) a buriall of ſinne,
there muſt be a conſuming of it, by little and little till it be utterly wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted:
as a dead man when hee is laid into the grave and buried, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes
by little and little; ſo wee muſt bury ſinne till it bee conſumed
and waſted; for as it is with man, ſo it is with ſinne; in a man, there be
two things,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> the life and the body of man, take away the life from the
body and that is nothing but a lumpe of earth, if it remaine unburied
it will poyſon the ayre: ſo there is in every man the life of ſinne, and
the body of ſinne, the life of ſinne is the raigning of it, and the body of
ſinne is the lumpe of luſt and corruption: therefore when the life or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
raigning of ſin is taken away, ſtill there remaines the body ſinne;
this wee muſt bury or elſe it will infect us: ſo the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> faith,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 6. that we doe not onely <hi>dye to ſinne</hi> in the death of Chriſt, but we
are alſo <hi>buried</hi> with him; therefore let us carry this ſame body of ſinne
unto the grave of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and bury it in his grave. And you that have
beene at the buriall of your friends, turne againe to bury your ſinnes,
every one muſt addreſſe himſelfe to this buriall, that ſo it may be waſted
and conſumed: wee read <hi>Ezek.</hi> 39. 14. of a ſtrange ſpeech that there
were ſcearchers appointed to goe through the land, who if they found
any dead mens bones, they were to ſet up a ſticke till the buriers did
come and bury them: ſo a Chriſtian muſt doe, his conſcience muſt bee
the ſcearcher, it muſt finde out our ſinnes which be as dead mens bones,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:17958:144"/>
and when wee have found them, wee muſt ſet ſtickes up by them for
markes, and never be at reſt till they bee buried, and may rot and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
to nothing; therefore ſeeing Chriſt was buried that wee might
have power and ſtrength to bury ſinne, we muſt take heed that we doe
not roote them out of the grave againe, and uncover the moulds; to
this end let every man pray for grace, that he may ſuffer his ſinnes to be
buryed.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> If a man ſhould rake a man out of the grave that had lyen there
foure dayes as <hi>Lazarus</hi> did, hee would poyſon the ayre and infect the
countrey; ſo our ſinnes if we ſhould root them out that have beene bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
theſe hundred yeeres, they would bee ready to infect all the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
therefore wee muſt pray to God that our ſinnes may be buried, and
kept downe by the power of Chriſts buriall, that ſo they may never
riſe againe.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing obſerved was,<note place="margin">Secondly, the Parties who bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Chriſt.</note> 
                  <hi>the parties that buried Chriſt, Ioſeph of

honorable men, and Counſellors, who buried Chriſt with their owne
hands;<note place="margin">1</note> they did it not by a ſervant, <hi>Ioſeph</hi> he begs the body of Chriſt,
and tooke it downe (in all likelihood) with his owne hands, and <hi>Nicode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>
brought an hundreth pound of ſweete odours, of <hi>Myrrh</hi> and <hi>Alo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,</hi>
to imbalme the body of Chriſt. It is a ſtrange thing that theſe hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
perſons would ſtoope to ſo meane a ſervice as this, but it was the
love that they bare to Chriſt that made them; and it may teach us, that if
wee truely love Chriſt wee will ſtoope to any meane duty and ſervice
for Chriſt or his members, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. when the Angels came to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi>
houſe, he made them a <hi>feaſt,</hi> and he waited on them: as if hee had
beene a ſervant, becauſe of the love he did beare to them, ſo in <hi>Exod.</hi> 2.
11. wee read <hi>Moſes</hi> was the adopted ſonne of <hi>Pharoahs</hi> daughter, and
yet he did not ſcorne <hi>to goe out and looke on the burthens of his brethren,</hi> and
when there was injury offered unto them, he did labour to right it; ſo
alſo <hi>Zacheus,</hi> hee was a rich man, who when hee did heare that Chriſt
came by, <hi>gets himſelfe into a fig-tree to ſee Chriſt;</hi> now one ſhould have
thought that ſuch a man would have ſcorned ſuch a thing to climbe up
into a tree amongſt boyes and girles, and yet love to Chriſt made him
doe it: in like manner our Saviour Chriſt, <hi>Iohn</hi> 13. did <hi>riſe from the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and tooke a towell, and girding it about him,</hi> waſhed his Diſciples feet, and
after he had done, he ſaid, <hi>ye call me Lord and Maſter, as I am indeede, if I
then your Lord and Maſter have waſhed your feete, yee ought much more to
waſh one anothers feete;</hi> if there be any love in us to Chriſt we will ſtoope
to any meane duty or ſervice for Chriſt or his members: one would
have thought that ſuch an honorable perſon as <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> would have beene
ſqueamiſh to have taken downe the dead body of Chriſt in his owne
armes, to have ſoyled and foyled himſelfe with the bloud that came
out of his wounds, but the true love hee did beare to Chriſt made him
doe it: ſo if there bee true love in us to Chriſt, we will not bee ſquea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh
to doe any meane ſervice and duty for him and his members; wee
will not be ſqueamiſh to come to their ſick beds to comfort and relieve
them:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> wee ſee a mother through the love ſhe hath to her childe, will
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:17958:144"/>
ſtoope to doe any meane ſervice and duty that another woman would
be ſomewhat ſqueamiſh of; ſo if there bee true love to Chriſt in us, it
will make us doe any ſervice and duty to the meaneſt of Chriſt mem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bers,
even to do that which another would ſcorn: S. <hi>Iierom</hi> ſaith, O man,
when thou goeſt to the ſicke beds of thy neighbours, thou art ſomewhat
ſqueamiſh, and thou makeſt a ſowre face at it, conſider with thy ſelfe
that thou art made of the ſame element, and the ſame thing that is befal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
him, thou mighteſt have ſuffered, thinke his ſorrowes and paines
to be thine owne, and then thou wilt not be ſo ſqueamiſh.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> they were <hi>Diſciples,</hi> yet but weake Diſciples; <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was a
ſecret Diſciple, but for feare of the Iewes hee durſt not ſhew his face
openly in that profeſſion, and <hi>Nicodemus</hi> hee came to Chriſt by night,
now theſe were weake Diſciples, and yet in the greateſt diſgrace ſtood
to Chriſt, when <hi>Iudas</hi> had betraied Chriſt, and <hi>Peter</hi> had denyed him,
and all the reſt of the Diſciples were fled from him: which may teach
us, not to deſpiſe our weake brethren, but to thinke humbly of our ſelves,
and to carry our ſelves lowly, for theſe weake ones may ſtand to Chriſt
and to the profeſſion of holy Religion, when great learned men ſhrinke,
men of great graces, therefore wee ſhould not deſpiſe our weake bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
as <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 4. who art thou that condemneſt another
mans ſervant? <hi>hee ſtandeth or falleth to owne Lord and maſter;</hi> yea hee
ſhall be eſtabliſhed, for God is able to make him ſtand. Now I doe not
ſpeake this to nouriſh any one in his weakeneſſe, for it is a good thing to
ſpeake boldly in the cauſe of Chriſt; who ſaith, <hi>he that denyeth me before
men, I will denie him before God.</hi> There is a pretty ſtory in the booke of
<hi>Martyrs</hi> of two <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> that were doctors of Divinity in the dayes
of <hi>King Edward,</hi> ſaith one of them, I am afraid I ſhall not have courage
to ſtand out for Religion in the time of perſecution, I thinke I cannot
burne for Religion: ſaith the other, knowing that I doe know, if I had
one hundred lives, I would give them and be contented to loſe them in
the cauſe of Chriſt: well the time of perſecution came, and the ſtrong
man became a Papiſt, and the weakeſt remained a Proteſtant, although
he did not burne for it, but dyed in his bed; therefore the ſtrong muſt
carry themſelves humbly and lowly, and not deſpiſe their weake bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
but pray to God, that they may ſhew love to Chriſt in the time of
greateſt troubles.</p>
               <p>Now what was it that made them performe this duty to Chriſt? this
conſideration that they had heard Chriſt preach unto them, and had
not profited by it, that hee was entertained into many of their houſes,
but not into their hearts, and now that thay had taken Chriſt and killed
him, if ever they will ſhew their love to him, now they muſt doe it or
never; this conſideration made them hold and ſtand to Chriſt when
others did ſhrinke. Now the ſame thing muſt worke upon us the like
effect, we have heard the Goſpell a long time, yet have profited little by
it, whereas we might have growne in grace, and have beene teachers of
others, ſtill we remaine ignorant the more ſhame for us; we ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reaſon thus, I grow old, and I know not how ſoone the day of my
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:17958:145"/>
death will come: now is the time where in I ſhould get grace, the time
wherein I ſhould get knowledge, it muſt bee now or never; this conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
may ſtirre us up to ſhew love to Chriſt and to his members.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The next point is,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Thirdly, the place of his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall.</note> the place where Christ was buryed; <hi>and this is to bee
conſidered in divers circumſtances:</hi>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>1 That it was another mans grave.</item>
                  <item>2 That this grave was Ioſephs grave.</item>
                  <item>3 That it was a new grave wherein never any man was laid.</item>
                  <item>4 It was in a Garden.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">First, another mans grave.</note> it was another mans grave that Chriſt was buryed in, for hee
was ſo poore that he had not a grave of his own; we ſee that poore men
though they have not an houſe to hide their heads in,<note place="margin">Reaſon 1.</note> yet they have a
grave to bury themſelves in, but Chriſt was ſo poore he had not a grave
of his owne to bury himſelfe in; neither was it onely in his death, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
in his whole life, for when Chriſt was borne, he was borne in another
mans houſe, when he preached, hee preached in another mans ſhip, and
when he prayed he prayed in another mans garden; when hee eat, the
women miniſtred unto him, when he did ride to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> he did ride on
another mans Aſſe, when he was buryed, he was buryed in another mans
grave, he had nothing peculiar to himſelfe but his croſſe; which no man
would touch, much leſſe take from him, for they compelled <hi>Simon</hi> of
<hi>Syrene</hi> to beare it; all which may teach us that Chriſt hath ſanctified a
poore eſtate to us, ſo that if a man be never ſo poore and meane, let him
be contented with it, and labour to be Gods ſervant, that he may ſay of
him, Behold my ſervant, and behold my ſonne, then this poore eſtate
is ſanctified to thee.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Reaſon 2.</note> Chriſt was buried in another mans grave, to ſhew that hee
would come in a neerer conjunction with us, That hee would not onely
take our nature upon him, come into our houſes, and eate at our Tables
but hee would alſo lye in our graves with us; it is a great love that a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
heares to her huſband,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> that ſhee will be contented to forſake her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
houſe and leave her kindred, and go and dwell with her huſband; but
it is a farre greater love when ſhee will follow him into the priſon, and
downe into the dungeon; ſo it is a great love of Chriſt that he would take
our nature upon him, come into our houſes, and feede at our tables, But it
is a farre greater love that he would go into the grave with us, and lie there
troden downe of death, that ſo he might give life to our dead bodies.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Secondly, Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephs grave.</note> 
                  <hi>this grave was Ioſephs:</hi> now <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was a rich man as wee have
heard; and this was to fulfill that Scripture <hi>Eſay</hi> 53. 9. where the Prophet
foretold it, <hi>Hee made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death;</hi>
on the croſſe contemned and deſpiſed, but in the grave he was honoured:
ſo it is with a Chriſtian, ſo long as he is in troubles and croſſes of this life,
ſo long he is contemned and deſpiſed, but when he is in the grave, then hee
is honoured; as wee ſee the Iewes did perſecute the prophets in their life
time, but<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when they were dead they did paint and garniſh their tombes:
therefore our Saviour ſaith, ye are witneſſes unto your ſelves, that yee are
the ſonnes of them that murthered the prophets; when they were alive
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:17958:145"/>
then they could not abide them, but. when they were dead then they did
honour them, and ſo in <hi>Prov.</hi> 10. 7. <hi>The memoriall of the juſt ſhall be bleſſed,
but the name of the wicked ſhall rot.</hi> The ſight of a good man is grievous to a
number, they cannot abide to ſee his face, but let God take him away and
then they honour him; it is not ſo with the wicked man, for hee hath his
honour whiles he liveth, here every one doth applaud him and ſpeake to
him faire, but let him dye and then his name rots, as <hi>Iob</hi> 21. 17. it is ſaid,
<hi>How oft is the candle of the wicked put out; and how oft commeth their deſtruction
upon them?</hi> where we may ſee the life of a wicked man compared to a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
that when it is light, every man takes delight to looke on it, but let it
be put out, and it leaveth a ſtinking ſnuffe behinde it; even ſo it is with a
wicked man, as long as he liveth every man ſeeketh to him, and many doe
applaud him, but if he be dead, then he leaveth nothing but a ſtinke behind:
and therefore this is a comfort to a Chriſtian man that though he be deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
here while he liveth, yet he ſhall be honoured in the grave.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>it was a new grave, wherein never man lay:</hi> and here was a ſpeciall
providence of God in it.<note place="margin">A new Grave.</note> Now there were two cauſes why he was buried
in a new grave:</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Two cauſes why Chriſt was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in a new Grave.</note> leſt the Iewes ſhould ſurmiſe that it was not Chriſt that did riſe
againe, but ſome other that was buried before him, therefore he was buried
in a grave wherein never man was laid before him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, leſt the Iewes ſhould thinke he did not riſe by his owne pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
but by the power of ſome holy man that had beene buried there before;
even as the man ſpoken of 2 <hi>king.</hi> 13. 22. when he was put into the grave
of <hi>Eliſeus,</hi> and did touch his dead bones, life came into him againe; ſo leſt
they ſhould thinke that ſome holy Man had beene buried there, and by
touching of his dead bones life came into him againe, therefore wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of God appointed that he ſhould bee buried in a Grave wherein ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
man was, ſo that God would ſtop all occaſions of ſurmiſing to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
In <hi>Hos.</hi> 2. 6. <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>I will hedge up the way with thornes,
and make a wall that he ſhall not finde her pathes:</hi> ſome take this way to be the
way of affliction, but it is a Metaphor taken from men that doe incloſe
beaſts in a paſture, that do thruſt buſhes into every gap, becauſe they ſhould
not creepe out; even ſo, becauſe wee are ready to creepe out at every gap,
therefore the Lord doth ſtop them, that ſo wee may not wander here and
there.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4</note> 
                  <hi>it was in a garden</hi> that as the <hi>firſt Adam</hi> did commit ſinne in
a garden:<note place="margin">It was in a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</note> ſo the <hi>ſecond Adam</hi> came to bury ſinne and utterly to deſtroy it
in a garden. I, but why did <hi>Ioſeph</hi> make his grave in the midſt of his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
ſeeing the garden is a ſpeciall place of delight? the reaſon is, that he
might remember death in the midſt of his pleaſures, and to put him in
minde that he muſt lye there and be diſſolved to duſt, which doth teach us
a ſpeciall point of Inſtruction, that wee ought to remember death in the
midſt of all our pleaſures and delights: our Saviour in his life often ſpeaks
of death, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. 18. and <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. 31. When Chriſt was tranſfigured
on the mount,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> talked with him, it is ſaid, <hi>They appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in glory, and ſpake of his deceaſe, Luk.</hi> 9. 31. ſo in the midſt of our mirth and
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:17958:146"/>
of our delights and pleaſures, we ſhould thinke of death: Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> ſaith
it was the cuſtome amongſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> that in the midſt of their triumphs
there was one at the backe of them, who cryed out, <hi>Remember thou art a
mortall man, and for all this applauſe that thou must dye;</hi> ſo it was the manner
of Egyptians that at their merry meetings, to bring in a Sceleton, the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
of a dead man, whoſe fleſh was puld off the bones, and one ſaid unto
them, <hi>Eate and drinke, and bee merry, for thou ſhalt bee ſuch an one after death:</hi>
Now if the Romanes in their Triumphs had their remembrance of death,
and the Egyptians at their merriments, then how much more ſhould wee
that be Chriſtians thinke of death? they had but the light of nature, and
we have the light of Gods grace. We reade <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 22. <hi>When Abraham ſaw
the place afarre off where he ſhould ſacrifice his ſon, he tooke the wood of the burnt
offering and laid it on his ſonne Iſaac, and he tooke the fire in his hand, and a knife;
and they went both together:</hi> ſo when wee ſee afarre off the place of death, or
the time when we ſhall dye by contemplation or meditation that wee are
old or that ſickneſſe is upon us,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> wee ſhould fit and prepare our ſelves for it,
that ſo wee may dye in faith and in the favour of God, in aſſurance of the
pardon of our ſinnes, that ſo when wee part with this world we may enter
into joy and happineſſe.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, we are to obſerve <hi>the manner of Chriſts buriall,</hi> wherein divers
things are to be conſidered:<note place="margin">4 The manner of Chriſt buriall.</note> As firſt, that <hi>Ioſeph</hi> before hee would take
downe the dead body of Chriſt would aske leave of <hi>Pilate:</hi> for the bodies
of the condemned be in the hands of the Magiſtrates.<note place="margin">1</note> This was the reaſon
why he would not take downe the body without leave. Secondly, when he
had leave,<note place="margin">2</note> he goes and puls the nailes and ſpicks out of the hands and feete
of Chriſt, takes his body down and gets it on his backe, and in this medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
it is likly ſaid, Lord, thou haſt borne the burthen of my ſins, and now I
will beare the burthen of thy body.<note place="margin">3</note> Thirdly, that <hi>Nicodemus</hi> did bring an
hundred pound of ſweet odors of Myrrh and Aloes, to imbalme his body,
and leſt the Iewes ſhould thinke it were ſuperfluity, it is ſaid, <hi>It was the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of the Iewes to doe ſo.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">4</note> Fourthly, when they had imbalmed his body, <hi>Ioseph</hi>
gets a kircher, and tyed upon his jawes, and wrapped up his wounds and
ſores with fine linnen, and laid him in a faire ſheet and wrapped him in it.
Fiftly, when this was done they layd him into the earth, the one at the head
and the other at the feet,<note place="margin">5</note> and then they rowled a ſtone upon the grave that
no body might doe any hurt unto the dead body of Chriſt. Now from
hence divers things worthy our obſervation offer themſelves unto us, but
for the preſent wee will content our ſelves onely with theſe two obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Obſer. 1. Their readineſſe to bury Chriſt.</note> 
                  <hi>The readineſſe of theſe men to burie Chriſt,</hi> wherein they ſhewed
their true love to him; the one hee brought fine linnen to wrap up Chriſt
in; the other, an hundred pounds of oyntment to annoint the dead body
of Chriſt: theſe men thought nothing too much to beſtow on him: But
where are the men that are ſo ready now to doe ſervice, or to beſtow any
coſt on Chriſt? Theſe men did but a little in his life time; but now hee is
dead, they ſtand at no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oſt, they are ready to doe any ſervice unto him;
which may condemne us that now live in the light of the <hi>Goſpell:</hi> now
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:17958:146"/>
when Chriſt is not dead but alive in glory, and amongſt us in his lively
members, and are no more ready to ſhew our love to Chriſt, who is yet to
be clothed and helped: therefore, (as a learned man ſaith) Let us go with
these two Diſciples and buy fine Linnen, and wrap the body of Chriſt in
it, and let us bring an hundred pound of ſweete ſpices to imbalme him
with, and if thou canſt not buy an hundred pound, then buy ten pounds;
if thou canſt not buy tenne, buy five; if not five, then one pound; and if
not one pound, then buy one ounce: yee know what Chriſt ſaith, <hi>That
which ye do to of theſe little ones, ye do it to me;</hi> and if thou haſt nothing to
give Chriſt, yet take heed how thou take away any thing from Chriſt. As
the fine linnen and the ſweet ſpices that <hi>Ioſeph</hi> and <hi>Nicodemus</hi> had prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for the buriall of Chriſt; therefore, if there be any money, or bread,
or any thing elſe to bee beſtowed on Chriſt in his poore members, let us
take heed how we doe take it away: If (I ſay) we have nothing to beſtow
on Chriſt or on his poore members, yet let us take heed how we take away
from him that which <hi>Ioſeph</hi> and <hi>Nicodemus</hi> hath given, I meane that which
Gods people hath beſtowed.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> we obſerve in the manner, that <hi>as too much ſumptuouſnes is to be
avoyded,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Obſervatio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>ſo too much ſluttiſhneſſe:</hi> there is a golden meane if one could hit
it; there be ſome too fine, and there be ſome too ſluttiſh; and therefore, if
we have no better rule than this, let us follow the manner and cuſtome of
Gods people; we ſee here it was the cuſtome of the <hi>Iewes</hi> ſo to burie. Now
there bee fooliſh toyes uſed amongſt us, I know not from whence they
came, but I am ſure it is not the ancient manner of Chriſtians ſo to
bury.</p>
               <p>The fifth is,<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>The fruite and benefit we have by the buriall of Chriſt,</hi> which
is,<note place="margin">The fruite and benefit of his buriall.</note> 
                  <hi>That ſinne may be buried in us;</hi> and therefore as every man would bee
contented to bring ſomething to the buriall of Chriſt, if thou canſt not
bring fine linnen with <hi>Ioſeph</hi> to wrappe the body of Chriſt in,<note place="margin">1</note> nor an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
pound of ſweete ſpices with <hi>Nicodemus</hi> to imbalme his body, yet doe
thou bring thy ſinnes and thy corruptions, let them die in his death, and
be buried in his grave; this is acceptable to God, and ſeeing he lookes for
thy ſinnes and my ſins, and hath waited three daies together being tramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
and troden downe of death, therefore what may wee looke for if wee
doe neglect it. Now that ſinne may bee buried in us, there bee foure
things required:</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">4</note> 
                  <hi>that we labour to kill ſinne,</hi> for if wee have not killed it, wee cannot
burie it;<note place="margin">Waies to burie ſinne.</note> as long as their is life in it, it will riſe againe, and therefore let
us ſlay ſinne and labour to kill it: this is that which <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of, <hi>Coloſ.</hi>
3. 1. <hi>Mortifie therefore your members which are on earth,</hi> that is, kill your ſins,
and your luſts: Wee ſee when the Souldiers went to bury the theeves,
finding them alive,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> they firſt brake the legges of them and killed them; ſo
when we goe to bury ſinne, if we finde ſinne to be alive ſtill, wee muſt firſt
breake the legges and kill it, and then we muſt burie it.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>We muſt hate the loathſome face of ſin;</hi> for if we like it and love
it, we will never bury it: and this is the reaſon why we are content to bury
our friends though we lov'd them &amp; lik'd them well,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> becauſe after they are
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:17958:147"/>
dead,<note place="margin">ARTI. IV.</note> they become loathſome: ſo when ſinne is loathſome and wee
cannot abide to ſee the ugly face of it, then wee ſhould endevour to
bury it.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> Therefore, when men will ſweare and lye, and prophane the
Sabbathes, and be drunken, it is certaine they doe not ſee the loathſome
face of ſinne, and then they care not for the burying of it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>To remoove it out of our ſight,</hi> and out of our houſes, as wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moove
a dead man out of our houſes; therefore <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid,<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>Let me bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
my dead out of my ſight: Ez<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> 39. 14. There is related a ſtrange ſtorie, that
there were ſearchers appointed to goe through the lan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, who if they did
finde any dead mens bones after a great ſlaughter, were to ſet up a marke
or a ſticke by them,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> till the buriers came; ſo every mans conſcience muſt
be the ſearchers to finde out his ſinnes, which when hee hath found out,

to handle a further deſcent of Chriſts humiliation,
for there were certaine ſteps thereof, on which hee
deſcended, till he came at the loweſt ſteppe; and
it was (as all Divines agree) <hi>His deſcention into Hell.
Geneſis</hi> 28. 12. We may ſee that on the ladder that
<hi>Iacob</hi> ſaw in his viſion, there were Angels aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and deſcending:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſo on the ladder of mans re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
there was Chriſt deſcending lower and lower till hee came to
the loweſt ſteppe, and ſinfull man aſcending higher and higher, till hee
came to the higheſt top of glory; it is an experience in nature, that thoſe
would carry water up to high Towers and Steeples, muſt let it fall excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
low,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ere it can riſe: So our Saviour Chriſt the moſt cunningeſt
Artificer in the World, that he might raiſe the fraile nature of man to the
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:17958:147"/>
higheſt toppe of glory,<note place="margin">SERMON XXIX.</note> was contented to fall exceeding low, to the loweſt
ſtep of humiliation, that ſo he might raiſe man to the higheſt glory: This
is generally the myſtery of Chriſts deſcention into Hell, as all doe
agree.</p>
               <p>Now for the particulars, I muſt grant there bee divers opinions of it;
ſome thinke one thing, ſome another yea there is not onely diverſities of
opinions between the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> and the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> but in both ſides even
in the boſome of their Churches, and amongſt themſelves. It is the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of ſome Papiſts that Chriſt was not in the place of the damnd of Hel,
but they ſay he was in the ſkirts and brimmes thereof; but <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> hee
diſſents from them, and affirmes he was in the vaults and chambers in Hel;
and another ſaith, he was not in Hell bodily, but by efficacy and vertually:
ſo we ſee the Papiſts be not all of one minde, but there be divers opinions
amongſt them. Now before wee goe any further, there bee two ſorts of
men that muſt be ſatiſfied.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> ſuch as ſay ſeeing there is ſuch a diverſitie of opinions, they will
beleeve nothing till all be agreed. To ſuch I anſwere, if thou wilt beleeve
nothing till all be agreed, then thou wilt never beleeve at all, and ſo thou
ſhalt never be ſaved, becauſe there have been diſſentions in all ages; <hi>Moſes</hi>
was withſtood by <hi>Iannes</hi> and <hi>Iambres, Elias</hi> with <hi>Baals Prieſts, Ieremie</hi> with
the <hi>falſe Prophets, Chriſt</hi> with the <hi>Phariſies,</hi> and <hi>the Apoſtles</hi> with <hi>Simon Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus:</hi>
so there hath been diverſitie of opinions from the beginning, and will
be as long as there is the ſeede of the vvoman and the ſeede of the Serpent;
ſo long as the <hi>Fleſh luſteth againſt the ſpirit, and the ſpirit againſt the fleſh,</hi> ſo
long as <hi>we ſee but in part, as it were in a glaſſe;</hi> and therefore if thou wilt not
beleeve till all agree, thou wilt never beleeve, and ſo thou ſhalt never bee
ſaved; as in <hi>Chryſostom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> time many heathen came unto him and told
him, that they would bee Chriſtians, but that there were ſuch diverſities
of opinions amongſt them, and ſuch diviſions, every one pretending the
truth. Now <hi>Origen</hi> doth worthily anſwer this, ſaith he, Wilt thou not be a
Chriſtian, becauſe there be diverſity of opinions? thou hadſt as good ſay,
thou wilt not be of any calling, for there is no calling but hath its diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of opinions and diſſent in judgement: wilt thou bee a <hi>Philoſopher?</hi>
some of them be of one judgement, and ſome of another, and there is an
hundred opinions amongſt them: Wilt thou bee a <hi>Phyſition,</hi> there is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity
of judgements amongſt them too? Wilt thou be a <hi>Lawyer,</hi> why,
one interprets the law one way, and one another way; yea, there is not
any Art, but therein are diſſentions in judgement one from the other;
and therefore if thou wilt doe nothing till all bee agreed, thou canſt not
be of any calling. It is a ſtrange thing that men ſhould doe more fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in religion, than in any thing elſe: If a man hath his lands to ſow, and
he goe and aſke his neighbour when it is beſt to ſow;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſome will ſay at ſuch
a time, and ſome at ſuch a time, and every man will ſpeake according to
the judgement and light of knowledge he hath; therefore wilt thou neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
ſowing thy land: ſo it may be thou mayeſt be ſtarved. Now ſince for
diverſitie of mens opinions concerning the ſeaſon, thou wilt not omit the
time of ſowing; much more doe not thou neglect the ſaving of thy ſoule:
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:17958:148"/>
This is the madneſſe of men, they will not neglect the ſowing of their
land nor the building of their houſes, and yet they will neglect the ſaving
of their ſoules.</p>
               <p>Another ſort of men that must bee ſatiſfied,<note place="margin">2</note> are ſuch who ſay, if great
Doctors and learned men are not able to ſettle themſelves; how ſhall we
bee able that are unlearned? I anſwere, that if a man make conſcience of
plaine truths, God will reveale the other ſo farre forth as ſhall bee need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for him: Saint <hi>Paul</hi> gives us a rule for it, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. 15. <hi>Let us therefore
as many as be perfect be thus minded and if in any thing ye be otherwiſe minded,
God ſhall reveale even the ſame thing unto you.</hi> Nevertheleſſe, in that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
wee are come, let us proceede by one rule that wee may minde one
thing. Now there be ſome truths that wee all generally agree in, we hold
that whoredome is a ſin, that drunkennes, ſwearing, lying and ſlandering
our neighbour be ſinnes, and dealing unjuſtly is a ſin, and if we make not
conſcience of theſe knowne truthes, it is juſt we ſhould care and wander
in the great matters, therefore let us make conſcience of knowne truthes,
and God will reveale the other to us; As we ſee <hi>Acts</hi> 10. in the example
of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> he being ignorant in a maine point, faſted, praied, made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
of knowne truthes, and God did informe him in the ſame by <hi>Peter;</hi>
ſo likewiſe <hi>Peter</hi> in the ſame Chapter being ignorant of the converſion of
the Gentiles, preached, and prayed on the houſe toppe, and making con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
of that knowne truth, God did reveale the other to him in a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
So likewiſe <hi>Apollos, Acts</hi> 18. knowing nothing but the Baptiſme of
<hi>Iohn,</hi> went on and preached life and ſalvation by Chriſt, and making con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
of that knowne truth, God did reveale the other; hee ſtirred up
<hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla,</hi> and they informed him; therefore let us make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
of knowne truthes, and God will reveale the other as far form
as ſhall be needfull for us.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> If a man powre water into a glaſſe, if the glaſſe
foule the water and mud it, hee will ſtay his hand and will powre in no
more, but if it remaines cleare, hee fils it up to the top: ſo if God powre
knowledge into a man, if he marres his knowledge or ſoyles it, then God
will ſtay his hand, but if hee with his knowledge labour to glorifie God,
and make conſcience of his wayes, then God will fill him up to the toppe.
This may bee the ſtay of a true Chriſtian when great Doctors erre and
wander, and be unſetled, if thou make conſcience of thy wayes, and walke
in the plaine truths, God will reveale unto thee the other.</p>
               <p>Now having ſatiſfied theſe two ſorts of men, I will ſhew you firſt
what I allow not of; ſecondly, what I take to be more probable, and
come more neere the truth; thirdly, what I take to be the truth in my
judgement, all under correction of the more grave and learned.</p>
               <p>Firſt, what it is that I reject and allow not of; for though no man can
preſently know the certaine truth of this, yet it is good to avoid the
dangerous opinions:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> As a man that is at ſea, if he cannot hit of the right
haven to arrive at, yet if he can avoid the dangerous rockes and ſands it
is well; So although we cannot know all certaine truths, yet it is well if
we can avoid uncouth and falſe opinions. Now there be foure opinions
which I allow not of.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="285" facs="tcp:17958:148"/>
Firſt, <hi>That his body deſcended into hell;</hi> this in my judgement ſtands not
with the Scripture, for Chriſts body was in the grave three nights and
three dayes,<note place="margin">Foure opinions of Chriſts deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion into hell.</note> as Chriſt ſpeakes, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 40. <hi>As Ionas was three dayes
and three nights in the Whales belly; ſo the ſonne of Man ſhall be three dayes and
three nights in the body of the earth;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1</note> therefore the body of Chriſt was no
lower than the grave, it deſcended no further: And this may be a ſweet
comfort to us, that the bodies of Chriſtians deſcend no lower than the
grave; therefore when we ſee a Chriſtian laid into his grave, he is in the
worſt eſtate wee ſhall ſee him in; but the wicked deſcend lower and
lower til they come at hell, though their bodies doe not deſcend when
they be buried, yet when they ſhall riſe againe at the laſt Iudgement,
then not onely their ſoules, but alſo their bodies ſhall goe to hell; as
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 9. <hi>The wicked ſhall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God;</hi>
but when a Chriſtian is buried and laid in his grave, here is the worſt
eſtate ſhal befal them, for where the body of Chriſt reſted, there the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of Chriſtians ſhall reſt after death, to wit, in the grave.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>That Chriſt went downe in his Spirit into hell (or deſcended
thither) to preach to the damned to convert them:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The ſecond Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</note> This opinion ſeemes more
unreaſonable than the former; but <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confutes it, for hee ſaith,
that life is the time of grace, there is no repentance nor converting unto
God after death, according as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Iohn</hi> 9. <hi>Worke while it is called
today, for the night commeth on when no man can worke:</hi> And 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>We ſhall
all appeare before the judgement ſeat of God, to anſwer for that we have done in the
body, whether it be good or bad:</hi> So there is no repentance after death, but
then we muſt come to judgement to anſwer for that we have done in our
fleſh: And <hi>Galath.</hi> 6. <hi>Whiles we have time doe good;</hi> here in this life-time is
the doing of good, and therefore it is a ſure thing that if we doe not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
and turne unto God while wee live here, wee ſhall not repent after
death, becauſe this life-time is the time of grace, and of repentance;
therefore it muſt be the wiſdome of men to repent of their ſins, to turne
unto God, lay hold on life and ſalvation while they live here, for if they
be dead and laid in the grave, it is impoſſible that they ſhould repent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
this life time is the time of repentance: S. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaith, there
be <hi>two kindes</hi> of <hi>Repentance, fruitfull</hi> and <hi>unfruitfull,</hi> or penall repentance:
<hi>Fruitfull repentance</hi> is in this life, <hi>Penall repentance</hi> after this life in hell, for
it is true (ſaith he) the damned in hell ſhall repent them of their ſins, the
whoremaſter of his whoring, the drunkard of his drunkenneſſe, the ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
of his ſwearing, but this repentance ſhall be unfruitfull, though it be
an afflictive repentance; therefore if wee would have fruit and benefit
by our converſion, we muſt repent whiles we live here.</p>
               <p>The third is,<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>That Chriſt deſcended into hell to ſuffer the paines and torments
of hell in his ſoule,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The third Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</note> where we ſhould have ſuffered: I anſwer, the Scripture
is plaine for this, that Chriſt did not ſuffer for us in hell, for hee ſuffered
on the croſſe, where all was finiſhed; therefore hee did not need to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend
into hell to ſuffer paines and torments there; as <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>Forſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as the children were partakers of the fleſh and bloud, he alſo himſelfe having
tooke part with them, that by death hee might deſtroy him that had power ever
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:17958:149"/>
death,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Object.</note> 
                  <hi>that is, the Devill;</hi> ſo Chriſt did overcome the Devill by dying.</p>
               <p>But it may be objected and ſaid, that we deſerved to have ſuffered the
paines of hell for ever; and therefore Chriſt deſcended into hell for us.
To this I anſwer,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> that if this reaſon were good, then he in ſoule ſhould
not onely have ſuffered the torments of hell, but his body too, for wee
deſerve not onely to have our ſoules tormented, but our bodies alſo;
therefore this cannot ſtand us in ſtead: Chriſt ſuffered the paines of
hell, but not in the place of hell, but partly in the Garden, and partly on
the Croſſe, which was ſufficient for mans offence; as a man that hath a
ſumme of money to pay, if he pay it (though it be not in the ſame place)
all is well, it cannot be required againe; ſo Chriſt hath paid and ſatisfied
God for our ſinnes, though not in the ſame place where we ſhould have
ſuffered, but partly in the Garden, when he was in the bloudy ſweat, and
partly on the Croſſe, when he made that bitter complaint, <hi>My God, my
God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> And therefore this may give us comfort
that God is ſatiſfied and will not require any more at our hands, if wee
be in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The Fourth is,<note place="margin">4</note> 
                  <hi>That Chriſt went not downe to hell, but hee went to the upper
ſkirts and brims of hell where the Fathers were floting,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The fourth Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</note> 
                  <hi>ſo to fetch them thence.</hi>
This is the opinion of the Papiſts, and is more unreaſonable than any of
the former, for the Fathers were not in the upper skirts and brims of hel,
but were ſaved by the ſame faith we be; as we ſee, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 11. <hi>But wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
through the grace of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt to be ſaved as they doe;</hi> ſo the
Fathers were ſaved by the ſame meanes we are, for the ſame means were
in the Old Teſtament that is in the New, but that there was a veile be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it: To this effect we have <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102. 24. <hi>I ſaid, take mee not away in the
midſt of my dayes;</hi> but there is a plainer place than this, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 12. 7. <hi>Then
ſhall the duſt returne to the earth as it was, and the ſpirit ſhall returne unto God
that gave it.</hi> So the ſoules of good men, we ſee, went not to the border
of hell, but to God, as <hi>Luke</hi> 16. when <hi>Lazarus</hi> was dead, his ſoule was
carried into <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome, and <hi>Dives</hi> into hell.</p>
               <p>Now there be two evidences that <hi>Lazarus</hi> was not in the border and
ſkirts of hell: Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> becauſe his ſoule was carried by the Angels, who
doe not carry mens ſoules into hell,<note place="margin">2</note> but into heaven: Secondly, becauſe
that he was in a place of comfort and joy, but there is poore comfort in
hell; therefore we may ſee that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> opinion is very erroneous
and falſe.</p>
               <p>But there is another Scripture to be anſwered,<note place="margin">Object.</note> where it is ſaid, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.
12. that the way to the holieſt of holy, was not made <hi>by the bloud of Goats
and Calves, but by the bloud of Chriſt;</hi> and then it followes, there was no
way to heaven, but by the death of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer,<note place="margin">ſol.</note> firſt, that there was no way to heaven by the legal ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices,
only the vertue and power of Chriſts ſacrifice laid the way open
to us. Secondly, all that came to heaven muſt come by the vertue and
power of Chriſt, for his death was as vertuall and effectuall to ſave men
from the beginning, as it is now; therefore in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> it is ſaid,
<hi>He is the Lamb ſlaine from the beginning,</hi> becauſe it was effectual and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:17958:149"/>
in Gods account; As when a man is arreſted and carried to priſon for
a great ſumme of money, and meets with his friend, who aſkes him whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he is going;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> he tels him he is going to priſon, who thus pleads with
the man that this party was indebted to; If ye let him goe I will pay the
debt, I have not ſo much money about mee as will pay thee now, but at
ſuch a time I will pay all that money; well, he keepes the day and payes
the money, and all is well; So wee be infinitely indebted to God, and
were going to priſon, Chriſt promiſeth to God hee will ſatiſfie him, at
the time appointed he brought him a bag of money, that is, of his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
then we were diſcharged, God was pacified and pleaſed. Thus yee
have heard of thoſe foure opinions that I cannot aſſent unto, now we are
to ſpeake of that which in my poore judgement is neerer the truth, and
carries ſome probabilitie for it.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Two more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Opinions.</note> 
                  <hi>That Chriſt deſcended into hell to ſubdue the Devill, and conquer him
in his owne houſe;</hi> this is more probable than any of the other, and there
be learned men that do hold ſo,<note place="margin">1</note> but I dare not yeeld to it, becauſe I have
reaſon to the contrary;<note place="margin">Reaſon 1.</note> Firſt, becauſe moſt of all Divines hold, that
Chriſts deſcenſion into hell is the loweſt ſtep and degree of his abaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
yet let it be what it will be, <hi>David</hi> rejoyceth at it, as a thing of
great deliverance, that he had eſcaped the grave, <hi>Therefore</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>my
heart is glad, and my glory rejoyceth; my fleſh alſo ſhall reſt in hope, for thou wilt
not leave my ſoule in grave, neither yet wilt thou let thine Holy One ſee corruption:</hi>
And <hi>Augustine</hi> ſaith, that by this poverty of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt wee
are enriched: But if Chriſt deſcended into hell to triumph over the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
in his owne houſe, then it is not the loweſt ſtep of his humiliation
and abaſement, but it will appeare that he had the firſt beginning of his
Kingdome, and firſt ſtep of his exaltation in hell; therefore in my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
this cannot be the true ſenſe of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> all the Scriptures ſhew that his ſoule went not into hell,
but into heaven; as <hi>Luke</hi> 23. Chriſt ſaith to the theefe on the croſſe, <hi>This
day thou ſhalt be with me in Paradiſe;</hi> ſo the ſoule of Chriſt went to Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe,
not into hell; and in the ſame chapter, when Chriſt gave up the
ghoſt, <hi>he commended his ſoule into the hands of God;</hi> ſo Chriſts ſoule was not
in hell, but was laid downe in the hands of God, and his body remained
here till he was taken up; and <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, if we thinke that the ſoule
of the Theefe went to heaven, then it were our ſin to thinke that Chriſts
ſoule did not as well as his. Some ſhifts this and ſay, his ſoule went to
heaven firſt, and preſently after he was buried, he deſcended into hell;
and ſome againe ſay, his ſoule went to hell firſt, and after it went to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
but this is againſt that Scripture, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. it is the ſpeech betweene
<hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Dives, that there is a great ſpace beeweene us, that they which are
here, cannot come there, and they which are there cannot come here;</hi> there is no
entercourſe betweene them: And <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith <hi>he was in heaven and in
hell all at one time;</hi> but he that is in heaven cannot be in hell, and hee that
is in hell, cannot bee in heaven, becauſe it is proper onely to the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
to be in all places at one time.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>Origen</hi> ſaith, <hi>hee triumphed on the croſſe and in this world over all
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:17958:150"/>
his ſpirituall enemies;</hi> and if hee did it in this world and upon the croſſe,
then hee need not deſcend into hell to triumph over the divell and to
ſubdue him. In the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> the Apoſtle ſhewes how Chriſt did tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
<hi>on the croſſe</hi> over principallities and powers, there hee vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
and overcame them, and there hee trod downe all his ſpirituall
enemies.</p>
               <p>But here may <hi>an Objection ariſe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Object. Sol.</note> how could he overcome them, ſeeing
he was overcome himſelfe of death? I anſwer, hee overcame them in
his ſoule by his holy graces, he carryed away a glorious triumph, though
they ſeized upon his body; ſo it is ſaid of meaner men than Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi>
8. 36. <hi>All the day long we are killed, and are accounted as ſheepe for the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi>
and yet for all this they were more than conquerours by the holy
graces they had, by their faith, patience and care, ſo they carried away
the glorious triumph. Now if men did triumph on the croſſe, much
more Chriſt; which muſt teach us, that ſeeing Chriſt did triumph on the
croſſe, every Chriſtian ſhould doe ſo, when he is under the croſſe, then
he ſhould triumph over his ſpirituall enemies by his faith and holy gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
ſo to carry away a glorious victory. So <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 29. our Saviour
ſaith, <hi>If thine eye offend thee, plucke it out, and if thine hand offend thee, cut it
off: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members ſhould periſh, and not that
thy whole body ſhould bee caſt into hell.</hi> It is an eaſie matter to the world,
when they be in health and in peace, to tread downe all the ſpirituall
enemies, but a difficult taſke when they bee in ſickneſſe, and in paines,
yet a Chriſtian we ſee, if hee will follow the example of his Lord and
maſter Ieſus Chriſt, muſt triumph on the croſſe.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Saint <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">4</note> 
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 1. <hi>I have made the former treatiſe, O
Theophilus, of all that Ieſus began both to doe and teach, untill the day that hee
was taken up:</hi> now if Saint <hi>Luke</hi> did write of all that Chriſt did till the
time hee was taken up, then he would have wrote of this, it being an act
of Chriſt to deſcend downe into hell; but Saint <hi>Luke</hi> hath not recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
it, he hath not written of this, and therefore Chriſt did not deſcend
into hell to ſubdue the divell there. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith well, <hi>whatſoever our
Saviour Chriſt would have us to beleeve, he hath commanded his Diſciples to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
it;</hi> but they have recorded no ſuch thing, therefore it is not to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved.</p>
               <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5</note> there be many Divines ſay, that all the devils be in this world
till the laſt day, and then they bee not in hell. Now I dare not ſay that
all of them be in this world, but I thinke the greateſt part bee here; for
<hi>Ephes.</hi> 6. the devill is ſaid to be <hi>in high places,</hi> that is, in the aire; and <hi>Iob</hi> 1.
the Lord asketh the devill from whence he came, whoſe reply is, <hi>from
compaſſing the earth,</hi> ſo the devill is in the earth; and <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
Chriſt caſt out a devill out of a man, and hee asked him what his
name was, and hee ſaid, <hi>Legion,</hi> becauſe <hi>there was alegion of devils,</hi> is that a
great number: ſo that the greateſt part of the devils bee in this world;
therefore hee needed not to deſcend into hell to ſubdue the devils, the
moſt of which might be ſubdued here.</p>
               <p>Laſtly,<note place="margin">6</note> all the articles of our Chriſtian faith are confirmed by plaine
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:17958:150"/>
places of Scripture, but there is no plaine place of Scripture to confirme
this that Chriſt went downe into hell to ſubdue him in his owne houſe:
and <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, that all thoſe points of faith that are fit for a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
to beleeve are confirmed by plaine places of Scripture; but this is
not ſo confirmed, therefore not to be beleeved.</p>
               <p>Now againſt this,<note place="margin">Object. Sol.</note> there bee three Scriptures alleaged: the firſt is
taken out of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. <hi>Thou wilt not leave my ſoule in grave or in hell: neither
wilt thou let thy holy One ſee corruption:</hi> where <hi>by ſoule is meant life,</hi> and
<hi>by hell is meant the grave;</hi> for the ſenſe is; <hi>thou wilt not leave my life in the
grave.</hi> Now that this is the true ſenſe it may appeare by theſe two
reaſons:</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Two reaſons to prove the point.</note> out of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88. where the like phraſe of Scripture is, <hi>My ſoule
draweth neere to hell,</hi> that is, my life draweth neere to the grave, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
plainely by the words following,<note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>I am counted amongſt them that
goe downe into the pit, free among the dead, like the ſlaine lying in the grave.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, it may appeare by the ſame words that <hi>Peter</hi> brings in to
proove the reſurrection of Chriſt;<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 2. the Apoſtle there makes an
oppoſition betweene <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> that Chriſt is aſcended up into
<hi>Heaven,</hi> but <hi>David</hi> was not, his body remaining in the grave: ſo Chriſt
was where <hi>David</hi> was not; therefore wee cannot proove by this that
Chriſts ſoule was in hell.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Scripture is out of <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 7.<note place="margin">Object. Sol.</note> 
                  <hi>Who ſhall deſcend into the
deepe, that is, to bring Chriſt againe from the dead?</hi> Now by the deepe is
not meant the deepe of hell; but of the grave, the depth of the grave
where the dead lye.</p>
               <p>The third is out of <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 9. <hi>Now in that he aſcended, what is it but that
he alſo deſcended firſt into the loweſt parts of the earth?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Object. Sol. Two parts of the earth.</note> 
                  <hi>Chryſostome</hi> expounds
the place, and ſaith, <hi>it is the very grave;</hi> for in the Hebrew tongue there
be two parts of the earth, there is the face of the earth which is the place
where we be, and the lower part, and that is the grave; ſo that the loweſt
part of the earth that Chriſt did aſcend to is the grave.</p>
               <p>The ſecond more probable opinion is,<note place="margin">The ſecond pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable opinion.</note> that <hi>Chriſt deſcended into hell,
when hee left the paines of hell in the garden and on the croſſe:</hi> this is a true
ground, but it doth not agree with the <hi>order of the Creed;</hi> for his deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
into hell was a thing that was done after he was buryed, and his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
in the garden and on the croſſe was before, now it was not repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
againe, for in ſo ſhort a confeſſion, men uſe not to repeat, therefore
it was ſomething that was after his death and buriall.</p>
               <p>Now that which I take to be the truth in my judgment is, that Chriſt
lay in the grave three daies together, trampled and troden downe of
death, ſo that the deſcenſion of Chriſt into hell is nothing elſe but <hi>the
captivating of Chriſt under death for a time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For our inſtruction there bee two uſes to bee made of this point:
firſt, that as Chriſt deſcended lower and lower, till he came to the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
ſtep of abaſement,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> before he aſcended into glory, ſo every one muſt
labour to be contented to deſcend lower and lower, till he come at the
loweſt ſtep of humiliation, before hee aſcend into glory: to this effect
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:17958:151"/>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of Chriſt, <hi>he that deſcended is the ſame that aſcended farre above all
heavens;</hi> ſo that a Chriſtian muſt deſcend firſt before he can aſcend.</p>
               <p>Now there <hi>be two deſcents of a Chriſtian,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Two Deſcents of a Chriſtian.</note> the one is in his ſoule, and the
other is in his body:<note place="margin">1</note> the firſt is in ſoule, to deſcend low into our ſelves,
and to ſinke downe as low as Hell in the ſenſe and feeling of our ſinnes
and vileneſſe before God, that God may advance and lift us up; ſo the
Prophet <hi>David</hi> did, and other holy Saints recorded in the ſacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and therefore <hi>Origen</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> that thoſe which God doth purpoſe to
advance, hee doth firſt make them deſcend low into themſelves to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
as no body that ſo they may be lifted up to glory: ſecondly, they
muſt deſcend in their bodies, they muſt be contented to deſcend into
the grave and to lye in the duſt many yeeres together kept under of
death, and then afterward they ſhall be raiſed to glory.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> that as Chriſt deſcended lower and lower, ſo wee ſhould
bee contented to come downe to the loweſt degree that God ſhall aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne
us; there be many that be contented to come downe ſomewhat,
but to loſe all and to part with all our goods, there is not one of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
that will be contented:<note place="margin">2 Sam. 6. 22.</note> when <hi>David</hi> daunced before the Arke, <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal</hi>
deſpiſed him for it, unto whom he makes this anſwere, <hi>that if it bee a
vile thing to doe ſo, he would be more vile;</hi> ſo ſhould we doe, bee contented
to become more vile in our owne eyes,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> to come to any eſtate that it
ſhall pleaſe God to bring upon us, that ſo he may advance us, as <hi>Iob</hi> 19.
25. when he was deſpiſed of his ſervants and all his goods loſt, yet hee
was contented with it, and cheareth up himſelfe by faith, ſaying, <hi>I know
my Redeemer liveth, and in my fleſh I ſhall ſee God;</hi> ſo if wee be contented to
be humbled here in the kingdome of grace, we ſhall be advanced in the
kingdome of glory.</p>

                  <note place="margin">SERMON XXX.</note>
now we are to ſpeake of the degrees of his
<hi>Exaltation:</hi> but before wee ſpeake of this, the
conſideration of both of them together will not
be unprofitable for us; becauſe from thence wee
may learne this good inſtruction, that as there
was a time of <hi>humiliation,</hi> and a time of <hi>exaltation</hi>
unto Chriſt, ſo all the people of God in ſeverall
ages have had theſe two times; a time of humiliation, and a time of
exaltation; ſo ſaith the Prophet <hi>Ierem.</hi> 30. <hi>Alas, for that day is great, ſo
that none is like it; it is even the time of Iaakobs trouble, yet he ſhall be delivered
out of it:</hi> there is a time of trouble, and a time of deliverance from trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105. 18, 19. <hi>Ioſeph had his feet in the ſtockes and was laid in
Irons, till his appointed time came, and the Lords word had tryed him;</hi> ſo there
was a time of his trouble, and a time of his deliverance out of his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.
This may be the comfort of all the people of God, that as there
is a time of humiliation, ſo there is a time of exaltation, which they
may looke for; as they have trouble, ſo they ſhall have deliverance out
of it, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 12. <hi>If wee ſuffer with Chriſt, wee ſhall alſo
raigne with him;</hi> of theſe things ſaith the Apoſtle put them in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,
as they bee humbled here, ſo they ſhall bee exalted in time to
come: all the people of God muſt ſuſtaine themſelves with this, as <hi>Iob</hi>
14. where he ſaith, <hi>All the daies of my appointed time will I waite, till my
change come:</hi> their ſhame ſhall be turned into glory, and their paines
into eaſe, their trouble into joy; ſo alſo ſaith <hi>David Pſal.</hi> 123. <hi>as the
eyes of a ſervant waite on his maſter, and the eyes of a maide attend on her mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe,
ſo we will waite on thee, till thou have mercy on us;</hi> therefore it is plaine
as there is a time of trouble, ſo there will be a time of mercy, as Chriſt
had theſe two times, ſo all the people of God ſhall have theſe two times.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>The reaſon why it was needfull Chriſt ſhould riſe;</hi> for as there were
reaſons why he ſhould ſuffer; ſo there are alſo reaſons why he ſhould riſe
againe.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">His Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Firſt, three rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why it was needfull that Chriſt ſhould riſe.</note> 
                  <hi>To aſſure us that all our ſinnes are pardoned, purged, and expiated in
the death of Chriſt;</hi> for if there had beene but one ſinne of ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
committed, unexpiated and unreconciled, the guilt of that one ſin
would have held Chriſt under for ever; for <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>the wages of ſinne
is death:</hi> therefore ſeeing Chriſt did riſe againe, it is a plaine evidence
that there is not one ſinne but is done away and reconciled, and yee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
a man doth not thinke of this, but lyeth in a number of ſinnes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
we ſee that one ſin had been ſufficient to have held Chriſt under death
for ever: therefore ſaith <hi>Paul Rom.</hi> 8. 33. <hi>who ſhall lay any thing to the charge
of Gods elect? It is God that juſtifieth, who ſhall condemne:</hi> and againe, in
<hi>chap.</hi> 4. <hi>ult.</hi> he ſaith, <hi>Chriſt was delivered for our ſinnes, and raiſed againe for our
juſtification;</hi> for as Chriſt was juſtified before God, ſo is every true
Chriſtian by the meanes of Chriſt.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> Wee ſee in experience that a man
being caſt into priſon for another mans debt, having chaines caſt on his
hands, and fetters on his feet; if the party ſee a little while after the
chaines taken off his hands, and his fetters knocked off from, his feet
himſelfe to have liberty to walke abroad, he may ſurely thinke that his
debt is diſcharged: this is the caſe betweene Chriſt and us, we were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted
to God, Chriſt is become our ſurety, he is taken and caſt into the
grave, and the chaines of death are caſt on him, therefore when a little
while after Chriſt comes out of the grave, and caſts off the chaines of
death and walkes at liberty againe, we may thinke mans debt is anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
we reconciled, God pacified and pleaſed, and we ſhall not anſwere
for it before the tribunall of God: for if there had beene but one ſinne
unexpiated, that one ſinne would have kept Chriſt under, therefore in
that Chriſt roſe, it is an evidence that our ſinnes are pardoned and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piated.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Chriſt roſe to applie ſalvation,</hi> for he did purchaſe and worke
mans ſalvation by his death, and roſe againe to apply it: for though ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
and redemption was wrought by his death and purchaſed for us,
yet unleſſe he had roſe againe to apply it, we could have had no benefit
by it, for all that we might have periſhed: as <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7. 39. it is ſaid, <hi>The Spirit
was not yet given, becauſe Ieſus was not yet glorified;</hi> there were many goodly
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:17958:152"/>
promiſes made unto the Church, and gifts given, but they had them not
till ſuch time as Chriſt was riſen to apply them; <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, that
he made excellent promiſes to the Church, but there was not a hand of
power to beſtow them till Chriſt was riſen; and therefore it was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
that Chriſt ſhould riſe: as Phyſitians and Surgeons temper a great
many of plaiſters,<note place="margin">Simile</note> and then ſend their ſervants our to apply them, ſo
Chriſt hath tempered many plaiſters with his blood to heale the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
that is ſicke of ſin, and he ſends out his faithfull miniſters to apply
them: we ſee many times a father doth purchaſe goodly lands and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings,
which the childe never enjoyes, but Chriſt hee hath not purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
life and ſalvation for us, but hee liveſ againe to put us in poſſeſſion of
it; therefore it was needfull that Chriſt ſhould riſe againe to apply ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
to us.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Reaſon 2.</note> 
                  <hi>That hee might bee an undoubted evidence to us that we ſhall riſe
againe. Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, that which went before in the head ſhall follow
in the members, for as Chriſt did riſe out of the grave, ſo he ſhall raiſe
all his members. Now hee will raiſe them two waies: firſt, <hi>out of the
grave;</hi> ſecondly, <hi>out of trouble,</hi> whiles they live here.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> Chriſt will raiſe his members <hi>out of the grave:</hi> for as hee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
roſe out of the grave, ſo hee will raiſe them out of it, by the ſame
vertue and power, howſoever they may dye as others doe and turne to
duſt, yet one day they ſhall riſe againe out of their graves; ſo ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>
1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4. 16. <hi>the dead in Chriſt ſhall riſe,</hi> and vers. 17. he ſhewes that they
which are a live at the comming of Chriſt, ſhall not prevent them which
are dead: which is plainely manifeſted, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 22. that as <hi>in Adam
all died, even ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive.</hi> Now every man ſeeth how
we dye by <hi>Adam,</hi> but the faith of a Chriſtian muſt goe further, and ſee
how he ſhall live by Chriſt; this muſt be the onely ſtay of a Chriſtian;
that howſoever hee ſhall dye and bee turned into duſt, yet one day hee
ſhall riſe againe by the power of Chriſt; therefore howſoever we may
be humbled heere, have much trouble and affliction, and in the end dye
and turne to duſt, yet let us comfort our ſelves with this, that one day
wee ſhall riſe againe by the power of Chriſt to poſſeſſe eternall happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;
thus <hi>Iob</hi> did ſuſtaine himſelfe, when he was forſaken of his friends
when hee was a ſtranger to his maides, his wife not regarding him, hee
ſaies joyfully to himſelfe in the nineteeth Chapter, <hi>I know my Redeemer
liveth, and hee ſhall ſtand at the latter day on the earth; and though after my
ſkinne, wormes deſtroy this body, yet ſhall I ſee God in my fleſh:</hi> in like manner
a Chriſtian ought to ſuſtaine himſelfe, that though a great deale of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
and miſery befall him, yet one day hee ſhall ſee God with his eyes;
ſo alſo <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 9. <hi>Wherefore my heart is glad, and my tongue
rejoyceth, my fleſh alſo reſteth in hope, for thou wilt not leave my ſoule in the
grave, neither wilt thou let thy holy one to ſee corruption:</hi> and more over this
was that comfort that Chriſt gave to his Diſciples, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. 19.
when hee told them of his paſſion. <hi>And they ſhall deliver him to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
to mocke, and to ſcourge, and to crucifie him, but the third day he ſhall riſe
againe.</hi> Now that which comforted <hi>Iob, David,</hi> and Chriſt, muſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:17958:153"/>
us, for as Chriſt did riſe, ſo all his members ſhall riſe; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let us conjoyne our ſelves to Chriſt whileſt wee live here, that ſo wee
may dye with Chriſt, and let us lay our ſelves under him in the grave, I
meane our luſts and ſinnes; and then as Chriſt roſe ſo we ſhall riſe; but if
thou doe not conjoyne thy ſelfe with Chriſt in his death, and lye under
him in the grave, then Chriſt ſhall riſe, and thou ſhalt lie ſtill in the grave;
nay, it were well if it might bee ſo, for thou ſhalt riſe againe, but Chriſt
ſhall riſe to glory, and thou to ſhame; Chriſt ſhall riſe to poſſeſſe eternall
life, and thou eternall death.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> we ſhall not onely riſe out of the grave, but we ſhall alſo riſe
out of trouble; for as there is a power of Chriſt to pull us out of the grave,
ſo there is a power of Chriſt to raiſe us out of trouble: It is an opinion in
the World, that there is a power of Chriſt to raiſe them out of the grave,
yet they doe not know that there is alſo a power of Chriſt to raiſe them
out of their troubles; but howſoever this is unknowne to the world, yet
it ſhould be knowne to a Chriſtian. To which effect the Apoſtle ſpeakes,
2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 4. 10. <hi>We alwaies beare about in our bodies the dying of the Lord Ieſus,
that the life of Ieſus might be made manifeſt in our mortall bodies.</hi> And vers. 14.
ſaith he, <hi>knowing that he which raiſed up the Lord Ieſus, ſhall raiſe us up alſo by
Ieſus, and ſhall preſent us with you.</hi> Theſe words are to be underſtood of rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
them out of trouble, to comfort them in this world: And ſo 2 <hi>Tim.</hi>
2. 9. <hi>Remember</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that Ieſus Chriſt made of the ſeede of David was raiſed
againe from the dead;</hi> Remember this you that ſuffer for good cauſes, that
as Chriſt was raiſed, ſo you ſhall be raiſed to comfort and joy out of your
troubles; ſo theſe be the reaſons why it was needefull Chriſt ſhould riſe:
Firſt, <hi>To aſſure us that our ſinnes are expiated and pardoned:</hi> Secondly, <hi>To
apply Salvation:</hi> Thirdly, <hi>To be an undoubted evidence to us, that we ſhall riſe
out of the grave, and out of our troubles in this world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2</note> The time when hee did riſe againe; <hi>and that is exactly ſet
downe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The time when hee roſe againe.</note> the third day, <hi>according as Chriſt foretold in the</hi> 2 <hi>of</hi> Iohn, I will
deſtroy this Temple, and in three daies I will build it againe, <hi>and</hi> Matth. 20 19.
<hi>the place before mentioned,</hi> and they ſhall deliver him to the Gentiles to mocke
and to ſcourge, and to crucifie him, but the third day he ſhall riſe againe; <hi>and ſo
in this place which I read unto you,</hi> that he was buried, and that hee roſe the
third day according to the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>Now there is reaſon why hee roſe no ſooner, and there is reaſon why
he roſe no later, as that being the fitteſt time for him to riſe in; of which I
will ſpeake at this time.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Reaſon 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Becauſe that it might he an evidence to the Iewes that he was truely dead:</hi>
for if he had riſen the firſt day or the ſecond,<note place="margin">Why Chriſt roſe no ſooner.</note> then they would have thought
he had beene in a trance or in a ſound onely; and therefore to cleare this
point, he did not riſe till the third day, becauſe all the hope of the pardon
of our ſinnes hangs on the death of Chriſt and all the hope of Gods favor,
and therefore he would have this point ſealed to the World: and this was
the firſt reaſon why Chriſt roſe no ſooner.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Reaſon 2.</note> 
                  <hi>That the Diſciples might have an evidence of the power of the
death of Chriſt:</hi> for there was a greater power in Chriſt to riſe againe,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:17958:153"/>
when he had beene poſſeſſed and vanquiſhed of death three dayes, than if
he had roſe the firſt day. And <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, that Chriſt did more ſhew
his power in riſing from death when they had killed him, than hee ſhould
have done if he had come downe from the Croſſe when they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ad him: ſo
there was a greater power of Chriſt ſeene in riſing the third day, than if he
ſhould have riſen the firſt day, or the ſecond, it was a greater matter that
hee ſhould recover, when all hope was paſſed; the <hi>widdowes ſonne</hi> in the
Goſpell was raiſed when he lay upon the Beere to bee carried to burying;
<hi>Entichus</hi> when he fell out of the window; and the dead man aſſoone as he
did touch the dead bones of <hi>Eliſha;</hi> but Chriſt recovered when hee had
beene three dayes together vanquiſhed of death: and this doth ſhew the
great power of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>To teach us Chriſtians patience,</hi> that if wee doe not ariſe out of
trouble the firſt day, or the ſecond, yet ſtill to waite with chriſtian patience
till the third day, that is many dayes together, till the time that God hath
appointed. Therefore if wee be not raiſed out of trouble ſo ſoone as wee
deſire, let us not murmure or grudge againſt God, and be impatient; but
quiet our ſelves with the good will of God, and waite with patience till the
time he hath appointed for our deliverance. It is the manner of the world
if they be in their troubles but a day or two, they ſay, how long Lord, how
long? as if they tarried too long; but the patience of Chriſt muſt teach
us patience, and to quiet our ſelves with the good will of God: ſo <hi>David</hi>
did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 123. <hi>As the eyes of a ſervant looke to his maſter, and the eyes of a
Mayden to her Miſtris, ſo our eyes wait on thee till thou ſhew mercie:</hi> and though
it be not to day, nor to morrow; yet we waite on thee till thou ſhew mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie:
yee remember that Chriſt Ieſus ſaid to <hi>Marie</hi> when there wanted
wine, <hi>My houre is not yet come.</hi> There be two houres; God hath his houre,
and wee have our houre; our houre is as ſoone as wee ſtand in neede but
Chriſts houre is to helpe when all meanes faile, there be many that deſire
eaſe, and peace, and comfort, but we muſt tarrie Chriſts houre, wee muſt
waite with Chriſtian patience till the third day come. So much for the
reaſons why Chriſt roſe no ſooner; now wee are come to ſpeake why hee
aroſe no later.</p>
               <p>The firſt reaſon is,<note place="margin">Three Reaſons why Chriſt roſe no later.</note> 
                  <hi>To ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>w that if he had deferred it any longer, the Iewes
might have thought that it had not beene Chriſt, but ſome other:</hi> And therefore
whiles the matter was freſh and the Souldiers about the Grave Chriſt
roſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>That the faith of the Diſciples might not faint nor ſtagger;</hi> for
we ſee <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 21. that two of them ſay, <hi>We truſted that it had beene hee that
ſhould have delivered Iſrael,</hi> and beſides all this, <hi>to day is the third day:</hi> ſo
their faith began to ſtagger, and therefore Chriſt roſe that hee might
ſtrengthen their faith: this is the great goodneſſe and kindneſſe of God to
his ſervants. In the Scripture it is ſaid, <hi>Hee remembred that we bee but duſt:</hi>
Now as Chriſt had a care of the faith of his Diſciples, ſo hee hath a care of
the faith of us Chriſtians; for hee might have deferred his riſing till wee
ſhall riſe, and then we might have doubted whether we ſhould riſe againe
or no: therefore leſt wee ſhould doubt of our reſurrection, Chriſt would
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:17958:154"/>
tarrie no longer; and ſo by this meanes to ſtrengthen our faith, that as he
aroſe at his time, ſo we ſhall ariſe at our time.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>That he might apply it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and therefore the Angels give a charge
to the woman, that ſhe ſhould goe and tell his Diſciples he was riſen.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4</note> 
                  <hi>Becauſe it was the time that God had appointed;</hi> Hee ſtirred not
the firſt day nor the ſecond, hee lay dead without motion, there was not a
word of his riſing; but when the third day came, then Chriſt roſe with
majeſtie and power, to give us comfortable hope that wee ſhall riſe one
day out of trouble: for although there bee little hope of comfort to day,
or the next day, yet when the time commeth that God hath appointed, we
ſhall have eaſe, and wee ſhall have comfort: And therefore as Chriſt was
contented to tarry his time, ſo wee muſt bee contented to tarry the time
God hath appointed for our eaſe, comfort and deliverance.</p>

               <p>Firſt, <hi>That though he died in weakneſſe, yet he roſe in power;</hi> which was ſeen
in this,<note place="margin">1</note> that hee roſe notwithſtanding all the oppoſitions the <hi>Iewes</hi> made,
for they rowled a ſtone upon the mouth of the grave, and they ſealed it,
and ſet a watch to keepe him downe, and yet he roſe in ſpight of them all:
which muſt teach us that Religion ſhall riſe, and the Goſpell ſhall riſe,
notwithſtanding all the oppoſition that is made to the contrarie, though
they rowle a great ſtone upon it,<note place="margin">Obſer. 1.</note> and labour to keepe it downe, all the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers
in Hell ſhall not prevaile againſt it, but the Goſpell ſhall riſe, and
Religion ſhall be advanced in all times: ſo we ſee in <hi>Exod.</hi> 1. that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> made lawes for the vexing and troubling of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> yet
they did increaſe and multiply; and this may bee our comfort, that as
Chriſt did riſe notwithſtanding all the oppoſitions to the contrary, ſo
Religion and the Goſpell ſhall riſe, notwithſtanding all oppoſitions that
can be made againſt it. It ſhall breake through the ſtones, an armed po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
nor all the Divels in Hell are not able to keepe it downe; ſo our ſavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our

thee in judgement, thou ſhalt condemne.</hi> As alſo the Prophet <hi>Zechary</hi> 12. 3.
ſaith, <hi>And in that day will I make Ieruſalem an heavy ſtone for all people: All that
burden themſelves with it ſhall be cut in peeces, though all the people of the earth
be gathered together againſt it:</hi> which <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaith, was a Metaphor ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from the cuſtome of the <hi>Iewes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> whoſe manner was to have a great
ſtone lie at every gate to trie their ſtrength by lifting at it, which if a man
was not able to lift, the more hee did ſtrive and ſtruggle, the more hee
cruſhed himſelfe with it; ſo the Lord will make the Church and holy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
to be ſuch a ſtone, that the more they ſtrive and ſtruggle with, the
more it ſhall cruſh them; which is a great comfort to the people of God
that religion, the Goſpell and holy profeſſion ſhall riſe in ſpight of all that
make oppoſition againſt it; <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. 2. <hi>Moſes ſaw the buſh burne, and yet not
waſte,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> becauſe God was in it; ſo all the troubles and afflictions of the
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:17958:154"/>
Church doe not waſte it, becauſe God is in the middeſt of the Church:
for as Chriſt roſe, ſo the Goſpell ſhall riſe, notwithſtanding all the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
againſt it.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> the power of Chriſts riſing, is ſeene in this, that then there
was <hi>an Earth quake,</hi> the earth did ſhake and quake; which ſhewes that
death had not taken away any of the power of Chriſt, or abated or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed
it; it was as great when he roſe, as it was before his death, we
ſee that all the great Emperours that have died were not able to ſtirre a
cloud, or to move the earth, but Chriſt did, he made the earth to quake
and tremble, Death could not keepe him under; ſo <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. Chriſt
ſaith, <hi>All power is given me in heaven and earth;</hi> and <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. 18. it is ſaid, <hi>I
am alive, but was dead; and behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and I have
the keyes of hell and death.</hi> Wee therefore ſeeing there is ſuch power in
Chriſt ſhould labour to be under his defence, and then we ſhall be ſafe
from danger; as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. <hi>My ſheepe heare my voice, they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
me, and I give them eternall life, and they ſhall never periſh, neither ſhall any
one plucke them out of my hands:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> Therefore as a man in the time of danger
runnes unto a rocke, or ſure place of defence; ſo in the time of danger,
let us runne to Chriſt, and we ſhall be ſafe from danger, by making him
our defence.</p>
               <p>Againe, the grave had detained Chriſt but three dayes, and yet wee
ſee how the earth did quake and tremble; therefore, O thou that haſt
not kept downe Chriſt three dayes together, but many dayes, how
oughteſt thou to quake! many dayes Chriſt hath beene riſing in thy
heart by the motions of his Spirit, and yet thou haſt ſuppreſſed and kept
him under; learne thou therefore of the dumbe earth that quaked and
trembled for keeping Chriſt under but three dayes; learne, I ſay, to
quake and tremble for thy great hardneſſe of heart, that haſt kept him
under,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> not dayes onely, but many yeeres together; as the three Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
<hi>Peter, Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn, Matth.</hi> 17. when they ſaw the great glory
that was put upon Chriſt in his tranſfiguration on the mount, and heard
a voice ſaying, <hi>This is my welbeloved Sonne, heare him;</hi> they fell on their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and were afraid, becauſe they had not formerly attended Chriſt, nor
regarded him as they ſhould; ſo when thou ſhalt ſee Chriſt riſe in great
power, and ſhalt ſee great glory put upon him, if thou haſt not kept him
under three dayes together only, but many dayes, how wilt thou quake
and tremble, ſeeing thou haſt not better attended nor regarded him?</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>An Angell came and miniſtred unto him;</hi> which did roule away
the ſtone, terrifie the ſouldiers, comfort the women; here we may ſee
the wicked, they roule a ſtone upon Chriſt to keepe him downe, but the
Angels take it away, they miniſter unto Chriſt; which may be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
to Chriſtians, that as the Angels miniſtred unto Chriſt, ſo they ſhall
doe ſervice to them, they ſhall take away the ſtone, dig away the earth
and moulds to pull them out of their graves, that they may come joyful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
forth, and be made partakers of everlaſting life; as <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. Chriſt
ſaith, that <hi>he will ſend forth his Angels to gather together his Elect from the
foure corners of the earth,</hi> to digge them out of the earth, to pull them out
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:17958:155"/>
of their graves, that they may ſtand comfortably before God at the laſt
day. And there is a further comfort we ſhall have by the Angels, for
they ſhall not onely helpe us out of the graves, but they ſhall alſo helpe
us out of trouble; as we ſee when <hi>Peter</hi> was in priſon, <hi>Acts.</hi> 12. it is ſaid,
<hi>And the Angell of God brought him out, and ſet him in ſafetie;</hi> ſo alſo <hi>Daniel</hi>
being caſt into the Lions den, the Lord ſent his Angell to ſtoppe their
mouthes; in like manner when <hi>Sodome</hi> was deſtroyed, the Lord ſent an
Angell to bring <hi>Lot</hi> forth, and his wife, who tooke <hi>Lot</hi> by the one hand,
and his wife by the other, and brought them out of the citie; ſo the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
doe not onely helpe us out of our graves, but doe alſo helpe us out
of troubles.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ſpeciall thing in the manner of Chriſts reſurrection was;<note place="margin">2</note>
That <hi>when he roſe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chriſt when he roſe left behinde him all Deaths ornaments.</note> 
                  <hi>he left all the ſinnes of mortalitie and death, he ſtripped him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
of all the grave-clothes, and left them behinde him;</hi> and Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith,
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 20. 7. that when the women came to the Sepulchre all the grave-clothes
were foulded up, and laid in a place; whereof there bee two
Reaſons:</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Reaſon 1.</note> that it might be an evidence to the Iewes to convince them; for
they had given mony to the ſouldiers to ſay his Diſciples came by night
and ſtole him away: Now it is like that if they had ſtollen away his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
much more they would have taken away the fine linnen ſheets hee
was wrapped in: and again, if they had ſtollen away the body of Chriſt,
they would not have laid up the linnen handſomely, they durſt not have
tarried to doe it, for in a feare men doe not things handſomely, but ill fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouredly:
therefore this is an evidence to convince the Iewes, that the
body of Chriſt was not ſtollen away.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> to teach us that when we riſe to the life of grace, that we
ſhould leave all the ſins of mortality and death behinde us, all the grave-clothes,
that is, all our vile ſinnes and old corruptions that we have long
lived in. There be many that creepe out of the grave (as it were,) get out
of ignorance, but becauſe they be not wiſe to ſhake off the ſins and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
they have lived in, have drawne them to themſelves, and have
not left behinde them the ſignes and markes of mortalitie and death;
therefore are not yet conformable to the riſing of Chriſt: It is the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
<hi>Pauls</hi> exhortation, <hi>Put off the old man, and put on the new;</hi> ye that would
riſe with Chriſt, leave your old ſinnes and your corruptions; there be
many that riſe to the profeſſion of the Goſpell, who ſtill keepe on the
grave-clothes, they will ſweare, lye, make no conſcience of their wayes,
and deale deceitfully, ſuch are not ſtripped of their grave-clothes; but
Chriſt, when he roſe, he left all the grave-clothes behinde him; ſo if we
will be conformable to him, we muſt leave all (as he did) behinde us.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>The Company Chriſt roſe with;</hi> hee roſe not alone, but a great
many did attend him;<note place="margin">The Company he roſe with.</note> as wee may reade, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27. 52. though Chriſt
died alone, yet he did not riſe alone, but he roſe with a multitude to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
him; to teach us, that his reſurrection appertaines to us, one
day all wee ſhall riſe by the ſame power that theſe did at his firſt reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection;
therefore all the people of God muſt labour to eſtabliſh their
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:17958:155"/>
hearts in this,<note place="margin">SERM. XXXI.</note> that one day they ſhall riſe out of their graves by the
power of Chriſt, for Chriſt did not riſe alone, but with a great compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny:
As in a ſhipwracke one ſwims out,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and labours to draw all his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
out with him; ſo Chriſt riſing out of the grave, did draw all his
members out with him.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> We ſee in nature, if the head be above water,
ſo long the body cannot be drowned; ſo ſeeing our body is riſen, and
our head is above, wee ſhall not ſinke or lye ſtill, but ſhall be raiſed up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.
It is an undeniable truth that others have riſen out of their graves,
but there was great difference in their riſing and Chriſts: The <hi>dead man</hi>
when hee touched <hi>Elias</hi> bones; <hi>Lazarus</hi> when hee had beene three or
foure dayes in the grave; the widdow of <hi>Naim's</hi> ſonne when hee was in
the coffin, and <hi>Eutichus</hi> when he fell out of a window; when theſe roſe
never a cloud did ſtir about them, and they roſe alone by Chriſts power,
as alſo to die againe; but Chriſt did riſe with a number and multitude
with him by his owne power, and that never to die againe; which doth
ſhew there is a great difference in their riſing; he roſe with a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
to ſhew his riſing pertaines to a great many, for hee roſe not as a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,
but as a publike perſon for the good of many, and to ſhew there is
a communicative power in his riſing from the dead.</p>

                     </gap>ſe with Chriſt;</hi> a multitude: whereof there
be two reaſons:</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That we might ſee that the benefit of Chriſts riſing is not confined to ſome
few, but to many;</hi> and therefore it is to ſet out the large hand and libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
of God in Chriſt, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. it is ſaid, <hi>That many ſhall come from
the Eaſt and Weſt, and ſhall ſit downe with Abraham, Iſaak, and Iaakob, in the
kingdome of heaven;</hi> So <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 10. it is ſaid, <hi>For it became him for whom are
all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many ſons unto glory, to make
the Captaine of their ſalvation perfect through ſufferings:</hi> Therefore Chriſt
roſe with ſo many, to ſhew that he is willing to communicate his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
to many; <hi>Eſau</hi> complained of the narrowneſſe of his fathers bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings,
but wee cannot doe ſo by Gods bleſſings, for hee extends them
largely.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> he roſe with ſo many <hi>that there might be many witneſſes of his
reſurrection,</hi> for the riſing of Chriſt from the dead being a maine pillar
of our Chriſtian faith; therefore it was requiſite that our faith might
reſt on a ſtrong foundation, there ſhould be many witneſſes of his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
               <p>I,<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> but there may a queſtion be moved, what was the reaſon that all the
Saints did not riſe with Chriſt, as well as ſome? It is a ſtrange thing that
<hi>Abraham</hi> lay ſtill in the grave, the father of the faithfull, and <hi>Iſaak</hi> and
<hi>Iaakob,</hi> and all the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and a number of other holy men,
all which died in faith; what was the reaſon then they did not riſe aſwel
as the reſt?</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer,<note place="margin">Ans.</note> that it was the wiſe counſell of God ſo to appoint
it,<note place="margin">1</note> for if all ſhould have riſen againe, then there might have beene ſome
doubt whether we that have died ſince Chriſts riſing, ſhould have roſe
againe or not; for 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 18. <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Philetus</hi> ſaid, <hi>that the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
was paſt already.</hi> Now if all had riſen, then much more Chriſtians
might have doubted of the matter; and therefore to take away this
doubt, this is the reaſon why they did not all riſe; for looke how many
dead <hi>Patriarks,</hi> and <hi>Prophets,</hi> and holy men there be that roſe not, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
pledges and pawnes there be of our reſurrection, for howſoever wee
might doubt it, in regard of our ſelves, becauſe of our ſinnes, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
there be ſo many dead Saints lye ſtill in the duſt, whom hee will
one day raiſe, we have comfortable hope that we ſhall riſe with them,
for looke how many dead bodies of the Saints there be amongſt us, ſo
many pledges and pawnes there be to us, that our bodies ſhall one day
riſe againe.</p>

Secondly, ſeeing tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſome of the Saints did riſe, and not others which
were left in the grave, and yet as good and holy men as they (nay, it may
be holier;) This may teach us a worthy point, that there is a ſpeciall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation
of God, in the dealing with ſome of the Saints; therefore every
one muſt labour to bee contented with that God doth aſſigne him. So
<hi>Numbers</hi> 12. 7. ſaith the Lord, <hi>My ſervant Moſes is not ſo, who is faithfull
in all my houſe; unto him will I ſpeake mouth to mouth:</hi> where was a ſpeicall
favour that God did ſhew to <hi>Moſes</hi> more than he ſhewed to the reſt: in

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> of his Diſciples with him
when hee was tranſfigured in the Mount; which muſt teach us that every
one muſt bee contented with his aſſignement: This is the reaſon why hee
raiſeth ſome to comfort, and leaves ſome in heavineſſe; ſome are rich, and
others are poore; ſome in ſickneſſe, and others in health; becauſe there
is a ſpeciall diſpenſation. When Chriſt had told <hi>Peter</hi> what death hee
ſhould die, and that he ſhould be crucified; <hi>Peter</hi> out of a nice curioſitie
aſketh ſtraight,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> 
                  <hi>What ſhall this man doe?</hi> Chriſt checks him and ſaith, <hi>If I
will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? follow thou me,</hi> looke thou to
thine owne calling, to thine owne dutie, follow thou me. So when wee
ſee ſuch ſpeciall diſpenſations, that ſome bee rich, and ſome poore ſome
bee in health, and ſome in ſickneſſe; ſome in eaſe, and ſome in paines;
ſome in comfort, and ſome in heavineſſe; ſome in proſperitie, and ſome
in adverſitie; and yet as holy and as good men as we, (yea, it may be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and holier than thou which art in proſperitie) when wee ſee this, I ſay,
let every one labour to bee contented with his owne eſtate, and looke to
his owne calling and dutie, let him follow Chriſt, becauſe there be divers
diſpenſations, for thou mayeſt bee in comfort, and thy brother in heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
thou mayeſt bee rich, and thy brother poore, and yet as holy and as
good as thou, nay it may be better; therefore be thou contented with thy
owne lot.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>The time when they did riſe,</hi> after Chriſts reſurrection; before
Chriſt did riſe,<note place="margin">When they did riſe.</note> though the Rockes did cleave, and the Graves open, yet
there was not a man that did ſtirre or come out of the Graves; but when
Chriſt was riſen, then well was hee that could get up with him: which
muſt teach us, that ſeeing Chriſt is riſen, wee muſt riſe: I doe not meane
that wee can riſe out of the Graves, for that wee muſt not looke to doe till
the laſt d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y; but we muſt looke to riſe out of ſinne ſpiritually to newneſſe
and holineſſe of life: therefore if Chriſt be riſen, riſe thou in thy affection.
It is <hi>Pauls</hi> exhortation, <hi>Colos.</hi> 3. 1. <hi>If Chriſt be riſen, ſeeke the things that bee
above where Chriſt is:</hi> you that be Chriſtians and hope to bee partakers of
Chriſt, doe you riſe in your affections, do not lie ſtill in your ſins, but riſe
to newneſſe and holineſſe of life.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> We ſee in experience that if the Maſter
be up, it is a ſhame for the Servant to lye ſtill; ſo ſeeing Chriſt our Maſter
is riſen, let us riſe with him to newneſſe and holineſſe of life; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let us not lie ſtill in the grave of our ſinnes, for if wee doe not riſe here
in this life with Chriſt, we ſhall not riſe with comfort at the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
I did ſhew you in the morning that when the Divell is caſt out of
a man, if he be not wiſe to hold his advantage and to ſhut him out, he will
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:17958:157"/>
make a returne againe, and he will conſult himſelfe and ſay, I have an old
friend in ſuch a place: I will returne againe to him and then he will come
<hi>with ſeven Divels worſe than himſelfe, ſo that the end of that man is worſe than
the beginning</hi> therefore as Chriſt roſe out of the grave, doe thou riſe out
of thy ſinnes, We ſee in experience if a Toyle be ſet to catch Deere, Men
drive them upon it, and ſet Dogges to hunt them in; If the Deere runne
full upon the Toyle, Men will ſay nothing; but if they runne aſide, then
they will make an outcrie againſt them; Even ſo the Divell deales with a
man,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> hee pitches his Toyles in many places, and then labours to drive a
man into them, and as it were, ſets dogges, ſubtill temptations and allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to drive him in; if the man runne headlong in his ſnares, hee ſayes
nothing, all is whiſt and quiet, but if he runne aſide and decline the way
he would have him goe in, then he cries out and makes a filthy ſtirre, and
will not be quiet till he either gets him in againe, or quite and cleane loſes
him: therefore if men be wiſe let them riſe out of their ſinnes whileſt they
live heere, and then they ſhall be partakers with Chriſt in glory hereafter,
but if we doe not riſe with him in this world in holineſſe and newneſſe of
life, wee ſhall not riſe with him in the world to come in glory and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
for evermore.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>What they did when they were riſen;</hi> they went into the holy ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and did appeare to many,<note place="margin">4</note> 
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> is called the <hi>holy citie,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
there was the meanes of holineſſe;<note place="margin">What they did being riſen.</note> and what did they there? they did
appeare to many. The <hi>Greeke</hi> word is that they did ſhew themſelves as
witneſſes of Chriſts reſurrection, of the power and of the grace of it; ſome
thinke if God would ſend ſome from the dead to teſtifie of the glory that
the godly ſhall enjoy, and of the paines that the wicked ſhall have, men
would repent of their ſinnes, and would beleeve: but the truth is, that if
men that be dead ſhould riſe, they would tell us no other things than the
Scripture doth: The Saints that did riſe, did witneſſe of the power of
Chriſts riſing, and of the grace of Chriſt; So if all the holy people ſhould
bee brought out of their graves, this it is that they would witneſſe, how
bleſſedly men ſhall riſe to glory, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 17. when Chriſt was tranſfigured
on the Mount, there appeared <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> unto him, and it is ſaid,
<hi>they talked with him:</hi> but whereof? that S. <hi>Luke</hi> telleth us, they talked of
<hi>Chriſts death,</hi> and the power of it: here wee ſee the Saints when they did
riſe teſtified of the power of Chriſts Reſurrection, and of the grace of
Chriſt; and theſe holy people (when Chriſt was tranſfigured on the
Mount) ſpake of Chriſt, of his departure, of his death and the fruites and
benefits thereof; which ſhould teach us what the conference of Chriſtians
ſhould be when they meete, to talke of Chriſt, of the grace of the Goſpell,
of the great benefits wee have by him, and of the happineſſe in the life to
come.</p>
               <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5</note> 
                  <hi>what became of them;</hi> this is a great queſtion; but (as I thinke)
cannot be better anſwered,<note place="margin">What became of thoſe who roſe.</note> than by anſwering one queſtion by another:
What became of <hi>Moſes</hi> bodie, and of the bodies of the Angels that came
to <hi>Abrahams</hi> Tent and did eate and drinke? It is an opinion amongſt
ſome Divines, that their bodies diſſolved to the ſame matter they were
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:17958:158"/>
made of, when they had done the work of God they came for, they laid
aſide their bodies, ſo why might not theſe men, when they roſe againe
and appeared, having done the worke of God they came for; have their
bodies diſſolved to duſt, their ſoules returning to the place they came
from; otherſome hold that theſe Saints aſcended into heaven with
Chriſt, but I cannot ſee how this ſhould be, becauſe there was none but
Chriſt ſeene when hee roſe againe, it is ſaid that the earth and the ſea
gave up their dead: but we doe not read that the heavens gave up their
dead.</p>
               <p>The uſe hereof is, that ſeeing the Angels and theſe Saints were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented,
when they had done the buſineſſe and the worke of God they
came for, to lay aſide their bodies, and that they ſhould diſſolve and
come to duſt againe; ſo when wee have done the worke of God wee
came for in this world, we ſhould be contented meekely and patiently
with the reſt of our brethren to lay aſide our bodies, that they may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
and come to duſt and aſhes, untill the time of the generall reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
               <p>Having ſpoken thus of the manner of Chriſts riſing, now we come
to the <hi>manifeſtation thereof;</hi> for though no man ſaw him at the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
when he roſe, yet when he was riſen hee did manifeſt himſelfe to
the world ſo farre forth as was fit; which may teach us, that although
the world doe not ſee the very inſtant or moment when we be humbled
or when wee repent,<note place="margin">1</note> and turne to God, or when wee are brought to an
eſtate of Grace; yet when we be converted and have turned unto God,
we muſt let the world ſee the fruits of our converſion; ſo (wee ſee) the
Theefe did, as ſoone as he was converted hee did ſhew the fruits of his
converſion, for hee reprooved his fellow, confeſſed his ſinnes, cleareth
Gods judgements, and pleadeth for Chriſt: ſo Saint <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith, <hi>ſhew
me thy faith,</hi> never talke thou haſt faith, unleſſe thou ſhew it, let the world
ſee it, ſhew it in thy ſpeeches, in thy actions, and in thy life, that thou art
converted and turned unto God: to this effect the ſame Apoſtle ſaith,
<hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 13. <hi>Who ſo is a wiſe man and is indued with knowledge amongſt you, let
him ſhew it, by good converſation;</hi> ſo if thou haſt repented and turned to
God, ſhew it in thy life, and in thy ſpeeches, let thy words ſhew the
fruits of it: this is that which Chriſt himſelfe exhorts to, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. <hi>Let
your light ſo ſhine before men that they may ſee your good workes and glorifie your
Father which is in heaven;</hi> for it is not enough to have light in our ſelves
but wee muſt let our light ſhine, Chriſt did riſe and no man ſaw the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
inſtant and moment, and yet when he was riſen he did manifeſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
to the world; ſo though no man ſee the inſtant when wee were
converted, yet when we be converted, we ſhould ſhew the fruits of our
converſion; for as it is in the life of nature that a man cannot have life
in him but it will appeare, either by ſtirring, breathing or panting, ſo it is
in the life of grace,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> if a man have life in him it will bee ſeene by one
meanes or other.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this may ſerve as matter of comfort, Chriſt was not ſeene
at the inſtant or moment when hee did riſe and yet did ſhew by infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:17958:158"/>
tokens that he was riſen; many an one are troubled that they know
not the very inſtant or moment of their converſion, and therefore make
queſtion of their Chriſtian calling; but this example is fit to relieve
ſuch: that although a man knowes not the very inſtant or moment when
he was converted,<note place="margin">Comfort for not knowing the moment of cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</note> yet if he can proove by infallible tokens and markes
he is converted, he may reſolve undoubtedly that he is called. We ſee
in nature that a childe hath life, and yet the mother doth not know the
inſtant ormoment of its life &amp; quickning,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> but by the ſtirrings &amp; movings
ſhee doth know there is life initiated in her childe; ſo it is in the life of
grace, there may bee life in a man though he know not the very inſtant
and moment when hee firſt received that life, yet if hee have evident
markes of it, hee may have comfort that hee is converted though hee
know not the time of it.</p>
               <p>Now there were twelve ſeverall times that Chriſt did appeare,
wherein he did manifeſt himſelfe to the world, it is too long to ſpeake
of all, therefore I will ſpeake of them that are moſt fit for our inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>There were five ſeverall times that Chriſt appeared that day hee
roſe in.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. To Mary Magdalen.</item>
                  <item>2. To the two women going from the grave.</item>
                  <item>3. To the two Diſciples going to Emmaus.</item>
                  <item>4. To Simon Peter.</item>
                  <item>5. To the Diſciples being together, onely Thomas away.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Now what is the reaſon that Chriſt appeared ſo many times that day
he did riſe on,<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> ſo that all the day long hee did appeare to one or other,
at one place, or another, to his followers, and did ſpend it in holy exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes
and in holy apparitions? I anſwere, it was to dedicate, and inſtitute
the Chriſtian <hi>Sabbath,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ans.</note> therefore Chriſt did ſo many times appeare that
day: it is a great queſtion amongſt Divines, who it was that did alter
the <hi>Sabbath;</hi> ſome thinke that it was the <hi>tradition of the Church,</hi> but it is
not the Church, nor all the Churches in the world that can alter it, it
muſt be Chriſt onely that muſt doe it: therefore he did appeare ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times that day to ſet it apart to holy uſes, by his owne example: the
Apoſtles did not inſtitute the day, nor dedicate it of themſelves, but ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
together by the divine knowledge they had, that it was Chriſts
meaning and will to teach them by his appearing ſo many times in one
day, to appoint that day for the Chriſtian Sabbath; and therefore the
Apoſtle did put it in practiſe; ſo wee ſee <hi>Act.</hi> 7. 20. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 2.
and <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. 10. where the name is given to it, as <hi>the firſt day of the
weeke,</hi> and <hi>the Lords day;</hi> whence it is manifeſt that Chriſt did dedicate
and ſanctifie the Chriſtian Sabbath, as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith well, that by the
reſurrection of Chriſt on that day it was conſecrated to be the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Sabbath.</p>
               <p>The firſt appearing was to <hi>Mary Magdalen, out of whom he caſt ſeven
devils:</hi> And there bee three things to bee obſerved in this point of his
appearing:</p>

               </list>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Firſt, why Chriſt appeared to Mary Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len.</note> 
                  <hi>The cauſe why hee did appeare to her,</hi> not becauſe ſhee was a great
ſtateſwoman, a rich woman, or a more holy woman than the reſt; for
there was <hi>Mary</hi> the Mother of Chriſt an holier woman, one would
have thought hee would have appeared to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> or to <hi>Emperours</hi> and
<hi>Kings,</hi> to Noble men and to great men of the world, or to the holieſt
and moſt ſanctified women in the world, or that he ſhould have appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to his Mother, but he did appeare firſt to <hi>Mary Magdalen, out of
whom he had caſt ſeven devils,</hi> one that was infamous and a great ſinner,
yet ſhe was penitent for her ſinnes and a true convert, as appeares in that
ſhe did ſhew ſuch ſpeciall love to Chriſt, upon her converſion, in atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
about his grave: and this was the cauſe why Chriſt appeared to
her,<note place="margin">Obſervation</note> and may teach us, that although we be not Kings and Queenes, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
men and women, nor yet the holieſt and moſt ſanctified men and
women, although we be ſinners, yet if we be repentant ſinners, and ſhew
ſpeciall love to Chriſt upon our converſion, hee will appeare to us and
we ſhall ſee his glory: therefore wouldſt thou, O man or woman, have
Chriſt appeare to thee and ſhew thee his glory, then be a repentant ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
and ſhew ſpeciall love to Chriſt upon thy converſion, and feare not
but Chriſt will appeare to thee and thou ſhalt ſee his glory. So Chriſt
ſaith, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 21. <hi>He that loveth me ſhall be beloved of my Father; and I will love
him and ſhew mine owne ſelfe unto him and dwell with him;</hi> ſo likewiſe <hi>Gen.</hi>
18. we read, that God appeared unto <hi>Abraham</hi> in ſuch a familiar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as he never did to any; no not to <hi>Adam,</hi> in the ſtate of his innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
nor to <hi>Henoch</hi> in the ſtate of excellency; and why did he appeare ſo
to <hi>Abraham?</hi> becauſe he had ſhewed ſpecially love to Chriſt, as wee
may ſee in the <hi>Chapter</hi> foregoing, that he obeyed God to the cutting off
his fleſh and the effuſion of his blood; even ſo if wee would have God
come in a familiar manner to us, to be at our tables, at our labours, and
to be in our houſes, then we muſt ſhew ſpeciall love to God in obeying
his commandements: if we repent us of our ſinnes, convert and turne
to God, and ſhew ſpeciall love to Chriſt, we are the men that ſhall enjoy
Chriſt by the eye of faith:<note place="margin">Six notes of Maries love.</note> now there bee <hi>ſix particular notes of Maries

               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>ſhe continued ſeeking when others gave over; Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> ſought
him, but when they came and ſaw nothing but the linnen clothes they
gave over, but <hi>Mary</hi> ſhe continued ſtill; wherein ſhee ſhewed ſpeciall
love to Chriſt: now in theſe two are figured two ſorts of Chriſtians,
<hi>the cold Chriſtians</hi> are figured out in <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> and the feruent Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
in <hi>Mary:</hi> the cold Chriſtian could be contented to have Chriſt,
but if he be gone, he cannot helpe it, he ſeekes but coldly to finde him:
O but the fervent Chriſtian, if he cannot finde him the firſt or the ſecond
day, hee will never give over till hee have found him: this is a ſpeciall
argument of true love; ſo the Church doth, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3. ſhe never gives over
ſeeking till ſhe have found him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="307" facs="tcp:17958:159"/>
Secondly, that <hi>ſhee ſought him with teares, and weepes for the loſſe of him:</hi>
ſo when we can weepe for the loſſe of Chriſt, and of Gods favour, this
is a note of true love, wee ſee how <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> could weepe for
the loſſe of Chriſt, the Angell aſked her what ſhe ailed? ſaith ſhe, Doe
you aſke me what I aile? <hi>they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where
they have laid him;</hi> hee in whom I have laid up all my hope and all my
comfort and joy; ſo wee may ſay by our ſinnes, if any aſke us why wee
weepe, we may reply, our ſinnes have taken away the comfortable fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of Gods favour, they have taken away Chriſt from me, he in whom
I have laid up all my joy and all my comfort and hope; and have I not
cauſe to weepe? therefore it is a pitifull thing that a man can weepe for
the loſſe of a wife, or a childe, or a ſonne, or ſome worldly wealth, or
becauſe he is ſicke and wants health, but will never weepe for the loſſe
of Chriſt, and for the want of Gods favour, it is ſaid of a learned Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that there bee no teares ſo acceptable with God as the teares that
be ſhed for ſinne, for all other teares that be ſhed for worldly loſſes fall
to the ground, but theſe teares are kept in a Bottle.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note>

that is the place where they may have hope of finding of him, they

the <hi>Elephant</hi> that although he cannot ſwimme as other beaſts can, yet he

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Declared the laſt day, that Chriſts firſt appearing
was to <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> out of whom was caſt ſeven
devils, who had beene infamous, and a very great ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
but was become a convert, and a repentant ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and had ſhewed ſpeciall love to Chriſt upon her
converſion and repentance, in attending about the
grave; and therefore, although ſhe was none of the
great gallants of the world, nor yet the holieſt and moſt ſanctified wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
yet becauſe ſhe was a repentant ſinner, and ſhewed great love to
Chriſt, therefore Chriſt did firſt appeare to her. I will ſhew you ſix par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
wherein <hi>Mary</hi> did ſhew her love to Chriſt:</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> that ſhe continued ſeeking, when others, <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> gave
over.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> in that ſhe wept and mourned for the loſſe of Chriſt, when
others went away without mourning and weeping. We ſee in nature,
if one comes to a birdſ-neſt,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and take away her young ones, the bird
will flie about the neſt, take on, and in ſome ſort bewaile the loſſe of her
young, but the Devill may come and catch away the graces of Chriſt,
repentance, faith, patience, the comfortable feeling of Gods favour,
with the hope of heaven, and yet thou never weepeſt for the loſſe of
theſe; therefore it is a good thing, when a man hath loſt theſe graces, if
he can bewaile them: It is ſaid of <hi>Ioſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> when they had loſt
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:17958:160"/>
Chriſt,<note place="margin">SERM. XXXII.</note> they ſought him with heavie hearts; even ſo when a man hath
loſt the comfortable feeling of Gods favour, and the graces of Chriſt,
he ſeekes for them, and doth weepe in regard of the loſſe of them, this
is a true note of true love to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> in that ſhee bowed downe into the Sepulchre, and looked
here and there, if by any meanes ſhee could finde Chriſt. Of theſe wee
have ſpoken alreadie, now to proceed.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4</note> 
                  <hi>Her true love to Chriſt is ſeene by the continuance of her complaint.</hi>
For notwithſtanding ſhe had ſeene the comfortable ſight of Angels, the
one ſitting at the head, the other at the feet of the Sepulchre (ſhewing
that they were not onely ready to attend the head, but alſo to miniſter
to the meaneſt of the members of Chriſt) who gave her comfortable
ſpeeches, aſking why ſhee wept, as if they ſhould ſay to her, Indeed, if
Chriſt ſhould lye ſtill trampled and trodden under-foot of death, if thy
ſinnes were yet upon him, and held him under, there might be cauſe for
it; but Chriſt hath riſen from the dead, and hath vanquiſhed and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Death, Hell, and the Devill, and therefore thou haſt no cauſe to
weepe: yet for all this ſight ſhe had ſeene, and for all thoſe good ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
the Angels could not give her comfort, till ſhe had the thing ſhee
ſought for; So if a man have true love to Chriſt, it is not all the Angels
can give him comfort till he finde Chriſt, and feele the comfortable aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance
of the pardon of his ſins, and the hope of Gods favour, nothing
will make him glad till then; as <hi>Mary</hi> complaines to the Angels, and
ſayes,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> 
                  <hi>They have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him,</hi>
in whom I have laid up all my joy and comfort, all my hope, and all my
delight; ſo a Chriſtian may complaine and ſay, My ſinnes have taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
Chriſt from me, they have taken away the comfortable feeling of
Gods favour,<note place="margin">Note.</note> the hope of heaven. We marvell that the good ſpeeches
that Preachers and good Chriſtians give to a man in diſtreſſe doe not
comfort him, but it is no marvell, for the Angels cannot doe it, till a man
be poſſeſſed with Chriſt; therefore no marvell that good Preachers and
good Chriſtians cannot give them comfort; it is a pitifull thing, that a
number when they have loſt Chriſt, every little matter will comfort
them, they need not have Angels ſent from heaven, for a few angels of
gold will doe it.</p>
               <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5</note> 
                  <hi>The divulgation of her complaint;</hi> ſhee complaines to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
and ſhe complaines to Chriſt, thinking he had beene the Gardener,
ſhe was not aſhamed that hee ſhould know, that the cauſe of her heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
ſorrow and weeping, was for Chriſt; this is a certaine note of true
love to Chriſt, when we are not aſhamed to let the world know, or ſee,
that the cauſe of our ſorrow and heavineſſe is, becauſe wee have loſt
Chriſt by our ſins, and the comfortable feeling of Gods favor: So in the
<hi>Canticles,</hi> when the Church had loſt Chriſt, ſhe runs thorow the ſtreets
and lanes to ſee whether ſhe could finde him, ſhe was not aſhamed to let
the world know that the matter of her griefe and ſorrow was becauſe
ſhe had loſt Chriſt; ſo afterwards ſhe layes out for Chriſt; <hi>If yee meet my
love, tell him that I am ſicke of love;</hi> ſhee was not aſhamed to let the world
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:17958:161"/>
know that ſhe was ſicke of love; ſo when it is thus with a man, that hee
is not aſhamed to let the world know and ſee that the matter of his ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
and griege is, becauſe he hath loſt the comfortable feeling of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
of his ſins and of Gods favour; this is a note of true love to Chriſt;
<hi>Hebr.</hi> 2. 11. it is ſaid, <hi>that he was not aſhamed to call them brethren,</hi> therefore
if he be not aſhamed of us, let us never be aſhamed of him: Indeed there
is good cauſe, why he ſhould bee aſhamed of us, there is ſuch a deale of
corruption and ſin in us; therefore he might be aſhamed of us (eſpecially
when hee ſhall ſtand before God in judgement.) Now if Chriſt bee not
aſhamed of us, let us never be aſhamed of him; for if we be aſhamed of
him before men, he will be aſhamed of us before God, and all the holy
Angels.</p>
               <p>The ſixth note of true love which ſhe bare to Chriſt was,<note place="margin">6</note> 
                  <hi>the ſtrange
proffer ſhe made to Chriſt: Tell mee</hi> (ſaith ſhe) <hi>where thou haſt laid him, and I
will take him away,</hi> if he be never ſo deepe, if it be never ſo far, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to take any paines to have him; this is a ſtrange proffer which ſhe
makes beyond her power and abilitie, her weake armes were not able to
carry Chriſt, but herein ſhe ſhewes her true love to him; ſo when a man
is contented to take any paines or labour to goe thorow it, be it never ſo
farre, if he can finde Chriſt is contented; this is a note of true love to
Chriſt, for <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 37. our Saviour ſaith, that <hi>where the dead bodies be, thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Eagles will reſort:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> As the Eagles when they ſent a dead body,
they will flie many a mile to it; ſo we ſhould (like the Eagles) get a ſent
of the dead body of Chriſt, and be contented to goe many miles, take
any paines and labour that we might have Chriſt: <hi>Ioh.</hi> 21. when the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples
were a fiſhing,</hi> Chriſt came and appeared to them, upon which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
<hi>Peter</hi> launches into the water,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> the ſhip could not hold him, but he
leapes into the ſea, to come to Chriſt; ſo when we know that Chriſt is
to be found in the uſe of good meanes, in the preaching of the Word,
nothing ſhould keepe us from thence: <hi>Mary</hi> was content beyond her
ſtrength and ability to ſeeke Chriſt; ſo we ſhould ſhew our love to him
above our ſtrength and abilitie, as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. it is ſaid of the <hi>Macedonians,</hi>
that <hi>to their power, and beyond their power, they were willing;</hi> And as he ſayes,
<hi>Pſa.</hi> 119. <hi>Thou haſt commanded me to keep thy Precepts diligently, O that my heart
were directed to keep thy Statutes;</hi> I cannot do as I would, but would to God
my heart were directed to keepe thy Statutes: <hi>David</hi> had no ſtrength
to doe as he would, but he deſires it above his ſtrength; ſo ſhould we.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>The manner how Chriſt did appeare to her;</hi> He ſhewed himſelfe
ſtrange a long time,<note place="margin">The manner how Chriſt ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>peared to her.</note> and held her in ſuſpence, and yet <hi>Mary</hi> ſought for
Chriſt, and ſought for him, when others gave over, with teares; which
may teach us, <hi>that many a good Chriſtian may ſeeke for Chriſt with teares, that
is,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Note.</note> 
                  <hi>in truth of affection, and yet not preſently finde him:</hi> they may ſeeke long,
and attend upon the meanes; but as Chriſt did appeare to <hi>Mary,</hi> ſo in
due time thou ſhalt ſee him to thy comfort.</p>
               <p>Now there were two cauſes why Chriſt did not appeare to <hi>Mary,</hi> nor
ſhew himſelfe to her preſently:<note place="margin">Two cauſes why Chriſt put off Mary ſo long.</note>

thought it had beene the Gardiner; Hee did not appeare in ſuch a forme,
but <hi>Marie</hi> thought ſo, ſhe did ſo ſorrow and mourn for Chriſt, that though
he were before her, ſhe could not ſee him; it was through her owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault:
ſo God many times gives comfort to us, when through our owne
default we ſee not the comfort that is before us, through the ſorrow and
griefe wee ſuſtaine: but refuſe it when it is offered; and this is the cauſe
why it is ſo long<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ere ſome can receive comfort: As <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77. <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>My
ſoule refuſed comfort:</hi> ſo it is with Chriſtians many times, God offereth
comfort to them, and they refuſe it; this is the eſtate of the beſt: ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
Chriſt appeared to the World, when through their owne default
they could not ſee him, through the blindneſſe and ignorance that remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in them even to this day: they ſee not though hee ſpeakes unto them
day by day, they have not the eyes of Faith to ſee him. This is the eſtate
of the World, though God ſpeakes unto them they know it not, they
thinke it is the Gardiner, they thinke it is the voyce of a Man, and not of
God, but the true Church of Chriſt knowes when Chriſt is ſpeaking unto
her, <hi>It is the voyce of my welbeloved:</hi> ſo Chriſt no ſooner ſpeakes but they
know it, but the greateſt part of the world doe not ſo, though hee ſpeakes
unto them from day to day, Chriſt appeares unto them, and through
their owne default they doe not ſee him.</p>
               <p>The ſecond cauſe was,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>Through a ſpeciall diſpenſation, that ſhee might the
more repent of her ſinnes and make a triall of her faith,</hi> to make the preſent
more comfortable: as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> made himſelfe ſtrange to his brethren a long
time,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and afterward did reveale himſelfe unto them: ſo though Chriſt
make himſelfe ſtrange, and hold us in ſuſpence for a time, it is becauſe hee
would have our faith tried, and becauſe wee might have the greater com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
when we finde him.</p>
               <p>Now though he held himſelfe a long time in ſuſpence, yet Chriſt did
diſcover himſelfe by a word for he ſaith, <hi>Marie,</hi> and ſhe turned about and
ſaid <hi>Rabboni, Maſter:</hi> ſo it was but a word of Chriſt that gave comfort, he
can doe it by a word, hee can make all our diſcomforts to ceaſe, and give
comfort with a word. Thus wee ſee <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. that the <hi>Centurion</hi> ſaid to
Chriſt, <hi>Doe but ſpeake the word, and thy ſervant ſhall be whole;</hi> If Chriſt doe
but ſpeake a word, his wiſedome is to lay hold on that word; which muſt
teach us that wee muſt catch hold on every little word of Chriſt. I have
ſhewed you heretofore that it is the nature of the Vine to catch hold on
every little ſticke, or on every little thing with his twigs to lift up himſelfe;<note place="margin">Simile.</note>
ſo a Chriſtian muſt lay hold on every little word of Chriſt to help him by.
But it is a pittifull thing that one word of Chriſt will not ſerve, nor all the
words of Chriſt, nor the mercies, nor the judgements of God to turne us
to him: as <hi>Marie</hi> catched hold on every little word, ſo it muſt bee our
wiſedome to lay hold on the leaſt word that may bring us to Chriſt: From
hence two things are to be conſidered.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>That true faith doth lay hold on every little word of Chriſt:</hi> It is like
the Vine that layeth hold on every little ſticke and poſt with his keyes and
clanvers to lift up himſelfe;<note place="margin">Conſideration.</note> ſo true faith will lay hold on every little means
to lift up it ſelfe, if it be but a word it will lay hold on it: as wee ſee <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:17958:162"/>
Chriſt ſaith to his mother <hi>Marie, Woman my houre is not yet come;</hi> ſhe layes
hold on this word of Chriſt, and ſaith to the ſervants, <hi>whatſoever hee bids
you doe, that doe you,</hi> and you ſhall not want wine, ſo <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. It was but
a word that Chriſt ſpake to the woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and a ſowre word too,
yet the poore woman catches hold of it: ſo in the booke of <hi>Kings</hi> when
<hi>Benhadads</hi> ſervants came unto the king, they catched hold on every word;
thus where there is true faith it will lay hold on every little word of Chriſt:
therefore when men cannot catch hold on one word of Chriſt, nor all
the words of Chriſt: this doth ſhew the dulneſſe and deadneſſe of mens
hearts. It is ſaid, <hi>Ionah</hi> 2. <hi>They which follow lying vanities, forſake their owne
mercies:</hi> and there is great mercie offered in the Word, in the preaching
of the Goſpell; but they which deſpiſe and refuſe it, deſpiſe and forſake
this great mercy that is offered unto them.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing is,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>The infinite comfort that a Chriſtian hath after hee
findes Chriſt:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Conſideration.</note> Heaven and Earth cannot give that comfort that a Chriſtian
hath after he hath found him. Therefore although it coſt a man ſore travell
and labour, and a great deale of paines, yet hee thinkes his labour well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
if he can finde him at laſt: ſo we ſee in <hi>Marie</hi> that ſhe ſought Chriſt
and ſought him with teares, and yet when ſhe had found him, how joyfull
was ſhe, ſaying <hi>Rabboni, Maſter,</hi> thou art the man I ſought for, thou, thou
art he I did long for: ſo <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 41. <hi>Andrew</hi> ſaith to <hi>Simon Peter, we have found
the Meſſias,</hi> and the wiſe men, <hi>Matth.</hi> 2. when they had found Chriſt <hi>they
rejoyced exceedingly;</hi> therefore whatſoever paines a Chriſtian takes to ſeeke
Chriſt, if once hee have found him, the World cannot make him ſo glad,
he thinkes all his paines and labours well beſtowed.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> If a man finde a bag
of gold how glad will he be, but all the gold in the World is not like to it,
the Apoſtle counteth all things dung and droſſe in regard of it; It is like
<hi>the pearle that the Merchant went and ſold all that he had to buy the field</hi> where
the Pearle was.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> the end why Chriſt did Manifeſt himſelfe to <hi>Marie,</hi> was two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold:<note place="margin">The end why Chriſt did ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt himſelfe to Marie.</note>

               <p>Firſt, theſe words, <hi>touch me not,</hi> are words of information and of inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to her, for ſhee would have imbraced Chriſt, but Chriſt refuſed her.
Now this is ſtrange that <hi>Marie</hi> had ſought ſo long for Chriſt, and ſought
him with teares, and now finding him, he forbids her to touch him: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
theſe words are words of inſtruction, wherein are two limitations.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, <hi>Noli me tangere, touch mee not now, for I am not yet aſcended,</hi>
there will be time enough hereafter, but now I have a more needfull duty
for you to doe: Goe and tell my brethren that I am riſen, for the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
were at the grave, and ſaw nothing but the grave-clothes, therefore
they went away with a conceit that ſome body had ſtollen away Chriſt,
taken away his body, and ſo their faith was in danger, and if it ſhould bee
longer held in ſuſpence, might bee ſore ſhaken, if not utterly ruined: and
therefore it was, that <hi>Marie</hi> muſt be ſent in ſuch poſt to acquaint them with
his riſing, and may not ſtay the time to touch Chriſt: now though it were
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:17958:162"/>
a good thing to doe ſo, yet ſhee muſt preferre this more needfull thing.
Firſt, <hi>goe and tell his Diſciples that hee was riſen:</hi> which muſt teach us, that we
muſt apply our ſelves to the duty that God cals us too: there bee many
examples of it in the Scripture, as <hi>Ioſ.</hi> 7. 10. Hee humbled himſelfe, faſted
and prayed unto the Lord, <hi>and the Lord ſaid unto Ioſhua, Vp Ioſhua,</hi> what
doſt thou there? I have another dutie for thee to doe, it is a good thing
indeed to faſt and pray, but I will not have thee to doe it now, I have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſervice and dutie for thee to doe; there is an execrable thing commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
goe and finde it out. And ſo <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. Chriſt bids the man to <hi>follow
him;</hi> but hee will firſt goe and bury his father, though Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Let the
dead bury the dead, but follow thou mee.</hi> It is a good thing to bury ones fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but <hi>Chriſt calls him</hi> to another duty, therefore it was not needfull
then to doe it.</p>
               <p>To make uſe of it to ouer ſelves,<note place="margin">1</note> it is a good thing to performe the duties
of our calling, to buy and ſell, to bargaine, plant and to ſow, and ſuch like,
but when the <hi>Sabbath</hi> day commeth doe it not, then God calleth us to doe
duties of Prayer, repentance, hearing of the Word, receiving of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
and ſuch like; ſo it is a good thing to read on a good booke, or
in the Scripture; but when we come to Church, God calls us to another
duty, to heare, to pray with the Miniſter, and therefore doe it not.</p>
               <p>The ſecond limitation is,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>Noli me tangere, Touch me not ſo:</hi> touch me
not with the hands of thy body, but touch mee with <hi>The hands of thy faith;</hi>
it was <hi>Thomas</hi> his reſolution, <hi>Vnleſſe I touch him with my hands, and put my
fingers into his ſide, I will not beleeve:</hi> Chriſt replies, <hi>Thomas, becauſe thou
haſt ſeene mee, thou haſt beleeved; Bleſſed are they that have not ſeene, and yet
have beleeved, Ioh.</hi> 20. 29. It is a good thing to touch Chriſt with the hands
of our bodies, O but it is a bleſſeder thing to touch him with the hand of
our faith; hence we learne, That to enioy Chriſts bodily preſence is not ſo
great a thing as to apprehend him by the hand of our faith: <hi>Auguſtine</hi>
(ſpeaking of the <hi>woman</hi> that had the <hi>bloody iſſue</hi>) ſaid, There were a number
of people that did throng and thruſt Chriſt, but they drew no vertue out
of him, ſhee onely did, and that by a touch of her faith: therefore it is a
more bleſſed thing to touch Chriſt with the hand of faith, than with the
hand of our body; there bee a number thinke, that unleſſe they touch
Chriſt, and feele him, and handle him, it is nothing, I, but doe thou labour
to touch Chriſt by the hand of Faith, and this will be of force to draw ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
from him.</p>
               <p>The ſecond end was,<note place="margin">The ſecond end of his appearance to Mary.</note> 
                  <hi>to ſend comfort to his Diſciples;</hi> for Chriſt did not
onely dye for them and us, but when hee had done, he tooke care to apply
it; this is the great goodneſſe and mercy of Chriſt not only to dye for us,
but alſo to apply his death to us. Now in this ſending of <hi>Mary</hi> wee may
obſerve three things:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>The party that did cary it:</hi> It was <hi>Mary.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. Vnto whom: To his brethren.</item>
                  <item>3. The meſſage it ſelfe: That I aſcend to my Father and to your
Father, to my God and your God.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> 
                  <hi>who it was that carried it, Mary:</hi> but why did not Chriſt goe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe?
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:17958:163"/>
I anſwere, it was to finde them the more humbled for their ſinnes
and their offences:<note place="margin">Anſ. 1.</note> It was a great wiſedome in Chriſt and a ſingular diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation
to ſend <hi>Mary,</hi> for what might the <hi>Diſciples</hi> thinke of it, that
Chriſt had appeared to <hi>Mary,</hi> and had not appeared to them. Thus, wee
be unworthy of his company, wee have ſo often denyed and forſaken him:
therefore that he might finde them the more humbled for their ſinnes and
their offences, he ſent <hi>Mary:</hi> In like manner when wee ſee others receive
comfort againſt their ſinnes and we cannot; others be in peace, and we bee
not, what may we thinke? but what we be unworthy of it, therefore that we
may be the more humbled for our ſinnes and offences, and the fitter to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him, Chriſt doth deferre his comfort from us, as 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19. when <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi>
was in the cave, there came firſt <hi>a whirlewind,</hi> then <hi>an earthquake,</hi> then <hi>a
fire,</hi> then <hi>a ſtill and ſoft voyce,</hi> where God was; why did God come thus with
a whirlewinde, an earthquake, and fire; it was to make the Prophet the
more humbled when he came, and the more fit to receive the charge that
was to be impoſed upon him: ſo <hi>Act.</hi> 9. when Chriſt came unto <hi>Paul,</hi> hee
flung him off his horſe, and ſtroke him with blindeneſſe that hee might
make him the more humbled for his ſinnes and his offences, and the fitter
to receive the charge which ſhould be given him.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Anſ. 2.</note> to ſhew how ready wee ſhould bee to communicate good
things one to another, for when we have received any good, we ſhould be
ready to impart it to another: We ſee the little birds, when they have got
a worme they fly home to their yong ones, and make them partakers with
them; ſo when wee have gotten any good thing, we ſhould carry it home
and make our families partakers of it:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> As naturally the Sunne caſts his
light on the Moone, and Stars, and the Moone and Starres caſts it downe
againe on the earth; ſo all the light of knowledge that is caſt upon us we
ſhould caſt upon our brethren: and as Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Mary, Goe tell my
brethren,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſo I ſay to you, Go and tell your friends, your acquaintance, your
neighbours, and your owne children and families the good things that
God hath revealed unto you.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Anſ. 3.</note> to inſtruct the diſciples which were the doctors and paſtors of
the Church: <hi>Mary</hi> was but a poore woman, and yet ſhee did informe
them of one of the greateſt myſteries of Salvation, the Reſurrection of
Chriſt: which may teach us how meane ſoever the perſon be not to deſpise
to learne any good of them, ſo we ſee <hi>Exod.</hi> 18. that <hi>Moſes</hi> was contented
to take the counſell of <hi>Iethro</hi> his father in law, one that was infinitely ſhort
of the gifts and graces of <hi>Moſes;</hi> ſo alſo. <hi>Acts</hi> 18. <hi>Apollos</hi> was inſtructed
by <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla,</hi> poore Tent-makers: therefore it muſt bee the
wiſedome and humilitie of a Chriſtian to take good by the meaneſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
that may be.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>whom ſhee muſt tell; his brethren:</hi> this is a ſtrange thing that
Chriſt calls them his brethren,<note place="margin">Whom ſhe muſt tell.</note> he might have ſaid, Goe and tell my Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
my revolters, backſliders, and ſuch as have denied, and forſaken mee;
yet wee ſee the goodneſſe and kindeneſſe of Chriſt that hee puts a ſpeciall
tearme of dignity upon them, <hi>Go and tell my brethren,</hi> partakers of the ſame
glory and immortality with mee: whereas hee might have ſaid, One of
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:17958:163"/>
them did betray me, and another denied mee, and all of them did ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
forſake me, yet he is contented to ſwallow up all, becauſe though they
had ſinned, yet they ſinned of weakeneſſe, they had repented for it, and
wept bitterly, therefore Chriſt ſends ſuch ſweete termes and cals them
brethren: Which may teach us that although wee fall into great ſinnes, if
we fall of weakeneſſe, and if we have repented for it, hee will take us for his
brethren; we ſee in experience that although a man turnes his backe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Sunne,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and is going from it, yet the Sunne followes him with his
heate, light and with his beames: ſo when we turne our backes on God,
and are going away from him, yet he followes us with his beames of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
kindeneſſe, and with his love, though we forſake him yet he doth not
forſake us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3</note> what the meſſage was that ſhee ſhould tell his brethren; That I aſcend
to my Father and your Father,<note place="margin">What her meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage was.</note> to my God and your God: <hi>From hence ariſeth
a twofold comfort.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">A twofold Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, firſt from his aſcenſion.</note> 
                  <hi>Goe and tell my brethren that I aſcend:</hi> what, is this ſuch a comfort
that Chriſt aſcends, that he goes away and leaves them? yea, it is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
and a great comfort too; as appeares,</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> becauſe hee is aſcended to Heaven as a pledge and pawne to take
poſſeſſion, and to prepare our place till we come there: As <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith,
the Head going before, all his Members ſhall follow: Chriſt aſcended as
a pledge and pawne to hold poſſeſſion for us: So <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. 2. 3. <hi>I go to to prepare
a place for you, and if I goe to prepare a place for you, I will come againe and take
you up to my ſelfe, that where I am, there you may be alſo:</hi> So it is a comfort to
a Chriſtian to know that Chriſt as aſcended. Secondly, it is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
to know that Chriſt is aſcended for our good,<note place="margin">2</note> to befriend us in
the Court of Heaven, to procure the graces of his Spirit, to reconcile
us unto God, and to make Interceſſion for us; therefore howſoever ſome
men may thinke it to bee a great comfort to have Chriſt on the Earth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
us, yet it is a farre greater comfort that Chriſt is aſcended into
Heaven to procure the graces of his Spirit, to reconcile us unto God, as
our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Iohn</hi> 16. 7. <hi>It is expedient for you, that I go away,</hi> to reconcile
you to God, to procure the graces of his Spirit, to make interceſſion for
you: Therefore, it is a comfort unto us, that Chriſt is aſcended to Heaven.</p>
               <p>The ſecond comfort is,<note place="margin">Secondly, from his going to our Father.</note> that Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Hee aſcended to my Father and
to your Father, to my God and your God;</hi> For when wee know the Father of
Chriſt, is become our Father; and the God of Chriſt is become our God;
by the meanes of him, wee cannot chuſe but hee comforted: There was a
time when God was our enemy, by reaſon of our ſinnes; but now Chriſt
ſaith, <hi>I aſcend to my Father, and to your Father, to my God, and your God:</hi>
therefore this is a great comfort that wee have ſuch a Father as is able to
bleſſe us, and to doe us good; for ſeeing he is become our Father, He will
make a ſupply of all our wants, as ſhall bee needfull for us. A Chriſtian
may ſay, Lord Ieſus doe thou aſcend into Heaven to hold a place for mee
againſt I come, to procure the graces of thy Spirit, to reconcile mee unto
God, to make interceſſion for mee, and then I ſhall bee happie. And thus
wee ſee it is for the good of Chriſtians that Chriſt is aſcended.</p>

                  <q>And behold, two of them went that ſame day to a

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Welve ſeverall times Chriſt did manifeſt himſelfe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his reſurrection, five whereof were in one day.
The firſt was to <hi>Marie Magdalen:</hi> The ſecond, <hi>To the
women comming from the grave.</hi> Of theſe two wee
have ſpoken, and are come to the third, <hi>to theſe two
Diſciples going to Emmaus;</hi> In which manifeſtation
there are diverſe things to be conſidered:</p>
               <p>Firſt, what diſpoſition Chriſt did finde them in, laid downe in two
circumſtances.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>That they went to a Towne called Emmaus, that was about threeſcore
furlongs off Ieruſalem:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Circumſtance.</note> They did not attend the grave and ſeeke for Chriſt
(as <hi>Marie</hi> did) but they were going away from him and from <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> as
men cleane out of heart. Here we are to conſider the kindneſſe and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of Chriſt, that he did not onely manifeſt himſelfe to them that ſought
him and did attend the grave, but to them alſo that did go away from him;
ſo wee ſee the diſciples were in another condition, they heard a brute of
Chriſts riſing, yet they were not wiſe to nouriſh this ſame ſparke, but they
were as men out of hope, and yet Chriſt goes after them and leaves them
not, till hee had brought them home to the companie of beleevers. So
here is the goodneſſe and kindneſſe of Chriſt not onely to manifeſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
to thoſe that ſeeke him and attend upon good meanes, but alſo to
thoſe that goe away, and have not a thought of him: ſo we ſee <hi>Iohn</hi> 7. the
woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> that came to draw water, ſhee had not a thought of
Chriſt, and yet he did manifeſt himſelfe unto her: and <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 8. the <hi>Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards</hi>
were tending their flockes by night, they had not a thought of
Chriſts comming; but the Angels came unto them, and told them that
Chriſt was borne, when they looked not for it: ſo alſo <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. when <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi>
was about his bagges and his money matters, he had not a thought of
Chriſt, yet then he called him: Here wee may ſee it is Gods mercie to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
us with his love, when wee have not a thought of him, but are buſie
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:17958:164"/>
about our profits and pleaſures,<note place="margin">SERMON XXXIII.</note> then he ſeekes us and brings us home un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
himſelfe, even when we are going from him: as (in the compariſon I
ſhewed you a little before) though a man turne his backe upon the Sunne,
and goe away from it, yet the Sunne followes him with his heat, light,
and beames, ſo when we are going away from Chriſt, he followes us with
his kindneſſe, and followes us with his goodneſſe and mercie: ſo Chriſt
did manifeſt himſelfe to theſe two Diſciples when they were going from
him, therefore let us thinke of the kindneſſe and goodneſſe of Chriſt. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay</hi>
55. ſaith the Lord, <hi>I was found of them that ſought me not:</hi> It is a great
mercy of God, that he will be found of them that ſeeke him, but a greater
mercy that when men goe away from him and have not a thought of him,
then he to ſeeke after them.</p>
               <p>The ſecond circumſtance is,<note place="margin">2</note> that although they were going from Chriſt
and from <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Circumſtance</note> yet <hi>they were talking of him</hi> by the way, there was ſome
ſparkes and ſeeds of goodneſſe left. Now this Towne they went to was
not a Towne of Religion, though a Countrie Towne, and it is very like
that they went about country buſineſſe, yet as they went by the way they
talked of Chriſt: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> worldly buſineſſe, going to a Faire, or
to a Market or any other journey. We read 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 2. 11. when <hi>Elias</hi> and
<hi>Eliſha</hi> went together, they <hi>went walking and talking till a firie Chariot came
and parted them,</hi> tooke away <hi>Elias</hi> and left <hi>Eliſha</hi> on his calling. And what
were they talking of? not of money matters but of immortalitie and of
Heavenly things: ſo in the <hi>Acts,</hi> when the <hi>Eunuch</hi> was on his way riding
in his Chariot, and had no body to talke with, hee puls out his Bible, and
would have God to talke with him: and to this end <hi>Deuter.</hi> 6. 7. wee have
a Commandement from God to ſpeake of his Word,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> 
                  <hi>When wee riſe, when
we lie downe, when we goe by the way, and when we be at our meate.</hi> Thus <hi>Pſal.</hi>
37. 30. <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>The mouth of the righteous will ſpeake of wiſedome, and his
talke will be of judgement;</hi> and he gives a reaſon of it, <hi>becauſe the Law of God
is in his heart:</hi> ſo a righteous mans mouth will ſpeake of good things, hee
will be talking of Religion.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> If a man have a Spring in his ground hee can
hardly hold it but it breakes foorth into other grounds: in like manner if
there be a ſpring of grace and of goodneſſe in a mans heart, he cannot hold
it, but it will breake foorth and flow out to others: therefore, when men
goe up and downe and never ſpeake of the Word, it ſhewes there is not a
Spring of grace in them. It is a good thing for a Chriſtian to talke of
Chriſt, and of the worke of Redemption, and of the great things that God
hath prepared for them, even when they are about their worldly buſineſſe
and labors; and if it be a good thing to ſpeake of Chriſt and of the Word
when we be about our labors and buſineſſe, then it is much better to talke
of the Word when we come from a Sermon, and from hearing the Word
preached on the Sabbath day, or at other times. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 8. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. It is ſaid,
<hi>The people rejoyced that they had heard the law read unto them,</hi> and that they
did underſtand the ſenſe of it:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſo when wee heare the Word of God prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
we ſhould goe away rejoycing that we have heard it, and underſtood

<pb n="316" facs="tcp:17958:165"/>
they went in Troopes, and a great company together, the reaſon was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they might ſpeake of the good things that they had heard: ſo it is a
Chriſtians dutie to goe in companies together,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> to conferre of the good
things they have heard. We ſee when men come from the Sea, they will
ſpeake of the Sea,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> or from the Warre, they will ſpeake of the Warre; or
from the Market, they will talke of the Market: and if men have beene at
their worke, they will talke of their worke; but many times wee goe to a
Sermon, and ſpeake not a word of that: the Marriner may ſpeake of the
Sea, the Souldier of his Warre, the Huſbandman of his Markets; but it is
a pittifull thing that Chriſtians will not ſpeake of the good things they
have heard out of the Word of God: There be three cauſes why men doe
not ſpeake of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The firſt,</hi>

                     </gap>
                  </note> a prophane contempt of God and goodneſſe,<note place="margin">Cauſes why men delight not to ſpeake of the word.</note> becauſe they deſire to
have as little to doe with him as may be: <hi>as the divels,</hi> Matth. 8. 29. <hi>cryed
out and ſaid,</hi> What have wee to doe with thee Ieſus thou Sonne of God? <hi>ſo they
ſay,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>What have we to doe with God and goodneſſe? and as in</hi> Iob 21. 15.

               <p>The ſecond is,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>want of caution;</hi> that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

                  </gap> watchfull over their
wayes, but ſuffer a great deale of idle ſpeech to come from them, as the
waſte water of a conduit; for many men doe not conſider that they ſhall
anſwere for every idle word, not onely for the bad words, but for the idle
alſo that tend to no good end.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> Wee ſee in a conduit, there is not onely a
pipe to let out the water, but a cocke alſo to hold it in; ſo we muſt have a
cocke, as it were, to keepe in our ſpeeches; therefore as <hi>David</hi> praieth,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 141. 3. <hi>Lord, ſet a watch before the doore of my lips:</hi> ſo we muſt goe to
God, and pray him to ſet a watch before the doore of our lips.</p>
               <p>The third is,<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>want of love to our brethren:</hi> becauſe wee doe not love them,
therefore wee doe not ſpeake of good things to them; for if wee did love
them, then wee would be ready to impart the good things that God hath
made knowne to us.</p>
               <p>The ſecond generall point is,<note place="margin">Secondly, How Chriſt did manifeſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to them.</note> 
                  <hi>how he did manifeſt himſelfe unto them:</hi> and
that was firſt when they were talking of Chriſt by the way, then hee came
and did joyne himſelfe unto them: Here wee ſee the bleſſing of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
good talke;<note place="margin">1</note> let men talke of Chriſt when they be going on their way,
and when they be at their labours, when they be journeying, and they ſhall
finde the bleſſing of God upon their ſpeeches; therefore, wouldeſt thou
have Chriſt preſent at thy table, and at thy labors, and as thou goeſt by
the way, then ſpeake of him, for there is ſuch a drawing power in good
ſpeech, as it will draw Chriſt to thee; and let us ſpeake of him and of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and then we ſhall finde the bleſſing of God upon us, but as long as
there is filthy ſpeech and curſing amongſt us, Chriſt will not come to us,
but that will drive him away from us.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> in the manner we may obſerve, that <hi>Chriſt did manifest him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
and they did not know of it; their eyes were held that they did not ſee him:</hi>
ſo Chriſt doth manifeſt himſelfe in his word and in the Sacraments,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and
talkes with us from day to day, and yet there is not one of twenty that
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:17958:165"/>
knowes it: the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had a preſence of God in the midſt of them,
yet they aſked if there were a preſence of God amongſt them; ſo there
is a preſence of God amongſt us, and yet there is ſuch a veile of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance

<hi>Ground;</hi> for Chriſt did not change himſelfe, but their eyes were held
that they could not know him. Now the reaſons why their eyes were
held are two:<note place="margin">Two reaſons why Chriſt could not be ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

preſence of Chriſt;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1</note> which may teach us, that it is a more comfortable
thing to have our faith founded on the Scriptures, than on Chriſts bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
preſence. It may be many an one thinks if he might have a viſible pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of Chriſt hee ſhould have comfort; O but it is a better thing to
have our faith founded on the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> to teach them, <hi>that properly to diſcerne naturall objects is the
power of God:</hi> if our eyes be ſhut we cannot ſee, if our eares bee ſtopped
we cannot heare, till God be pleaſed to open them: ſo that wee are not
able to diſcerne betweene one man and another, but by the power of
God: now if wee cannot diſcerne of any thing here but it muſt bee of
God, much more we cannot diſcerne the way to heaven but it muſt bee
of God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is ſaid, that <hi>Chriſt came and did joyne himſelfe with them, and
demanded what manner of ſpeech they had:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Thirdly, Chriſt joyned with them.</note> ſo if Chriſt were preſent hee
would demand what manner of ſpeech, and what manner of communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
ye have; what, doe you talke of Chriſt? doe you talke of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
or of the word? If yee talke of Chriſt and of Religion and of
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oly things, then I have a bleſſing for you, but if yee talke of the world,
of money matters onely, I have no bleſſing for you: which may teach
us, that if Chriſt ſhould come amongſt us, as he did to the Diſciples, he
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:17958:166"/>
would looke after our diſcourſe what it is of. Many a man thinkes hee
may ſpeake what hee will, and what hee liſt himſelfe, O but if Chriſt
were preſent hee would demand what ſpeech they had: wee ſee in the
time of a publike judgement, <hi>Ier.</hi> 8. <hi>The Lord hearkned and heard,</hi> ſo now
he comes to our houſes, and heares what paſſeth betweene the wife and
the husband, and what they ſpeake in their houſes and at their labours,
and as they travell by the way.</p>
               <p>Now Chriſt doth not demand of them what they ſaid, becauſe hee
was ignorant of it, for he knew what they ſaid; but he had another end
in it: as <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. when the Lord demanded of <hi>Adam what hee had done?</hi>
it was not that he was ignorant of it, for he knew well enough what he
had done; but by this meanes hee cals him to the conſideration of his
fault: and ſo <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. when the Lord asked <hi>Caine, where is thy brother Abel?</hi>
it was not that he was ignorant of it: ſo in this demand, it was not that
Chriſt was ignorant, but it was to nouriſh and to continue their good
communication; for when a ſtranger comes if men be talking of good
things they will bee ſilent; therefore Chriſt asketh this queſtion to ſet
their good talke on foot againe. Hence wee must take heed wee doe
quench good ſpeeches, but labour to nouriſh them; as we ſee <hi>Act.</hi> 28.
<hi>The Barbarians kindled a fire and Paul gathered ſtickes</hi> to nouriſh the ſame;<note place="margin">Simile.</note>
ſo if there be a fire begun (any good ſpeech) we ſhould get a bundle of
ſtickes, we ſhould nouriſh the good talke: a number cannot abide good
ſpeech, they ſay they come to bee merry, whereas if they were wiſe,
this were the onely way to make them merry:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> if a number of children
were in the darke, and a mercifull man ſhould ſet up a light for them to
light them the way home, and one ſhould goe and blow out this light,
what a wicked deed were this? ſo wee are here in this world like little
children in the darke, and when men be ſpeaking of good things they
doe ſet up a light, which to quench were a very evill thing.</p>
               <p>The next thing is, the anſwer of <hi>Cleophas</hi> to this demand, wherein
there be two thing to be conſidered:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. A Reprehenſion.</item>
                  <item>2. A Declaration.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt, a <hi>Reprehenſion; Cleophas</hi> doth reproove Chriſt, by way of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration,
ſaith he, <hi>Art thou onely a ſtranger in Ieruſalem, and haſt not knowne
the things that are come to paſſe there in theſe daies?</hi> can there be any ſo igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of it? Now as <hi>Cleophas</hi> doth wonder and admire at Chriſt, we may
truely wonder and admire at the ignorance that is amongſt us; it was
Chriſts ſpeech to <hi>Nicodemus, Ioh.</hi> 3. <hi>Art thou a teacher in Iſrael, and doſt
not know this?</hi> ſo wee may ſay, art thou a Chriſtian, and haſt thou had
meanes of knowledge ſo long and art thou ignorant of the principles of
Religion?</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, a <hi>Declaration;</hi> and herein we obſerve, that the Diſciples
had faith;<note place="margin">Firſt, Faith.</note> ſecondly, that it was weake faith they had. Faith was ſeene
firſt, in commending of Chriſt; and ſecondly, in diſcommending of the
fact of the Iewes in killing of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Firſt, their faith was ſeene in commending of Him, and there were
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:17958:166"/>
three things they commended him for, firſt, <hi>that he was a rare man,</hi> he had
rare things in him; ſo a Chriſtian muſt bee a rare man, it is not ordinary
things muſt content him:<note place="margin">Three things a Chriſtian is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for.</note> 
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſaith, <hi>If yee love your
friends onely what ſingular things doe yee?</hi> a Chriſtian muſt have ſingular
things: and ſo <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1</note> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. <hi>But continue thou in the thing thou haſt learned;</hi>
a Chriſtian muſt excell and goe before others in all things.<note place="margin">2</note> Secondly,
<hi>he was mighty in word and deed;</hi> there is many an one mighty in word but
not in deed,<note place="margin">3</note> but a Chriſtian muſt labour to bee mighty in both. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>Before God and man;</hi> ſo it is not ſufficient to approve our ſelves to God
but to men alſo, as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. the Apoſtle ſaith, we muſt procure things ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
in the ſight of men alſo; ſo that a Chriſtian muſt approve himſelfe
to God firſt, and then to men.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Secondly, their weakeneſſe of faith.</note> 
                  <hi>The weakeneſſe of their faith</hi> was in theſe words; <hi>But wee truſted
it had beene he that ſhould have delivered Iſrael, and as touching all theſe things
to day is the third day ſince they were done:</hi> wee were of good hope that it
was hee that ſhould have delivered the Church, but now wee doe not
hope, all our comfort is gone, he is now crucified and killed, and laid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the grave; indeed we had good hope, and we looked for great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
but now we doe not: ſo that their faith was ſhrewdly ſhaken; and
it may teach us, that a man may have true faith, and yet bee ſhrewdly
ſhaken; the truth is, it cannot bee wholly loſt, becauſe as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi>
saith, <hi>there is a ſeede remaines,</hi> yet it may come to ſuch a ſtand as that hee
may have little comfort of it:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> as a man may have a little cole of fire by
him and yet may ſit till he be a cold, till he rub his hands, and knock his
feet and heeles together; ſo a man may have true faith and yet as little
joy and comfort by it as though he had no faith: as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30.
<hi>I ſaid in my proſperitie I ſhall never bee mooved;</hi> yet in the next <hi>Pſalme</hi> hee
ſaith, <hi>I am cleane caſt out of thy ſight:</hi> ſo <hi>Iob</hi> 20. ſaith hee, <hi>I have ſinned,
what ſhall I doe unto thee, O thou preſerver of men? why haſt thou ſet me as a
marke againſt thee, ſo that I am a burthen to my ſelfe?</hi> ſo <hi>Matth.</hi> 14. 30. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
walked upon the water at firſt, <hi>but when hee ſaw the waves riſe,</hi> then his
faith began to be at a ſtand; ſo a good man may be at a ſtand in his faith,
therefore though a man feele weakeneſſe of faith in him, yet he ought
not to be diſcouraged, but muſt labour to helpe the weakeneſſe thereof:
is the man in the <hi>Goſpell</hi> cried out and ſaid,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> 
                  <hi>Lord, I beleeve, helpe my unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe;</hi>
ſo wee muſt ſay, Lord I have faith, helpe the weakeneſſe of my
faith: I, but what was it that did weaken the faith of theſe two Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and why did not they truſt ſtill in him? I anſwere, there were
three things that did hinder their faith:</p>
               <p>The firſt was,<note place="margin">Three hinderan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples faith.</note> 
                  <hi>Scandalum crucis,</hi> the ſcandall of the croſſe, for as long as
they ſaw Chriſt in his power walking on the ſea, caſting out of devils,
giving ſight to the blinde, clenſing of the Lepers, rayſing up of the
dead,<note place="margin">1</note> ſo long they had faith in him; but when they ſaw him hang on the
croſſe, crucified, and killed, and laid into the grave, then they began to
ſtagger; this it was that did weaken their faith: and I would to God it
were not ſo ſtill, for it is the ſcandall of the croſſe that doth weaken out
faith now adaies, for as long as all things goe well with us, that wee bee
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:17958:167"/>
in health, peace, and want nothing, wee are the beloved of the Lord:
I, but let the croſſe come, and then wee begin to ſincke and bee as men
out of heart: as the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when they came out of <hi>Aegypt</hi> by
a ſtrong hand with ſignes and wonders, then they rejoyced, but when
they came into the wilderneſſe, and wanted bread and water, then they
ſaid, <hi>would to God wee had died in Aegypt, Exod.</hi> 17. ſo <hi>Iudg.</hi> 6. 18. this it
was that did ſtagger, the faith of <hi>Gideon,</hi> ſaith the Angell, <hi>God is with thee
thou valiant man:</hi> he replyes, <hi>O my Lord, if the Lord be with us why then is all
this come upon us?</hi> ſo <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſaith to <hi>Iob</hi> 4. 3. <hi>Behold, thou haſt taught ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and haſt ſtrengthened the weake hands; but now it is come upon thee, and thou
art grieved, it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled;</hi> the hand of God is upon
thee, and thou art out of heart: and therefore it muſt be the wiſedome
of a Chriſtian to ſtrengthen his faith by the croſſe, and not to weaken it,
for it was the triumphant chariot to carry Chriſt to glory, leſt that for
want of wiſedome that which ſhould bee a meanes to ſtrengthen our
faith become a meanes to weaken it, for indeed this might ſtrengthen
our faith, becauſe <hi>the way to heaven is through many afflictions and tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Act.</hi> 14. 22.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>The conſideration of the time;</hi> for they ſay, <hi>this is the third
day:</hi> as if they ſhould have ſaid the ſcandall of the croſſe we could have
paſſed by, but the conſideration of the time, that this is the third day
and yet wee have not ſeene him, how can wee chuſe but doubt? why,
though it was the third day, yet it was not expired, but they were too
haſty, and too nimble, <hi>Eſai.</hi> 28. 10. it is ſaid, <hi>That he which beleeveth ſhall
not make haſte:</hi> I, but theſe were too quicke and too nimble, for thogh the
third day was come yet it was not expired, and therefore they caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
their confidence, and ſo this it was that did weaken their ſaith:
this is that which doth weaken the faith of many becauſe they have not
the thing that ſtraight they deſire; they have not comfort by and by,
therefore they caſt away the confidence they have in God: good <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
was overtaken that way when hee complaines, <hi>Exod.</hi> 5. 23. <hi>For ſince
I came to Pharaoh to ſpeake in thy Name, he hath vexed this people, and yet thou
haſt not delivered thy people;</hi> there <hi>Moſes</hi> was too nimble with God; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it muſt bee every mans wiſedome to waite on God, till the time
come of his comfort and deliverance, they muſt not be too haſty and
too quicke with God. <hi>Galath.</hi> 4. 4. it is ſaid, <hi>When the fulneſſe of time was
come, God ſent forth his Sonne made of a woman, &amp;c.</hi> there was great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
and looking for of Chriſt when great men, Kings and Queenes,
Patriarches and Prophets came into the world, but Chriſt came not till
the fulneſſe of time was come; and when that was come, Chriſt came;
ſo when we looke for eaſe, comfort, and for deliverance out of trouble,
yet wee cannot have it till the fulneſſe of time be come, that God hath
appointed; and therefore wee muſt not be too haſty and quicke with
God.</p>
               <p>The third thing that did weaken their faith was,<note place="margin">3</note> that although the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
had told the women that Chriſt was riſen, and the women had told
the Diſciples, and there was great evidence that it was ſo, yet <hi>they did not
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:17958:167"/>
ſee him;</hi> this it was that did weaken their faith: ſo men muſt take care of
this, that they doe not tye their faith to their eyes and fingers, that they
will beleeve God no longer than they ſee with their eyes, and feele with
their fingers, for a Chriſtian muſt beleeve God againſt ſenſe and reaſon.
It is the manner of the world as long as they ſee with their eyes, and feele
with their hands, as long as they have peace, and eaſe, and wealth, ſo long
they doe beleeve God, but when this failes, then their faith failes them. I,
but Chriſt ſaith to <hi>Thomas, Bleſſed are they which beleeve and ſee not: Thomas</hi>
did beleeve when he ſaw, but it is a more bleſſed thing to beleeve and ſee
not; and therefore we muſt reſt in the promiſes of God againſt ſenſe and
reaſon.</p>
               <p>Now finding this weakeneſſe of faith in them, hee doth labour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſh
and ſtrengthen them; loe here we may ſee the goodneſſe of God,
that by the weakeneſſe of their faith hee doth take occaſion to ſtrengthen
the ſame. It is the great mercy of God that <hi>all things ſhall worke together
for the good of them that love him;</hi> there be a number of things in the world
that ſeeme to work againſt the people of God, but God turnes all of them
to the good of his people,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and of them that love him: as we ſee in a Clocke,
that ſome wheeles turne one way and ſome another, yet all ſerve to make
the Clocke go; ſo there be many croſſes and contrary things in this world,
but all ſerve to one end, even to worke for the good of them that love him.
This may bring comfort to Chriſtians, that the weakeneſſe of their faith
the Lord can turne to their good:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> wee ſee in experience if a man ſet yong
Trees, he will pull and ſhake the Tree, as if he would pull it up, and all that
hee doth is but to ſettle the Tree the faſter; even ſo the Lord doth many
times, as if hee would overthrow a Chriſtian, and yet all is to ſettle his
faith, and to make him cleave the faſter to God.</p>
               <p>Now Chriſt doth ſtrengthen the faith of his diſciples two wayes:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. By reproving and rebuking of them.</item>
                  <item>2. By informing them.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt, hee reproves and rebukes them, <hi>that they were ſlow of heart to beleeve
the ſcriptures;</hi> which may teach us, that if there be a preſence of God among
us, hee will bee reprooving of us, whereas many thinke they may goe away
with any ſinne cloſely, yet if there bee a preſence of Chriſt among us, hee
will reprove us for our ſinnes, and for the weakeneſſe of our faith: This is
that which <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſpeakes in the Goſpell of Saint <hi>Iohn, That when the Spirit
of Chriſt is come into the world, he ſhall reprove the world of ſinne, &amp;c.</hi> ſo if the
ſpirit of Chriſt be come into our harts, he will reprove us for miſſpending
the time, for our ignorance, for every thing that is amiſſe; but if it bee not
ſo with thee, but thou art at peace and ſecurely ſleepeſt in thy ſinne, then
the ſpirit of Chriſt is not come into thee; for if the ſpirit of Chriſt bee
come into thee, he will reprove thee of thy ſinnes, and make thee ſay (as the

                  </gap>pers ſaid, <hi>We doe not well to tarry here, &amp;c.</hi>) O, we doe not well to breake
the Sabbath, to be drunken, to ſpeake filthily, wee doe not well to lye or to
ſweare. Now what was that he reproves them for? <hi>That they were slow of
heart to beleeve the Scriptures:</hi> and here wee are to take notice of a corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that is in us, that we are ſlow to beleeve the Scriptures, and the Goſpel,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:17958:168"/>
but quicke to beleeve a fooliſh tale, or a lye, or a falſe report of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
from this the Lord hath much adoe to ſtay us, although hee hath
ſtrictly charged us to enquire the truth of it, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 4. where hee ſaith, <hi>If
it bee told thee, and thou haſt heard it, then ſhalt thou enquire diligently if it bee
true, and the thing certain,</hi> before we ſpeake of it. If there be a falſe report of a
good Miniſter, or of a good Chriſtian, that wee can beleeve preſently, but
we are ſlow to beleeve the Scripture or any good thing, we are tardy, here
is our fault, and this corruption hath beene in our nature ever ſince the fall
of Man; for we ſee <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 3. The Lord told <hi>Adam, That in the day that he
did eate of the fruit, he ſhould dye the death;</hi> but the divell came and told him,
Ye ſhall not dye at all (cleane contrary) and yet we ſee that they were more
ready to beleeve the divell than God: Will yee ſee a compariſon to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine
it the better;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> If an earthly king ſhould ſay to us, If yee will bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to doe mee ſome ſervice a few dayes, and to attend mee, I will after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
advance you and beſtow great honour upon you, what man is there
that would not reſt himſelfe upon the kings promiſe? In like manner,
God hath ſaid unto us, Attend me in the duties of holineſſe, and doe mee
ſervice a few dayes, whileſt thou liveſt heere, and afterward I will make
you an Heire of the Kingdome of Heaven, and thou ſhalt bee neere unto
mee, and yet wee will not beleeve God. Now there bee two uſes to bee
made of this Doctrine, which ſhall bee declared unto you (God aſſiſting)
the next time of our meeting.</p>

are the wiſedome of God, which wiſedome goeth infinitely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
our reach, being of ſuch infinite excellencie that we cannot attaine
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:17958:169"/>
the height of them; for as the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> ſay, that a thing exceeding
ſenſible doth deſtroy the ſenſes,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> as too much light doth deſtroy the
ſight, too much cold doth benumme the ſenſes, too much heate doth
conſume us, too much noyſe doth make one deafe; ſo the wiſdome of
God, being of ſo great excellency above us, that it tranſcends the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie
of our underſtandings, cannot be apprehended by us, and therefore
we are ſlow to beleeve the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>Debilitas ſubjecti, The weakeneſſe of the ſubject;</hi> the Scriptures
excellency, and the dulneſſe of our apprehenſion makes us ſlow to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve;
for nature cannot worke above her power, but the wiſedome of
God is above the power of nature; for as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>The naturall
man perceiveth not the things that be of God;</hi> becauſe there muſt be a power
above nature to make us to underſtand and beleeve them: therefore as
the woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> ſaith, <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. <hi>The Well is deepe, and I have nothing
to draw with:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſo we may ſay, The Scriptures are deepe, and we have not
any thing to found them with, therefore wee are ſlow to beleeve them.
Now the uſes to be made of this firſt point are:</p>
               <p>Firſt, ſeeing wee are ſo ſlow to beleeve the Scriptures, no man neede
to marvell though wee ſee ſo few converted,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> or ſo few beleeve; for
every man hath a let in his owne nature, therefore no marvell though
ſo few beleeve: Let a man fling a narrow-mouth bottle into the ſea, and
if the mouth bee downeward it will receive no water;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſo wee are like
narrow-mouthed bottles, for although we bee in an Ocean ſea of good
meanes, yet we cannot receive it, we have a let at home in our ſelves.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> ſeeing wee are ſlow to beleeve the ſcriptures, ſeeing wee
have ſuch a let in our ſelves at home, therefore it muſt bee our care to
take the more paines, and to labour with our hearts, that ſo we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
the Scriptures. If a man have nothing but greene wood hee muſt
take the more paines to blow it, and to lay it together, that ſo it may
burne;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſo ſeeing our hearts are like unto greene wood, wee muſt take
the more paines with them, to make them beleeve the Scriptures:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> by informing of them: <hi>and two things hee doth informe
them of:</hi>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Of the Neceſsitie of his ſuffering.</item>
                  <item>2. The good Vſe and utilitie of the ſame.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Two wayes how Chriſt ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples faith.</note> that it is needfull that Chriſt ſhould ſuffer; and ſecondly, that
by ſuffering hee muſt enter into his glorie: and thereby ſeeing this was
the way for Chriſt to enter into his glory, he takes away the ſcandall of the
Croſſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">First, the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Chriſts ſuf<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ferings.</note> 
                  <hi>It was of neceſsitie that Chriſt must ſuffer;</hi> now the neceſſity was not
in himſelfe, for he might have gone to glory the ſame houre he came into
the World, becauſe it was hereditary to him, but in regard of us, for it was
the good of us that made a neceſſitie, and put this upon him. Therefore,
<hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 2. <hi>He gave himſelfe for us,</hi> and <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. <hi>Hee taſted of death
for all men:</hi> therefore, he ſuffered not for himſelfe, but it was for us: One
aſkes the queſtion, <hi>What is the reaſon that Chriſt cals it his glory?</hi> and anſwers,
he cals it ſo in regard of us, for he could have gone ſome other way, but we
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:17958:169"/>
ſhould have beene left heere; therefore it was needfull in regard of us, and
that by reaſon of a double neceſsitie:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The Neceſsitie of paying the price of Mans Redemption.</item>
                  <item>2. The Neceſſitie of good Example.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The firſt was,<note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>The Neceſſitie of paying the price of Mans Redemption,</hi> becauſe
when we have ſinned,<note place="margin">Neceſſitie.</note> ſuch is the Iuſtice of God, that either we muſt ſuffer
in our own perſons, or we muſt ſuffer in the perſon of Chriſt, either Chriſt
muſt ſuffer or wee: therefore when the wrath of God was ready to ſeaze
upon us, it pleaſed Chriſt to ſuffer for us, and to ſatiſfie the Iuſtice of God.
We may remember by this occaſion that which I have ſhewed heretofore,
that <hi>O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eſimus,</hi> after he ran away from his maſter, <hi>Paul</hi> converts, and ſends
him home againe to his Maſter, with a letter in his hand to this effect;
Receive him againe,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> if hee have done thee any wrong, ſet it on my ſcore, I
will anſwere it: ſo wee are run away from God, and Chriſt hath ſent us
backe againe with a letter as it were in our hands to this effect; Father,
admit them and receive them into thy favour, make them partakers of
thy glorie, If they have done thee any wrong, or ought thee any thing, ſet
it on my ſcore, I will anſwere it; I <hi>Ieſus</hi> have written it not with penne
and Inke, but with mine owne blood: and therefore we ſee it was needfull
that Chriſt ſhould ſuffer to pay the price of mans Redemption.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> it was needfull that Chriſt ſhould ſuffer, <hi>in regard of good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ple;</hi>
for no man would goe to Heaven through ſo many troubles,<note place="margin">Neceſſtie.</note> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
Chriſt had gone before them. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>Chriſt hath ſuffered,
leaving us an example,</hi> therefore did hee goe through all theſe troubles and
ſhames, that we might be contented to follow him: If a Man goe through
buſhes, briers,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> rugged waies, through dens and caves and rockes, if hee
finde the footeſteps of his loving friend, this giveth him comfort: ſo ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
we finde the footeſteps of Chriſt in theſe afflictions, we may bee bold
to goe on that way; and therefore it was of neceſſitie that Chriſt muſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
as well in regard of good example, as to pay the price of mans redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
what man then hath cauſe to be offended at the ſcandall of the croſſe,
ſeeing it was ſo needfull that Chriſt ſhould ſuffer theſe things?</p>
               <p>I,<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> but ſome Man may ſay, Was it of neceſſitie that Chriſt ſhould
ſuffer ſo many things, that his head ſhould be crowned with thornes, that
his backe ſhould be whipped, his face buffeted, his ſides pierced, and hee
himſelfe at laſt to die ſuch a ſhamefull death as on the croſſe?</p>
               <p>I anſwer,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> it was needfull that Chriſt ſhould ſuffer all theſe things which
we have ſpoken of, for if hee had ſuffered leſſe, then it would have done us
no good: Mans ſinnes were ſo hatefull in the eyes of God, that hee muſt
ſuffer all theſe things, howſoever the Friers ſay, that one drop of the blood
of Chriſt was enough to redeeme us, yea all Men, yet it coſt Chriſt all his
bloud to redeeme Man: for when Man had ſinned, all the Angels or Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angels
in Heaven could not redeeme him, nor all the <hi>Patriarches</hi> and holy
Men, but it muſt be the blood of the Sonne of God, and all his blood, and
in ſo great extremity as we have heard.</p>
               <p>From the conſideration of this we have the more cauſe to be thankefull
unto him; as <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13. <hi>Peter</hi> wonders at the humility of Chriſt, that he would
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:17958:170"/>
ſtoope ſo low to waſh his Diſciples feete; or hee that was the Lord of all,
higher than the Heavens,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſhould ſtoope ſo low to waſh my feete; ſo wee
may much more wonder and admire at this love of Chriſt, that he would
dye for us, and dye ſuch a curſed death: O Lord wilt thou interpoſe thy
ſoule for mine, and thy body for my body, and dye for mee that I might
live ſtill; and therefore wee have no cauſe to bee offended at the croſſe of
Chriſt, but we have cauſe to be the more thankfull to God for it, and to ſay
as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, <hi>Hee hath loved us, and hath waſhed away our ſinnes in his
blood:</hi> as it is <hi>Eſay</hi> 53. <hi>All we like ſheepe have gone aſtray, we have turned every
one to his owne waies; and the Lord hath laid upon him the iniquite of us all.
Ambroſe</hi> confeſſeth that he was more beholding to God for the worke of
Redemption, for redeeming him with his blood when he was loſt by ſinne,
than for creating him by his Power: Therefore, this may take away the
ſcandall of the croſſe, becauſe it was of neceſſitie that he muſt ſuffer.</p>
               <p>Now that which tooke away the ſcandall of Chriſts croſſe, may take
away the ſcandall of our croſſe: for many times a Chriſtian man is at
a ſtand and at a maze in himſelfe, and ſaith as the <hi>Diſciples</hi> ſaid, <hi>We truſted
it ſhould have beene hee that ſhould have delivered Israel:</hi> ſo I truſted and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
once that I ſhould have beene ſaved, but there bee ſo many croſſes
and ſo many troubles come upon me, that I doubt, I make a doubt of it,
whether I ſhall be ſaved or no. And that it is needfull wee ſhould ſuffer
as Chriſt did, theſe reaſons plainely ſhew:</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Three reaſons why of neceſſity wee muſt ſuffer.</note> it is of Neceſſity that we ſhould ſuffer, <hi>becauſe we ſhould be confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
to him,</hi> for as the head ſuffered ſo muſt the members; as Chriſt
ſpeaketh <hi>Matth.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1</note> 16. <hi>If any man will follow me</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>let him deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
and take up his croſſe and follow me;</hi> ſo <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 24. <hi>Now rejoyce I in
my ſufferings for you; and fill up that which is behinde of the affliction of Chriſt
in my fleſh:</hi> as Chriſt ſuffered in the fleſh in himſelfe, ſo <hi>Paul</hi> ſuffered in
his members; and therefore it is of neceſſity that we ſhould ſuffer.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>becauſe there be a number of ſinnes that be ſo ſunke and ſoken into
the fleſh, that they cannot be purged out but by the croſſe:</hi> ſo <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi>
119. 67. <hi>Before I was afflicted, I went aſtray, but now have I kept thy word,</hi>
ſo <hi>Eſai.</hi> 27. 9. <hi>By this therefore ſhall the iniquity of Iaakob be purged, and this
is all the fruite, the taking away his ſinnes:</hi> hence there be a number you ſee
of ſinnes that are ſo ſunke and ſoken into the fleſh that they cannot bee
purged out but by the croſſe;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> as if gold bee ruſt and canker-fretted, it
cannot bee helpt, but it muſt be caſt into the fire, ſo there be ſome ſinnes
that cannot be purged out, but it muſt be by the fire of affliction.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> it was of Neceſſity that we ſhould ſuffer, <hi>To prevent ſinne in
us:</hi> ſo wee ſee <hi>Gen.</hi> 20. the Lord came in a dreame to <hi>Abimelech</hi> and
told him that hee did keepe him that hee ſhould not ſinne againſt
God; and how did God keepe him? by laying his judgements upon
him, ſo 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. when <hi>Paul</hi> was carried into the third heavens; and
ſaw things that could not bee uttered, leſt he ſhould bee lifted up above
meaſure, the Lord ſent <hi>the prick of the fleſh and the meſſenger of Sathan to
buffet him,</hi> to keepe downe this naturall pride; ſo wee ſee there is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of the croſſe; and therefore have no cauſe to bee offended at it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="329" facs="tcp:17958:170"/>
The ſecond thing that Chriſt doth informe them of, is, <hi>the good utili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
end and iſſue that the croſſe hath:</hi> that it is ſo farre from taking away any
thing,<note place="margin">Secondly, Chriſt informes them of the utility of his Suffering.</note> as that it doth open away to the kingome of heaven, as <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 8,
9. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhewes, <hi>he humbled himſel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>me obedient to the death, even to the
death of the croſſe, wherefore God hath alſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ghly exalted him, and given him a
Name above all other Names:</hi> here is another conſideration to take away
the ſcandall of the croſſe, becauſe it was by it that Chriſt entred into
his glory; ſo if we will goe to glory, we muſt goe the ſame way; there
is no other, there is no neerer way to heaven but by the croſſe, as it is
<hi>Act.</hi> 14. <hi>Through many troubles and afflictions we muſt enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Heaven:</hi> ſo <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. when the woman came with her two
children, ſhe makes this requeſt to Chriſt, that <hi>the one may ſit at his right
hand, and the other at his left:</hi> Chriſt anſweres by way of queſtion, <hi>Can ye
drinke of the cup that I muſt drinke of, and be baptized with the baptiſme that I
muſt be baptized with?</hi> for before ye drinke of the cup of glory, ye muſt
drinke of the cup of affliction, therefore no man ought to be diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
at afflictions or croſſes, ſeeing it is the way whereby we enter into
glory. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 2. 11. when <hi>Elias</hi> was taken into heaven, he was not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
in a golden chariot,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> as the Papiſts ſay that <hi>Henoch</hi> was, but it was a
<hi>chariot of fire, and horſes of fire;</hi> and yet hee was not afraid of them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they were the horſes and the chariot that ſhould carry him to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
ſo when wee ſee the firy horſes of afflictions and of death to come,
we ſhould not be afraid of them, becauſe they be the horſes and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots
that carry us into glory: therefore this is that which ſhould make us
goe cheerefully thorough all troubles and afflictions; this is that which
made <hi>Paul</hi> ſay that <hi>he counted all things but dung and droſſe that he might win
Chriſt, and that he might come to glory;</hi> ſo whatſoever it coſt a man though
it coſt him his life and his blood, yet all is well beſtowed ſo he may win
Chriſt and come to glory.</p>
               <p>Now to this information he doth annex a <hi>Confirmation,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Fourthly, confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, to infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</note> and proves it
by the Scriptures, and ſo begins at <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Prophets</hi> and doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret
all the things that are ſpoken of him.</p>
               <p>Now herein we may obſerve many things: firſt, hee doth labour to
ſound the faith of the Diſciples on the Scriptures; hee might have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
himſelfe at the firſt and ſaid, I am hee, or might have ſhewed
them his hands or his ſides, as he did afterwards in this chapter; but hee
goes on, and leades them through the Scripture and doth interpret un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them all the places that were ſpoken of him; the reaſons, becauſe he
would their faith ſhould be grounded on the Scriptures: which muſt
teach us that wee muſt ground our faith onely on the Word of God;
therefore Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Search the Scriptures, for in them yee thinke to have
eternall life;</hi> ſo it is not true faith till it bee founded on the Scriptures, it
may be a counterfeit, or it may be an opinion, or it may be a perſwaſion,
but it cannot be true faith till it hath his ground there; ſo ſaith <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi>
10. <hi>Faith commeth by hearing of the word preached;</hi> as alſo the <hi>Schoolmen</hi>
ſay, <hi>the beſt reſolution of faith is of God,</hi> that they doe beleeve becauſe
God ſaith ſo: here we are to take notice of an errour in the world, that
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:17958:171"/>
many ſay, they have faith, and yet have no ground for it, but they will
tell you ſuch a Preacher ſaid ſo, or ſuch a good man, or wee heard it a
great while agoe, but it is not true faith till they can ſay that God ſpake
it, well he may have a perſwaſion, or an opinion, or a conceit, but it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be true faith till it be founded on the word of God.</p>
               <p>Thus we heard in the former verſes, how Chriſt did found the faith
of the Diſciples on the Scriptures; he might have diſcovered himſelfe
at the firſt, and have given them a ſenſible knowledge of him, as hee did
after in this chap. but Hee drew them on by little and little, and did lead
them through the Scriptures, the booke of God, that ſo he might open
unto them all that was ſpoken of him.</p>
               <p>In the next place we come to the diſcovery of him, where wee may
ſee that when they drew neere unto the towne they went to, Chriſt
makes a proffer to be gone, as though he would have left them, after he
had begun the worke of grace in them, and had kindled ſome ſparkes in
them: in like manner through the wiſe diſpenſation of God hee
doth ſtill, hee beginnes the worke of grace, and kindles ſome ſparkes
of faith in us, and then he will proffer to bee gone, if we be not wiſe to
lay hold on him, and retaine him: therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> makes his prayer,
<hi>Numb.</hi> 10. 36. every time the <hi>Arke</hi> removed, <hi>Returne O Lord, to the many
thouſands of Iſrael;</hi> he knew that the people had given God juſt cauſe to
be gone from them, therefore he makes his prayer that God would yet
returne againe to them. In like maner <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 44. 9. makes his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint,
<hi>But now thou art farre off, and putteſt us to confuſion, and goeſt not forth
with our armies:</hi> here <hi>David</hi> ſeeth the Lord to ſhrinke from him making a
proffer to be gone, &amp; therefore complaines he thus; ſo we ſhall find that
the Lord doth ſhrink from us and makes a profer to be gone, and to take
away the Goſpell and our comfort, if wee bee not wiſe to lay hold on
him, and ſtay him.</p>
               <p>Now there bee three things by the which a man may know when
Chriſts makes a proffer to be gone:<note place="margin">Three trials to know when Chriſt will be gone from us.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>When men grow idle and cold in the uſe of good meanes,</hi> in prayer, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the word,<note place="margin">1</note> reading and meditating thereon, they doe not apply
themſelves to it as they have done, but they attend about the world, this
makes Chriſt proffer to be gone. <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 47. <hi>Ioſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> never loſt
Chriſt all the while they were in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> they kept him when they were
under the croſſe, and in affliction, but when they were in peace and at <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi>
then they loſt him; and the reaſon was, becauſe they attended
their friends, kinſfolkes, and the reſt of the company, but did not attend
Chriſt, never looked after him, therefore hee was preſently loſt; even
ſo moſt men as long as they be under the croſſe keepe Chriſt, but when
they bee in peace then they loſe him and the comfortable feeling of
faith; they attend to the world, to their profits and pleaſures, and grow
looſe in the uſe of good meanes, forgetting to nouriſh the good things
and holy feelings of Gods favour in themſelves: to this effect, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.
11. <hi>David</hi> prayes unto God, <hi>That he would not take away his ſpirit from him;</hi>
he felt the Lord to ſhrinke from him, and make a proffer to be gone, and
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:17958:171"/>
therefore he ſayes, <hi>Lord, take not thine holy ſpirit from me,</hi> whatſoever thou
take away from mee, though it bee my crowne and kingdome, yet take
not thy ſpirit from me: As we ſee if a man hath fiſh in his pond, as long
as the water tarries,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſo long the fiſh will remaine, but if the water bee
drawne out, then the fiſh will follow the water; even ſo as long as wee
uſe good meanes, ſo long Chriſt will tarry with us, but if once we grow
looſe then Chriſt will follow the meanes. And this is the firſt thing
whereby we may know whether Chriſt makes a proffer to be gone.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> wee may know whether Chriſt makes a proffer to bee gone,
<hi>When wee live in knowne ſinnes againſt our judgement and conſcience,</hi> giving
way to our fleſh, and following bad examples, then we may juſtly feare hee
will be gone, or make a proffer to be gone. For as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 8. 6. the Lord ſaith,
<hi>Son of Man, ſeeſt thou not what they doe? Even the great abominations that the
houſe of Iſrael committeth here, that I ſhould goe farre off from my Sanctuarie:</hi>
So if we commit ſins againſt God, it will cauſe his Spirit to depart from
us: as alſo <hi>Exodus</hi> 33. 7. When the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had committed a great
ſinne againſt God in worſhipping the Calfe, <hi>Moſes tooke the Tabernacle,
and did pitch it without the Hoſt:</hi> to ſhew unto the people that God was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting
from them, becauſe of their ſinnes, if they were not wiſe to ſtay
him by repentance, and turning to him by Prayer: Another example
hereof we have, <hi>Iudges</hi> 16. 20. <hi>Sampſon,</hi> who was a good man, and yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
hee loved a harlot and ſinned againſt God, <hi>The Spirit of the Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
from him; for when ſhe ſaid, the Philiſtians bee upon thee Sampſon, hee
awo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ke out of his ſleepe, and ſaid, I will goe out as at other times before, and
ſhake my ſelfe: And hee wiſt not that the Lord was departed from him:</hi>
Even ſo if good Men ſinne againſt God, it will cauſe the Spirit of
Chriſt to depart from them, for when they have committed great ſinnes
againſt God, though they ſhake themſelves and thinke to doe as they have
done before, to pray and performe ſuch like duties, yet for their life they
cannot, becauſe the Spirit of God is departed from them: hence we may
learne that though a man be a good man, yet if he ſinne againſt God, God
may give him over, and he may loſe the Spirit of grace, and the comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
feeling of it for a time; therefore every man muſt take heed how hee
give way to the fleſh to commit ſinnes againſt God, and as <hi>Iacobs</hi> ſonnes
ſaid to the <hi>Sichemites, If yee will be circumciſed, then will we give our daughters
to you and take your daughters to us, and wee will be one people, Geneſis</hi> 34. 16.
Even ſo God ſaith to us, if ye will be circumciſed and cut off your luſts and
your ſinnes, and be a ſanctified and holy people, then ye ſhall be one with
me; but if ye will not bee circumciſed and cut off your luſts and your ſins,
then yee will cauſe mee to depart away from you. And this is the ſecond
thing whereby we may know when Chriſt makes a proffer to be gone.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>When we feele a decay of Gods graces in us,</hi> when we have loſt our
zeale, care and love; as when the King removes from a place, wee may
know it by his carriage going before:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſo the graces of Gods Spirit bee as
it were the carriage; therefore when this goes away, know then Chriſt will
remoove, then he makes a proffer to be gone.</p>
               <p>But why did Chriſt make a proffer to be gone? It was not that hee had
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:17958:172"/>
any purpoſe to depart, but to trie their affections, and to ſee what account
they would make of him; ſo the Lord doth ſtill make a proffer to bee gone
from us, and to take away the Goſpell and many times the comfortable
feeling of his favour; which hee doth to trie our faith and our affection,
and to trie what account wee will make of him. So we ſee <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. 22.
Chriſt deales with the woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> makes a proffer to bee gone, as
may appeare by conferring this with other places: for it is ſaid in <hi>Marke</hi>
17. 24. <hi>Chriſt went into an houſe, and would have no man know it,</hi> as if he would
have beene gone from her, yet ſhee followes him; he goes into the fields,
and yet ſhe followes him; this was not that he had any purpoſe to be gone
from her,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> but to trie her faith and her affection. As 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 2. the <hi>Arke</hi> was
in the borders of <hi>Iſrael twentie yeeres together, and all the people lamented after
the Lord:</hi> He kept the <hi>Arke</hi> twenty yeeres together aloofe of them, to ſee
how they would long for his preſence: So God deales with us, hee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawes
the comfortable feeling of his preſence, to ſee how wee will long
after it,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and what account wee make of it: as a loving mother ſometimes
hides her ſelfe from her childe, not becauſe ſhe meanes to go from it quite,
but becauſe ſhee would trie the love of her childe, and how it longs after
her; ſo Chriſt doth ſhrinke away from us, and hide his preſence to trie
our love, our faith, and our affection. Therefore, when Chriſt makes a
proffer to be gone, wee muſt doe as the people did, <hi>Marke</hi> 1. 45. <hi>follow him,</hi>
not being at reſt till they had found him; though hee went into never ſo
ſecret a place: If hee be departed away from us, wee ſhould not bee at reſt
but follow him and labour to recover him againe by prayer, meditation,
and the uſe of good meanes.</p>
               <p>Now when Chriſt made a proffer to be gone, theſe two Diſciples would
not let him goe, but one hanged on the one arme as it were, and the other
on the other, till they conſtrained him to tarry with them. Hence wee muſt
learne that if Chriſt makes a proffer to be gone, we muſt not let him goe,
and doe as the World does, If hee will goe let him goe, and ſay,
wee cannot hold him; but wee muſt importune him and conſtraine him to
tarry with us, as it is ſaid of the good people, <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 42. <hi>And when it was
day he departed and went into a deſart place, and the people ſought him and came
to him, and ſtayed him that he ſhould not depart from, them:</hi> So when wee feele
Chriſt to depart from us, wee muſt conſtraine him to tarrie with us as <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>

                  <hi>Genes.</hi> 32. 26. When hee and the Angell wreſtled together, <hi>Iacob
laid hold on him and would not let him goe, till he had bleſſed him:</hi> Now the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell
that did wreſtle with <hi>Iacob</hi> was <hi>Chriſt.</hi> So alſo <hi>Exodus</hi> 32. 15. When
the Lord told <hi>Moſes</hi> that hee would not goe with them, but an Angell
ſhould goe with them;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> Lord (ſaith hee) <hi>Carry us not away from this place,
unleſſe thy preſence goe with us:</hi> Lord, let me die here and goe no further, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
thy preſence goe with us; ſo wee ſhould pray to God not to carry us
away from our houſes, that we may not ſtirre from the places where wee
be, unles the preſence of God goe with us, and when we feele the preſence
of God to be going from us, we muſt pray him to tarrie with us, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine
him too.</p>
               <p>But why doe they deſire Chriſt to tarry with them? becauſe they
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:17958:172"/>
had taſted of the goodneſſe, power, ſweet graces, and excellency of
Chriſt, this was the reaſon of it: therefore no marvell though the
world let Chriſt goe, and doe not deſire him to tarry with them, becauſe
they never felt the power of God, neither taſted of the ſweet and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
graces that be in Chriſt, but ſuch as have taſted hereof will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to take any paines and labour to enjoy Chriſt; therefore the
Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> gives us this exhortation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 2.<note place="margin">Simile.</note>

ſaid, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. <hi>Lord depart not from thy ſervant,</hi> ſo wee ſhould deſire
Chriſt to be with us and to ſay, Lord depart not away from mee till the
day of my death.</p>
               <p>Now there are two eſpeciall times wherein every Chriſtian ſhould
pray that Chriſt may be with him:<note place="margin">Two things, wherein every Chriſtian ſhould pray God to bee with him.</note>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. In the time of Trouble.</item>
                  <item>2. At the time of Death.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>In the time of trouble,</hi> when there is miſery and extremity upon
us,<note place="margin">1</note> then we had need to have a great deale of grace to ſuſtaine us: wee
ſee ſhips in a great ſtorme,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> if they have not good Anchors and good
Cables they may quickly miſcarry and daſh againſt ſome rockes, and ſo
make ſhipwracke; in like manner if trouble and danger bee upon us, if
Chriſt be not with us, we are like to miſcarry, therefore as the two <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi>
ſaid to Chriſt,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> 
                  <hi>The day is farre ſpent, and the night drawes on, tarry with
us;</hi> ſo wee ſhould ſay, The day of proſperity is farre ſpent, and there is
a night of affliction drawing on, therefore, Oh Lord, tarry with us, and
give us a good iſſue out of troubles; ſo <hi>David</hi> prayeth <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. 11. <hi>Be not
farre from me, O Lord, becauſe trouble is neere, for there is none to helpe me:</hi> this
is a ſpeciall time to have Chriſt with us.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>At the day of death,</hi> when wee come to end this life, this is a
ſpeciall time to have Chriſt with us,<note place="margin">2</note> as the diſciples ſaid to Chriſt, <hi>Tarry
with us, for the day is farre ſpent, and the night drawes on;</hi> ſo a Chriſtian ſhould
ſay at the time of his death, My life is farre ſpent, old age is come upon
me, and ſickneſſe and death drawes on, Lord, tarry thou with me, and I
pray thee that I may ſo ſhut up mine eyes in this world, and that they
may bee opened in the kingdome of heaven, and that I may dye in thy
favour, in the pardon and forgiveneſſe of my ſinnes, and in the peace of
a quiet conſcience. Thus <hi>David</hi> praieth in the <hi>Pſal. Yea even untill mine old
age and gray head, O Lord, forſake me not;</hi> And ſo againe <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27. 9. <hi>Hide not
therefore thy face from me, nor caſt thy ſervant away in diſpleaſure; thou haſt bin
my ſuccour, leave mee not nor forſake mee, O God, of my ſalvation.</hi> And theſe be
the two times, when we are ſpecially to deſire Chriſt to be with us:</p>
               <p>Now we come to the next thing, which is, how Chriſt was knowne
of them, and it is ſaid, <hi>In the breaking of the bread:</hi> here two queſtions
are to be anſwered:</p>
               <list>
                  <pb n="334" facs="tcp:17958:173"/>
                  <item>1 What is meant by Bread?</item>
                  <item>2 How Chriſt was knowne by the breaking of Bread?</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> 
                  <hi>what is meant by Bread?</hi> whether it were ordinary common
Bread, or whether it were ſacred, and conſecrated to an holy uſe? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
that the Bread heere ſpoken of is not Sacramentall,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> but ordinary
Bread. The Papiſts take advantage by this place (as they doe by all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
that ſeeme to ſerve their turne) for when they be urged and aſked
why they breake the Lords inſtitutions to give Bread, and not wine,
contrary to the commandement of Chriſt, ſeeing Chriſt inſtituted
both: to this they anſwer, that the Church of Rome hath an example
to doe ſo, becauſe Chriſt did adminiſter the Sacraments to the two
Diſciples going to <hi>Emmaus.</hi> But we can prove by theſe two reaſons ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
out of their owne Doctrine and Canons, that this breaking of
Bread cannot bee meant of Bread uſed in the inſtitution of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
but of ordinary and common Bread:</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> becauſe they hold it a ſacriledge for any Prieſt to conſecrate
Bread without Wine; for they will have them both conſecrated toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
though none but the Bread be adminiſtred; but in this place there
is none but Bread ſpoken of, and therefore it was not Bread uſed in the
Sacraments.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe their owne Doctrine and Canons ſay, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
bee a Sacrament without the five words of conſecration,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>Take, eate,
this is my body;</hi> but there were not theſe five words of conſecration; and
therefore it is not meant of the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>Now they have two reaſons againſt this argument:</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">The firſt popiſh argument.</note> In that they ſay, there is the ſame forme of words that is uſed
in the inſtitution of the Sacrament, both in <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. and alſo in the
Goſpell of Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> where the inſtitution is ſpoken of; and that is that
<hi>he tooke the bread, and bleſſed it, and gave it,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, they may as well <hi>prove</hi> the five loaves and the two
fiſhes that Chriſt fed the people with,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> 
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. to be a Sacrament, for
there it is ſaid, he tooke the bread and bleſſed the ſame and gave it, ſo
there are the ſame forme of words.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">The ſecond po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh argument.</note> they ſay, if it had not beene this Sacrament, Chriſt would
not have adminiſtred it, he would not have bleſſed the bread and brake
it and have given it, becauſe he was a ſtranger.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> that it was the manner of the Iewes, that the beſt
men in the company gave thankes, brake the bread, and did not put it
off to a childe as many doe at theſe dayes; therefore becauſe he was the
beſt, and moſt gravity did appeare in his face, therefore hee did bleſſe it
and gave it.<note place="margin">2 Vſes.</note> Now then if it were an ordinary foode, or Repaſt; this
muſt teach us two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> that we ſhould not take a bit of bread into our mouths till wee
have bleſſed God for it, and ſo it was the manner of the people to doe,
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9. 15. the maids ſaid to <hi>Saul,</hi> that <hi>The people would not eate till Samuel
came and had bleſſed the ſacrifice;</hi> and ſo <hi>Act.</hi> 27. <hi>Paul</hi> when he was amongſt
ſtrangers in the ſhip in the preſence of them all <hi>he gave thankes:</hi> We ſee
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:17958:173"/>
Chriſt did not take bread till he had given thanks and bleſſed it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
how dare any man take a morſell or a bit of meate into his mouth,
till he hath by holy prayer drawne downe a bleſſing upon him. Chriſt
he would not, he that was the Creator of all, and therefore how dare a
Man, that is but fleſh and bloud, take his dinner and ſupper, and never
give thankes nor bleſſe the bread, ſurely man hath not more liberty than
Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> that as theſe two Diſciples did travell with Chriſt, and
when they came at their waies end did then eat and drinke with Chriſt,
and comfortably refreſh themſelves; ſo let us travell with Chriſt here
in this world, and when we come at our journeies end, we ſhall eate and
drinke with him in the Kingdome of Heaven: ſo wee ſee <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 29.
<hi>Therefore I appoint unto you a kingdome as my Father hath appointed to me, that
ye may eate and drinke at my table in my kingdome:</hi> ſo <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. <hi>To him that
overcommeth will I give to eate of the h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>dden Manna;</hi> Therefore let us la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to travell with Chriſt here in this world, and then howſoever we
may have trouble and affliction heere, yet when wee come at our jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes
end, wee ſhall bee comfortably refreſhed in the Kingdome of
Heaven.</p>
               <p>The ſecond queſtion is, <hi>how Chriſt was knowne in the breaking of bread:</hi>
ſome ſay becauſe hee brake the bread ſo ſmooth as if it had beene cut
with a knife, but it cannot be ſo, becauſe it is ſaid hee was knowne <hi>in</hi> the
breaking of the bread, not <hi>by</hi> the breaking; and ſome ſay he was knowne
by the maner of his thanks-giving, but it is not ſaid that he was knowne
by this, but in breaking of the bread; therefore it is beſt to follow the
words of the Text, <hi>That he was knowne of them in the breaking of the bread,</hi>
for their eies were held that they knew him not before, and at that very
inſtant, at the act of breaking the bread, then the Lord opened their
eyes; which may teach us, that there may be a preſence of God in our
houſes, in the fields, and in the places where we be, and yet wee cannot
ſee it, unleſſe the Lord open our eyes: Therefore as the two blinde men
cryed unto Chriſt and ſaid,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> 
                  <hi>O Sonne of David, have mercy on us;</hi> whom
Chriſt aſked what they would have; they ſaid, <hi>Lord, that our eyes may bee
opened:</hi> ſo we muſt cry to Chriſt to open our eyes that wee may ſee his
goodneſſe and mercy to us.</p>
               <p>The next thing is what they did when Chriſt was vaniſhed out of
their ſight: here be divers things to be conſidered, only I will commend
unto you two things:</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> that they ſaid one unto another, <hi>Did not our hearts burne when hee
ſpake unto us?</hi> ſo wee ſhould examine our ſelves when Chriſt hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
unto us, whether our hearts burne, whether we were afflicted with
that which was taught us: If we find not this, we may ſay to our ſelves,
What did we heare, why doe we miſſe-ſpend the time?</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> that they could not be at reſt, they could not tarry, <hi>but they
went and told it to their brethren;</hi> ſo when God hath made any good thing
knowne unto us, we ſhould not be at reſt, but ſhould tell it to our wives,
to our children, to our friends, and to our acquaintance: we remember
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:17958:174"/>
what Chriſt ſaid to the women, <hi>Goe tell my brethren:</hi> and even ſo I may
ſay to you, Go tell your friends, and tell your brethren the good things
yee have heard, tell it to your wives and children, and if yee cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
any more, yet remember this, how wee may retaine and keepe
Chriſt; namely, with this ſhort prayer of theſe diſciples, <hi>The day is farre
ſpent, and the night drawes on, tarry with us;</hi> ſo my life is night ſpent, and the
night of death drawes on, Lord, tarry with us; and then we ſhall make a
happy cloſe of our life, when <hi>Wee ſhall ſit downe with Abraham, and Iſaac,
and Iacob in the Kingdome of heaven.</hi>

two Diſciples going to <hi>Emmaus,</hi> finding their faith weake hee doth la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to nouriſh and ſtrengthen the ſame: 2 <hi>King.</hi> 9. as <hi>Iehoram,</hi> when
he was wounded of the Aſſyrians returned to <hi>Iezreel to be healed of his
wounds:</hi> ſo when the devill hath wounded us in our faith, love, care, and
in our zeale, we muſt returne to the uſe of good means, that ſo we may
recover againe. If a man have a tree that ſtands in his orchard, if there
bee but a little life left in it, he will dig and dung it about, and lay freſh
moulds to the roote of it; ſo if there bee a little life of grace left in us,
wee ſhould labour to nouriſh the ſame by prayer,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> hearing the Word
preached, and by receiving the Sacraments; that ſo wee may recover
againe: thus the <hi>Diſciples</hi> were aſſembled together to nouriſh that ſparke
of faith which was left in them.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> becauſe they were <hi>in hope thereby to finde a bleſſing</hi> upon them:
others had ſeene Chriſt, and they aſſembled together in hope to ſee
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:17958:175"/>
him too: which may teach us that the bleſſing of God upon others in
the uſe of good meanes, muſt give us comfortable hope, that if we uſe the
ſame meanes we ſhall finde a bleſſing of God upon us, that as others have
beene brought by the preaching of the Word, to faith and repentance,
and to a comfortable feeling of Gods favour, to bee perſwaded that their
ſinnes are pardoned; ſo if wee uſe the ſame meanes, we ſhall have the ſame
bleſſing upon us: As <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 48. <hi>Wee have thought of thy loving
kindneſſe O Lord, in the middeſt of thy Temple;</hi> other men have found a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
upon them, and therefore we looke for the like upon us. But why were
the Diſciples deſirous to ſee Chriſt? becauſe they had felt the power of
Chriſt, and had taſted of his ſweet graces, and of the excellencie that was
in him: ſo if men had taſted of the ſweete things that are in Chriſt, they
would long after him; therefore Chriſt ſayes to the woman of Samaria,
<hi>Iohn</hi> 4. <hi>If thou kneweſt the gift of God, and who it is that ſaith unto thee, Give me
drinke, thou wouldeſt have aſked of him, and hee would have given thee living
water:</hi> This was the reaſon why the two Diſciples conſtrained Chriſt to
tarrie with them, becauſe they had felt of the goodneſſe and of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
that was in him.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> it is ſaid, <hi>the doors were ſhut for feare of the Iewes:</hi> this is a ſtrange
thing,<note place="margin">Hee appeared when the doors were ſhut.</note> that they ſhut the Doore for feare of the Iewes, they were bold to
confeſſe the name of of Chriſt before all men, and now they are afraid of the
Iewes; and no marvell, for they had killed and crucified him, and therefore
they would make no ſcruple to kill them: which may teach us two things.
Firſt, that <hi>we ſhould bee carefull to avoid all needleſſe dangers;</hi> as <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.
Our Saviour ſaith, <hi>If any man will follow mee let him deny himſelfe, take up his
croſſe and follow mee:</hi> If it bee a croſſe that God layes upon us, we muſt take
it up with both hands, but wee muſt take heed of making croſſes to our
ſelves: We read <hi>Luke</hi> 22. <hi>That Chriſt prayes that this cup might paſſe away;</hi>
ſo we muſt pray that this trouble and affliction may paſſe away, but if it be
the will of God that it ſhall abide with us, then we muſt willingly yeeld to
it. Indeede the croſſe is needfull when God layes it upon us, but we muſt
take heed how we bring needleſſe croſſes upon our ſelves:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> If a Phyſitian
ſhould give us ranke poyſon, hee would ſo temper and qualifie it, as that
it ſhould doe us good, but if wee take it our ſelves, it may poyſon us; So
God this ſame ſkilfull Phyſitian, if he lay the croſſe and trouble upon us, it
will turne to our good, but if we take it our ſelves, it may trouble and hurt
us; therefore it is good to avoyde all needleſſe dangers or croſſes.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing that it doth teach us is,<note place="margin">2</note> that <hi>Every man muſt meaſure
his owne actions by his ſtrength:</hi> the more ſtrength a man hath, the more
courage; and the leſſe ſtrength, the leſſe courage: ſo it was with the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples;
the more ſtrength, the more courage they had in the cauſe of Chriſt;
and the leſſe ſtrength, the leſſe courage: here is the queſtion anſwered by
that which hath beene ſpoken of before, whether it be lawfull to flie in the
time of perſecution? If one hath ſtrength and courage to ſtand, then hee
were beſt to abide it, but if he have not ſtrength, then he were better to fly,
as <hi>Marke</hi> 15. <hi>There was a yong man that did follow Chriſt in a linnen garment,
whom they caught hold on, and hee left the linnen cloth and fled from them
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:17958:175"/>
naked:</hi> But did he well to flie from Chriſt? I anſwere, he did well to flie,
for he had not ſtrength to reſiſt, nor meanes to prevaile.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing is,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>The manner how hee did appeare,</hi> and that was <hi>when
the Doores were ſhut:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The manner how Chriſt did appeare.</note> Hence wee learne no Doores can keepe out Chriſt;
when <hi>Paul</hi> was in priſon and the Doores ſhut, he came to <hi>Paul,</hi> ſo that all
the Doores could not keepe out Chriſt. There bee diverſe opinions how
this could be; ſome be of the minde, that the Doores gave way to Chriſt
and did open, as the iron gates opend when the Angell did fetch <hi>Peter</hi> out
of priſon; as S. <hi>Ierome</hi> ſaith, that the <hi>Creature</hi> gave place to the <hi>Creator:</hi> A
ſchooleman ſaith that the Doore did open ſo ſoftly and ſhut again, as that
they did not perceive it: others think that he did ſo attenuate his body, and
make it ſo ſubtile, as that it could paſſe through the Doore, or any little
chinke or Creviſe, as the Sun paſſeth through the glaſſe window: Others
againe thinke there is ſuch power in a glorified body, as that it is able to
paſſe through any ſolid body, as a man may paſſe through water or the Aire.
Therefore Chriſts body riſing a glorified body, was able to paſſe through
the Doore: ſo our bodies glorified, if they were in an Iron or Steele Cheſt,
in a Marble ſtone, or Tombe, it could not hold them, a glorified body is
able to paſſe through them. Hence the Papiſts would prove their tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation,<note place="margin">Object.</note>
that ſeeing he could make his body paſſe through the Doore,
he could make it paſſe into the bread and wine. To this I anſwer, there is
great difference between them,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> for although he paſſed through the Door,
yet he was in the ſame proportion, figure &amp; dimenſion that he had before,
but in the Sacrament there are not the ſame proportions nor the ſame fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,
nor the ſame dimenſion; ſo there is a great difference between them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>the Effect</hi> of this appearing, when Chriſt came amongſt
them hee ſaid, <hi>Peace bee unto you:</hi> this is a ſtrange ſpeech of Chriſt to
ſay to them, peace bee unto you, ſeeing ſome of them had betrayed him,
ſome denied him, and all had fled away from him; yet hee ſayes, <hi>Peace be
unto you,</hi> as if they had not offended him; the cauſe was they had repented
of their ſinnes, condemned and judged themſelves, therefore, Chriſt
brings peace unto them: So though we ſinne againſt God and offend him,
yet if wee weepe for our ſinnes, repent of them, and condemne and judge
our ſelves, hee will bring peace unto us. Here wee may ſee what Chriſt
brought out of the grave with him to his Diſciples, even as when a father
is abſent from his childe hee comes home comfortably: ſo Chriſt being
abſent from his Diſciples brings out of the dens of death, and out of the
Grave, peace with God, with the holy Angels, with all the Creatures, and
peace of their owne conſcience with him. Therefore if any man ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
and ſay,<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> Chriſt indeede was crucified and he died and was laid into
the Grave, but what good have wee by theſe things? To this I anſwere,
that he hath brought the greateſt good with him that may be,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> for he hath
brought peace with God, with the holy Angels, with all the Creatures,
and peace with our Conſciences, this is a great comfort to a Chriſtian,
for though hee bee not a great man in the world, nor one of the brave gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants,
yet he is a happy man, becauſe Chriſt hath brought a peace with
him unto him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="340" facs="tcp:17958:176"/>
Further, this may teach us, <hi>where we are to ſeeke our peace;</hi> no where but in
the death of Chriſt;<note place="margin">Vſe.</note> therefore if thou wouldeſt have peace with God and
in thy owne conſcience,<note place="margin">Where wee are to ſeeke for peace.</note> ſeeke it in the death of Chriſt, there thou mayeſt
have it: if thou haſt peace which doth not ariſe from hence, it cannot bee
true peace, nor the peace of conſcience, till thou canſt ſee by the eye of
faith Chriſt dying upon the croſſe, bleeding in the Garden, flung into the
Grave for thy ſinnes; ſo it is Chriſt, that brings us peace: ſo the Apoſtle
ſpeakes, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 17. <hi>Hee came and preached peace to you which were afarre off,
and to them that were neere:</hi> So <hi>Eſay,</hi> 26. 12. <hi>Lord, unto us thou wilt ordaine
peace, for thou haſt wrought all our workes for us:</hi> Therefore, every man that
would have peace, Muſt looke to have it in the death of Chriſt. Here wee
ſee what the maine benefit is Chriſt brought from the Grave with him,
peace; yet it is reſtrained and with a limitation (<hi>to you.</hi>) that is, To
thoſe that have repented of their ſinnes and long for Chriſt. So then let
every one looke to himſelfe if hee have repented his ſinnes, and longed for
Chriſt, then Chriſt brings him peace, but if he be impenitent and doe not
long for Chriſt, then there is no peace for him. Therefore when thou doſt
conſider Chriſt is come from the Grave and from the Croſſe, laden with
a number of bleſſings, thinke unleſſe thou haſt repented thee of thy ſinnes,
thou ſhalt have no part in him. There bee a number of men deſire to have
peace in the World, but if they have not repented and doe not long for
Chriſt, he brings them no peace nor comfort.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is ſaid, <hi>Hee ſhewed them his hands and his feete,</hi> which was for
<hi>further confirmation of their faith;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3</note> for they had a number of phantaſies and
thoughts in their mindes,<note place="margin">He ſhewed them his hands and feete.</note> they thought hee was a Spirit; and therefore
Chriſt bids them feele and handle him, for a Spirit hath <hi>not fleſh and blood,
as ye ſee me have;</hi> therefore to take away theſe fantaſies, and theſe thoughts
Chriſt did ſhew him his hands: here we are to take notice of a corruption
of ours, that if wee goe about any good thing, wee ſhall have a hundered
thoughts to hinder us come into our minds, as <hi>Zech.</hi> 3. 1. we may ſee, when
<hi>Ioſua was offering of ſacrifices,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> 
                  <hi>Sathan ſtood at his right hand to reſist him:</hi> So
when a Chriſtian is going about any good thing, he ſhall bee ſure to have
one thing or other to hinder it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he ſhewed them he hands and feete, <hi>To teach them hee did not
riſe with another body,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>but with the ſame body that was crucified and killed;</hi>
which may ſerve for a further confirmation of our faith in the reſurrection,
that we ſhall not riſe with other bodies, but with the ſame bodies; <hi>Origen</hi>
ſaith, that it is not the ſame body we lay downe, that ſhall riſe againe, but
another; but Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> confutes him, and ſayes, the ſame bodies wee
carrie about us, and the ſame bodies we have ſinned againſt God with, the
ſame wee ſhall riſe with to receive judgement: and <hi>Iob</hi> 19. (ſaith hee) <hi>I
know that my Redeemer liveth, and that hee ſhall ſtand the laſt upon Earth, and
though after my ſkinne wormes deſtroy this body, yet ſhall I ſee God with my fleſh,
&amp;c.</hi> And therefore the ſame bodies wee lay downe, the ſame ſhall riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</p>
               <p>The Vſe is,<note place="margin">Vſe.</note> that ſeeing the ſame bodies ſhall riſe againe that wee carry
about us, therefore how carefull ought wee to bee to keepe them pure, for
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:17958:176"/>
the ſame tongues wee have ſpoken filthie words with, the ſame bodies we
have defiled through unchaſtity, and the ſame hands we have ſtollen with,
the ſame eyes wee have looked after vanity with, the ſame feete that have
carried us to diſordered places, with the ſelfeſame ſhall wee ſtand before
God: And therefore how carefull ſhould we be to keepe our bodies pure?</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">The third point, the effects of Chriſts appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiom.</note> 
                  <hi>The effect and fruite;</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>The Diſciples were glad when they
had ſeene Chriſt,</hi> after a great deale of labour and a great deale of paines;
ſo if wee can ſee Chriſt after a great deale of paines and labour by the eye
of faith, we ſhould thinke our labour well beſtowed, for a man may ſee
Chriſt with the eye of his body and yet periſh, but if wee ſee him by the
eye of faith wee ſhall bee ſaved. Therefore as the Diſciples ſaid, wee have
ſeene the Lord, we have ſeene Chriſt though we had loſt him, ſo wee may
thanke God, though wee have loſt Chriſt by our ſinnes, yet that wee have
ſeene him againe, and that although God ſend the croſſe and affliction to
us, yet we are glad that we have ſeene Chriſt; whom if we can ſee heere in
this World by the eye of faith, wee ſhall ſee one day in the kingdome of
glory; therefore happy is that man or woman that can ſee Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thus we have heard what riches and treaſure Chriſt brought to the
Church, that hee came not empty from the croſſe, nor from the grave,
but laden with a number of rich graces for the good of the Church, as
<hi>Peace of conſcience, pardon of ſinnes, juſtification, ſanctification;</hi> all theſe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
Chriſt brought with him.</p>
               <p>Now in the next place, we are to conſider <hi>the care that Chriſt hath to
communicate his graces to the Church,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chriſts care to communicate his graces.</note> 
                  <hi>and to apply them;</hi> for though he have
a number of rich graces in himſelfe, what were wee the better for it,
unleſſe there were meanes to convey it to us; therefore as the woman
ſaid to Chriſt, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. <hi>The well is deepe, and wee have nothing to draw withall:</hi>
ſo Chriſt is like a deepe well, we cannot come by his graces, unleſſe we
have meanes,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> therefore alſo it is the care of Chriſt to appoint meanes
to convey them unto us, &amp; put us in poſſeſſion of them: as a man finding
a ſpring in his ground will get pipes to convey it to his houſe, ſo Chriſt
is a fountaine of grace, and it is his care how to convey it to us. Now the
miniſtery of the word is the means,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> this is the hand of Chriſt to convey
all his graces, theſe be the pipes whereby we receive all the excellency
that is in him; all the benefits that he hath purchaſed, he hath bound the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
in a bundle together and laid them down that they may be conveyed to
us this way: as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 7. the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>We have this rich treaſure
in earthen veſſels, that the excellency of power may be of God,</hi> and 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 5.
18. ſaith he, <hi>And hath given unto us the miniſtery of Reconciliation:</hi> ſo the
<hi>Goſpell</hi> is the meanes by the which Chriſt doth apply unto us all his rich
graces: wee ſee <hi>Gen.</hi> 42. 17. <hi>Ioſeph</hi> filled his brethrens ſacks with corne,
which they carried into the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> to preſerve them alive till
they came into <hi>Egypt:</hi> ſo the true <hi>Ioſeph</hi> Ieſus Chriſt hath put theſe ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
treaſures into a ſacke,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and hath ſent his ſervants to diſpence them
and give them to his brethren, to nouriſh and to comfort them till the
good time they come home unto him; this is the firſt care that Chriſt
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:17958:177"/>
hath when hee came from the grave, <hi>Hee ſends out his Diſciples.</hi> Here ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
foure things:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1 He Armes them before he ſends them.</item>
                  <item>2 The Commiſsion, as my Father ſent me, ſo ſend I you.</item>
                  <item>3 The Ability that he gives them; to performe their charge.</item>
                  <item>4 The Authoritie.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> before Chriſt ſends his Diſciples, <hi>He armes them,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Peace
be unto you:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chriſt armes them.</note> It is a ſtrange thing, that ſeeing there is ſuch great good of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
in the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> that it ſhould be ſo unwelcome, one would have
thought it would have beene entertained and received joyfully: but
Chriſt knew that of all meſſages this is unwelcomeſt, and therefore
Chriſt faies, <hi>Behold, I ſend you as ſheepe among wolves;</hi> though yee bee as
ſheepe yet yee ſhall meete with wolves: and what is that he comforts
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with that? God is at peace with them; this is all the armor he fences
them with againſt the unkindneſſe and hard dealings of the world, to
know that God is at peace with them and loves them by the meanes of
Chriſt; ſo <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16. he ſaith, <hi>In the world ye ſhall have trouble, but in me ye ſhall
have peace, be of good comfort for I have overcome the world;</hi> this may teach
us, that if a Chriſtian bee at peace with God and knowes that his ſinnes
bee pardoned, and that God loves him by the meanes of Chriſt, here is
enough to beare him out againſt al the encounters and unkindneſſes that
the world affords: therefore when a Chriſtian man is in any trouble or
affliction, let him deſcend into his owne heart and ſee if God be at peace
with him by the meanes of Chriſt, that his ſinnes are pardoned and that
he knowes he ſhall bee ſaved: this will give a man comfort; ſo we ſee,
<hi>Lam.</hi> 3. the Church did; and <hi>Ier.</hi> 14. ſaith he (in the greateſt diſtreſſe that
might be) <hi>The Lord is my portion, ſaith my ſoule, therefore will I hope in him.</hi>
I have ſhewed you heretofore that if a man fall into the hands of
theeves and robbers, and they robbe him and take away his goods or his
money, if hee hath a jewell of infinite price about him and they leave
him that,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> hee will ſay, Lord, I thanke thee, I have my jewell ſtill, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
I have loſt my goods and my money; ſo a man may ſay, though
ſickneſſe had taken away my health, and bad neighbours my money, yet
Lord I thanke thee, I have my jewell, I have my peace with thee and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance
that my ſinnes bee pardoned: <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 34. it is ſaid of the good
people, <hi>That they ſuffered with joy the ſpoyling of their goods, knowing that they
had in heaven a better and an enduring ſubſtance;</hi> ſo as long as a man hath
peace of conſcience, pardon of his ſinnes, hope of Heaven, he is armed
and fenced againſt all troubles, and all the unkindneſſes the world can
offer unto him.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, <hi>the Commiſſion, As the Father ſent me, ſo ſend I you:</hi> here
are two things to be conſidered:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Who it is that ſends.</item>
                  <item>2. To what end he ſends.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt, by whom they were ſent, by Chriſt; <hi>As my Father ſent me, ſo ſend
I you:</hi> thence we learne, It is Chriſt that is the Authour of all Miniſtery,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:17958:177"/>
he it is that ſends Miniſters to the Church, as <hi>Matt.</hi> 23. 34. <hi>Behold, I send
unto you Prophets and wiſe men, Scribes, &amp;c.</hi> ſo <hi>Eſay</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Lord God and
his Spirit hath ſent me:</hi> ſo it is Chriſt that is the Author of all Miniſtery,
as <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 14. <hi>When he aſcended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave
gifts unto men:</hi> And theſe were the gifts, <hi>He therfore gave ſome to be Apoſtles,
and ſome Prophets, and ſome Evangeliſts, ſome Paſtors and ſome Teachers:</hi> ſo it
is Chriſt that ſends Miniſters at this day, but yet there is a difference, for
he ſent the Apoſtles immediately by himſelfe, and hee ſends Miniſters at
this day mediatly by the meanes and authority of the Church.</p>
               <p>Now there are good uſes to be made of this point, ſome that do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
us Miniſters, and ſome that doe concerne you.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> ſeeing it is Chriſt that ſends us, <hi>hee will aſsist and bleſſe us in our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">For Ministers.</note>
as <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. <hi>Goe and teach all nations, and baptize them in the name
of the Father, and of the Sonne, and of the holy Ghoſt, And loe, I am with you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
to the end of the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> ſeeing it is Chriſt that ſends us, we muſt doe the buſineſſe
and the worke he ſends us to doe; ſo Chriſt ſaith of himſelfe, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 30.
<hi>Becauſe I ſeeke not mine owne will, but the will of my Father that ſent mee.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> If a
Merchant ſhould ſend his ſervant beyond ſea to bee a Factor for him,
who ſhould apply himſelfe to gather money, and to make an eſtate to
himſelfe, neglecting his maſter, hee may looke for a cold welcome
home; ſo ſeeing he hath ſent us to bee Factors for him, and to doe his
buſineſſe, if wee ſhall apply our ſelves to get money, and to make an
eſtate to our ſelves, and ſo leave the Lords buſineſſe undone, wee may
looke for a cold welcome home, when we ſhall goe to God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, ſeeing it is Chriſt that ſent us, we muſt give our accompt to
him at the day of judgement, for every man muſt give account to him
that ſends him; we ſee <hi>Luke</hi> 10. that the Diſciples being ſent of Chriſt
to preach, they returne againe and give account of that they have done;
And ſo in <hi>Iob.</hi> 2. the divell being ſent of God, returnes againe to tell
what he hath done. Now the uſes that concerne you be theſe:</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> ſeeing it is Chriſt that ſends Preachers, yee muſt learne to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
the great goodneſſe of Chriſt,<note place="margin">For the people.</note> that he would make any ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to ſuch as ye be;<note place="margin">1</note> it had beene much if he had ſent to us men, when
we had ſought him and turned to him, but that he ſhould ſend when we
had not a thought of him, but were ſinning againſt him, this is a farre
greater mercy, therefore how thankefull ſhould we be to Chriſt that he
ſends to us? <hi>Daniel</hi> chap. 6. 22. doth acknowledge this as a great bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
ſaith he, <hi>My God hath ſent his Angell, and hath ſhut the mouthes of the
Lions, that they have not hurt me;</hi> ſo wee are to acknowledge it a great
mercy and kindneſſe of God to ſend his Preachers and Miniſters, not
when wee lay bound in the Lions denne, but when wee lay faſt bound
with the divels, and hath preſerved us from them: It was a great kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe

and bade them leave all, and come into the land of Egypt, and willed

brethren were not ſo unkinde to him, as wee bee to Chriſt, and yet
wee may ſee the goodneſſe and the mercy of the Lord Ieſus that hee

               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> ſeeing Chriſt ſent Preachers and Teachers, then it is your
duties to receive them; <hi>Eſay</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Lord ſent me,</hi> and <hi>Ieremie</hi> ſaid ſo,
when the people would have ſtoned him: one would thinke it were
enough to ſtrike terrour into the hearts of men, to doe any injury to Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,
when they know the Lord ſent them; and although there bee
nothing in themſelves to cauſe us men to doe it, yet wee muſt receive
them for Chriſts ſake. The Apoſtles ſaith 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 20. <hi>Now then are we Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors
for Chriſt, as though God did beſeech you through us; We pray you in
Chriſts ſtead that yee would bee reconciled unto God:</hi> And therefore ſeeing
Chriſt ſends the Miniſters, and they come of the Lords meſſage, it
ſhould be your care thankefully to receive them.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Secondly, their commiſsion to what end they were ſent.</note> 
                  <hi>their Commiſſion, to what end they were ſent;</hi> to the same end
that Chriſt was, <hi>As my Father ſent me, ſo ſend I you, Luk.</hi> 19. 10. it is ſaid, <hi>The
ſonne of man is come to ſeeke and to ſave that which was loſt;</hi> Now all true
Preachers are ſent to the ſame end,<note place="margin">1</note> to ſeeke and to ſave that which is
loſt: Men are loſt in ſinne, and runne away from God, the Preachers
therefore are ſent to ſeeke that which is loſt, and to bring them home
againe: ſo it is an eaſie matter to go into the wilderneſſe, but it is a hard
matter to finde the way out againe; It is an eaſie matter to goe into the
world, O but it is a hard matter to be brought to God; therefore when
men have loſt themſelves in their ſinnes, and runne away from God, as
farre as the <hi>prodigall ſonne</hi> ran from his Father, the true Preachers are ſent
to ſeeke them up againe, and to bring them to God.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> Chriſt was ſent <hi>not to call the righteous but ſinners to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi>
as appeares <hi>Mat.</hi> 9. 13. to the ſame end all true Preachers are ſent,
to bring men to Repentance, to convert them to God and to turne them
from their evill courſes, to a hatred and deteſtation of ſinne and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> Chriſt came <hi>To preach deliverance to the captives,</hi> as appeares
<hi>Luk.</hi> 4. 18. All men by nature are become captives to the devill and ſlaves
to ſinne, being unable to helpe themſelves, whrefore God, ſeeing mans
miſery, ſent his onely Sonne Ieſus Chriſt, to take mans nature upon him,
thereby to ſet at liberty and free mankinde out of the vaſſalage of ſinne
and Satan: and to this end alſo are the Preachers ſent as the Apoſtle
<hi>Paul</hi> witneſſes, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 25. <hi>In meekneſſe inſtructing thoſe that oppoſe, if God
peradventure will give them repentance, that they may know the truth and that
they may recover themſelves out of the ſnare of the devill, who are are taken cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
by him at his will:</hi> therefore let us not ſtand in our owne light, but let
us now ariſe to lay hold on ſo great a good, as the redemption of our
ſoules and bodies from the miſerable ſlavery of ſinne and Satan, which
now is offered unto us by the Miniſters of the Word of God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the <hi>Ability Chriſt gave them to performe their charge; hee brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
on them,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Thirdly, the abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity Chriſt gives them.</note> 
                  <hi>and ſaid to them, Receive the holy Ghoſt:</hi> wherein two things
are to be obſerved:</p>
               <list>
                  <pb n="345" facs="tcp:17958:178"/>
                  <item>1 What He gives them.</item>
                  <item>2 By what ſigne.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>What he gives them;</hi> the holy Ghoſt: all our preaching can doe
no good,<note place="margin">Firſt, what he gives.</note> till it pleaſeth Chriſt to ſend the holy Ghoſt, and to mingle
his ſpirit with our ſpeeches and words, that it may be effectuall to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
men, to beget faith, and increaſe grace in us. This is an excellent
bleſſing that it pleaſeth Chriſt to mingle his Spirit with our words; ſo
that the ſpirit of Chriſt attends the Miniſterie of his word, as the apoſtle
ſaith 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6. <hi>Who alſo hath made <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> able Miniſters of the new Teſtament,
not of the letter, but of the ſpirit; for the letter killeth, but the ſpirit giveth life:</hi>
It is called the Miniſtration of the ſpirit, becauſe the holy Ghoſt doth
attend it, and make it fruitfull and effectuall: Therefore this is excellent
comfort to all Gods people, that it pleaſeth Chriſt to mingle his ſpirit
with the words of the Preacher, for if a Preacher have but a little ſparke
of the ſpirit of Chriſt, he is able to doe much: We ſee if a man have but
a little ſparke of fire, let him come to a houſe of gun-powder, and this
ſparke will be a meanes to diſſolve and bring the whole fabricke to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
by blowing it up: So if a Preacher have but a little ſparke of the
ſpirit of Chriſt, it will diſſolve this ſame huge houſe of corruption that
the divell hath, and at length bring it to nothing: Therefore it is good
for men to attend the word and regard it, for Chriſt doth not ſend the
bare Miniſtery of his word only, but he giveth his ſpirit with it alſo.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Secondly, how he gives the holy Ghoſt.</note> 
                  <hi>by what ſigne he gave the holy Ghoſt; He breathed on them:</hi> Now
we are not to thinke that this breath was the Holy Ghoſt it ſelfe, for it
was but a meere winde, or aire, but we may ſafely ſay and thinke it was a
ſigne of it; ſo wee ſee <hi>Eſai.</hi> 6. 7. <hi>And he laid it upon my mouth and ſaid, Loe,
this hath touched thy lips, and thine iniquitie ſhall bee taken away, and thy ſinnes
ſhall be purged;</hi> wee may not thinke that the Prophets ſinnes were taken
away by touching his lips with a coale from the Altar; for it was onely
a ſigne of it; ſo alſo <hi>Zech.</hi> 3. 3, 4. <hi>Now Ioſhua was cloathed with filthy gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and he ſtood before the Angell. And hee anſwered and ſpake unto thoſe
that ſtood before him, Take away the filthy garments from him. And unto him he
ſaid, Behold, I have cauſed thine iniquities to depart fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thee.</hi> Here we are not to
thinke the Angell tooke away <hi>Ioſhuas</hi> ſinne by the outward act of taking
away his filthy garments; for this was nothing but a ſigne of it, that as he
tooke away thoſe filthy garments from him,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſo God did by his inward
grace, take from him all his ſins and iniquities: in like manner Chriſt by
breathing on the Diſciples gave them a ſigne that hee would alſo give
them the holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>But why did Chriſt give it by a ſigne?<note place="margin">1</note> that men might know that
they had received of the ſame ſpirit which was in Chriſt; we ſee when
<hi>Moſes</hi> did ordaine Elders, <hi>Hee laid his hands upon them,</hi> that men might
know that they received of the ſame ſpirit that <hi>Moſes</hi> had, ſo Chriſt did
breathe on them, that they might know they had of the ſame ſpirit of
Chriſt in them.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> it was for the more aſſurance that he gave it by an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
ſigne; for when men doe know that the ſpirit of Chriſt is in them,
and are perſwaded of it, it makes them regard and attend it.</p>
               <p>

Fourthly, <hi>The authoritie, whoſe ſinnes yee binde on Earth ſhall bee bound in
Heaven,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">4</note> 
                  <hi>and whoſe ſinnes yee retaine ſhall be retained:</hi> Now here is great po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer

                  <hi>Whoſe ſinnes ye binde on Earth ſhall be bound in Heaven, and whoſe
ſinnes ye looſe on Earth ſhalbe looſed in Heaven:</hi> But yee Muſt know this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
is not given to our perſons, but to our function: this ſame binding and
looſing is a Metaphor or borrowed ſpeech taken from a man that is faſt
bound in fetters and chaines, ſo as he is not able to ſtirre till he bee unloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed:
ſo every man by nature is, bound in fetters and chaines with his ſins,
and cannot be looſed, till God ſends true Preachers to looſe them: as we
may ſee when <hi>Lazarus</hi> was in the Grave,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> though hee had life in him, yet
he was not able to come forth, being bound with his Napkins, and cloths
till hee was unbound: ſo when the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> had taken <hi>Sampſon,</hi> they
bound him,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and laid fetters and chaines upon him: In like manner the
Divell doth lay ſpirituall fetters and chaines upon us, ſo as we are not able
to ſtir in the life of holineſſe, till the Lord ſend Preachers to us, to unlooſe
us:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> Therefore as a man that is in fetters and chains, when the Iaylor comes
to knocke off his chaines and fetters, though he be never ſo much pinched
and pained, yet he will hold ſtill and take it in good part, becauſe he ſhall
bee freed and ſet at liberty; ſo when the Preachers come to breake off our
gives and chaines, though it bee more painefull than before, yet we muſt
take it in good part, becauſe we ſhall be ſet at liberty by it.</p>
               <p>Now two waies a Miniſter may forgive ſinnes:<note place="margin">How a Miniſter forgives ſinnes; two waies.</note> Firſt, <hi>By pronouncing
forgiveneſſe of ſinnes to ſuch as doe repent and beleeve,</hi> as the Prieſts in the old
Law did pronounce thoſe that were made cleane, to bee cleane: ſo a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
when hee ſees a man throughly waſhed and purified by the teares of
true repentance,<note place="margin">1</note> may without feare abſolve that man from all his ſinnes,
and iniquities. But how can this be, may ſome man ſay, ſeeing it is God
onely that doth forgive ſinne? I anſwer, There bee two Courts; there is
the Court of Heaven, and there is the Court of this World: In the Court
of Heaven, none but God can forgive; but in the Court of this World, a
Miniſter may forgive, upon the true confeſſion that a man may make, and
the hearty repentance he may ſee in him, he neede not feare to pronounce
unto him the forgiveneſſe of his ſinnes.</p>

                  <hi>By way of authoritie,</hi> (not as the Papiſts do) but when in diſtres

               <p>Now in this appearance there bee foure things to bee conſidered:</p>

                  <item>2. The Time of it.</item>

               </list>
               <p>The <hi>Occaſion</hi> was,<note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>To heale the infidelitie of all his Diſciples;</hi> for hee had
now but one that did remaine in infidelitie;<note place="margin">The occaſion of Chriſts appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</note> therefore hee comes to cure
that one. Here we ſee the tender care of Chriſt, that having but one Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciple
that did remaine in unbeleefe, yet could not be at reſt, till hee had
cured that one: ſo we ſee the care of Chriſt doth not onely extend in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
to al his Diſciples, but alſo in particular to everie one; which is a
ſweete comfort to a Chriſtian, that the care of Chriſt is not onely in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
for the good of the Church, but in particular for every one: ſo that if
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:17958:180"/>
there bee but one weake and fraile member, Chriſt hath a care of that one.
It is ſaid, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 10. 3. that <hi>The good ſhepheard calleth his owne ſheepe by name;</hi>
Hee doth not onely know the groſſe ſumme, and keepe the whole tale of
them, but he knowes every particular one: If there be but one man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
that doth belong to him, Chriſt hath a care of him; as wee ſee in that
parable, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. <hi>Of a man that had an hundred ſheepe, whereof when one
of them goes aſtray, hee leaves the ninetie and nine, and goes and ſeekes for
that one ſheepe:</hi> If there bee but one weake and fraile member, Chriſt will
have a care of that one; for he himſelfe ſaith, <hi>Iohn</hi> 9. 18. <hi>Of them that thou
haſt given me, I have not loſt one:</hi> ſo that if wee can once bring our ſelves to
be members of Chriſt, he will regard and have a care of us. This is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
comfort to Gods people; for as <hi>Numb.</hi> 12. 15. When <hi>Miriam</hi> was
ſhut out of the Hoſt for her ſinne, the Lord would not let the <hi>Arke</hi> remove
till ſhe was recovered and brought in againe; ſo if there be but one gone
aſtray, God will never reſt till he have it home againe: Therefore as Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> ſaith boldly, where hee doth apply Chriſt unto himſelfe particularly,
<hi>Galath.</hi> 2. 20. <hi>Nevertheleſſe I live, yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in mee, and the
life I now live in the fleſh, I live by the faith of the Sonne of God, who hath loved
me, and given himſelfe for me:</hi> for when Chriſt was on the croſſe, he did not
onely eye the generall good of the Church, but in particular, <hi>England,
Eſſex, Clavering,</hi> and ſo of every particular man and woman; which may
comfort us, howſoever wee may erre and goe aſtray, yet if wee belong to
Chriſt, there will bee a time when Chriſt will have a care of us, and bring
us backe againe to God; for there was but one Diſciple that did remaine
in infidelitie, and Chriſt had a care of that.</p>
               <p>But let us enquire, what were the cauſes that <hi>Thomas</hi> remained in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleefe:
there be two cauſes expreſſed in the Text.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Becauſe hee was away when Chriſt came,</hi> hee remaines in his unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe;
here wee ſee what a loſſe it is to bee abſent from holy meetings,<note place="margin">Firſt, the cauſe of Thomaſ's un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleefe.</note>
for thoughg it be but once (for <hi>Thomas</hi> was but once away) yet he loſt the
ſight of Chriſt; if he had beene preſent with the reſt of the Diſciples,
then it is like as they did beleeve, hee would have beleeved; for they
were as deepe in infidelity as hee; but they being met together when
Chriſt came were cured of it, and it is very likely if <hi>Thomas</hi> had beene
there, hee would have beene alſo; therefore wee may ſee what a loſſe
he had by being abſent from holy meetings: Now when the Diſciples
met <hi>Thomas,</hi> they told him that <hi>they had ſeene the Lord;</hi> they had ſeene
him that had triumphed over death, and the grave, and you have not; ſo
Chriſtians may ſay when they have beene at holy meetings, wee have
ſeene Chriſt in the face of the Goſpell, we have had motions of faith
and of repentance, wee have beene brought to the ſight of our ſinnes,
and you have not: therefore little doe men know, what a loſſe they
have by being abſent from holy meetings, though it bee but once;
for <hi>Luk.</hi> 8. 9. the Word is compared to <hi>ſeede,</hi> and why? becauſe although
the land be good, yet it is hardened and beareth nothing till it be plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and ſowne,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſo the increaſe comes of the ſeede: if a man ſhould ſteale,
but a pecke of ſeede from one, he doth him more hurt, than if he ſhould
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:17958:180"/>
ſteale a buſhell of corne out of his barne, becauſe hee ſteales away his
increaſe; ſo our hearts being barren till the Word of God be ſowne in
them, when the devill ſteales away but a little of this ſeede of the
Word, hee doth us more hurt than the world can doe otherwiſe, and
that by keeping us away From theſe holy meetings, becauſe hee ſteales
away out increaſe of grace. Wee read <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 6. That the Angell
ſaith to <hi>Cornelius, ſend for Peter, and he ſhall ſpeake words unto thee whereby
thou ſhall be ſaved, and all thine houſe:</hi> ſo a man may chance to bee abſent
at that time when hee might heare words that hee might bee ſaved by,
for who knowes whether that time might not bee the time of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion,
and the time of his repentance? and therefore little doth a
man know what hee may loſe by being abſent but one time from holy
meetings; <hi>Thomas</hi> was away but once when Chriſt came, and wee ſee
how grievouſly hee fell in infidelity: and this was the firſt reaſon why
he remained an unbeleever.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">The ſecond cauſe of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleefe of Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas.</note> 
                  <hi>Thomas preſcribed a law of beleeving to himſelfe,</hi> and put on a

why hee remained in unbeleefe: and yet there was matter enough

before that <hi>he ſhould riſe the third day;</hi> and he had ſeene Chriſt raiſe <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

out of the grave a little before; beſides the Diſciples told him that
Chriſt was riſen; and hee had the Teſtimonies both of the Angels and
women, notwithſtanding all which <hi>Thomas</hi> makes this Law to himſelfe;
which may teach us, that wee muſt take <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eed how wee preſcribe a law
unto our ſelves, that we will not beleeve, nor repent, except God doe
ſo and ſo for us: <hi>Iob.</hi> 4. 48. our Saviour ſaith unto a certaine Ruler, <hi>Yee
will not beleeve unleſſe ye ſee ſignes and wonders;</hi> ſo <hi>Matth.</hi> 27. 42. the Iewes
ſay to Chriſt, <hi>Let him come downe from the croſſe, and wee will beleeve him:</hi>
and 2 <hi>King.</hi> 5. 11. it is ſaid of <hi>Naaman, But Naaman was wroth and went
may, and ſaid, Behold, I thought with my ſelfe, he will ſurely come out, and ſtand
and call on the name of the Lord his God, and put his hands on the place, and heale
the Leyer:</hi> and if his ſervant had not beene wiſer than himſelfe, he had
gone away a Leper, as he came; therefore every man muſt take heede
how hee preſcribes a law of beleeving unto himſelfe. But what law
was this that <hi>Thomas</hi> made? I anſwere, a ſtrange, unjuſt, and unequall
law; for, ſaith he, <hi>Except I ſee in his hands the print of nailes, and put my fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
into the print of the nailes, and thruſt my hand into his ſide, I will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve.</hi>
Now there is nothing more contrary to true faith than this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 1. <hi>Faith is the ſubſtance of things hoped for,
and the evidence of things not ſeene:</hi> in naturall things, we have firſt experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and after wee beleeve, as feeling fire to be hot, when we have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of it, then wee beleeve it to be hot, and feeling water to bee
cold, we beleeve it to be cold; ſo experience goeth before, and faith fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
after; but in divinity, faith goeth before, and experience followes
after; for wee muſt beleeve though wee have no experience: ſo then
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:17958:181"/>
this law that <hi>Thomas</hi> makes is contrary to true faith: I dare ſay wee are
all ready to condemne <hi>Thomas,</hi> but there be a number of us whoſe caſes
be like this, they will beleeve no longer than they ſee with their eyes,
and feele with their hand the goodneſſe of the Lord to them; and
when ſenſe and feeling failes them, then their faith failes them: ſo <hi>Iudg.</hi>
6. 13. the Angell ſaith to <hi>Gideon, God be with thee thou valiant man:</hi> ſaith
he, <hi>O my Lord, if the Lord be with us, why then is all this come upon us?</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
hee could not ſee Gods goodneſſe, and feele it with his fingers,
therefore he did not beleeve: but we muſt take heed we doe not tye our
faith to the ſenſe, ſight or feeling, but to relye upon God, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
in him againſt ſenſe and reaſon, and to ſhut up our eyes, and reſt in
the bare promiſes of God, as that holy man, <hi>Iob</hi> 13. 15. ſaith, <hi>Though
thou kill me, yet will I trust in thee;</hi> hee relied upon God againſt ſenſe and
reaſon: ſo Chriſt when he did hang on the croſſe, he reſted himſelfe by
faith on his fathers good will, and therefore cries out, <hi>My God, my God,
why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> ſo alſo <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 73. 26. <hi>My fleſh faileth, and
mine heart alſo, but God is the ſtrength of mine heart, and my portion for ever:</hi>
therefore <hi>Thomas</hi>'s law is unjuſt, unequall and contrary to faith.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing is,<note place="margin">Secondly, the time when Chriſt appeared.</note> 
                  <hi>the Time</hi> when Chriſt appeared, <hi>eight daies after;</hi>
ſo long <hi>Thomas</hi> lay in his ſinnes, and longer would have lyen, if Chriſt
had not come: here wee are to take notice of our corruption, how
prone we are to fall into any ſinne, and how difficult and hard a matter
it is to recover againe; for being once plunged in, of our ſelves wee
have no minde to recover, or to come out of our ſinnes, till Chriſt bring
us backe againe: an example hereof wee have in <hi>David,</hi> who after hee
had committed the great ſinnes of adultery, and murther, lay in ſinne
a whole yeare, and longer would have lyen in it, if the Prophet <hi>Nathan</hi>
had not come and told him of his ſinne: So the people of Iſrael, <hi>Amos</hi>
4. 11. when the Lord brought a number of judgements upon them, <hi>Yet
have yee not returned unto me, ſaith the Lord.</hi> This then we ſee is a fearefull
and lamentable corruption of our natures that wee ſoone fall into ſinne,
but when we be fallen, wee have no minde to recover, nor turne backe
againe, till Chriſt bring us backe: as appeares plainely <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 60.
When <hi>Peter</hi> had denied Chriſt his Maſter, hee ranne further into ſinne,
till Chriſt caſt a gratious eye on him, even ſo when wee ſinne againſt
God, we ſhall goe further and further, till hee caſt a gratious eye on us.
Now the reaſon why Chriſt came not till the eighth day, are chiefly
theſe two following:</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Two reaſons why Christ ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared the eighth day.</note> to ſanctifie this day as the Chriſtian Sabbath, and to dedicate it;
here wee may obſerve they had not a word of Chriſt all the dayes of the
weeke beſides; but when the eight day came, then Chriſt did appeare to
them: which may teach us to walke in the ſtrength of that we get one Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,
till the next, for it may bee wee ſhall not heare a word of Chriſt,
till the next Sabboth: therefore it muſt bee our wiſedome to get ſo much
at one baite, as may ſerve to carrie us to another; even as Travellers will
ſo refreſh themſelves at one time, as that it may carry them to the next
baiting place, ſo ſeeing we have a long journey to goe, wee muſt ſo refreſh
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:17958:181"/>
our ſelves on the Sabbath, as that it may comfortably carry us to the next
Lords day.</p>
               <p>Secondly, to teach us that although wee cannot keepe our <hi>Eaſter</hi> with
Chriſt and his Diſciples <hi>the firſt day,</hi> yet we ſhould labour to keepe it with
<hi>Thomas the eighth day;</hi> that is, if we cannot be of the firſt ranke of beleevers,
yet let us labour to be of the ſecond ranke, as <hi>Numb.</hi> 9. 6. <hi>There were certain
men that were defiled with a dead man,</hi> ſo as <hi>they might not eate of the Paſſeover
the ſame day, therefore they came to Moſes</hi> for reſolution; he referres the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to God, and the Lord anſweres them, that he that could not take it the
<hi>firſt moneth in the ſeaſon,</hi> muſt take it the <hi>ſecond Moneth:</hi> ſo if we cannot bee
of the firſt ranke of beleevers: Let us labour to bee of the ſecond ranke, if
not of the ſecond, then let us labour to bee of the third ranke, if not of the
third (rather than to be of none) let us labour to be of the laſt: as <hi>Math.</hi> 20.
the <hi>laborers</hi> that were ſent into the vineyard,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſome came in at the <hi>firſt houre,</hi>
ſome at the <hi>fourth,</hi> and ſome at the <hi>eleventh</hi> houre: ſo if wee cannot bee of
the firſt ranke of thoſe that beleeve and repent them of their ſinnes, yet let
us labour to bee of the ſecond ſort, nay to come into an eſtate of grace,
though it be in the laſt houre.</p>
               <p>The third thing is,<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>The manner that he appeared in,</hi> it was in the ſame ſort
as he did appeare before;<note place="margin">The manner how Chriſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared.</note> for he came in <hi>When the Doores were ſhut, and ſtood
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ngſt them,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>Peace bee unto you,</hi> and ſhewed them his hands and
feete: But why did Chriſt appeare in this manner? There were two rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of it:</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Why Chriſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared thus.</note> 
                  <hi>To confirme the faith of the Diſciples,</hi> for no doubt they had told to
<hi>Thomas</hi> before, how Chriſt was riſen and had appeared to them before,
and therefore Chriſt comes in the ſame manner to confirme their faith.<note place="margin">1</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>Becauſe Thomas had ſaid in a private meeting, that hee would not
beleeve unleſſe he did ſee;</hi> therefore Chriſt anſwered him in his owne words
and ſpeeches: which may teach us that Chriſt overheares us every word
we ſpeake in our private houſes, in our chambers, when wee ſpeake of this
friend and that, of this body and that, and will relate them at the day of
judgement, even the ſame words we ſpeake; therefore every man muſt be
carefull of his ſpeech, and of his words, that he doe not ſpeake filthy or idle
words, for at the day of judgement Chriſt will repeat them all againe:
as <hi>Hoſea</hi> 7. 2. ſaith the Lord, <hi>And they conſidered not in their hearts that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
all their wickedneſſe.</hi> this is the reaſon why men run into ſinne and
wickedneſſe, becauſe they doe not conſider that God remembers it, for
if they did, then they would not doe as they doe; they would not ſpeake a
word, or thinke a thought contrary to Gods will.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thomas</hi> indeede was much too blame to preſcribe ſuch a law to Chriſt,
and yet notwithſtanding, ſuch was the goodneſſe and mercy of Chriſt,
that he yeelds to his weakneſſe: And why doth Chriſt yeeld to him? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he did ſee there was a deſire in him to beleeve and repent, therefore
<hi>Chriſt</hi> yeelds to him and his weakneſſe: Hence we may learne that ſuch is
the goodneſſe and mercie of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to ſinnefull men, that notwithſtanding
they preſcribe unjuſt and unequall lawes as <hi>Thomas</hi> did, yet he will yeeld
to their weakneſſe, if they have a true deſire to beleeve. So <hi>Marke</hi> 5. 23.
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:17958:182"/>
It is ſaid, <hi>The Ruler of the Synagogue came unto Chriſt, and beſought him that
hee would come and lay his hands upon his daughter, and heale her;</hi> where hee
preſcribed a kinde of law, in thinking that unleſſe hee would come to her,
he could not helpe her; and if ſhee were dead, hee could not give her life
againe: yet notwithſtanding <hi>Chriſt</hi> condeſcends and yeelds to his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and goeth and helpeth his daughter: This is the goodneſſe and
mercy of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to yeeld to our weakneſſe. Now here are two queſtions to
bee anſwered.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>Whether there bee any wounds in a glorified body or no;</hi> ſeeing Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Whether there be wounds in a glorified body.</note> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 43. <hi>That it is ſowne in diſhonour, it riſeth againe in honour,
it is ſowne in weakneſſe, and it riſeth in power?</hi> I anſwer, that commonly and
ordinarily there is no wounds nor ſcars in a glorified body, for as there is
glory in one part, ſo there is glory in all the parts, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith of
death, that it is not in one part but in all; ſo (ſaith he) there is not glory
in one part, but there is glory in every part; and therefore commonly
and ordinarily a glorified body hath no wounds: but that Chriſts body
had wounds in it, it was by ſpeciall diſpenſation, for our good and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
that wee might have faith in the reſurrection of Chriſt, for hee was
contented for our good and benefit to abate of his glory; this ſhould
teach us that wee ſhould be content to abate of our glory for the good
of our brethren: and it is not mine but the leſſon which S. <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth
us, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>Let the ſame minde be in you that was in Christ, who humbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
and became obedient to the death of the croſſe for our good;</hi> therefore wee
ſhould bee contented to humble our ſelves and to doe good to our
brethren.</p>
               <p>The ſecond queſtion is,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>why hee would have his Diſciples to looke on his
wounds?</hi> I anſwer, to ſhew them where the comfort of a Chriſtian was,
not in Chriſts walking on the water, or raiſing of the dead, or caſting
out of devils, or cleanſing of the Lepers, but in Chriſts bleeding and
dying on the croſſe: ſo the comfort of a Chriſtian is from the wounds
of Christ.</p>
               <p>The fourth generall point is,<note place="margin">Fourthly, the effect of Chriſts appearing.</note> 
                  <hi>The effect and fruit of his appearing; Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi>
converſion: for he preſently ſaith with great affection, <hi>my Lord, and my
God:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, what a pitifull eſtate was I in, I might have pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed
in mine infidelity and unbeleefe, if thou hadſt not condeſcended
to my weakeneſſe; therefore ſeeing thou haſt ſhewed ſo great mercy,
<hi>Thou art my God and my Lord:</hi> ſo a Chriſtian may ſay, when he feeles the
goodneſſe and the mercy of Chriſt unto him, in the pardon of his ſinnes,
O Lord, I thanke thee, I might have periſhed in mine ignorance and
blindneſſe, I was going the broad way to hell, and it hath pleaſed thee
to give me faith in thy promiſes, repentance for my ſinnes, care to walke
before thee in newneſſe of life; thou art therefore my God and my
Lord, I am glad and I rejoyce in it.</p>

                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Why it was needfull that Chriſt ſhould Aſcend:</hi> Howſoever wee may
thinke it had beene better for Chriſt to converſe with us here, yet Chriſt
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:17958:183"/>
tels us,<note place="margin">ARTI. VI.</note> that it is for our good and benefit that he doth aſcend, <hi>Iohn</hi> 16. 7.
<hi>It is expedient for you that I goe away, for if I goe not away the Comforter will not
come unto you:</hi> For as the Sunne doth us more good being in the Skie,
than if it were amongſt us,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> becauſe then every Hill and Houſe, and every
Barne would keepe the light from us: ſo if Chriſt were perſonally heere
amongſt us, then hee would be confined to one Countrey, Towne, Houſe,
or to one Man; and when he were preſent in one place, he would be abſent
in another: Therefore as the Sunne being in the Skie, doth ſend out his
light, heate, and beames to all; So Chriſt being in Heaven doth infuſe
his graces unto all his people every where: Now this argument of utility
may make us quietly reſt on God;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> for as a mother when ſhe is going from
her childe, uſes to ſtill and quiet it by ſaying, hold thy peace, I will fetch
thee a good thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo Chriſt did ſtill his Diſciples when they were in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſſe.
It is for your good that I goe away, to convey the rich graces of
my Spirit to you. There be five reaſons why Chriſt aſcended.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Five Reaſons why Chriſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended.</note> 
                  <hi>To prepare a place for us,</hi> for wee cannot alwaies live here in this
World, a time will come when wee muſt away; and therefore Chriſt is
gone to prepare a place for us, that when Earth excludes us, Heaven may
receive us;<note place="margin">1</note> when we part with men, wee may goe to God; and when wee
leave theſe Earthly houſes, wee may have in Heaven a Manſion houſe. As
Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. 4. <hi>I goe to prepare a place for you; If I goe not away, the
Comforter will not come; But if I goe, I will come againe, and receive you to my
ſelfe; that where I am, there may ye be alſo:</hi> For (as I ſaid) Chriſt is gone to
prepare a place for us, and to hold poſſeſſion for us, till wee bee ready to
enter and take poſſeſſion our ſelves: As <hi>Genes.</hi> 45. it is ſaid, <hi>That Ioſeph was
ſent into Egypt to prepare a place for his old father,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> and <hi>for his bretheren and to
take up the beſt of the land:</hi> So the true <hi>Ioſeph Chriſt</hi> is gone into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to prepare a place for us, even the beſt, Heaven it ſelfe, and to take poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſion
till we come and enter our ſelves, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. <hi>To an inheritance immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
and undefiled, and that fadeth not, reſerved in Heaven for us.</hi> This inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
is kept in the hands of our Lord Ieſus, till wee bee ready for it, who
will faithfully deliver it to us: Even as a Guardian doth not take up land
for himſelfe,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> but for the Heire, who when the time doth come, doth wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
reſigne it againe to him: So Chriſt is aſcended into Heaven to take
poſſeſſion of it for us, and when the time comes, hee will faithfully deliver
it to us. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 6. It is ſaid, <hi>God hath raiſed us up together, and made us ſit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in heavenly places in Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Here <hi>Augustine</hi> ſaith, we ſit not in our
ſelves, nor in our owne perſons; but Chriſt ſits in our right, till wee bee
ready for it. This is a ſweet comfort to a Chriſtian in all extremitie, that
Heaven is our inheritance, and Chriſt ſits there in our right till wee bee
ready for it; well may death take away our lives bad neighbors our good
name, theeves our goods, but they cannot take Heaven from us: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a poore chriſtian may ſay, though I am not a great man in this world,
though I have no great Revenewes, Lands or Livings, yet I thanke God
Heaven is mine Inheritance, Chriſt doth keepe poſſeſſion of it till I am
ready: And when he lookes up to Heaven, he may ſay, There is my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
there is my houſe, Chriſt holds poſſeſſion of it, and one day hee will
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:17958:183"/>
faithfully deliver it to me. If a ſtranger ſhould goe into a farre countrey,
if he ſhould ſee a number of little Cabbins or Cottages, and but one brave
Building,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and asking whoſe houſe it is, a poore man ſhould anſwere and
ſay, It is mine houſe, a good friend did purchaſe it with a great deale of
gold and ſilver for mee, and one day I ſhall have it; would not this man
thinke that his eſtate were good, though hee dwelt now in a Cottage a
while? So we dwelling in Cottages of clay in this World, if one ſhould
aske us when we looke up to Heaven, whoſe houſe is this? and be anſwered
by any of Gods people, it is mine; I thanke God, Ieſus Chriſt hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed
it, not with gold and ſilver, but with his moſt pretious blood, and
one day I ſhall have it; would not every man thinke this mans caſe to bee
good, and hee a bleſſed man. This is the firſt reaſon why Chriſt is aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
into Heaven.</p>
               <p>Now if Chriſt bee aſcended to Heaven to prepare Heaven for us, then
every man muſt prepare himſelfe, and make him ready to receive Heaven:

               <p>Secondly, Chriſt aſcended into Heaven, <hi>To ſend downe the Holy Ghoſt
into the hearts of his ſervants;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2</note> as hee ſaith, <hi>Iohn</hi> 16. 7. <hi>It is expedient for you

                  </gap>e
of grace, but it muſt bee by the Holy Ghoſt, for as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,
1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 12. 3. <hi>No man can ſay Ieſus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> yet
he full meaſure of grace, and the abundance of the holy Ghoſt was not
given till Chriſt aſcended, but was reſerved till then: therefore <hi>Iohn</hi> 7. 30.
It is ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>id, <hi>That the Holy Ghoſt was not given, becauſe Chriſt was not aſcended:</hi>
Even as a King,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> whoſe gifts beſtowed on his Favourites are but petty, till
hee bee inſtalled, and then bee they great gifts; ſo the gifts of the Spirit
be given but in a ſmall meaſure, till Chriſt was aſcended, and then were
they great gifts, unto which hee daily addes more gifts and graces of his
Spirit ſtill:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> as a loving husband when hee is abſent from his wife, will bee
ſending of love-tokens; ſome Gold-rings, Iewels or Pearles to comfort
and to cheare her; ſending ſtill by every meſſenger that comes one thing
or other, till hee himſelfe comes home: ſo Chriſt being abſent from us,
doth ſend unto us Rings, Pearles, and Iewels, even the gifts and graces of
his Spirit untill he come. This is a great comfort, howſoever wee want
the preſence of Chriſt here, ſo long as wee have his Spirit to aſſure us of
Gods favour and of the pardon of our ſinnes, and that Heaven is ours, all
is well wee know: 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 2. 9. <hi>When Elias was to depart from Eliſha,</hi> ſaith
be,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> 
                  <hi>Aske what I ſhall give thee: Eliſha anſwers, that thy ſpirit may bee doubled
upon me:</hi> So when Chriſt at his aſcenſion bids us aske what we would have,
we muſt make this requeſt; Lord, that thy Spirit may bee doubled upon
me, that ſo my minde may bee enlightned, my will ſanctified, and all my
affections rightly ordered.</p>
               <p>Now as Chriſt is aſcended to ſend down the graces of his ſpirit into our<note place="margin">Vſe</note>
                  <pb n="356" facs="tcp:17958:184"/>
hearts,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſo we muſt prepare our ſelves for it: as the <hi>Diſciples, Acts</hi> 1. 14.
<hi>Did all continue in Prayer and Supplications with one accord:</hi> ſo ſeeing the
Spirit is promiſed, let us read the Scriptures, meditate of them, pray,
and ſo make our ſelves fit to receive the holy Ghoſt. As 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 4. 10.

As Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 8. <hi>When hee aſcended up on high, heeled

his triumph is our triumph; there is not a true Chriſtian, but one day he
ſhall triumph over all his ſpirituall enemies, but it muſt be as Chriſt was.
For firſt he was killed, and throwne into the dens of theeves and death,
then he aroſe againe, and triumphed over all our ſpirituall enemies, and
did gloriouſly aſcend into Heaven: ſo when we bee killed and throwne

where is thy ſting? O Hell, where is thy victorie?</hi> and then wee ſhall aſcend
into Heaven. Therefore labour thou to bee a ſervant of God, and then
doubt not but as Chriſt triumphed over all our ſpirituall enemies, ſo
ſhalt thou; for as Chriſt ſpeakes, <hi>Iohn</hi> 16. 33. <hi>In the World yee ſhall have

<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 8. <hi>When hee aſcended up on high, he gave gifts to men:</hi> and verſe 10.
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:17958:184"/>
of the ſame Chapter, <hi>Hee that deſcended, is the ſame that aſcended farre above
all Heavens, that he might fill all things:</hi> ſo that the goodneſſe of Chriſt is
ſpread all the World over. Chriſts aſcenſion is like a tree, the rootes
whereof be in the Earth,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> but the fruite is above our heads, but ſhake the
tree, and the fruite will tumble at our feete; ſo the rootes of Chriſt bee
here amongſt us in this earth, here hee was conceived, borne, and here
he died, and roſe againe; I, but the fruit of Chriſt is in Heaven, above
our reach; but if we touch him by the hand of faith, and tongue of prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
then all the fruites tumble at our feete. This is a great comfort that
Chriſt is aſcended to give gifts to men, to fill all places with his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p>Now as Chriſts aſcenſion was for the good of the Church,<note place="margin">Vſe</note> and to
make men the better for it, ſo every man muſt make his aſcenſion like to
Chriſts, that the Church and the whole countrey may be the better for
it: And therefore haſt thou any aſcenſion from being a meane man;
Art thou become a gentleman from a meane man, a knight from a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
or lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c? Then make thy aſcenſion like to Chriſts, make the
Church the better for it, and the countrey where thou dwelleſt, not to
take gifts, but to give gifts, ſo that the Church and Countrey may have
comfort by thine honour and by thine aſcenſion.</p>
               <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5</note> Chriſt aſcended <hi>To make interceſsion for us;</hi> hee did proſtrate
himſelfe in the Garden,<note place="margin">To make inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for us.</note> and upon the croſſe, in the vale of his fleſh for
us, and now hee is aſcended into Heaven, to make the Court of Heaven
friendly and favourable unto us; for we know if we have a matter in the
law, or a friend on the bench, then the court of rigour is turned into a
court of favour;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſo ſeeing we have Chriſt our friend, who is aſcended
into Heaven, to make the Court of Heaven friendly to us, wee may bee
comforted, in that the Court of Iuſtice is turned into the Court of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
and the Court of rigor is become a Court of favour: <hi>Revel.</hi> 4. 3.
wee ſee the <hi>Throne of God</hi> was compaſſed with a <hi>Rainbow;</hi> Now the
Rainbow was a token of Gods mercy, and of his favor; to teach us that
that which was a Throne of Iuſtice, now is made by the means of Chriſt,
a Throne of mercie: and therefore <hi>Paul</hi> aſkes the queſtion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 34. <hi>Who
ſhall condemne us? It is Chriſt that dyed, yea or rather that is riſen againe, who is
even at the right hand of God to make interceſſion for us:</hi> Hence therefore let
us comfort our ſelves when we cannot pray, yet Chriſt prayes for us.</p>
               <p>But how doth Chriſt make interceſſion for us?<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> I anſwere,<note place="margin">How Chriſt makes interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for us.</note> there bee
two kinds of prayer, <hi>vocall prayer,</hi> and <hi>reall prayer;</hi> now wee are not to
thinke that Christ makes any <hi>vocall prayer,</hi> that hee doth proſtitute him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
at the feet of God,<note place="margin">1</note> as hee did in the garden, for this will not ſtand
with the majeſtie of Chriſt, who is <hi>the Iudge of all men, and God hath put
all judgement into his hands:</hi> but it is a <hi>reall prayer</hi> that hee makes; and
for your apprehenſion I will ſhew by a ſimilitude,<note place="margin">Reall Prayer what.</note> what <hi>Reall prayer</hi> is;
<hi>Exod.</hi> 2. little <hi>Moſes</hi> was put into an <hi>Arke,</hi> and throwne into the water,
<hi>Pharaohs</hi> daughter comming downe to waſh her, ſaw this Arke, and
cauſed it to bee brought her,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and when ſhe <hi>had opened it, ſhe ſaw the childe
weepe:</hi> now the childe ſpake never a word, and yet this weeping of the
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:17958:185"/>
childe was reall prayer unto her to ſhew mercy to it; ſo though Chriſt
ſpeake never a word, yet the preſenting of his body before God, is a
<hi>Reall prayer;</hi> effected two waies in his interceſſion.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">The firſt way of his Interceſſion.</note> by preſenting his pierced ſides, his nailed hands and feet, and
his bloody wounds; ſo Chriſts body doth ſpeake for us, when we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſpeake, and his blood cries, when wee cannot cry: for what was it
that did uphold <hi>Peter</hi> in his dangerous fall, but the fruite of Chriſts
prayer, as wee ſee <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 32. Hee ſaith unto him, <hi>I have prayed that thy
faith faile not:</hi> and ſo it is ſtill the fruit of Chriſts prayer that doth uphold
us; in confidence whereof we may ſay as Chriſt did to the Woman in
the Goſpell, <hi>Some body hath touched me, for I feele vertue to goe out of me:</hi>
even ſo may wee ſay when we feele ſtrength againſt ſinne, and grace in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed,
it comes not by my ſelfe nor by mine owne vertue, but by the
interceſſion of Chriſt; <hi>whoſe blood</hi> (as Saint <hi>Paul Heb.</hi> 12. 24. ſaith)
<hi>ſpeakes better things than the blood of Abel,</hi> for that cried for vengeance,
but the blood of Chriſt for mercy.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Chriſt doth not onely preſent his owne perſon, but alſo
every faithfull man and woman; as <hi>Exod.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2</note> 28. 29. we ſee when the <hi>high
Prieſt</hi> went into the holy place, hee carried before him the names of the
twelve Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſo Chriſt doth not onely preſent the names of
the twelve Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but the particular name of every faithfull
man and woman; therefore let this be our comfort when wee are dull
and cannot pray, that Chriſt is aſcended into heaven and preſents us
dayly before God.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> The unthankefull <hi>Butler</hi> did not remember <hi>Ioſeph,</hi>
notwithſtanding his kindeneſſe, O, but <hi>Ioſeph</hi> did not forget his old Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and his brethren, when he was advanced, but he ſaith to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi>
Sir I have a poore father and poore brethren in the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> they
are like to be famiſhed, they want bread; I pray thee ſir, that I may have
chariots to fetch them hither, that they may dwell in the beſt of the
land: and even ſo the true <hi>Ioſeph, Ieſus Chriſt</hi> remembers us to God, ſaith
he, Father I have a number of poore ſervants in the world troubled and
afflicted, I pray thee ſend for them, and let them enjoy the happineſſe I
have prepared for them. And this is the bleſſing wee have by the aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The ſecond point is,<note place="margin">Secondly, the time when Chriſt aſcended.</note> 
                  <hi>the time when Chriſt aſcended;</hi> laid downe in
three circumſtances:</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>after he was riſen;</hi> ſo it is in the order of the Creed, he was <hi>crucified,
dead,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>and buried, he deſcended into hell, the third day he roſe againe from the dead,
and then he aſcended into heaven;</hi> which muſt teach us, that we muſt never
looke to aſcend to heaven till we be riſen, for as Chriſt roſe out of the
grave before he aſcended, ſo we muſt riſe out of the grave of our ſins and
corruptions before we aſcend: therfore Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 6. <hi>Bleſſed
are they, that have their part in the firſt reſurrection, for on ſuch the ſecond death
hath no power:</hi> now there be two reſurrections; there is the riſing of the
<hi>ſoule out of ſin</hi> in this life, to newneſſe and holineſſe of life; and the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of the <hi>body at the day of judgement</hi> to immortality and everlaſting life:
therefore whoſoever thou bee, that doſt not labour to riſe in thy ſoule
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:17958:185"/>
out of the grave of thy ſinnes, to riſe (I ſay) to repentance, and a turning
to God in the care of an holy life, then thy body ſhall not bee raiſed to
immortality, and life everlaſting; but if thou labour to riſe out of thy
grave of ſinne and wickedneſſe to a holy life, then as Chriſt did riſe, and
afterwards aſcend, ſo ſhalt thou, but if thou doſt not, Chriſt ſhall aſcend,
and leave thee heere; nay, well it were if thou mighteſt remaine in this
life, but Chriſt ſhall aſcend to heaven, and thou ſhalt goe to hell; and
therefore let every one labour to riſe out of his ſinnes here in this life,
that he may aſcend with Chriſt into heaven. There be a number of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in the world thinke to aſcend to heaven, and goe to God, but if they
doe not riſe out of their ſinnes, but continue in them ſtill, they are like to
periſh in them. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 5. It is ſaid, <hi>By faith Enoch was tranſlated that hee
might not ſee death, and was not found, becauſe God had tranſlated him: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his tranſlation, he was reported of that he pleaſed God:</hi> ſo labour thou to
pleaſe God in a good courſe, and walke with him, ſo farre foorth as
frailty will permit, and then when thou parts from this world, thou
ſhalt be ſure to goe to God.</p>
               <p>The ſecond circumſtance is,<note place="margin">2</note> that it was <hi>forty daies after he roſe,</hi> as it is,
<hi>Act.</hi> 1. 3. Chriſt had right to heaven ſo ſoone as hee roſe, but for the
good of his Church, and of his Diſciples, he was content to tarry from
it for a time; which muſt teach us to bee content to tarry from heaven
for a time, for the good of them amongſt whom wee live; ſo wee ſee
<hi>Paul</hi> did, as it is <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. <hi>Nevertheleſſe to abide in the fleſh is more needfull for
you: and having this confidence, I know, that I ſhal abide and continue with you all
for your furtherance and joy of ſaith:</hi> ſo 2 <hi>King.</hi> 20. 2. it is ſaid of <hi>Hezekiah,
Then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e turned his face to the wall and prayed:</hi> Why did <hi>Hezekiah</hi> weepe
and pray to the Lord that he might live? I anſwer, not that he was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
of death, but hee deſired to live for the good of the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
Religion and the worſhip of God was in danger, which he deſired
to eſtabliſh: as <hi>Martin</hi> a biſhop in <hi>France</hi> when he came to dye, for the
good of the Church deſired to turne into the world againe. Now theſe
examples may ſerve to make us contented to tarry out of heaven for a
time for the good of others: if Chriſt tarried forty daies for the good
of the Church, much more ſhould wee bee contented to leave places of
honour, and of preferment for the good of the Church; for there bee
too many men that will not ſtep one foot from their preferment for the
good of their brethren, as <hi>Nehem.</hi> 5. hee laies it as a great fault on the
rich men, that <hi>they would not eaſe their poore brethren;</hi> and there is a curſe
denounced againſt ſuch, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 5. 23. <hi>Curſe yee Meroz, ſaith the Angell of the
Lord, curſe the inhabitants thereof, becauſe they came not out to helpe the Lord
againſt the mighty;</hi> unto which many are now liable, who will hazard
nothing for the love of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The third circumſtance is, that, <hi>before Chriſt aſcended, hee gave a change
and a commandement to his Diſciples;</hi> as we may read,<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>Act. 1. 2. Vntill the
day in which hee was taken up after that hee through the holy Ghoſt, had given
commandement unto the Apoſtles whom hee had choſen.</hi> And what was the
charge he gave them? It was concerning the kingdome of God, religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:17958:186"/>
and the worſhip of God; which may teach us before wee aſcend,
and death take us away, we muſt give charge to our children, to our ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
and to thoſe which doe concerne us, touching Religion, and the
worſhip of God, that they bee faithfull in the covenant of God, when
we be dead and gone; and then we may comfortably aſcend to heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
ſo we ſee <hi>David</hi> did, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28. 9. when he came to dye he gave a charge
and a commandement to his ſonne <hi>Solomon,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>And thou Solomon
my ſonne, know thou the God of thy Fathers, and ſerve him with a perfect heart;
and with a willing minde, for the Lord ſearcheth all hearts, and underſtandeth
all the imaginations of the thoughts: If thou ſeeke him, he will be found of thee,
but if thou forſake him, he will coſt thee off for ever:</hi> ſo likewiſe <hi>Moſes</hi> did
<hi>Numb.</hi> 27. 18. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto Moſes, Take thee Ioſhua the ſonne
of Nun a man in whom is the Spirit, and put thy hand upon him, and ſet him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Eleazer the Priest, and before all the congregation, and give him a charge in
their ſight:</hi> ſo every governour, and every maſter and father ſhould give
charge and commandement concerning Religion and the worſhip of
God to thoſe which doe concerne them, that they may bee faithfull in
the covenant, and hold out Religion when they be dead and gone; and
then they may comfortably aſcend as Chriſt did.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Thirdly, the place where hee aſcended.</note> 
                  <hi>The place from whence he aſcended:</hi> now in every motion, there
is the place from whence they goe, and the place whither they goe, the
place <hi>a quo,</hi> from whence Chriſt aſcended was <hi>Bethanie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1</note> as Saint <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.
50<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>The mount of Olives,</hi> as it is <hi>Act.</hi> 1. which was the place, whence a little
before he went to his Paſſion, it was the place where he ſweat water and
blood, and where hee was apprehended; yet heere it is ſaid, to bee the
place from which hee aſcended to heaven; which may teach us, that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
wee be faithfull and walke carefully and conſcionably before God, the
places that he places of trouble and of torment to us, he will make them
<hi>Mount Olives,</hi> places of comfort; and therefore doeſt thou lye on thy
ſicke bed, art thou troubled with paine and ſickneſſe, and haſt beene
many yeeres together, bee faith fall and God can make thy ſicke bed
<hi>Bethania,</hi> to thee, a place to aſcend to heaven from; and ſo likewiſe art
thou in priſon or in any other baſe place, bee faithfull and of good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
the Lord can make it like the <hi>Mount Olives,</hi> a place to aſcend to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
from; doeſt thou dwell in a poore cottage and a ſmoaky houſe, be
of good comfort, God can make this a meanes to aſcend to heaven by
and goe to God.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> the place <hi>ad quem,</hi> whither he aſcended, and that is into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
ſo the Angels ſay, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 11. <hi>Yee men of Galilee, why ſtand yee gazing
into heaven, this ſame Ieſus which is taken from you into heaven, ſhall ſo come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
as yee have ſeene him goe to heaven:</hi> ſo againe, <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith of him, <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 21.
<hi>Whom the heavens must containe, untill the time that all things be restored:</hi> and
<hi>Paul, Heb.</hi> 9. 24. <hi>Hee is gone to appeare in the presence of God for us:</hi> ſo it is
cleare by all theſe Scriptures, that Chriſt is gone to heaven. Now if he be
gone to heaven, then it is in vaine to ſeeke him heere in this world: The
Papiſts ſay, that the bread in the Sacrament after the words of conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
are turned into the body of Chriſt, nay into the very fleſh as hee was
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:17958:186"/>
borne of the virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> now then if we aske the Papiſts where is Chriſt,
they will bee ready to ſay in ſuch a Church and ſuch a Church, or he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
ſuch a Prieſts fingers; but aſke the faith of a Chriſtian profeſſor
where hee is, and that will tell you that hee is aſcended into heaven, and
therefore to avoid this Doctrine of the Papiſts in all likelihood it is that
our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 23. <hi>If any man ſhall ſay unto you, here is Christ or
there is Christ, beleeve him not;</hi> doe not goe after them, for Chriſt is aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
into heaven, whither ſeeing Chriſt is aſcended, let us gather after him,
and although our bodies cannot yet aſcend, yet let our hearts and mindes;
and as the Diſciples did follow him with their eies, till a cloud came and
tooke him up out of their ſight; ſo let us follow him with our hearts and
mindes, till we be in his ſight.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>The manner of this aſcenſion; Luk.</hi> 24. 50. <hi>He lifted up his hands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them and bleſſed them,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Fourthly, the manner of his Aſcenſion.</note> this was the laſt farewell he did not leave unto his
Diſciples houſes and lands, caſtles and mannors, but he left them his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
as the beſt portion; which muſt teach us when we are to depart this
world,<note place="margin">1</note> though wee cannot leave lands and livings to our children, yet let
us leave Gods bleſſings behinde us, the knowledge of God, the hatred of
ſinne, the love of vertue, conſcience to walke with God: as <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 3.
when <hi>Rebeccah</hi> ſent her ſon <hi>Iaakob</hi> for a wife, though his father was rich, yet
he was to the eye of the world but meanly provided, having for his journey
onely a ſtaffe in one hand and a bottle of oyle in the other, but together
with them he had his fathers bleſſings and Gods bleſſing laid up in it; and
with theſe his mother thought him better furniſhed than his rich brother
<hi>Eſau</hi> with all his wealth: ſo let a poore man leave Gods bleſſings to his
childn, and then he ſhal have the beſt portion that can befall him. Now by
the vertue of this bleſſing the Apoſtles paſſed through many troubles, and
were fenced with it againſt all the hard dealings of this ungratefull world,
for they cared not who curſed them, ſo God bleſſed them, nor who hated
them, ſo God loved them; ſo if we get Gods bleſſing, if that be upon us,

               <p>Secondly it is ſaid,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>While hee bleſſed them, hee was parted from them, and

he went from the two Diſciples that went to <hi>Emmaus:</hi> but here he went
leaſurely, by little, and by little, till he was taken up, <hi>till a cloud came and

howſoever they doe now bring us ſnow, and raine, and haile, and wind,
yet they ſhall bee the chariots to bring Chriſt to Iudgment, at the laſt

ſhall,<note place="margin">SERM. XXXVIII</note> by the mouth of the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> declaring who ſhall obtaine

hath not lift up his ſoule to vanity, nor ſworne deceitfully, he ſhall receive the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
from God:</hi> hee that is a harmeleſſe man and doth not wrong or injury
to his neighbour; hee that doth not drinke in the ſinnes of the age hee
liveth in, hee that doth not lift up his minde to vanity (for there is a great
deale of vanity in man, vanity in the ſpeech, vanity in apparell) this is the
man that ſhall receive this bleſſing from God, and hee ſhall not onely bee
bleſſed in this world, but be pronounced alſo bleſſed at the great aſſembly,
when heaven and earth and hell ſhall meet together before God and all
the bleſſed Angels and holy men, even by that ſweet mouth of Chriſt
which ſhall chace and drive thouſands to hell, and ſhall curſe the wicked,
but ſhall ſay to ſuch, <hi>Come ye bleſſed my Father, receive the kingdome prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for you from the beginning;</hi> therefore labour thou whoſoever thou art
to be thus bleſſed of Chriſt, and then thou art fenced againſt all the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
and wrongs that this world doth afford us.</p>
               <p>Secondly, wee did obſerve in the <hi>Manner of Christs aſcenſion,</hi> that when
hee departed hee went not <hi>ſuddainely</hi> away from them, as he did from the
Diſciples that went to <hi>Emmaus,</hi> but he departed by little and little leaſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
till a cloud came and tooke him out of their ſight. Now in ſeverall ages
there were ſome that aſcended, as <hi>Henoch</hi> in the time of <hi>Nature, Elias</hi> in
the time of the <hi>Law, and Christ</hi> in the time of the <hi>Goſpell;</hi> To teach us that
heaven is the houſe prepared for the faithfull in all ages.</p>
               <p>But there was great difference in their aſcenſions;<note place="margin">Differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion of Christ and others.</note> 
                  <hi>Others aſcended by
means,</hi> as we may ſee in the 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 2. 12. <hi>Elias was carried up in a firie chariot;</hi>
but Chriſt did aſcend by <hi>His owne power and vertue,</hi> without the helpe of
any; and ſo in <hi>Luk.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1</note> 16. 22. <hi>When Lazarus was dead, he was carried of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
into heaven;</hi> But Chriſt aſcended by his owne power, which may teach
us, that al others have need of help to aſcend to heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but Chriſt had none.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Others aſcended before death ceaſed on them,</hi> as <hi>Elias;</hi> but Chriſt
aſcended after hee was killed and crucified and put into the grave; hence
we learne, all the people of God ſhall riſe and aſcend; but firſt death muſt
kill them, and they muſt be laid into the grave, and then they ſhall riſe and
after that aſcend; as <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. 9. it is ſaid, <hi>That the bodies of the two Prophets
lay in the ſtreets three daies and an halfe, and after life came into them againe,
and the world wondred at it;</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 12. it is ſhewed how they roſe, <hi>That they
heard a voyce from heaven, ſaying, Come up hither, and they aſcended up to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in a cloud.</hi> in like manner, labour thou to be joyned with Chriſt, and as
Chriſt aſcended, ſo ſhalt thou aſcend.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>Others went onely themſelves to heaven,</hi> but made no way for any
body els, but when Chriſt aſcended, he made way for others to aſcend and
follow him: he did not as <hi>Lot, Gen.</hi> 19. who when he had taken in the angel,
<hi>ſhut the doore;</hi> but Chriſt when he entred into heaven, left the doore open
for others to enter in; ſo it is ſaid, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 20. <hi>Hee entred by the new and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
way, which hee prepared for us, through the veile, that is, his fleſh;</hi> even
by the veile of his fleſh hath he dedicated a way for us to heaven, therefore
<hi>Chryſostome</hi> ſaith well, <hi>Christ hath entred into heaven at the narrow hole of his
paſsions, and hath left a broad doore for his members to follow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="364" facs="tcp:17958:188"/>
Fourthly, <hi>Others</hi> when they were aſcended <hi>could do nothing there,</hi> though
they could work miracles on earth but Christ being aſcended,<note place="margin">4</note> is as power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to adminiſter to his people in this kingdome, as if he were with them
in this world; for <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 33. hee being aſcended, ſent downe the gifts and
graces of his ſpirit upon his Diſciples: others being aſcended can doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
their power being confined to the place where they bee, but Chriſt
being aſcended, as is powerfull here as if he were preſent.</p>
               <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5</note> 
                  <hi>Others went away on a ſuddaine,</hi> as wee ſee 2 <hi>King.</hi> 2. that <hi>Elias</hi>
aſcended in a <hi>Whirlewind;</hi> but Chriſt aſcended by little and little, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
till a cloud came and tooke him out of their ſight.</p>
               <p>Now there be two reaſons why Chriſt did not aſcend into heaven ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainely,
but by little and little:<note place="margin">Two reaſons why Chriſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven leaſurely.</note> firſt, that they might ſenſibly ſee hee had
left this world and was aſcended into heaven, therefore wee ſhould not
looke for him here:<note place="margin">1</note> it behoveth the Church to know that Chriſt is aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
into heaven and that for their good, to prepare a place for them, to
ſend downe the gifts and graces of his ſpirit: ſo <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. wee may ſee the
Diſciples when Chriſt told them that he ſhould go away from them, ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
and mourned for it; I, but when they did conſider that hee was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended
for their good, to prepare a place for them, and to hold the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of heaven till they were ready, and to ſend the holy ſpirit into their
hearts, this was a great matter of joy and comfort to make them glad.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> to take away an error in the world, that many an one thinkes
hee ſhall goe to heaven in a whirle-wind, out of the midſt of their ſinnes
and of their prophaneneſſe: nay, looke on Chriſt, hee aſcended by little
and little, and made many aſcenſions before hee came at heaven, ſo muſt
thou doe, and therefore thou muſt not thinke to goe in a whirle-wind into
heaven, out of the midſt of thy luſts and of thy ſinnes, but thou muſt make
many aſcenſions every day in thy care zeale, faith and thy repentance: It is
Chriſts ſpeech, <hi>Can.</hi> 3. <hi>Who is this that aſcends up out of the wildernes, perfumed
with myrrh, &amp;c.</hi> ſo the people of God aſcend up leaſurely till God receive
them,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> as S. <hi>Ierome</hi> ſaies, ſpeaking of the 42. journies of the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi>
to the land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> ſo we muſt not think to goe to heaven with eaſe, but
it will coſt many a journey, and a Chriſtian muſt be every day riſing in his
care, in his zeale, in his faith, in his repentance and in his love, till at laſt he
come at heaven gates.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Thirdly, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</note> 
                  <hi>A cloud came and tooke him out of their ſight;</hi> ſo Saint <hi>Luke</hi> ſaies,
<hi>Act.</hi> 1. 9. <hi>And when hee had ſpoken theſe things whilst they beheld him hee was
taken up, for a cloud tooke him out of their ſight,</hi> that is, it came under the
foot of Chriſt and ſo did cover him: and as hee went away in a cloud, ſo
<hi>Hee ſhall come againe at the day of judgement,</hi> ſo the Angels ſaid: the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 13. ſaith, <hi>I beheld in a viſion by night, and behold, one like to the
Son of man came in the clouds of heaven:</hi> ſo <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 30. <hi>And then ſhall appeare
the ſigne of the Son of man in heaven, and then ſhall all the hindreds of the earth
mourne, and they ſhall ſee the Sonne of man comming in the clouds of heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the uſe of this point is,<note place="margin">Vſe</note> that ſeeing Chriſt aſcended by a cloud into
heaven, and as he aſcended, ſo will come to judgement, therfore ſo often as
we looke on the clouds, wee may conſider that theſe bee the chariots that
ſhall bring Chriſt to judgement, however they now bring us winde and
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:17958:188"/>
raine, and ſnow, and haile: as <hi>Genes.</hi> 45. 24. <hi>When Iaakob ſaw the Chariots that
Ioſeph had ſent for him, his Spirit revived againe:</hi> ſo when we looke on the
Chariots that ſhall bring Chriſt to judgement, our hearts will or ſhould
revive; therefore ſo often as we caſt up our eyes to Heaven, wee ſhould
thinke of this.</p>
               <p>Now we will come to ſpeake of the fifth point,<note place="margin">Fifthly, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit we receive by Chriſts aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> 
                  <hi>the uſe and benefit wee
ſhould make of Chriſts aſcenſion:</hi> and I would I had an hundred tongues to
ſpeake, and that I had the words of motion, that I might make you feele
and ſee the excellent things that God doth offer unto us by the Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>The aſcenſion of Chriſt muſt cauſe a ſpirituall aſſenſion in us;</hi> for as the
body of Chriſt did aſcend to Heaven,<note place="margin">1</note> ſo our hearts and minds and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
muſt aſcend; and although our bodies be here, yet our hearts and
mindes and affections muſt be in Heaven: ſo ſaith <hi>Paul, Colos.</hi> 3. 1. <hi>If ye bee
riſen with Chriſt, ſeeke thoſe things that be above where Chriſt is;</hi> as if he ſhould
ſay, Chriſt is in Heaven; let not your hearts therefore and your mindes
bee on the Earth, but let them aſcend to Heaven: ſo it is ſaid <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.
<hi>But our converſation is in Heaven.</hi> There be a number of men in the world
that grovell on the ground, their hearts bee glued and tyed to the
world: Oh but a Chriſtian man whiles he is in this world, he muſt have
his converſation in Heaven by living juſtly, and holily in this world;
Therefore, whileſt wee live here our hearts and minds muſt aſcend to
Heaven, becauſe our ſoules ſhall not aſcend till the day of death: Nay,
if our ſoules doe not aſcend whiles wee live here, our bodies ſhall not
aſcend at the day of judgement, for every man muſt begin his Heaven
here; therefore Chriſts aſcenſion muſt cauſe a Spirituall aſcenſion in
us. But what ſhall wee ſay of ſuch men, as for their lives cannot lift up
their hearts and their mindes to Heaven? wee may ſay as God ſayes to
<hi>Ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>m, Gen.</hi> 3. <hi>Earth thou art, and to Earth thou ſhalt returne; Duſt thou
art, and to Duſt thou ſhalt returne:</hi> Nay, it were well with them if they
might returne to Earth, but they ſhall goe both ſoule and body to Hell
without repentance, and therefore labour to aſcend in thy heart and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
whileſt thou liveſt here; pittifull is the ſtate of theſe men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I, but
what ſhall then the people of God doe when they cannot feele their
hearts to aſcend? they may ſay, O Lord Ieſus, thou art aſcended, and I
am grubbling on the Earth; therefore I will pray as the Prophet <hi>David</hi>
doth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. <hi>Lord quicken mee and raiſe mee,</hi> that I may aſcend in my
heart, minde and affections, while I live here.</p>
               <p>Now the rules to know whether wee be aſcended with Chriſt in the
holineſſe of our lives,<note place="margin">How to know whether wee aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend or not.</note> and converſations here on Earth, that ſo wee
may aſcend to him hereafter in glory, are chiefly theſe two:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. By an Opticke rule, a rule of humane learning.</item>
                  <item>2. By a rule of Scripture.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>By a rule of humane learning,</hi> or an <hi>Opticke rule;</hi> In all aſcenſions
the higher a man goes,<note place="margin">Triall.</note> the greater the things above ſeeme to be, and the
things below ſeeme the leſſer: As for example, if a man goe to the top
of an high Caſtle, the things above ſeeme great, and the things beneath
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:17958:189"/>
ſeeme ſmall if hee looke downe; I, but if he goe up to the Mountaines,
then the Caſtle ſeemes ſmall or leſſer, but if it were poſſible that hee
could goe up as high as the Sunne,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> or the Moone or Starres, how great
would the Starres and Spheares, and the amplitude of Heaven appeare
to bee, when as this Earth would hardly bee ſeene thither, and if ſeene,
would it ſeeme ſcarce ſo big as a little Moule-hill: ſo it is in our ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
aſcenſion, the neerer wee come to Heaven, the greater Heavenly
things ſeeme to bee, and the further we goe from theſe worldly things,
the leſſer and leſſer will they ſeeme to us; and therefore the pardon of
thy ſinnes, and the favour of God, and the hope of Heaven, are theſe
great in thine eyes, and the things of this life like little motes flying in
the Sunne? bee of good comfort thou art aſcended: but if the things
of this life bee great in thine eyes, and the things of Heaven ſmall, then
thou art not aſcended as yet. And thus by this rule we may give a true
judgement of our ſelves.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>A rule of Scripture: Epheſ.</hi> 4. 9. it is ſaid, <hi>Hee that aſcended, is
the ſame that did deſcend firſt into the lower parts of the Earth:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Triall.</note> So by S. <hi>Pauls
rule,</hi> before there can be an aſcenſion to Heaven, they muſt firſt deſcend,
and that to the lower parts: <hi>Pauls</hi> words bee plaine, that a man muſt
firſt deſcend before he can aſcend: and therefore every man muſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
with himſelfe, whether hee hath deſcended into the lower parts,
whether he hath beene caſt downe with the burden of his ſinnes, in the
ſenſe and feeling of them, and that hee hath beene brought as low as
Hell, and the Grave, and into the Dungeon of GODS wrath
and diſpleaſure, if thus then thou haſt aſcended; but if thou haſt not
deſcended into Hell, and as low as the Grave in the ſenſe and feeling
of thy ſinnes; If thou haſt not beene in the dungeon of Gods wrath
and diſpleaſure, then thy aſcenſion is yet to come. I have ſhewed you
heretofore,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> that a man that would bring water to the top of an high Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
or Tower, hee firſt makes it fall exceeding low: ſo every man that
would aſcend, hee muſt firſt deſcend, and come downe low in the ſenſe
and feeling of his owne ſinnes, and then hee is fit to aſcend: Therefore,
looke into thy owne ſelfe, and conſider whither thou haſt deſcended,
and haſt beene brought low in the ſenſe and feeling of thy owne ſinnes:
If thou haſt, thou haſt aſcended; but if not, thy aſcenſion is yet to come.
<hi>David</hi> beginnes one <hi>Pſalme</hi> with <hi>De profu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

places have I called unto the Lord:</hi> ſo wee muſt bee brought to call to God
out of the deepes.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> ſeeing Chriſt is aſcended into Heaven, <hi>Let us bee willing to
goe to Chriſt as ſoone as may be;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> we ſee in nature that all the members will
have recourſe to the head, becauſe that gives life and motion to the reſt
of the members; ſo becauſe Chriſt our Head is gone before to Heaven,
we ſhould be willing to aſcend to him: we know and have often heard
how willing old <hi>Iacob</hi> was to goe into <hi>Egypt;</hi> his ſpirit revived when he
ſaw the Chariots of his ſonne <hi>Ioſeph</hi> came for him;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſo we ſhould be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to leave all, and to aſcend to Heaven, and how ſhould our ſpirits
revive, when we ſee the chariots of death come for us? But yet there
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:17958:189"/>
muſt be a moderation this way, for as a good ſervant will not goe away
till he have a diſcharge from his maſter, though hee long for the time of
his freedome, and looke to the ſhore of the Sea to ſee when the Ship
would come to carry him away, and thinke every day ſeven,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and every
yeere ſeven till the time come, yet he goes not before his maſter calls:
ſo it ſhould be with a Chriſtian, though hee be willing to goe to God,
and to leave all, yet <hi>Hee muſt not take downe the Tent himſelfe,</hi> but hee muſt
tarry till the Lord give him a diſcharge, and then thinke every day ſeven
daies, and every yeere ſeven yeeres till the time come; and when it is
come, he muſt willingly goe to Chriſt. It is an infinite wonder notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
all the happineſſe men ſhall enjoy by aſcending with Chriſt,
that they cannot by any perſwaſions be induced to forſake and leave off
this hanging on the world; I doe not meane, onely when God would
have them to live, but even when men lie on their ſicke beds and are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye
to depart this World.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Vſe 3.</note> ſeeing Chriſt is aſcended, wee muſt labour to feele the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
and Power of Chriſts aſcenſion; there bee many that can talke and
tell long ſtories of it, but this is nothing, unleſſe they can find the vertue
and power of it. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 9, 10. ſaith <hi>Paul, I deſire that I may be found in him,
and that I may know him and the vertue of his reſurrection, &amp;c.</hi> So wee muſt
deſire that we may feele the Power of Chriſts aſcenſion; as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68. 18.
It is ſaid that when <hi>Chriſt aſcended up on high, he led captivity captive;</hi> that
is, (as yee heard before) that when hee aſcended, hee did triumph
overall our ſpirituall enemies, and they were bound and tyed to the
triumphant Chariot of Chriſt in fetters and chaines like ſlaves. Now
everyman muſt feele this triumph and conqueſt in himſelfe; therefore,
doſt thou feele the Divell to be bound, and Hell to bee ſtopped; Death
to be weakned, and the power of thy luſts and ſinnes abated; then thou
doſt truely feele the vertue and the power of Chriſts aſcenſion; but if
thou doe not feele the Divell to bee bound, Hell ſtopped, Death to bee
weakned, and thy luſts and corruptions to be abated, then haſt thou no
vertue by Chriſts aſcenſion. Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith well, If thou doeſt not
feele the vertue and power of Chriſts aſcenſion, hee is not aſcended for
thee, thou ſhalt have no good, nor bee a penny the better for it; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let every man labour to finde the vertue and the power of Chriſts
aſcenſion in himſelfe; as Hell to be ſtopped, Death to be weakned, and
Sinne to bee abated, and then hee may have comfort by Chriſts aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>Now there is another vertue we muſt finde by Chriſts aſcenſion, ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of <hi>Pſal.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2</note> 68. 18. at his aſcenſion <hi>Hee gave gifts to man,</hi> and what gifts
were they?<note place="margin">Gifts of Chriſts Aſcenſion.</note> of two ſorts: Firſt, <hi>Royall gifts;</hi> and Secondly, <hi>Perſonall gifts:
Perſonall gifts</hi> bee ſuch as Teachers and Preachers have: <hi>Royall gifts</hi> be
ſuch as be in a Chriſtian, as <hi>Knowledge, Spirituall wiſedome, Vnderstanding,
Faith, Repentance, Love, Zeale,</hi> and the gift of <hi>Prayer:</hi> Therefore haſt thou
knowledge, ſpirituall wiſedome, underſtanding, faith and repentance?
haſt thou love and zeale? and haſt thou a gift in Prayer? Then thou
doſt feele of the vertue and power of Chriſts aſcenſion; but if thou bee
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:17958:190"/>
an ignorant and a blockiſh man, and haſt no knowledge or underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
no faith or repentance, no gift in prayer, then thou art not one
pennie the better by Chriſts aſcenſion, neither canſt thou have any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
in it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Vſe 4.</note> ſeeing Chriſt is aſcended, what muſt we doe till he come
againe to us: the Papiſts tell us wee muſt have an Image or a picture of
him, and muſt keepe it to put us in minde of him, till hee come againe:
but this is againſt the ſecond Commandement: And 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 5. 16.
the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> tels us, that wee ſhould no more know Chriſt after the
fleſh, ſaith hee, <hi>yea though we had knowne Chriſt after the fleſh, yet now hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
we know him no more;</hi> ſo that this is not the way the Papiſts tell us,
to have an image or a crucifixe of Chriſt: But there is another way, for
the Lord hath left us the glaſſe of the Goſpell; as 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 13. 12. <hi>But
now we ſee through a glaſſe darkly, but then face to face:</hi> Therefore we muſt
looke well into this glaſſe, for there wee ſhall ſee Chriſt borne in a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and laid in a Manger, praying on the Mount, bleeding in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
hanging on the Croſſe, laid into the Grave, and riſing from Death,
and gloriouſly aſcending into Heaven: Therefore wee muſt not doe as
the Papiſts tell us, but we muſt keepe us to this glaſſe, hold us to it, and
looke into it, and at laſt <hi>Ieſus</hi> will come and joyne himſelfe to us, nay,
he will ſtand by us, and tranſport our bodies, and make them like to his
glorious body. Now the next uſes are uſes of Comfort.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Vſes of Comfort.</note> that ſeeing Chriſt is aſcended into Heaven, this may give us
comfort,<note place="margin">1</note> that one day we ſhall riſe and aſcend alſo; for He is our pawne
and pledge, and hath taken poſſeſſion of heaven for us: which is a great
comfort to a Chriſtian, that where Chriſt is, there hee ſhall bee alſo, as
Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 3. <hi>I go to prepare a place for you, and I will come againe unto
you, and take you unto my ſelfe, that where I am, there you may be alſo;</hi> therefore
ſeeing Chriſt is in heaven, he wil draw all his members after him: ſo <hi>Ioh.</hi>
17. in that ſweete prayer that Chriſt makes, he ſaith, <hi>Father, I will that
they which thou haſt given me, may be with me, even where I am, that they may
behold my glory: Tertullian</hi> ſaith well, Chriſt the Mediator of God, and
man hath taken the pawne of our fleſh, and hath carried it into heaven,
and hath left us the pawne of his Spirit; therefore now fleſh and blood
be ſecure in Chriſt: and <hi>Athanaſius</hi> ſaith, God hath repealed this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
ſentence, <hi>Earth thou art, and to earth thou ſhalt returne againe, duſt thou
art, and unto duſt thou ſhalt returne againe;</hi> for Chriſt hath carried thy fleſh
into heaven, and hath taken poſſeſſion of it, and holds it till thou art rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:
therefore let not a Chriſtian be afraid of the troubles and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that hee meets with in this world, for as Chriſt is aſcended, ſo one
day he ſhall aſcend when the time comes: this is a ſweet comfort to a
poore Chriſtian when he lyes on his ſicke bed, when he meets with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
troubles and afflictions in this world; unto whom I may ſay, as Chriſt
ſaid to the Church of <hi>Smyrna,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Incouragement againſt the Croſſe.</note> 
                  <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. 10. <hi>Feare none of theſe things that
thou ſhalt ſuffer;</hi> even ſo I may ſay, feare none of theſe things that thou
ſhalt ſuffer, feare not trouble, affliction, ſickneſſe, death, nor any thing:
Art thou a poore man, and doſt thou want a houſe to dwell in? why
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:17958:190"/>
                  <hi>Heaven is thy houſe:</hi> doſt thou want friends? <hi>God is thy friend, and all the
Angels and Saints:</hi> doſt thou want comfort? <hi>God will bee thy comfort,</hi> and
therefore bee not afraid of trouble, nor of death, but bee like the <hi>five
wiſe Virgins</hi> that had their lamps ready burning, and their loyns girt, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to enter into their Maſters joy.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">The ſecond uſe of Comfort.</note> ſeeing Chriſt is aſcended into Heaven, our ſalvation is the
neerer to him: wee ſee in nature as long as the head is above the water,
the body cannot be drowned; in like manner ſo long as our Head is ſafe
in Heaven,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> he will ſave all his members. To this effect <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Epheſ.</hi>
2. 6. That <hi>hee hath ſet us together in heavenly places:</hi> and how hath hee ſet
us together in heavenly places, not in our owne perſons, but in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of Chriſt, he holds it, and hee will one day faithfully deliver it into
our hands.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">The third Vſe.</note> ſeeing Chriſt is aſcended, we may bee bold in the time of
our neede, trouble and affliction, to go to God in Prayer, and may have
comfort that Chriſt will heare us, and that we ſhall be regarded: This
is the uſe Saint <hi>Paul</hi> makes of it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 14. where he ſaith, <hi>Seeing we have
a great high Prieſt, which is entred into Heaven even Ieſus Chriſt the Son of God,
Let us goe boldly to the Throne of Grace, that wee may finde mercie, and receive
grace to helpe in the time of neede:</hi> So chapter 10. 19. ſaith hee, <hi>Seeing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Brethren, that by the blood of Chriſt wee may bee bold to enter into the holy
places by the new and living way, which hee hath prepared for us through the
veile, that is, his fleſh, let us draw neere, &amp;c.</hi> If a man had a great ſuit at Court,
and did know no body there,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> a man may looke for ſmall comfort when
he comes thither: but if he knew that the Kings ſonne would be ready
to ſpeake for him to his father, and to grace him before all the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
this will give him comfort; ſo if we go to God as to a Stranger, then
we can looke but for cold comfort: I, but if we know that Chriſt will
ſpeake for us to God, grace us and bring us into favor with him, this may
comfort us, and make us <hi>with boldneſſe goe to the Throne of Grace.</hi> There
was great difference betwixt the time when <hi>Ioſephs</hi> brethren knew him,
and when they knew him not,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> for when <hi>Ioſeph</hi> would not acknowledge
them for his brethren, hee handled them roughly, and tooke them for
Spies; but when he did acknowledge them to be his brethren, then he
did kindly entertaine them, and did fill their ſackes with corne, that
they might bee preſerved till they came into <hi>Aegypt;</hi> ſo there is great
difference when wee be ſtrangers, and when Chriſt doth acknowledge
us, for when hee knowes us, he will ſpeake to God for us, and grace us,
will fill our ſackes with the beſt of Heaven; therefore the true Chriſtian
may have great comfort to go to God in Prayer in the time of his need,
and he ſhall be heard and regarded of God.</p>

                  <item>5. The fruites and benefits wee have by his ſitting at Gods

               </list>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>what is meant by the right hand of God:</hi> To ſpeake properly, God
hath neither right hand,<note place="margin">Firſt, what is meant by Gods Right hand.</note> nor left hand, for <hi>he is a ſpirit,</hi> as it is, <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 24.
Therefore ſeeing he is a Spirit, he hath no bodily parts nor dimenſions,
and therefore neither right hand nor left; but it is a borrowed ſpeech
taken from the manner of <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes,</hi> who are wont to advance
their favourites next to their ſelves in any office or dignity. <hi>Augustine</hi>
ſaith well, If it be a wicked thing to make an image or a picture of God,
to make him like an old man with hands and feete, and to ſet it up in a
Church, or a Temple, ſeeing God is a Spirit; much more (ſaith he) is
it a vilde thing to frame an Image of him in a mans heart, ſeeing it is a
Temple for God and his Spirit to dwell in. Now the right hand of God
is taken in three ſenſes in Scripture:</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Three ſeverall acceptions of right hand in Scripture.</note> the right hand of God doth ſignifie <hi>his power;</hi> becauſe the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
power and ſtrength of a man lies in his right hand, for by this right
hand he doth worke and bring things to paſſe; ſo by the right hand of
God,<note place="margin">1</note> is meant the power of God, by the which he is able to doe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
he will: So <hi>Exod.</hi> 15. <hi>The right hand of God is glorious in power, the
right hand of the Lord hath bruiſed the enemies;</hi> and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118. 15. The right
hand of God is taken for the <hi>Power of God;</hi> but it cannot ſo bee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
in this place, becauſe the power of God is in all places, but the
humanitie of Chriſt is confined to one place onely, therefore this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
bee the true ſenſe; indeede, it is ſaid, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 64. <hi>Nevertheleſſe,
ye ſhall ſee the Sonne of Man ſitting at the right hand of Power, and comming in
the Clouds:</hi> the meaning whereof is expreſſed afterwards, chap. 28. 18.
<hi>that all power and authoritie is given unto him of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">The ſecond ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.</note> the Right hand of God is taken for <hi>The goodneſſe and glory of
beaven and happineſſe,</hi> as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 11. <hi>At thy right hand are pleaſures for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more:</hi>
but it cannot be ſo taken in this place, for though it bee true that
Chriſt is bleſſed in the kingdome of heaven, in joy and happineſſe, yet
this is common to all the Angels and Saints, for they enjoy all the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
in heaven; but to ſit at the right hand of God is peculiar to Chriſt
onely: as it is <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>To which of his Angels, ſaid he, at any time, Sit at my
right hand till I make thine enemies thy footstoole.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">The third ſenſe.</note> the right hand of God, is taken for the <hi>Next place to God in dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and honor, Rule and government:</hi> It is the manner of Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
when they doe advance any to office next themſelves, to ſet them at
their right hand, as 2 <hi>King.</hi> 19. <hi>Salomon</hi> cauſed a ſeate to be ſet for the <hi>Kings
mother, and ſet her at his right hand:</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 9. it is ſaid, <hi>Vpon thy right
hand did ſit the Queene in a garment of gold:</hi> ſo to ſit at the right hand of
God, is to be in the next place to God in <hi>Dignity</hi> and <hi>Honour,</hi> in <hi>Rule</hi> and
<hi>Government.</hi> And this is heere meant; for this ſitting at the right hand of
God, is nothing elſe but a dignity and honour given him of the Father
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:17958:192"/>
whereby hee is indued with a power to rule and governe all things imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
both in heaven and earth.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">How Christ is ſaid to ſit at the Right hand of God.</note> how hee is ſaid to ſit at the <hi>Right hand of God,</hi> and that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he is in the higheſt place next to God in dignitie and honour, admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration
and government of this whole world, and alſo particularly of
the Church of God: ſo to ſit at the Right hand of God implyes two
things.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">The firſt meaning.</note> 
                  <hi>That Christ is in the next place to God in dignity and honour;</hi> as <hi>Phil.</hi>
2. 9. ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Wherefore God hath highly exalted him, and given a
name unto him above all names, that at the name of Ieſus every knee ſhould bow of
both things in heaven and things in earth and things under the earth;</hi> which is
to bee underſtood not onely of the outward geſture and reverence to bee
uſed at the Name of Ieſus; but chiefly of the internall ſoveraignty and
authority of Ieſus; becauſe hee ſhould ſet his throne above all thrones,
in that all powers ſhall bee ſubject to him both in heaven and earth, and ſo
all knees ſhall bow unto him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The ſecond meaning.</note> That hee is in Rule and Government in the highest place next to
God: Epheſ. 1. 20, 21. <hi>it is ſaid,</hi> That God hath ſet him at his Right hand in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
places, farre above all principality and power and might and dominion and
every name that is named, not in this world only, but alſo in that which is to come;
and hath made all things ſubject under his feet, and hath appointed him over all
things to be the head to the Church. <hi>Theſe bee the two things implyed in his
ſitting at the Right hand of God: whence wee are to take notice of two
things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That Christ hath enobled our nature, and hath lifted it up above An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
and Archangels:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1</note> therefore ſeeing Chriſt hath thus dignified and eno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
the nature of man, in ſetting it above Angels and Archangels, what
ſhall wee anſwer to God, if wee abaſe it and bring it below the meaneſt of
the creatures? I doe not ſay, below the <hi>Sunne,</hi> and <hi>Moone,</hi> and <hi>Starres,</hi> which
are conſtant in their motions and courſes, but below the dumbe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
for they doe moderate themſelves in their appetites, they will
take no more meat and drinke than will doe them good, and will bee mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
in their ſleepe; therfore what ſhall wee anſwer to God for our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe.
But I would to God we could ſtay here, Chriſt hath lifted up our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
above the Angels, and we imbaſe it and bring it below the devils; for
when men bee ruled by the devill, they make themſelves ſlaves to him, and
ſo bring themſelves below the devill: as wee ſee hee could no ſooner bid
<hi>Adam</hi> eat, but he did eat, and <hi>Caine</hi> kill his brother, but he kils him, and
<hi>Iudas</hi> betray his Maſter, but he betrayed him; ſo he can no ſooner bid men
ſweare, but they will ſweare, or lye, but they will lye, or prophane the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</hi>
but they will doe it; therefore when men are thus ruled by him, what
is it, but to make themſelves ſlaves to the devill? and then how ſhall men
anſwer this injury and wrong done to Chriſt: we read <hi>Prov.</hi> 31. 4. <hi>Bathſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba</hi>
ſaith to her ſonne,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> 
                  <hi>It is not for Kings, O Lemuel, to drinke wine, nor for prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to drinke ſtrong drinke, lest they drinke and forget the law:</hi> ſo is not for
Chriſtians to ſweare, to lye, to deceive one another, to prophane the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths,</hi>
                  <pb n="373" facs="tcp:17958:192"/>
for Chriſt hath graced them, and therefore they muſt take heed they
doe not diſgrace their ſelves; Chriſt hath innobled their nature and ſet it
up above the Angels, and therefore they muſt take heed they doe not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
it by a ſinfull life.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we are to take notice, that ſeeing Ieſus Chriſt is in the next
place to God in adminiſtration and government,<note place="margin">2</note> ſo he is in honour not
onely next unto God, but alſo hath all at his command, hee is the ruler
and governour of this whole world, and therefore will governe it for
the good of the Church and of his people, and one day thou ſhalt bleſſe
God, and bow thy knees, and thanke him, that hee hath put the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
into his hands. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 24. it is ſaid, <hi>that all things ſhall worke toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for the beſt, or good of them that love him:</hi> the whole world ſhall winde
and turne to his good,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> if a man be a friend to God, and love him: there
be number of ſtrange turnings and motions in this world, all which ſhall
turne and winde unto the good of the Church: as in a clocke there be
ſome wheeles turne one way, and ſome another way, they being croſſe
and contrary one to the other, and yet by the skilfull and cunning
workeman they turne all to one end, to make the clocke goe; ſo in this
world there be many ſtrange turnings and motions, that ſeeme to runne
croſſe and contrary one to the other, yet by the ſkilfull workeman Ieſus
Chriſt, all is carried to the good of the Church; therefore great is the
comfort that the Church may have by this: for what ſhall the Church
doe in the time of trouble? runne to Chriſt, and pray him to turne all
to the good of them,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> becauſe the government is in his hands. Wee ſee
in experience when there is a cunning Pilot ſet at the ſtearne of a ſhip,
though it bee toſſed with the waves, and troubled with winds, yet hee
will carry the ſhip ſafe into the harbour; even ſo, as long as Ieſus Chriſt
is our Pilot and ſits at the ſterne of heaven, though there be many winds
and waves beate on the ſhip; that is, though there be many troubles and
afflictions that doe ariſe, yet he ſafely brings both ſoule and body to the
haven or harbour of reſt. It is a good meditation that the learned have
out of <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> the Diſciples were in a ſhip at ſea, where aroſe a great
tempeſt, <hi>ſo that the waves beate on the ſhip, which was in danger, whileſt Chriſt
was aſleepe in the ſhip. Then they cried to him and awaked him: and he aroſe and
rebuked the winds, and the ſea, and there was a great calme:</hi> ſo (ſay they) the
Church is compared to a ſhip, and this world to the ſea, the troubles
and afflictions of this life, to the winds and waves that beate upon the
ſhip, and indanger it; therefore we muſt doe as the Diſciples did, runne
to Chriſt, awake him by our praiers, and ſtirre him up by our repentance,
and then he will ariſe and rebuke the winds, and the ſea, and there ſhall
he a great calme: therefore in all the troubles and rages of the world, we
are to conſider that Chriſt ſits at the right hand of God, and hath the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the people of the whole world, and he will turne all to the
good of his Church and people. Now the conſideration of this will
make feare flye from thee, as the darkeneſſe doth from a candle.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Thirdly, why Christ is ſaid to ſit and not to ſtand at Gods right hand.</note> 
                  <hi>why Chriſt is ſaid to ſit, and not to ſtand at the right hand of God.</hi>
Of which there be three reaſons:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="374" facs="tcp:17958:193"/>
Firſt, <hi>To ſhew unto us that hee hath now finiſhed the worke of mans redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and having done all,<note place="margin">1</note> he is ſet downe at the right hand of God: this
is that he would have the whole world to ſee, that now mans redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is finiſhed and perfected: ſo <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 12. <hi>But this man after hee had
offered one ſacrifice for ſinnes, ſate downe for ever at the right hand of God.</hi> Now
although Chriſt hath wrought the redemption of man, and is ſet at the
right hand of God, yet wee muſt not ſit downe too, but ſeeing he hath
done his part, we muſt doe our parts, though he be ſet, yet we muſt not
ſit, but labour to lay hold on that which he hath purchaſed, and apply it
to our ſelves; for, although Chriſt hath purchaſed it, yet if wee doe
not apply it,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> we ſhall be never the better for it. If a man lye bound hand
and foote in a deepe dungeon, and a Iaylor come and ſet open the priſon
doores, bidding him come to him, and he will take the Gives and Bolts
off from his hands &amp; feet, and when he hath done ſo, the Iaylor ſits him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
downe with the keyes in his lap; now doe you thinke though the
Iaylor ſits ſtill, the priſoner will? no I warrant you, but rather would la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to creepe out of the ſtinking priſon; ſo ſeeing Chriſt hath opened
the priſon doores, and hath knocked off the Gives, and the Bolts of
ſinne, and is ſet downe at the right hand of God with the keies of hell,
and of death, we muſt not ſit downe too, but apply our ſelves to come
out of our ſinnes, and to lay hold on the mercy that is offered to us.</p>
               <p>Secondly;<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>becauſe there is a judiciarie Power committed unto Him,</hi> that is,
a power of judgement<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he ſits to arraigne men, and to give judgement
and ſentence againſt them; and as earthly Iudges ſit to order and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
of all things that are done <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſo <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 22. it is ſaid, <hi>The Father
judgth no man, but hath committed all judgment to the Sonne;</hi> therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
Chriſt holds a court of judgement to judge the whole world, wee
muſt be carefull to paſſe the whole time of our life and dwelling heere,
in feare and holineſſe before God, becauſe Hee ſits to judge us; and
though we bee not afraid of earthly Iudges, yet let us bee afraid of the
heavenly Iudge, for howſoever men may ſhift the matter, and blinde an
earthly Iudge, yet they cannot blinde the heavenly; therfore every man
muſt conſider when he is drinking, deceiving, lying, ſwearing and the
like, that Chriſt will judge him for it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>becauſe he is in the continuall act of judgement,</hi> hee is alwaies on
the judgment ſeat,<note place="margin">3</note> alwaies ready to adminiſter judgement to the world;
earthly Iudges bee not alwaies on the judgement-ſeate, but they have
their <hi>vacation times out of tearme,</hi> (as they ſay) that is, they have certaine
times of hearing:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> O, but Chriſt is in the act of judgement, and on his
charge continually; <hi>Moſes</hi> ſate from morning till night to heare the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
but he was weary of that; but Chriſt ſits continually, and is never
weary in the act of judgement. Hence wee may learne theſe good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions
following:</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>to comfort us in afflictions and croſſes,</hi> that Chriſt is alwaies ready
to waite and attend on the cauſes of his ſervants,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> and people; a man may
come at an unſeaſonable time to men, as <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. it is ſaid, <hi>the man came
to his friend at midnight, and he was rebuked of his friend:</hi> O, but we cannot
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:17958:193"/>
come at any unſeaſonable time to Chriſt, hee ſits night and day on the
throne, and will bee ready to heare us, therefore in all our troubles this
may give comfort.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> 
                  <hi>to ſtrike terrour into the hearts of men, and to make them afraid
of ſinne, and to offend him,</hi> becauſe he ſits on the throne ſtill, and is ready
to execute judgement:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> If a theefe ſhould ſteale, or cut a purſe when the
Iudge is on the bench, hee in worthy to be hanged, ſentence is ready to
paſſe upon him preſently; ſo ſeeing Chriſt is on the bench, and in the
act of judgment, if a man ſinne againſt him, ſentence is ready to be paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
hee may preſently have execution done upon him: and indeed all
the judgments that come from day to day upon us, come from Chriſt;
the <hi>executions</hi> be in the country,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> but the <hi>writs,</hi> and ſentences amongſt us
come from a higher court, from <hi>London:</hi> ſo here in this world be all the
executions, but the ſentence and the writs come from above, they come
from the court of heaven.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Fourthly, to what end Chriſt ſits at Gods right hand.</note> 
                  <hi>To what end Chriſt ſits at the right-hand of God: for two ends;</hi>
firſt, <hi>To make interceſsion for us,</hi> as <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 24. <hi>For Chriſt is not entred into the
holy places made with hands, which are ſimilitudes of the true Sanctuary, but is
entred into heaven to appeare now in the ſight of God for us.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1</note> We ſee in <hi>Samuel</hi>
that <hi>Saul</hi> was angry with <hi>David</hi> many times,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and would have killed him,
but ſtill <hi>Ionathan</hi> interpoſed himſelfe, and laboureth to pacifie his fathers
anger; ſo God is angry with us many times, and would kill us, but the
true <hi>Ionathan</hi> Ieſus Chriſt doth interpoſe himſelfe, and labour to miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
his anger by preſenting his wounds and body before God; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when wee cannot lift up our voyce to God, nor our hearts as wee
ſhould, yet Chriſt makes interceſſion; his body ſpeakes, when we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſpeake; and his blood crieth, when we cannot cry: Now I ſhall not
need to ſhew you the manner how Chriſt makes interceſſion for us, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſpoken of it but a little before; and therfore I will now proceed
without any repetition to the ſecond end why Chriſt aſcended.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">The ſecond end what it is.</note> 
                  <hi>That hee might more powerfully and more mightily administer
and governe his Church;</hi> for therefore God hath exalted him that he may
rule the whole world for the good of the Church; as the people rejoyced
exceedingly at the crowning of <hi>Salomon,</hi> ſo wee may much more rejoyce
that <hi>Christ is all in all,</hi> and that hee ſits at the right hand of God for the
good of the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now by foure actions Chriſt doth governe in his Church:</hi>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>1 He drawes people to himſelfe.</item>
                  <item>2 He doth guide and governe them.</item>
                  <item>3 He doth exerciſe them with croſſes and troubles.</item>
                  <item>4 He doth protect and defend them againſt all their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">He doth draw people to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</note> 
                  <hi>He doth draw and pull people unto himſelfe</hi> and brings them to Faith
and Repentance, and an eſtate of grace, that they may be ſaved; ſo Chriſt
ſaith to Ieruſalem, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 37. <hi>How often would I have gathered thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and yee
would not?</hi> to the ſame effect alſo, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 11. 52. It was ſaid of him, <hi>That hee
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:17958:194"/>
dyed not for that nation onely, but that hee ſhould gather together in one the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of God which were ſcattered abroad:</hi> ſo then it is Chriſt that doth ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and draw us; there is not any man living that is able to draw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
out of the kingdome of the devill, and pit of hell, into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of grace and ſtate of bleſſedneſſe, it muſt be Chriſt onely that muſt
draw him. therefore it is ſaid in the <hi>Acts,</hi> that <hi>There were added to the
Church daily ſuch as ſhould be ſaved;</hi> ſo it was not they themſelves that drew
themſelves out, but it was Chriſt, by his Word and by his Spirit, that did
draw them and pull them out of their ſinnes, and brought them to an eſtate
of grace.</p>
               <p>Now is there any man thus drawne out of his ſinnes into an eſtate of
grace, let him know it is the hand of Chriſt, that did draw and gather
him,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> for Chriſts ſitting in heaven is as powerfull to draw and pull men out
of their ſinnes, as the <hi>Adamant</hi> is to draw <hi>Iron</hi> to it. Wherefore when men
ſee themſelves thus drawne out of their ſinnes, and pulled out of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of the devill and pit of hell, they may ſay as <hi>Iudas</hi> did, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 22.
<hi>What is the cauſe thou ſheweſt thy ſelfe to us,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> 
                  <hi>and not unto the world?</hi> even ſo we
muſt admire the goodneſſe of Chriſt, and ſay, Lord, what is the cauſe thou
haſt pulled us out of the kingdome of the devill, and pit of hell, and haſt
brought us to an eſtate of grace, to <hi>Faith</hi> and to <hi>Repentance;</hi> there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in us Lord, but it was thy good pleaſure and meere mercy to doe it.
Now the meanes wherby he drawes and puls men unto himſelfe, is eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<hi>by the Preaching of the word</hi> and Goſpell,<note place="margin">Meanes of drawing.</note> therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Eph.</hi>
4. 12. he gave ſome to be <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and ſome <hi>Prophets,</hi> and ſome <hi>Evangelists,</hi>
and ſome <hi>Pastors</hi> and <hi>Teachers, for the gathering together of the Saints, and for
the worke of the ministery, and for the edification of the body of Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> ſo
<hi>Eſai.</hi> 53. 1. the Word of God is called the <hi>Arme of God;</hi> becauſe that even
as men doe draw and gather with their armes things to themſelves;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſo
the Lord doth draw and gather men to himſelfe by the preaching of the
Goſpell; ſo it is the Arme of God to draw men out of the eſtate of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
into an eſtate of ſalvation, and out of the kingdome of the devill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the kingdome of Chriſt: Hereof wee may make theſe profitable Vſes
following:</p>
               <p>Firſt, ſeeing the preaching of the Goſpell is the Arme of God to draw
men unto himſelfe;<note place="margin">Vſe.</note> therefore faithfull Miniſters muſt remember that they
bee the hand of Chriſt to draw and to pull men out of their ſinnes; <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſostome</hi>
compares Preachers to a number of ſervants in a great ſhop, of
whom,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſome bee in one place and ſome in another, yet all comes to the
common boxe, and is for the advantage of the maſter; ſo, ſaith hee, this
world may bee compared to a ſhop, wherein ſome of the Preachers are in
one place and ſome in another, imployed in preaching, and yet all muſt
come to the common boxe, all muſt turne to the advantage of our Lord
and Maſter, they muſt not turne it to themſelves and to their owne advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
but they muſt labour to draw and to pull men to God, becauſe this is
the ordinary meanes to draw them by.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> ſeeing the preaching of the Word is the Arme of God to
draw and pull men to God, therefore wee muſt hold us to the meanes,
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:17958:194"/>
and keep cloſe to them, that ſo we may be brought to an eſtate of grace;
to faith and repentance, and ſo to be ſaved.</p>
               <p>It may be objected,<note place="margin">Object.</note> 
                  <hi>All come to the means, but all are not drawne and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
to God,</hi> a number hang in their ſinnes ſtill. I anſwere, though thou
doe not finde thy ſelfe to be drawne to God preſently,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> yet doe not neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,
but come ſtill, for if thou doſt deſpiſe it and come not at it, then it is
not poſſible that ever thou ſhouldſt bee gathered and brought into the
ſtate of grace, but if wee come to the meanes, then wee may have hope
that <hi>one day</hi> God will draw us unto himſelfe, though not at the firſt
houre of the day, yet hee may at the ſecond; and if not at the ſecond,
yet at the ſixth; and if not at the ſixth, yet at the laſt houre of the day:
Therefore we muſt wait on the meanes, and attend that till God give
his bleſſing unto it. <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. we ſee a lame man came to the poole to bee
helped of his diſeaſes,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and lay there a long time, for he was intercepted
by one or other that did ſtep in before him, yet hee continued ſtill, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
there was meanes of his helpe, and at laſt Chriſt came and did help
him: ſo when we come to the meanes, to the preaching of the Word,
and come a long time; and we ſee others catch away the bleſſing, others
are drawne to faith, and to repentance, and to an eſtate of grace, and
we are not; yet let us not tarry at home, for then wee may die in our
ſinnes, but let us come to the meanes, and waite and attend on it, and
then at laſt we ſhall finde Gods bleſſing upon us.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, ſeeing the preaching of the Goſpell is the meanes to draw
us to God,<note place="margin">Vſe 3.</note> every man muſt labour to feele this worke of grace in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe;
for if a man heare never ſo often, if hee be not gathered to God,
and his heart brought home, but lieth ſtill in his ſinnes and corruptions,
hee can have little comfort by preaching; therefore labour thou to bee
brought home to God, to Repentance, to Faith, and to an eſtate of
Grace by it.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> Wee ſee in experience when the <hi>Hen clockes,</hi> the Chickins
will runne after her, and gather under her wings: Now the Goſpell is
(as it were) the <hi>clocke</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whereby he doth call us, and therefore
when hee cals us by his <hi>Clocking,</hi> let us runne unto him and gather under
his wings, that ſo wee may bee covered in the time of danger. I have
ſhewed you heretofore when <hi>Ieremie</hi> was in the Dungeon, there was one
that did put downe a cord to him, and caſt in a few ragges, whereupon
hee caught hold and put the ragges under his armes,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and ſo was pulled
out; in like manner we all lie in the Dungeon of ſinne, by the preaching
of the Word, the Lord puts downe a cord as it were to ſave us; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it muſt bee our wiſedome to apply our ſelves to it, that ſo wee may
be drawne out of our ſinnes. This is the firſt Action.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> when Chriſt hath gathered a people to himſelfe, he doth
not leave them at ſixe and ſevens,<note place="margin">Being drawne, hee governs them.</note> but <hi>doth governe and guide them to
Eternall life;</hi> as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 48. 14. it is ſaid, <hi>For this God is our God for ever and
ever, and he ſhall be our guide till the day of our death:</hi> So <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 79. it is ſaid,
<hi>Chriſt came to give light to them that ſit in darkneſſe and in the ſhadow of death,
and to guide our feete into the way of Peace:</hi> So he doth not onely draw and
gather people to himſelfe and ſo leave them, but he doth guide them by
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:17958:195"/>
his Word, and by his Spirit, and attends them, untill he have brought
them to Heaven and happineſſe. A goodly figure we have of this in the
<hi>Law,</hi> when the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were in the wilderneſſe of <hi>Arabia,</hi> and
were travelling to the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> they knew not which way to take,
yet the Lord ſent them a Cloud by day, and a Pillar of fire by night to
conduct them till they came to <hi>Canaan;</hi> Now what is this but a plaine
figure of our journey to Heaven?<note place="margin">Simile.</note> For we are all paſſengers, and travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
to Heaven, and are to paſſe through the wilderneſſe of this World,
wherein there are a number of by-pathes, and dangerous places, where
we are like to loſe our ſelves, and therefore Chriſt leſt wee ſhould goe
aſtray and bee in danger of loſing, hath left his Word and Spirit to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
and lead us to Heaven: this is a great comfortable mercy, that
Chriſt doth not onely draw men unto himſelfe, but when hee hath ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
them, he doth governe and guide them by his Word and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
Wee ſee it is not enough for a father to ſet downe his childe in the
way,<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>imile.</note> but alſo takes him by the hand, and leads him in it, and when he is
wearie, he recovers &amp; reſts him, and when he comes at a bridge, he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
him over<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo Chriſt doth by us, for it is not enough for him to ſet
us downe in the way that leads us to Heaven, but when we be in it, hee
takes us by the hand and leads us, and when wee be wearie, hee takes us
up, and when wee bee fallen, he doth recover us; when wee come to a
bridge, that is, when wee come to any hard pinch, hee carries us over:
this is therefore our caſe, and of all the children of God, and wee muſt
bee contented to bee governed and guided by him in all our actions. It
is the madneſſe of the World to have Chriſt to bee their Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
but they will not have him to bee their Governour and Guide;
which is the reaſon why ſo many in the World miſcarrie in their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and their courſes, becauſe they be not guided and governed by him;
therefore every man muſt labour to ſubmit himſelfe to the holy govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Chriſt. In the 73. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24. the Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Thou wilt
guide mee with thy Counſell, and afterwards receive me to glory.</hi> Hence wee
may conclude, that if a man will not be guided by Gods counſell whilſt
he lives here, he ſhall never bee received to glory: as alſo <hi>Acts</hi> 27. <hi>The
Lord had given the lives of all them that were in the Ship to Paul, if they did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide
in it:</hi> And therefore when they were in danger, and would have
taken another courſe, <hi>Paul</hi> tells them, they cannot be ſaved, unleſſe they
abide in the ſhip; ſo unleſſe we abide in the true Ship Chriſt Ieſus, and
be guided by his counſells whiles wee live here, wee cannot bee ſaved:
and this is the ſecond Action.</p>
               <p>The third Action is,<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>That Chriſt doth exerciſe his Church with divers
temptations and trials for their good;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">he exerciſes of he Church with divers tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> we ſee in ſtanding waters that Toads
and Frogges breed, but the Rivers carry them away; even ſo when
there is peace, then there are many vilde luſts and ſinnes breed in the
heart of a Chriſtian,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> as wee may ſee in <hi>David;</hi> and therefore God doth
exerciſe his Church with many temptations and trials to ſcowre away
the ruſt of their ſinnes: as <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. 23. <hi>When hee had called his Diſciples,
he went into a Ship with them,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> 
                  <hi>and a great Tempeſt did ariſe, ſo as the Ship was
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:17958:195"/>
in danger of drowning, whilſt Chriſt was aſleepe in the Ship, and his Diſciples
went and awaked him, ſo there was a great calme:</hi> Now what is this but a
plaine figure of Chriſts dealing with us? for hee placeth us here in this
World, as on the Sea, Hee raiſes up many troubles and afflictions, and
ſeemes to be aſleepe; therefore we muſt goe to Chriſt with the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and awake him by our Prayers, and ſtirre him by our repentance,
and then hee will drive away our troubles; this is one Act of Chriſts
adminiſtration, therefore when it is thus with a Chriſtian, that there is
one trouble after another, hee muſt remember it is one part of Chriſts
holy government, and therefore muſt ſubmit himſelfe unto it.</p>
               <p>There be three cauſes why Chriſt doth exerciſe the Church with diverſe temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.<note place="margin">Three Cauſes why Chriſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes the Church with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>To ſet aworke their graces<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> for when God hath given them Faith,
Repentance, Patience, and other graces of his Spirit, then he doth exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
them and ſet them aworke. So <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. when God had given ſaith
to <hi>Abraham,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1</note> then he tries him and ſets aworke his Faith, and his other
Graces, by offering up his Sonne: And ſo likewiſe we ſee the Lord tried
<hi>Iob</hi> by the Divell,<note place="margin">Iob 1. 3.</note> ſaith he, <hi>Haſt thou not conſidered my ſervant Iob, how that
he is a juſt and upright man?</hi> The Lord would have the World and the
Divell to ſee the graces, that were in <hi>Iob,</hi> and how he was ſtrengthned
from Heaven, and therefore the Lord let in the Divell upon him: If a
man make a curious glaſſe, and would have one to ſee the pretiouſneſſe,
excellencie and ſtrength of it, hee would put it into ones hand, and bid
him fling it againſt the wall, daſh it againſt the ground, be at it with a
hammer, and knocke it never ſo hard hee cares not: ſo the Lord doth
when he hath made a Chriſtian; he puts him ſometimes into the hands
of the World, and lets it daſh him againſt the ground or walls, knocke
him with a hammer, and tread him under foote, that men may ſee the
vertues and graces that bee in him, and how hee is ſtrengthened from
Heaven.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Reaſon 2.</note> the Lord tries and exerciſeth his Church with divers
temptations and trials, <hi>To pull downe ſpirituall pride that they ſwell not with
the graces of God.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> I have ſhewed you heretofore that when men have
good wines they will lay them up, in low cellars, for if they lye high
they will ſowre; ſo becauſe ſpirituall pride will ſowre Gods graces, and
we are ready to loſe them and to runne into the world, therefore the
Lord is faine to exerciſe us with croſſes to lay them low in us: this is
the reaſon why the Lord 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. did ſend <hi>a pricke in the fleſh, and the
meſſenger of Sathan, to buffet Paul</hi> blacke and blew, that he might not ſwell
of his graces, but that hee might lay them in a low cellar, and ſo retaine
them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Reaſon 3.</note> 
                  <hi>to keepe them from ſinne:</hi> we ſee a father if he ſeeth his childe
padling with fire and water,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> hee will take him and make him afraid as
though he would fling him into the fire, or into the water, and yet hee
meaneth no hurt to him but doth it onely to make him afraid; ſo the
Lord deales with us, for many times we be padling with ſinnes, and then
the Lord takes us and makes as if he would throw us into hell, as if hee
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:17958:196"/>
would deſtroy us, and yet hee meanes not hurt to us but doth it to fright
us, and to keepe us from ſinne, that ſo we may creepe to heaven and bee
ſaved.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Shewed you the laſt day that one ſpeciall end
why Chriſt did ſit at the right hand of God is, to
rule and governe the whole world for the good
of the Church, ſo that Chriſts exaltation to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
(I meane his ſitting at the right hand of God)
tends to the good of the Church, they have the
benefit of it and not himſelfe. Now there bee
foure Actions of his holy adminiſtration and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
that he exerciſeth towards the Church: there whereof wee
have ſpoken of already,<note place="margin">Act. 4.</note> the fourth remaines, which is, <hi>That Chriſt doth
preſerve and protect his people and Church againſt all the enemies of it;</hi> hee is
that great <hi>Michael</hi> that is ſpoken of in <hi>Daniel</hi> that ſtandeth up to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
his Church: and but for whoſe defence there would not bee left a
man or a woman to profeſſe the name of Chriſt: ſo this is one of the
Actions of Chriſt to defend the Church againſt all the enemies and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries
thereof.</p>
               <p>Now by five meanes Chriſt doth defend and protect his Church:<note place="margin">Five meanes whereby Chriſt doth protect his Church.</note>
firſt, <hi>by bridling and reſtraining of them that they cannot doe all the hurt they
intend;</hi> as <hi>Gen.</hi> 31. <hi>Laban purſued after Iaakob, and thought to have done him
ſome hurt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>but the Lord came in a dreame to him, and bad him take heed he ſpake
nothing to Iaakob but good;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſo many times when the men of the world doe
follow and purſue the Church thinking to deſtroy and to hurt it, then
the Lord comes with this charge, take heed yee ſpeake not ought but
good to them, take heed ye doe them no hurt; ſo <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 2. ſaith Saint
<hi>Iohn,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> 
                  <hi>I ſaw an Angell come downe from heaven, having the key of the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
pit, and a great Chaine in his hand, and he tooke the Dragon, (which is, the
old Serpent, the devill and Sathan) and he bound him for a thouſand yeares, and
cast him into the bottomleſſe pit, and hee ſhut him up and ſealed the doore upon
him:</hi> ſo it pleaſeth God to lay a chaine upon the divell and upon Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants,
that they ſhall, nor cannot doe all the hurt or miſchiefe that they
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:17958:196"/>
intend againſt the Church, and againſt faithfull men: this is the end
why God doth reſtraine and binde them, to give eaſe to the Church
that it may grow and increaſe; therefore labour to grow in grace when
God gives thee reſt, that ſo thou maieſt bee fitted the better againſt the
time of trouble: ſo we ſee the Church did <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 31. <hi>Then had the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
reſt throughout all Iudea and Galilee and Samaria,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> 
                  <hi>and were edified and wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
in the feare of God, and comfort of the holy Ghoſt, and were multiplied;</hi> for
when it pleaſeth God to reſtraine Tyrants, and to give reſt unto the
Church, they muſt labour to gather Faith, Repentance, Patience, and
comfort againſt the time of trouble.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> 
                  <hi>Baſill</hi> reports that there bee ſeven
daies in the dead of winter that are very calme without ſtormes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a little bird called the <hi>King-fiſher</hi> gets to the ſands, makes her neſt,
laies her egges, hatcheth her young, and then gets away from the ſea:
ſo muſt wee doe, in the winter of this world God gives reſt ſometimes,
therefore then wee muſt make our neſts, lay our egges, and hatch our
young, that is, we muſt get Faith, Repentance, and the Graces of Gods
Spirit; and ſo provide comfort againſt the time of trouble: this is one
meanes whereby God doth protect his Church, by bridling and reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the enemies that they cannot doe all the hurt they intend.</p>
               <p>The ſecond meanes is,<note place="margin">The ſecond meanes.</note> 
                  <hi>by bridling of the enemies and by ſhadowing of the
Church by his owne hand from the fury of the world;</hi> ſo <hi>Ierem.</hi> 36. 26. the
king would have killed <hi>Ieremy,</hi> and <hi>Baruch, but the Lord did hide them;</hi>
and ſo likewiſe <hi>Revel.</hi> 12. 14. it is ſaid, <hi>But unto the woman were given two
wings of a great Eagle, that ſhe might fly into the wilderneſſe into her place, where
ſhe is nouriſhed for a time, and times, and halfe a time;</hi> that is, all the time of
Antichrist the Lord did hide the Church with his holy hand: in like
manner <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. when the Angels came to <hi>Lots</hi> houſe into <hi>Sodom,</hi> the
men of the city came out of their houſes and would have gone in to
trouble <hi>Lot,</hi> and the Angels; <hi>but they were ſtroken with blindeneſſe and could
not finde the doore;</hi> ſo the enemies of the Church, <hi>Papiſts, Atheists</hi> and ſuch
like, they have a long time beene ſeeking to trouble and moleſt Gods
Church; but the Lord hath ſtroken them with blindneſſe that they grope
about the Church and cannot finde the doore, that is, they cannot finde
an entrance, nor the way to begin: this is another meanes how the Lord
doth defend his Church by hiding of them. The Papiſts demand of us
where our Church was before <hi>Luthers</hi> dayes. To this I anſwer, the Lord
did hide them in the wilderneſſe all the time of the rage of Antichriſt:
Saint <hi>Hilarie</hi> ſaith, Yee doe not well to love the wals of the Church, and
to make ſuch accompt of the Temple, know yee not that Antichriſt ſhall
fit in the Temple of God boaſting himſelfe as if he were God; therefore
ſaith hee, looke not for the true Church of God in the Temples, but looke
for it in mines, caves, and ſecret places.</p>
               <p>The third meanes whereby Chriſt defends his Church is, <hi>Miraculouſly
and wonderouſly;</hi> ſo the Lord delivered the Church out of <hi>Egypt</hi> from <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roah;</hi>
and ſo likewiſe, <hi>The three children</hi> out of the <hi>Firie fornace,</hi> and <hi>Dani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi>
out of the <hi>Lions den,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> out of <hi>Priſon</hi> when hee ſhould have beene
brought out the next day to execution: Yea, the Lord doth not onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:17958:197"/>
his Church wonderfully, but alſo gratiouſly: as 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. 26. it was
told to <hi>Saul</hi> that <hi>David was in the wilderneſſe of Maon, preſently Saul and his
men followed him: and Saul with his men were on the one ſide of the mountaine,
and David with his men were on the other ſide: but there came a meſſenger to
Saul, ſaying, Haſte thee and come, for the Philiſtines have invaded the land:</hi> ſo
<hi>David</hi> was delivered gratiouſly, though it were not <hi>miraculous</hi> and <hi>wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,</hi>
but by a rumour and report onely: heere wee ſee though the Lord
doe not deliver us miraculouſly and wonderfully, yet hee doth gratiouſly
in making our greateſt and chiefeſt enemies friendly unto us, and ſo gives
us peace.</p>
               <p>The fourth meanes whereby Chriſt doth defend and protect the
Church is,<note place="margin">The fourth meanes.</note> 
                  <hi>By giving them invincible courage to endure all that the world ſhall
put upon them:</hi> ſo although they bee <hi>ſlaine at the foote of the Lambe and the
blood come downe at their heeles,</hi> yet they goe away with a glorious conqueſt.
So <hi>Paul Rom.</hi> 8. ſaith, <hi>For thy ſake are wee killed all the day long; we are counted
as ſheepe for the ſlaughter, nevertheleſſe in all theſe things wee are more than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours
through him that hath loved us;</hi> for through their Chriſtian cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
they carry away the conqueſt: <hi>Revelation,</hi> 12. 11. it is ſaid, <hi>But they
overcame him by the blood of the Lambe, and by the Word of their testimony,
and they loved not their lives to the death. Cyprian</hi> ſaith well; God would
let the world ſee that though Chriſtians be ſlaine and trodden under foot
for the Goſpell, and for the teſtimony of the truth, yet they cannot over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
them, becauſe they bee not affraid to dye in the cauſe of Chriſt: for
as <hi>Chriſt by dying overcame death,</hi> ſo all his members muſt overcome by dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<hi>Augustine</hi> makes this queſtion, whether the Tyrant doth overcome, or
the Chriſtian? in the eye of ſenſe and reaſon, one would thinke that the
Tyrant hath the better, becauſe hee takes away life and blood, but it is the
Chriſtian that doth overcome, becauſe the Tyrant aimes doth not ſomuch
at the life or blood, but he labours to take away God, Chriſt, the hope of
heaven, and to deſtroy Faith and Religion; but the Tyrant though hee
take away liberty or blood or life, yet he cannot take away God, nor Chriſt,
nor the hope of heaven, nor the pardon of their ſinnes from them; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a Chriſtian is the conquerour, hee hath the better. As wee ſee in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
a man comes to kill a ſerpent,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> hee ſtrikes at the ſerpent, the ſerpent
labours to fence his head, becauſe his life lyes in his head, hee will take a
wound any where before hee will take it there; now as long as the ſerpent
fences his head and keepes his life, hee hath the better, becauſe the man
fought to take away his life and yet he keepes it; ſo when a Tyrant labors
to take away Chriſt, God, and faith from a Chriſtian, yet as long as hee
can keepe Chriſt and his graces, it is ſufficient, becauſe hee is the head and
life lyes in him: though hee bee wounded in his name or in his goods, or
his life taken from him, yet a Chriſtian hath the better: I will further ſhew it
you in an example of Scripture; wee ſee that the <hi>Divell</hi> was as it were let
looſe on <hi>Iob,</hi> hee tooke away his children, and his goods, and hee left him
nothing but the ſtench of his teeth, yet <hi>Iob</hi> had the better, becauſe the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell
did labour to take away his faith and comfort in God which he could
not, and therefore ſeeing <hi>Iob</hi> did keepe this, God ſets the crowne on his
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:17958:197"/>
head, and hee goes away the conquerour; ſo though ſickneſſe take away
a mans health, and uſurers his money, and theeves his goods, and tyrants
his life and blood, yet as long as a man keepes God, Chriſt, his faith and
hope of heaven, he hath the better.</p>
               <p>The fifth meanes is,<note place="margin">The fifth means.</note> 
                  <hi>By deſtroying and confounding all their enemies;</hi> for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it pleaſed God to uſe them for the chaſtening of his children, yet
at laſt hee will deſtroy them; a father uſeth a rod to chaſten his ſonne for
his amendment, yet at laſt hee will deſtroy the rod; ſo wee ſee <hi>Exod.</hi> 5.
what grievous taſkes were laid on the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> by <hi>Pharoah,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> to
make them willing to depart the land, the Lord was faine to doe as men
doe by bees, to ſmoke them out to make them leave their hives, ſo the
Lord did ſmoke them out of the place, and at laſt <hi>Pharaoh</hi> the rod it ſelfe
was drowned in the red ſea;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſo <hi>Dan.</hi> 8. wee ſee the <hi>Little horne,</hi> which was
the King of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> hee did overcome for a time, and tread under the
people of God, yet at laſt his horne was broken; ſo alſo <hi>Revelation</hi> 12. <hi>The
Beaſt that had ſeven heads and ten hornes,</hi> that did labour to devoure the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
hee alſo ſhall goe to deſtruction: and therefore let not Chriſtians
be diſcouraged and diſmaied, though they ſee the Church hath great ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
for God will defend and protect them againſt all their enemies, if
they walke worthy of the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> and labour to pleaſe God in all their
courſes; theſe bee the foure actions whereby Chriſt doth rule and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne
the Church: which for your memories ſake, I will briefly recapitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
unto you.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that hee doth draw and pull them out of the condemned multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of the world, and bring them to an eſtate of grace: ſecondly, hee
doth guide and governe them by his Word and Spirit: Thirdly, he doth
exerciſe them with divers temptations and trials: Laſtly, hee doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
and defend them againſt all their enemies.</p>
               <p>The Vſes wee are to make of Chriſts ſitting at the right hand of God
are;<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> firſt, that ſeeing Chriſt ſits in the higheſt place next to God, therefore
wee muſt labour to ſubmit our ſelves unto him, ſinke downe at the feet of
Chriſt, and bee contented to bee ruled and guided by him: but they that
are ruled by their owne luſts and ſinnes, they doe (as it were) pull downe
Chriſt out of his throne, and ſet up their ſinnes in his roome: <hi>Pſal</hi> 2. ſaith
the Lord, <hi>I have ſet my king upon mine holy hill;</hi> it is the decree of God that
wee ſhould ſerve and feare him, that we ſhould labour <hi>To kiſſe him,</hi> to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
our ſelves unto him, <hi>leſt his wrath be kindled and then we periſh ſuddenly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> ſeeing Chriſt ſits at the right hand of God, therefore wee
muſt take heede we doe not ſinne againſt him and offend him, becauſe
hee is in the next place to God; It is a great matter to ſinne againſt him
and offend him, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 12. ſaith he, <hi>Now when yee ſin againſt the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
and wound their weake conſciences, ye ſin againſt Chriſt:</hi> It is a great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
indeed to ſinne againſt Chriſt, <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, the <hi>Iewes</hi> condemned
Chriſt, and are blamed for it, but there is a great difference betweene
their ſinnes and the ſinnes of Chriſtians under the Goſpell, for they ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
againſt Chriſt in the time of his humiliation when hee did hang on
the croſſe, but thou art a chriſtian, ſin'ſt him now he is exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:17958:198"/>
into glory and ſits at the right hand of God; we ſee <hi>David</hi> when he
<hi>had cut off but the lap of Sauls garment, his heart did ſmite him;</hi> ſo much more
ſhould our hearts ſmite us, when wee have ſinned againſt him and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Vſe 3.</note> ſeeing Chriſt ſits at the right hand of God, doe thou labor
to bee in Chriſt a true Chriſtian, and then hee will defend thee from all
dangers, and turne all they troubles into comforts, all thy paines to eaſe,
thy ſorrow into joy, thy ſickneſſe into health, and thy death into life.
<hi>Acts</hi> 7. 36. we read that <hi>Stephen ſaw Heaven opened, and Chriſt ſtanding at
the right hand of God ready to receive him;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſo if a Chriſtian man or woman
behold Chriſt with the eye of Faith ſitting at the right hand of God at
the day of Death, this will give them comfort againſt all their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Vſe 4.</note> ſeeing Chriſt ſits at the right hand of God, therefore as
Chriſt overcame the Divell and all our ſpirituall enemies, ſo wee muſt
firſt overcome ſin, the Divell and all our luſts, and then we ſhall ſit at the
right hand of God: this promiſe makes, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. 21. <hi>To him that
overcommeth will I grant to ſit with me in my Fathers Throne, even as I over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
and ſit with my Father in his Throne:</hi> and therefore doe thou never
reſt, but labour to overcome ſinne and thy owne corruptions whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
thy paines and troubles be, and then thou ſhalt ſit at the right hand
of God:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> 
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 28. ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Ye which follow me in the regeneration
ſhall ſit on twelve Thrones and judge the twelve Tribes of Iſrael;</hi> you that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
me in a holy life, you that are borne againe anew, and you that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
of your ſins and make conſcience of your waies, you ſhall ſit upon
the throne of Chriſt, when others ſhall ſit down in the ſhadow of death,
and in the dungeon of Hell, with the Divell and his Angels; therefore
as Chriſt overcame Sinne, Death, and Hell and the Divell, and when
he had done it hee ſate downe then at the right hand of God, ſo when
we have overcome, we ſhall ſit at the right hand of God for ever.</p>

which is in the next Article of our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian

he ſhall come to judge the quicke and the Dead.</hi> He that

on the ſtage of this World, then the Lord Ieſus Chriſt ſhall have
his time to play his part, to ſhut up all, and gather his ſervants and ſaints
together into Heaven, but the wicked ſhall bee caſt into Hell. This is

whole World; there be many judgements, as <hi>Zephan.</hi> 3. 11. <hi>The juſt Lord
is in the midſt thereof, he will doe no iniquitie, every morning doth hee bring his
judgements to light, and he faileth not; but the wicked will not learn to be aſham'd:</hi>

bodies, but with ſoules alſo, for ſaith he, <hi>The Sea gave up the dead in her,
and Death and Hell delivered up their Dead that were in them:</hi> So we ſee the
bodies riſe againe to be judged, as well as the Soules.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Reaſon 2.</note> 
                  <hi>That there may be a declaration of the juſt judgement of God;</hi> that
all the World may ſee the judgements of God are juſt upon men for
their ſins; as <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>But thou after thy hardneſſe of heart that cannot repent,
heapeſt upon thy ſelfe wrath againſt the day of wrath, and of the declaration of the
juſt judgement of God:</hi> therefore beſides the private and cloſe judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
there muſt bee a generall and ſolemne arraignement in the view
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:17958:199"/>
of the whole world, that ſo there may be a declaration of the juſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">The third Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> 
                  <hi>Becauſe they ſhall not be judged as private perſons,</hi> but as publike
in the ſame body that they lived in: either in the body of the Saints, or in
the body of the wicked, for they ſhall be judged as they be members of
the ſame body they riſe in: and as they are found to have done good or
bad, accordingly ſhal the diviſion be made, as appears, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 31. where
it is ſaid, <hi>And before him ſhall bee gathered all Nations, and hee ſhall ſeparate
them one from another, as a ſheapheard doth ſeparate his Sheepe from the Goats,
and he ſhall ſet the one at his right hand, and the other at his left hand, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now becauſe this point is a great, and a very waighty one, and to be
conſidered before others in a Chriſtians life, being like the great wheel
of a clocke,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> it turnes all the inferior wheeles; ſo if a man be once perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of this, that he muſt give an account to God for all his actions, and
muſt ſtand before God in judgement, it will make him to paſſe his daies
holily and vertuouſly while he lives here: and therefore let us ſee brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
what bee the proofes, and grounds that there ſhall bee a judgement;
which are chiefly theſe foure following.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The firſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Foure proofes that there ſhall be a Generall judgement.</note> 
                  <hi>is taken</hi> From the Truth of God, becauſe hee hath ſaid it, <hi>and
therefore it ſhall come to paſſe, for</hi> God is not as Man that hee ſhould lye,
neither as the Sonne of Man that he ſhould repent; He hath ſaid it, and ſhall hee
in doe it? and hath he ſpoken it, and ſhall he not accompliſh it? <hi>As it is,</hi> Num.
23. 19. <hi>Therefore whatſoever he hath ſaid, it ſhall come to paſſe in the
time that he hath appointed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that Chriſt hath ſaid there ſhall be a judgement day, there bee
many Scriptures for it, As <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 15. <hi>Truely I ſay unto you it ſhall bee
eaſier for them of the land of Sodom and Gomorah in the day of judgement, than
for that Citie:</hi> So alſo <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 36. <hi>But I ſay unto you, That of every idle
word that men ſhall ſpeake, they ſhall give an account at the day of judgement:</hi>
And verſe 41. <hi>The men of Ninevie ſhall riſe up in judgement with this Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and ſhall condemne it, becauſe they repented at the preaching of Ionas.</hi>
We ſee the Teſtimony of the Lord is plaine for this, that there ſhall bee
a judgement day: <hi>Augustine</hi> ſaith, God hath made us many promiſes,
and hath performed them, and ſhall wee not thinke that the judgement
day ſhall come, according as hee hath foretold us? It is ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 144.
<hi>The Lord is righteous in all his waies, and holy in all his workes:</hi> If the Lord
hath promiſed any thing, it ſhall come to paſſe, for the Lord hath left
his Scripture which is his hand-writing to aſſure us of the truth of it.
And therefore doſt thou not beleeve that there ſhall bee a day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
The Lord himſelfe ſhall anſwere thee; thou haſt the hand-wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of GOD, and what muſt thou doe? Looke into that and ſee,
what a company of things hee hath promiſed in his Word, as unlikely
as this, which are all come to paſſe; he hath promiſed that <hi>He would ſend
his Sonne into the World to worke thy Redemption;</hi> Looke into his Word,
thou haſt his hand-writing, hath he performed this promiſe? Then aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
thy ſelfe likewiſe that one day he will come to iudgement: Hee
hath promiſed that <hi>Hee will ſend downe his ſpirit that ſhould lead them in all
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:17958:200"/>
truth;</hi> thou haſt his hand writing, ſee if this promiſe be come to paſſe,
then aſſure thy ſelfe withall, he will come to judge this World; hath he
promiſed, <hi>He will preach the Goſpell to all Nation,</hi> looke into the Scriptures,
hath hee performed it? Why then never doubt but that thy body alſo
ſhall riſe becauſe he hath foretold it.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is,<note place="margin">The ſecond Proofe.</note> 
                  <hi>becauſe it is the nature of Gods Iuſtice to give to every man
according to his due deſert,</hi> good things to good men, and evill things to
evill men: but it is not ſo here in this life, but the beſt men bee in the
worſt eſtate for the moſt part, and evill men in the beſt; for as <hi>Salomon</hi>
ſaith, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9. 2. <hi>All things come alike to all: there is one event to the juſt,
and to the wicked, to the pure, and to the polluted, and to him that ſacrificeth, and to
him that ſacrificeth not, as is the good, ſo is the ſinner, and he that ſweareth, as he
that ſweareth not, or feareth an oath:</hi> ſo the worſt be in the beſt eſtate, and
the good be in the worſt eſtate; hereof <hi>Habakkuk</hi> complaines <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 13.
<hi>Thou art of pure eyes, and canſt not behold wickedneſſe; wherefore doſt thou looke
on the tranſgreſſors, and holdest thy tongue, when the wicked devoureth the man
that is more righteous than be?</hi> here in this life there be many aberrations
and ſwervings from the right rule of juſtice, therefore there muſt bee a
judgement to bring that which deflects from the rule to rectitude and
ſtraightneſſe: Againe, <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſpeaking out of <hi>Pſſalm.</hi> 101. ſaith,
God hath two times; there is a time of mercy, and a time of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
therefore doe thou not accompt God unjuſt, though good and
bad ſpeede alike, he makes the raine to raine on the juſt and the unjuſt,
the Sunne doth ſhine on both, and they drinke all of one fountaine, and
draw in the ſame ayre, yet doe not thinke God to be unjuſt, becauſe this
is the time of mercy, but there will come a time of judgement; and
therefore (ſaith hee) O, my brethren bee wiſe an take heede, doe not
ſay, I did naughtily to day, and yet it was well with me, and I will doe
naughtily to morrow, and I hope to doe well too, this is but the time of
Gods mercy, there will come a time of His Iudgement wherein Hee
will call thee to accompt for all thy ſinnes.</p>
               <p>The third is,<note place="margin">The third Proofe.</note> 
                  <hi>from the wiſedome of God, and wiſe order be hath in the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of all things:</hi> for in all well ordered commonwealths, there are <hi>Aſsiſes,
Seſſions,</hi> and <hi>Law-daies;</hi> and in every city, towne, and hamlet there are
courts to order and determine things:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> if it bee ſo in all well ordered
commonwealths, then it muſt needs be ſo in Gods Kingdome; if this
wiſedome bee in man, that is but finite, much more ſurely is it in God
that is infinite; and therefore ſeeing in all well ordered common-wealths,
there is a time of judgement, it holds much more that God
ſhould have a Iudgement day to arraigne the whole world in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The fourth is,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The fourth Proofe.</note> from the common conſent of all, <hi>that is, of</hi> Angels, men <hi>and
of</hi> devils: <hi>Of</hi> Angels <hi>as we ſee</hi> Acts. 1. 11. Yee men of Galilee, why ſtand ye
heere gazing to heaven? this Ieſus whom ye ſee taken from you into heaven, ſhall
ſo come, as yee have ſeene him goe into heaven. <hi>And</hi> holy men <hi>doe acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
thus much, as Saint</hi> Iohn <hi>in the</hi> Revelation, <hi>and</hi> Henoch <hi>long before
did propheſie of it,</hi> Iude 14. <hi>ſo</hi> David, Pſalm. 89. ult. For he is come to
judge the earth, with righteouſneſſe ſhall hee judge the earth, and the people with
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:17958:200"/>
equity: <hi>Yea, the</hi> devils <hi>beleeve it, and tremble, as</hi> Matth. 8. Art thou
come hither to torment us before our time: <hi>therefore ſeeing there is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
conſent of all,</hi> Angels, holy Men <hi>and</hi> devils, <hi>it is certaine there ſhall
be a judgement day: which granted, as needs it muſt, let us make ſome
profitable Vſe for our inſtruction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt uſe is,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> 
                  <hi>That ſeeing there is a judgement, therefore wee ſhould reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
ſtand in feare of it,</hi> for one day thou ſhalt riſe out of thy grave, and
ſhalt ſtand before Chriſt in judgement to anſwere for all thy thoughts,
words and actions, and therefore it is not a light matter, but ſtands eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man in hand to bee reverently afraid of the judgement day, which
<hi>Paul</hi> cals <hi>the terrour of the Lord,</hi> becauſe it is a terrible thing to ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God in judgement.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> Wee ſee what a fearefull thing it is when a
theefe (ſhut up in the Iayle) is to make his appearance before an earthly
Iudge, which is but the danger of this life: how much more then will
is ſtrike terrour into us, when accuſed of our own conſciences, we are to
come before Chriſt in Iudgement who will judge both ſoule and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy?
When <hi>Paul</hi> preached to <hi>Felix of temperance and judgement,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> it is ſaid,
<hi>Felix trembled;</hi> now if he trembled at the name of judgement, then how
much more oughteſt thou to tremble? thou that art a cold Chriſtian,
that haſt lived looſely and badly, how oughteſt thou to to tremble (I ſay)
hearing of the ſeverity of Chriſt? It is a good ſaying Saint <hi>Bernard</hi>
hath, if thou haſt put away all ſhame which appertaines to ſo noble a
creature as thou art,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> yet caſt not away feare, for, ſaith he, men uſe to load
an Aſſe, and he beares it becauſe he is an Aſſe, but thruſt him in the fire,
or into a pit, and he will ſhunne it, becauſe he feareth death, and loveth
life: therefore be not worſe than the beaſt, feare death, feare hell, feare
Iudgement.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> ſeeing there is a Iudgement day, <hi>therefore we ſhould be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to paſſe the time of our dwelling here in holineſſe and feare,</hi> becauſe wee
ſhall ſtand before God in judgement; heaven and hell cannot avoide it,
the mountaines and hils cannot cover and hide us from his preſence;
therefore every man muſt bee carefull to pleaſe God, and to paſſe his
time well here, becauſe he muſt ſtand before God in judgement hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
Men that goe to markets and faires,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> knowing that their packs ſhall
be opened by the ſearchers to ſee what wares they bring, will bee care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
what wares they packe up; ſo ſeeing our packs and f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rdels ſhall bee
opened at that day, that is, our conſciences, we muſt bee carefull what
we packe and fardell up, ſeeing all ſhall be diſcovered; wee reade <hi>Iohn</hi>
11. 7. when there was word given out that it was the Lord that was on
the ſhore,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> 
                  <hi>Peter did gird his coate to him, and cast himſelfe into the Sea:</hi> this
was a ſtrange action of <hi>Peter,</hi> one would have thought rather he would
have let it alone, or have put off his coate; but <hi>Peter</hi> did wiſely conſider,
that hee muſt ſtand before Chriſt, and therefore that hee might ſtand
ſeemely before him, hee did gird himſelfe: ſo ſeeing wee ſhall one day
ſtand before God in judgement, wee muſt gird our coates unto us, and
caſt our ſelves into the glaſſie ſea of this world, that ſo wee may ſtand
ſeemely before him at that day.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="390" facs="tcp:17958:201"/>
Thirdly, ſeeing there is a judgement day, <hi>therefore wee muſt labour to
repent us of our ſinnes;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vſe 3.</note> if we repent of them, they ſhall be forgiven us, if
we doe not, we ſhall anſwere for them at that day: this counſell Chriſt
doth give us,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> 
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 58. <hi>Whileſt thou goeſt with thy adverſarie to the ruler,
as thou art in the way, give diligence that thou maieſt bee delivered from him,
leſt he bring thee before the Iudge, and the Iudge deliver thee to the Iaylor, and
the Iaylor caſt thee into priſon, I tell thee, Thou ſhalt not depart thence, till thou
haſt paid the uttermoſt mite:</hi> ſo wee are all in the way to the judgement
ſeate, whil'ſt we live here, therefore let us make our peace with God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
us of our ſinnes, and be reconciled to him, for if wee doe not, hee
will deliver us to the Iaylor, and we ſhall be caſt into hell, and ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
come out.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> It is a good ſaying of Saint <hi>Auſtine,</hi> if an earthly Iudge
paſſe ſentence againſt thee, and ſhould condemne thee to dye, to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
or the next day, tell me what would'ſt thou doe? would'ſt thou
ſleepe in thy chaines, and fetters? would'ſt thou idle out the time? No,
but thou would'ſt goe to this friend, and to that friend, and would'ſt ſell
all thou had'ſt to purchaſe a pardon: and if a friend ſhould ſay to thee,
what doſt thou meane to runne up and downe, and ſell that thou
haſt? why, thou would'ſt anſwere and ſay, I am condemned to dye to
morrow, or the next day, therefore whil'ſt I have time, I will labour to
ſave my life: ſo the heavenly Iudge hath given ſentence of us, and wee
may dye to morrow, or next day, and therefore what muſt wee doe?
ſleepe away the time, or idle it away? No, but labour to make friends,
to ſell all we have, to part with our wealth, and goods, to pray unto God,
to repent us of our ſinnes, that ſo wee may eſcape that heavie ſentence.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Vſe 4.</note> ſeeing there is a judgement day, <hi>this may give us comfort
againſt all the injuries and wrongs that are done unto us:</hi> Thus <hi>Paul</hi> doth
comfort himſelfe 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>But he that judgeth mee is the Lord: therefore
judge nothing before the time untill the Lord come, who both will bring to light
things that be hid in darkeneſſe, and will make the counſels of the hearts mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt:
and then ſhall every man have praiſe of God.</hi> Therefore howſoever a
Chriſtian man may be condemned for a diſſembler, an hypocrite, and a
proud perſon, yet this may give him comfort, that there is a judgement
day, and then men ſhall ſee whether they died in truth or no. This was
<hi>Moſes</hi>'s comfort,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> 
                  <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. when <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> came and
told him, <hi>be tooke too much upon him,</hi> and counted him a proud perſon;
ſaith he, <hi>To morrow the Lord ſhall ſhew who are his, and who appertaine to him:</hi>
ſo this ſhould be the comfort of a Chriſtian, when hee is ſlandered, and
evill ſpoken of, and counted a diſſembler, hee may ſay to morrow the
Lord ſhall ſhew you whether it bee ſo or no, when the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is.</p>

               <p>Secondly, <hi>Who ſhall be the Iudge?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Secondly, who ſhall be the Judge.</note> Chriſt onely ſhall be the Iudge; in this
world there bee many tribunals for offenders to be judged at, but when all
theſe tribunals ſhall ceaſe, then Chriſt ſhall be the Iudge onely: <hi>Paul</hi> tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 24. <hi>When hee hath put downe all things, all rule and authority,
then God ſhall be all in all;</hi> and <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 22. it is ſaid, <hi>he hath committed all judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the Sonne:</hi> ſo in this place which I have read unto you, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 42.
<hi>And hee commanded us to preach unto the people, and to teſtifie that it is hee that
is ordained of God to be the Iudge of quicke and dead;</hi> as alſo, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. <hi>We ſhall
all appeare before the judgement ſeat of Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> ſo wee ſee Chriſt is the
Iudge and none but hee; and there is a Reaſon for it, for there are two
things required of a Iudge:
1 Sufficient Knowledge, to know all things whatſoever.<note place="margin">Two things needfull in a Iudge.</note>
2 <hi>Sufficient Power, to puniſh all offenders.</hi> Which two are
moſt eminent in God.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>There is ſufficient knowledge,</hi> becauſe Chriſt knowes all things that
are done,<note place="margin">Firſt, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</note> there is nothing in all the world, but he knowes it; <hi>Angels</hi> know
not the thoughts of men, <hi>Divels</hi> know not mens intentions, and men
know not all actions that are done, but <hi>Chriſt</hi> knowes mens thoughts, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,
and actions; Therefore it is ſaid, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9. <hi>That hee ſaw their
thoughts:</hi> And <hi>Ioh.</hi> 21. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith unto Chriſt, <hi>Lord thou knoweſt all things;</hi>
So <hi>Hebrew.</hi> 4. 13. it is ſaid, <hi>That all things are naked and manifeſt before
him with whom we have to do:</hi> therefore he is the fitteſt for to be a Iudge.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="392" facs="tcp:17958:202"/>
Secondly, as hee hath ſufficient knowledge, so hee hath <hi>Sufficient power
to puniſh offenders;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2</note> when man hath killed the body, hee can goe no farther,
hee cannot kill the ſoule; but there is a power in Chriſt<note place="margin">Power.</note> 
                  <hi>To kill both body
and ſoule, and caſt it into hell fire. Even hee, Matthew</hi> 3. <hi>which hath his fan
in his hand, and will make cleane his flowre, and gather his wheat into his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
but will burne up the chaffe with unquenchable fire.</hi> And <hi>Revel.</hi> 20. it is
ſaid, <hi>And whoſoever was not found written in the booke of life, was caſt into the
lake of fire:</hi> ſo there is ſufficient power in Chriſt to puniſh all offenders,
and ſufficient knowledge; therefore hee is fitteſt to be the Iudge, Angels
are not, becauſe they know not mens thoughts; men bee not fit, becauſe
there is a defect of power; when they have killed the body they are not
able to kill the ſoule.</p>
               <p>Now if any man ſhall object and ſay,<note place="margin">Object.</note> Is Chriſt the Iudge onely, ſeeing
hee ſaith himſelfe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. <hi>That thoſe which do follow him in this regeneration,
ſhall ſit upon twelve thrones, and judge the twelve tribes of Iſrael;</hi> which alſo
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſeemes to agree with, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 2, 3. <hi>Doe yee not know that the
Saints ſhall judge the world? How then ſhall Chriſt be the onely Iudge?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> It is true that when the Saints themſelves have had judgement,
then they ſhall bee taken up, and ſit with Chriſt in judgement; But how?
Chriſt ſhall give the finall ſentence, and they ſhall bee Approovers or
Aſſiſters, ſo they ſhall judge, but not as ſupreme Iudges, but as Aſſiſters:
as we ſee at the Aſſiſes, the Iudge gives the finall ſentence, and the Iuſtices
doe but aſſent,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ratifie, and confirme it to bee true judgement; ſo it is
Chriſt that is the <hi>Supreme Iudge</hi> to give the finall ſentence, the Saints doe
but aſſent to it, and approve of the judgement to bee true judgement.
The Vſes are:</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> ſeeing Chriſt ſhall be our Iudge, we muſt labour to be found in
Chriſt, and to be Members of his body, becauſe hee wiſheth well to his
owne body: Therefore let us labour to bee found in Chriſt, to live in
him, and then it ſhall goe well with us; <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>There is no
condemnation to thoſe that be in Chriſt:</hi> all the comfort of a Chriſtian ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
from this, that hee is one with Chriſt, that hee hath the Spirit and
grace of Chriſt, to ſay as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20. <hi>Thus I live, yet not I
now, but Chriſt liveth in mee;</hi> then hee may have comfort at the day of
judgement when he is found in Chriſt. It was <hi>Pauls</hi> care, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. <hi>That
he accounted all things as dung and droſſe, that hee might winne Chriſt,</hi> or bee
found in him: Now that which was <hi>Pauls</hi> care muſt bee ours alſo, that
wee ſhould account all things but dirt, dung and droſſe, to bee found in
Chriſt. If a man have judgement paſſed againſt him, to loſe his hand,
his eye,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> or ſome other member for his offence; if he hath the ſkill, that
he can make his eye and his hand, the hand and eye of the kings ſon, the
king would ſurely ſpare him for his ſonnes ſake; ſo there is a ſentence
paſſed againſt us for our offences, and wee are judged not onely to loſe
an hand, or an eye, or any one member, but all our parts; now if wee
have the ſkill to make our hands, eyes and members, the hands, eyes,
and members of Chriſt, and become one with him, then God will
ſpare us for his Sonnes ſake. Thus to be found in Chriſt is very difficult,
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:17958:202"/>
and therefore let us conſider theſe three things, which are neceſſarily
required thereto.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Three things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to bee found in Chriſt.</note> 
                  <hi>Hee muſt make a remoove from himſelfe,</hi> that is, from his ſinnes
and corrnptions, and become a new Creature; as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
5. 17. <hi>If any man be in Chriſt, hee is a new Creature:</hi> Therefore, if any man
ſtand in his ſinnes and remaine in them,<note place="margin">1</note> hee cannot be in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>He muſt long in Soule and Spirit for Chriſt;</hi> as an hungry man
doth for his meate, and a thirſty man for his drinke; and <hi>Matthew</hi> 5.<note place="margin">Simile.</note>
Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Bleſſed is hee that hungreth and thirſteth for righteouſneſſe, &amp;c.</hi>
So that if a man hunger and thirſt for Chriſt, he is a bleſſed and an hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
man.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>He muſt be ſetled on Chriſt with all his affections:</hi> he muſt cleave
unto him by faith, and apply him home to himſelfe as the woman in the
Goſpell did throng and thruſt to Chriſt to touch him,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and did draw
vertue out of him to heale her; ſo we ſhould thruſt and throng to Chriſt,
and touch him by the hand of Faith, and ſo draw out his vertues and
graces.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> that ſeeing Chriſt is our Iudge, wee muſt take heed wee
doe not diſpleaſe or offend him: A number of men doe not regard him,
but attend their profits and pleaſures, ſet light by Chriſt, and care not
to pleaſe him, no more than a man would pleaſe a Dogge, with what
face can theſe men looke on Chriſt? How abaſhed and aſhamed ſhall
theſe men be to looke on him? We ſee <hi>Gen.</hi> 45. when <hi>Ioſeph</hi> did diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
himſelfe to his brethren, and ſaid, <hi>I am Ioſeph,</hi> how abaſhed and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed
were they? If they had uſed him well, they might have had
comfort, but their conſciences told them, that they had done injury and
wrong unto him, ſold him for a ſlave, and caſt him into a pit, therefore
they were aſhamed and abaſhed when hee ſaid, <hi>I am Ioſeph;</hi> ſo when
men have done well, when they have repented them of their ſinnes, and
obeyed Chriſt, then they ſhall have comfort, when Chriſt ſhall come
in the Clouds, and ſay, I am your brother <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> I am your <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior
Ieſus Chriſt:</hi> but if they have done injury and wrong to Chriſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
his lawes, deſpiſed him, and ſet light by him; how ſhall they
then be aſhamed, confounded and abaſhed? and with what faces ſhall
they looke on him at that day? Chriſt tells us, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. That when
<hi>becomes in the Clouds,</hi> all the kindreds of the Earth ſhall waile and weepe
that they were miſtaken in taking him for a bare man. The <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhall
waile and weepe that they thought it folly to beleeve in one that was
hanged on the Croſſe; and the cold and lukewarme Chriſtian ſhall
waile and weepe, that hee loved the World more than Chriſt: At that
time Chriſt ſhall ſay unto them, I deſcended from Heaven, that you
might aſcend; I was contented to bee borne in a Stable, laid in a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
that you might be in a better place; I was crowned with thornes,
that you might be crowned with glory; I was buffered and whipt, that
you might have caſe; I was killed on the croſſe, that you might live; I
was contented to deſcend into the Grave, that you might goe to glory:
where is the fruite of all theſe my labours, and paines? where is your
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:17958:203"/>
repentance, your care to pleaſe me? I counted of you more pretious
than my blood, for I was contented to ſhed my moſt pretious blood
for your ſakes, and yet you account of me moſt vile; for of all the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
the Earth is the moſt baſe, and you account of mee baſer than of
it; therefore wee ſee when men deſpiſe and contemne Chriſt, heavie
comfort ſhall follow them, when he ſhall ſay unto them, Receive dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
with the Divell and his Angels.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Vſe 3.</note> ſeeing Chriſt ſhall be the judge, it muſt be every mans care
to pleaſe him: If the world ſhould be our judge, then we might labor to
pleaſe that, or if a noble man, kings, or princes, then we might pleaſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>;
but inſomuch as Chriſt is our judge, it is nothing to pleaſe the world, or
to pleaſe the King or Princes, as noble men, unleſſe we pleaſe Chriſt; as
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 10. (ſaith S. <hi>Paul) Wherefore alſo we deſire that dwelling at home, and
removing from home, we may be acceptable to him:</hi> why doth he deſire to be
acceptable to God? becauſe (ſaith he) <hi>We ſhall all appeare before the Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſeat of Chriſt; becauſe Chriſt ſhall be the Iudge.</hi> There bee a number of
civill men in the world, that thinke all is well with them, if the world
cannot touch them for any fault, but what is it for the world to approve
of a man,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> if Chriſt condemne him. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaith well, A man in a
race when hee runs for a priſe, doth not take heede of the applauſe of
the ſtanders by, but his eyes bee on the Iudge of the game, and his care
is to pleaſe him, becauſe he ſhall give him his reward; ſo ſeeing wee all
runne in race to Heaven, and Chriſt is the Iudge of the game. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let us not take heed of the applauſe of the ſtanders by, which are
but men, but let us eye Chriſt, and labour to pleaſe him, becauſe it is he
that muſt give vs our reward, and our crowne: <hi>Auguſtine</hi> on <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. ſaith,
with what face ſhall I goe to Chriſt, if I ſhall pleaſe others and ſinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, and offend him? it may be (ſaith hee) that I may die to day,
or to morrow, or the next day, and then with what face ſhall I ſtand
before him?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, ſeeing Chriſt ſhall bee our Iudge, therefore this may give us
infinite comfort, that hee that was our Saviour and Redeemer ſhall be our
Iudge, hee that bought us with the pretious price of his blood: if a man
knew his father, brother, or his friend ſhould bee his Iudge, hee might
hope hee ſhould doe well; but it is Gods great mercy to us in this, that he
hath not made our father, brother, or our friend our Iudge, but hee hath
made Chriſt our Iudge, our Saviour and Redeemer, one that hath done
more for us than all the world beſide: the <hi>Butler</hi> was not afraid to goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Pharaoh,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> becauſe <hi>Ioſeph</hi> had told him hee would bee ſet at liberty; ſo
ſeeing Chriſt hath told us, that this is a time of joy and liberty, therefore
wee ſhould not be afraid to goe before him; <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Lift up
your heads with joy, for the day of Redemption draweth neere.</hi> Wee ſee in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,<note place="margin">Simile.</note>
if a man have a weighty matter to try in the court of juſtice, if he
heare the chiefe of his counſell is become the Iudge, hee that was his
advocate and pleaded the matter a long time, he hopes that it will goe
well with him: ſo wee have a weighty matter to try in the court of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
it concernes our life and ſalvation, and Chriſt hee that was the
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:17958:203"/>
chiefe of our counſell, is become our Iudge, he that was our advocate,
and pleaded our matter a long time before God: this may give us com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
that it ſhall goe well with us. Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> ſaith well, the day ſhall
come when the whole world ſhall weepe, and waile, and mourne, and
grieve, when thou that art a Chriſtian ſhalt bee glad and rejoyce;
when <hi>Plato,</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and others ſhall ſay, we did not know him, and
the <hi>Iewes</hi> we tooke him for a bare man, &amp; the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> we thought it ſilly
to beeleeve in One that died upon the croſſe, and <hi>the cold Chriſtians</hi> ſhall
ſay, wee have loved the world, and have not regarded him; then the
true Chriſtians ſhall comfortably ſay, This is our Saviour and Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
this is our God, and we have waited for him.</p>
               <p>The third point, <hi>the place, where he ſhall judge us:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The place is to be conſidered two waies: <hi>generally</hi> and <hi>particularly:
generally,</hi> the place where wee ſhall bee judged is, <hi>in this earth,</hi> therefore
wee ſay in the <hi>Articles</hi> of our <hi>Chriſtian ſaith, from thence hee ſhall come to
judge both the quicke and the dead:</hi> and <hi>Act.</hi> 11. 1. the <hi>Angels</hi> tell us, that
<hi>this Ieſus which is taken from you into heaven, ſhall ſo come as yee have ſeene
him goe into heaven;</hi> ſo alſo <hi>Iude</hi> 24. <hi>Henoch</hi> tels us that <hi>the Lord ſhall come
with thouſand of his Saints to give judgement againſt all men:</hi> ſo that this
world is the place of judgment; and moreover I will prove it by theſe
two reaſons:</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> becauſe this is <hi>the ordinary courſe of Iuſtice,</hi> for where men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
their offences in the ſame places they are judged: as wee ſee in the
ſame countries where men have done their faults there the Aſſiſes are
kept:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſo ſeeing we have ſinned againſt God in this earth, here wee ſhall
be judged: as 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 6. it is ſaid, <hi>Samuel went about yeare by yeare to
Bethel, Gilgal and Mizpeh, and judged Iſrael in all thoſe places.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>becauſe it is the fitteſt, and meeteſt place for it:</hi> it cannot bee in
<hi>hell,</hi> or in <hi>Heaven;</hi> not in Heaven, becauſe the unjuſt cannot come there,
not in hell becauſe the juſt cannot come thither: as we ſee <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 26.
<hi>Abraham</hi> ſaith to <hi>Dives, Betweene you and us there is a great gulfe ſet, ſo that
they which would goe from hence to you cannot, neither can they come from thence
to us:</hi> and therefore ſeeing they which are in heaven cannot come in
hell, and they which bee in hell cannot come to Heaven, there muſt bee
a middle place, to judge the world in, and that is this earth.</p>
               <p>Now there be two uſes to be made of this point:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. A terrour to the wicked.</item>
                  <item>2. A comfort to the godly.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>it ſhall bee a terrour to the wicked to bee judged in the ſame place where
they diſhonored God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> and blaſphemed his Name, and where they have
committed moſt grievous ſinnes; in the ſight of their fine houſes, gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
gardens, friends and acquaintance they ſhall bee judged: if it were
in a corner that no body ſhould ſee them, their griefe were the leſſe, or
if it were in a farre country: but ſeeing it ſhall bee in this world where
they have ſinned againſt God in the ſight of their friends and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
this ſhall be the greater terrour, as <hi>Heſt.</hi> 7. 11. <hi>Haman was hanged on
the gallowes which he had ſet up for Mordecai;</hi> it had bin ſhame enough for
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:17958:204"/>
him to have died in another place,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> but to dye at his owne houſe, in the
ſight of his wife, and children, ſervants, and by the meanes of his goods,
this made his terrour the greater; ſo the wicked ſhall be judged here in
this world, in the ſight of their wives and children, and in the ſight of
their friends and acquaintance, this makes for the terrour of them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>comfort to the godly,</hi> that in the ſame place where they have
beene deſpiſed and and diſgraced, there they ſhall be honoured: <hi>Ioſephs</hi>
honour was the greater that he was advanced in the ſame place, where
he was a poore ſlave; therefore it ſhall be for the comfort of the godly,
that they ſhall be judged in the place where they have beene diſgraced.
It was the manner of the <hi>Romans</hi> in their triumphs,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> that they began in
ſome private place without the city, and thence went into every ſtreet,
till they came in the high and capitall ſtreets: ſo the people of God
have their honour begun in this world, whence the Lord doth carrie
them thorough the clouds, and firie region, till hee bring them to the
capitall ſtreet, to heaven: this is a great comfort to the godly, where
they have beene diſgraced, and deſpiſed, there they be honoured.</p>

of the place where it ſhall be: all Divines
agree that the place <hi>in generall</hi> ſhall be <hi>on the earth;</hi>
not in heaven, nor in hell, nor in any remote
place, out of knowledge, but in this earth where
wee have paſſed our daies, and where wee have
ſinned againſt God, therefore according to our
uſuall phraſe in the Creed, it is ſaid, <hi>from thence he
ſhall come: David</hi> ſaith of his childe, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 23. <hi>I ſhall goe to him, but
he ſhall not returne to me:</hi> but it is not a ſure thing that wee ſhall goe firſt
to Chriſt, till he come to us. So in generall we all agree, that in this
earth ſhall be erected a glorious throne, for Ieſus Chriſt to ſit upon, and
to judge the whole world, where we have lived, and where wee have
paſſed our daies, where we have ſinned and diſhonoured God: The
Uſes whereof were matter of terrour, and matter of comfort; which
I handled then, therefore I proceed;</p>
               <p>To the particular, <hi>In what place of the world men ſhall bee judged?</hi> This is
a thing uncertaine, and the beſt Divines hold, it cannot be determined
out of the Scriptures in what place it ſhall be, but onely by probability;
Therefore in things of this nature, it is good to take Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> rule,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 3. <hi>Sapere ad ſobrietatem, to thinke ſoberly, not above what wee ought
to thinke;</hi> We ſhould not prie and looke into Gods Arke, that is, into his
ſecret Counſell, more than is meete, but wee muſt content our ſelves
with things revealed; as <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 32. 13. <hi>Iaakob</hi> ſaid of his ſheepe, <hi>that hee
would not overdrive them, leſt they die:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſo there bee a number of men that
overdrive their wits and bring them into an high ſtraine, and ſo make
them die: therefore a learned man ſaith well, <hi>It is better not to judge of
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:17958:205"/>
things ſecret and hidden, than to ſtrive and contend about them.</hi> There be a
number of Papiſts that do determine the place where it ſhall be, though
the beſt Divines hold it uncertaine; and they bring Scripture for it too;
Some ſay that the place is the valley of <hi>Iehoſaphat, Ioel,</hi> 3. 12. <hi>Let the World
be wakened and come up to the valley of Iehoſaphat, for there will I ſit to judge all
the Heathen round about:</hi> which words are ſpoken not of the laſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but the meaning is, that the Lord would judge the <hi>Amorits</hi> and the
<hi>Ammonites,</hi> wich were the enemies of the people of God in thoſe times,
there the Lord would overthrow and deſtroy them; and to prove it is
not intended of the laſt judgement, there be divers reaſons:</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Reaſon 1.</note> becauſe he ſpeakes by way of Alluſion: It is a <hi>Metaphor,</hi> and a
borrowed ſpeech as wee may ſee by other places of the ſame Chapter,
as verſe 18. <hi>And in that day ſhall the Mountaines droppe downe new wine, and the
hils ſhall flow with milke, and all the Rivers of Iuda ſhall flow with waters, and a
Fountaine ſhall come forth of the houſe of the Lord, and ſhall water the valley of
Shittim:</hi> Now as thoſe words cannot ſtand in their literall ſenſe, but be
Metaphoricall, and are ſpoken by alluſion onely, ſo likewiſe is it in this
place, and therefore it cannot bee meant of the laſt judgement.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Reaſon 2.</note> becauſe bodies muſt have diſtance and place, as <hi>Auguſtine</hi>
ſaith, <hi>Take away diſtance and place, and then bodies are no bodies;</hi> therefore,
it is not probable, that the <hi>valley of Iehoſaphat,</hi> ſhould hold all the bodies
of all the men, that have lived from the beginning of the World, to the
latter end of all ages, in all the Countries and kingdomes of the world:
It is not poſſible they can ſtand all there to bee judged at the ſame time.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Schoolemen, ſay,<note place="margin">Reaſon 3.</note> it is probable that it ſhould bee on
Mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> becauſe Chriſt did aſcend to Heaven from thence: Now
if it ſhould be on the <hi>Mount Olivet,</hi> it could not he in the valley of <hi>Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaphat,</hi>
becauſe they bee a great diſtance one from the other: as 2 <hi>Chron.</hi>
20. 20. we may ſee when <hi>Iehoſaphat</hi> went out to warre, he went to <hi>Tekoa,</hi>
which was ſixe miles from <hi>Bethlehem;</hi> and <hi>Bethlehem</hi> was ſixe miles from
<hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and then the valley of <hi>Iehoſaphat,</hi> muſt needs many miles bee
diſtant from <hi>Ieruſalem;</hi> ſo this opinion overthrowes the other. But they
ſay the valley of <hi>Iehoſaphat,</hi> was neere <hi>Ieruſalem;</hi> betweene the <hi>Mount
of Olives</hi> and that; but it cannot bee ſo, becauſe it is ſaid, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. 27.
that <hi>Iehoſaphat and the men of Ieruſalem and Iuda returned home to Ieruſalem,</hi>
from the valley. So that it was many miles diſtant from <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the <hi>Mount of Olives</hi> was neere; for Chriſt ſate on that Mount, and did
ſee men caſt into the Treaſury: therefore the valley of <hi>Iehoſaphat</hi> cannot
be the place, where the laſt judgement ſhall be.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Reaſon 4.</note> becauſe the dſciples, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17. when they heard Chriſt ſpeake
of the fearefull ſeparation that ſhall be at the laſt day of judgement: that
<hi>there ſhall be two in the bed,</hi> of whom <hi>the one ſhall be taken, and the other refuſed:
two in the fields, one refuſed and the other taken:</hi> ſaid unto him <hi>where Lord?</hi> and
he ſaid unto them, <hi>wherſoever the dead Carkas is, thither ſhall the Eagles reſort.</hi>
Now if it had been ſet downe in the Scripture, Chriſt would never have
left it as uncertaine to his diſciples, when they did aske him of it. So then
it is manifeſt, the particular place where Chriſt ſhall judge the World is
uncertaine.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="399" facs="tcp:17958:205"/>
Now if men will not be contented with this, but ſay, there muſt bee
a determined place where he ſhall judge the World, which is like to be
where he was borne, planted the Goſpell, did preach, and worke moſt
of his miracles: I muſt ſay for mine owne part I doe incline that way:
But whether it ſhall bee in <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> where Chriſt was borne, or upon
<hi>Mount Olivet,</hi> from whence Chriſt aſcended, or whether it ſhall bee <hi>on
Mount Calvery,</hi> where Chriſt was crucified, or on <hi>Mount Tabor,</hi> where
Chriſt was tranſfigured, I dare not determine, for that is left uncertaine
to us.</p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Vſe</hi> be made of it is,<note place="margin">Vſe</note> that ſeeing the particular place is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine,
therefore let us labour to bee joyned with Chriſt, to lie with
him in the Manger, pray with him on the Mount, fall downe by him in
the Garden, to goe with him to the Croſſe, to bee killed and crucified
with him, to deſcend into the Grave with him, and to lay our bodies by
him, and our bones by his bones, and to bee joyned with him; and then
as hee did riſe himſelfe our of the grave, ſo hee will raiſe thee out of thy
grave, and thou ſhalt be gathered unto him by the hand of an Angell,
and brought unto him whereſover the place be.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4</note> 
                  <hi>The time of the judgement:</hi> For when we heare there ſhall be a
judgement day, then we make enquiry when it ſhall be: It is a deſire in
nature to looke after it,<note place="margin">The time of the iudgement,</note> if once beleeved; therefore not onely the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
ſay, where is the promiſe of his comming; but his <hi>Diſciples</hi> alſo
<hi>Matth.</hi> 24. <hi>came unto him, and aſked him when the end of the world ſhould be:
Auguſtine</hi> ſaith well, <hi>All men that labour, deſire, to know or to have an end
of their labour;</hi> Therefore as the huſbandman caſts with himſelfe how
many weeks it will be to Harveſt;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> The Merchant man how many daies
to Returne; The Traveller what time hee ſhall get to his Inne; So a
Chriſtian that hath tooke paines to get Heaven, cannot chuſe but bee
deſirous to know when the end of the world ſhall be, that he may have
amend of his labour.</p>
               <p>Now concerning the time of the laſt judgement, I will lay downe
theſe three concluſions:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That the Time is certaine to God.</item>
                  <item>2. That the Time is uncertaine to us.</item>
                  <item>3. Although it hee uncertaine to us, yet hee hath given us
certaine Signes and Tokens of it.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>The Time is certaine to God:</hi> which I will prove by <hi>Scripture,</hi> and
by Reaſon:<note place="margin">Concluſion. The certainty of the laſt iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment proved.</note> Firſt, by <hi>Scripture, Matth.</hi> 24. 36. <hi>But of that time and houre
cometh no man, No not the Angels in heaven, but my Father onely:</hi> So <hi>Acts</hi>
17. 30. <hi>But now hee doth admoniſh all men every where to repent, Becauſe bee
hath appointed a day,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>in which he will judge the world:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">By Scripture.</note> ſo <hi>Revel.</hi> 14. 7. the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell
ſaith, <hi>Feare God, and give glory to him, for the houre of his judgement is
come:</hi> Therefore although we doe not know the certaine time, yet God
knoweth the day and houre when it ſhall be.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we will prove it by reaſon, for looke what God hath done
in any ſpecial and particular judgement,<note place="margin">2</note> that he doth in the generall;<note place="margin">By Reaſon.</note> but
God hath appointed and determined the very houre and time of ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all

all and particular judgements;<note place="margin">ARTI. VII.</note> therefore he hath appointed and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
the very day and houre of the great and generall judgement.
Now that hee hath appointed particular and ſpeciall judgements, and
conſequently knoweth the houre and time of them, is manifeſt out of
<hi>Gen.</hi> 6. where the Lord foretold the deſtruction of the old world: and
he prefixed a time, <hi>Ion</hi> 1. <hi>That in fortie dayes Ninivie ſhould be destroyed:</hi> ſo
alſo it is ſaid, <hi>Revel.</hi> 9. 14. <hi>The foure Angels were looſed, which were prepared at
an houre, and a day, and a moneth, and a yeere:</hi> ſo that we ſee there is never
a ſpeciall judgement, but God hath appointed the day and houre of it,
and therefore they are certaine to God; much more there is the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
and great judgement. But let us come to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> ſeeing the time of the laſt judgement is certain to God, we may
aſſure our ſelves, that although it come not in a time we looke for, yet it
is certaine it wil come in the time God hath appointed; therefore every
man ſhould be prepared for it; as <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 48. ſaith Chriſt, <hi>But if the
evill ſervant will ſay in his heart, my maſter will deferre his comming; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne
to ſmite his fellow, and to eat and drinke with the drunken: that ſervants
maſter ſhall come in a day when he lookes not for him, and in an houre when he is
not aware of, and ſhall cut him off in twaine:</hi> therefore it ſtands every man
in hand to prepare for that time; ſo it is ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. <hi>The Lord will come,
and he will not be ſilent:</hi> though the Lord be ſilent whil'ſt we live here, and
winkes at us, and ſaies nothing, becauſe this life time is a time of <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy:</hi>
yet when hee comes hee will not bee ſilent, becauſe it is a time of
<hi>Iuſtice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> ſeeing it is certaine to God, though it come not ſo ſoone
as wee looke for, yet wee ſhould with patience wait for it; though it
comes not to day or to morrow nor the next day, yea though it be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
yeers, yet we muſt wait with patience till the time commeth. We ſee
in <hi>Hab.</hi> 2. the <hi>Prophet</hi> ſaith, <hi>For the viſion is for an appointed time, but at laſt
it ſhall ſpeake and not lye, though it tarry yet wait for it, it ſhall ſurely come and
not ſtay. Auguſtine</hi> ſaith well, out of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33. O man, thou art Gods la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer,
and his worke man, doe thy worke and thy buſineſſe, and hee
will pay thee thy hire, and thy wages when thou haſt done thy worke:
when thy pay-day comes: but if thou wilt not wait till the pay-day, but
wilt have thine hire before thou worke, ſurely God will bee diſpleaſed
at thee; in like manner conſider with thy ſelfe whoſoever thou art, if
thou ſhouldſt ſet a man at worke,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and hee ſhould ſay, give me mine hire
firſt, or my wages, thou wouldſt ſay, Doe thy worke firſt, and then I
will pay thee: but if he ſay, nay, I will bee paid firſt; wouldſt not thou
be angry with him? But our waiting on God is much more ſure of pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
than from the hands of men, for they may deceive us, but God
will not; he will give every man that which is his due; therefore though
the judgement day come not ſo ſoone as we looke for, yet we muſt with
patience waite for it, ſeeing God hath certainely appointed the time.</p>
               <p>The ſecond concluſion is,<note place="margin">The second con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion.</note> that <hi>It is uncertaine to us;</hi> wee know not the
day, or the yeere, or the time, or the age of it, no nor the Angels, nor
Chriſt himſelfe, as he was man, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 36. <hi>But of that day and houre
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:17958:206"/>
no man knoweth, no not the Angels in heaven, but my Father onely:</hi> ſo <hi>Act.</hi> 1.
17. the <hi>Diſciples</hi> of Chriſt aſked of him, ſaying, <hi>Lord wilt thou at this time
reſtore the kingdome to Iſrael? hee ſaid unto them, It is not for you to know the
times and ſeaſons which the Father hath put in his owne power:</hi> therefore wee
ſee the time is uncertaine to us, wee know it not, no not the Angels.
Hence we conclude, they bee meere impoſters and deceivers, that ſet
downe a certaine time when the judgement day ſhall be.</p>
               <p>The Iewes had a propheſie, that the world ſhould continue ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
yeeres, two thouſand yeeres before the Law, two thouſand under
the Law, and two thouſand yeeres under the Goſpell: but a learned
man ſaith well, if he that made that propheſie could not ſet downe the
certaine time before, which was the eaſieſt, how ſhould wee beleeve
him for time to come? for from the beginning of the Law, till the
comming of Chriſt, it was but one thouſand five hundred yeeres, and
from the creation, to the giving of the Law two thouſand yeeres. In our
time in <hi>Germany</hi> there was one that propheſied that the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſhould be in ſuch a yeere and ſuch a day, which made the people
to neglect their plowing and ſowing, and ſo were like to have ſtarved
themſelves, if they had not beene releeved by the <hi>Emperour:</hi> ſo alſo
there was one amongſt us, that propheſied that the world ſhould bee at
an end in the yeere one thouſand five hundred eighty and eight; after
which he made a kalendar that the world ſhould continue thirty yeeres
after, now we have lived many a yeere longer (thankes be unto God) to
proove this a lye. But why hath the Lord kept this unknowne to us?
I anſwer, that wee might bee the more prepared for it; therefore it
ſtands every man in hand, to labour to get faith and repentance, and to
bring himſelfe into the eſtate of grace, that ſo he may have comfort at
that day; Therefore <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Let your lampes be burning, and
your loines girded, for the Sonne of man will come in an houre that yee are not
aware of;</hi> and Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith, the day of the Lord is uncertaine
to man, that he might prepare his heart for it: for he knoweth he will
come, but hee knoweth not the time when, and therefore wee muſt bee
like the wiſe virgins with our lampes burning, and our loines girded,
<hi>ready to enter into our maſters joy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third concluſion is, that although the time of this judgement
day be uncertaine to us, yet he hath given us certaine ſignes and tokens
of his comming; for the hope that is deferred is the drying of the
bones; and therefore that our hope might not faint, the Lord hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
us certaine ſignes and tokens of his comming: as <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 33.
<hi>When yee ſee all theſe things, know, that the kingdome of God is neere, even at the
doores:</hi> So <hi>Luk.</hi> 21. Chriſt tels his Diſciples, when they ſee the darkning
of the <hi>Sunne,</hi> and <hi>Moone,</hi> and the <hi>Starres,</hi> and thoſe ſignes that hee ſpake
of there; then they ſhould lift up their hands and hearts with joy for the
day of their Redemption draweth neer. Whereupon <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaith,
when we ſee an old man that creepeth on the ground by his ſtaffe, and is
feeble and weak in his joints,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> we ſay, that man cannot live long, though
wee know not the time when hee will die, yet it is certaine he cannot
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:17958:207"/>
live long becauſe nature is decaied in him; ſo when wee ſee the world
hath his burthen (ſaith hee) things grow old, nature decaies, and the
creatures groane and are weary of bearing, then it is certaine it cannot
be long ere the world fall, though we know not the time when it will
be. Now there bee two reaſons, why the Lord doth give us ſignes of
his comming.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Two cauſes why Chriſt gives ſignes of his comming.</note> 
                  <hi>for more certainety to aſſure us of his comming;</hi> as 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. when
<hi>Samuel,</hi> went to anoint king <hi>Saul,</hi> he told him of certaine ſignes that hee
ſhould ſee, as namely, that <hi>the Aſſes were found</hi> that he went to ſeeke, and
that hee ſhould ſee <hi>three men going to God to Bethel,</hi> one carrying three
Kids,<note place="margin">1</note> and another five loaves, and another a bottle of wine, that when
<hi>Saul</hi> ſaw thoſe things,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> it might the more aſſure him of the truth of thoſe
things that <hi>Samuel</hi> told him; ſo when wee ſee theſe things that Chriſt
hath told us of come to paſſe, we may the more aſſure our ſelves of the
truth of his comming: 1 <hi>King.</hi> 13. when the Prophet did propheſie
againſt the <hi>Altar,</hi> and told them that there ſhould bee <hi>a Childe borne to the
houſe of David,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> 
                  <hi>Ioſiah by name, and upon thee ſhall he ſacrifice the Priests of the
high places, that burnt incenſe upon thee, and they ſhall burne mens bones upon
thee: and hee gave them a ſigne,</hi> that the <hi>Altar</hi> ſhould cleave in ſunder
and the aſhes ſhould fall through, to the end this ſigne might aſſure
them of the truth and certainety of it, though it were three hundred
yeeres after: ſo Chriſt doth give us ſignes, that when wee doe ſee
any of them, wee may the more aſſure our ſelves of his comming;
for the Lord will not ſteale on the world and come upon them una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares,
but he giveth them ſignes of it.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> We ſee when the king remooves,
the lackies and pages goe before, whom when men ſee, they know it
will not be long ere the king come; ſo ſignes bee, as it were, Gods retei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
his lackies or his pages, they commonly goe before him: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when we ſee theſe, wee may know the Lord will remoove, hee is
not farre behinde, he will quickly follow after.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for <hi>excitation;</hi> To ſtirre up, quicken, and awaken the world,
that they may be provided for his comming: as <hi>Matth.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2</note> 25. it is ſaid, <hi>that
at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the Bridegroome commeth: then all
thoſe Virgins aroſe</hi> out of their beds, <hi>and trimmed their lampes</hi> and made
ready to meet with the Bridegrome: ſo every ſigne that wee ſee is as it
were a loud voyce or cry, <hi>The bridegroome commeth;</hi> and therefore every
one ſhould beſtirre himſelfe, get faith, repentance, the graces of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and make himſelfe ready to meet with the Bridegroome; for Chriſt
gives us theſe ſignes that they might be as ſo many tokens and warnings
unto us, to make our ſelves ready to meet with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Now there bee two conſequents,<note place="margin">2</note> that may bee deduced from this
Doctrine:<note place="margin">Conſequents.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>that the day of judgement cannot be farre off,</hi> becauſe all the ſignes
that Chriſt told us of, bee almoſt all paſſed already: <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. and
<hi>Luk.</hi> 21. Chriſt gives us many ſignes of his comming which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
all come to paſſe already; I meane, ſuch as are remooved ſignes,
and doe precede his comming: for there bee ſignes that ſhall not bee
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:17958:207"/>
till the immediate and preſent comming of Chriſt; therefore the day
of judgement cannot be farre behinde. Hence for our inſtruction wee
are to take notice of, that ſeeing we know not how ſoone we ſhall ſtand
in judgement before God, every man muſt awake out of his ſinnes, and
lay hold of ſalvation, that ſo wee may ſtand with comfort at that day.
<hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 11. The Apoſtles exhortation is, <hi>and that conſidering the ſeaſon,
it is now time that we ariſe from ſleepe, for now is our ſalvation neerer than when
wee firſt beleeved;</hi> and ſo againe 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 30. <hi>But this I ſay, Brethren, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the time is ſhort, let them that have wives, bee as they that have none; and
they that uſe the world, as though they uſed it not; and they that buy, as if they
poſſeſſed not; for the faſhion of this world paſſeth away:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, let
all goe ſeeing the time is ſhort, and lay hold on ſalvation, and make hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
ſure to your ſelves. One ſaith well, it is good for men to know that
it is but a ſhort time to the day of judgement, for it will make them the
more earneſtly apply themſelves to vertue; as a man in a long journey
when he commeth within the ſight of the city,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> it will make him gather
up himſelfe and make haſte, becauſe the way is but ſhort, for (ſaith he)
quicke and nimble men in a long way grow heavy and dull, and heavy
men in a ſhort way, be nimble and gather up themſelves: In like manner
we, becauſe we have but a ſhort way ſhould gather up our ſelves &amp; apply
our ſelves to vertue. The fathers before the flood are to be commended,
and wee are to be condemned, becauſe they knew not of the judgement
day, that it was ſo neere, and yet they did apply themſelves to vertue:
but Chriſt hath told us that the day of our redemption draweth nigh,
and yet for all this we ſleepe in our ſinnes and Gods wrath eternally is
ready to breake in upon us.</p>
               <p>The ſecond conſequent is, <hi>that the day of judgement cannot be yet,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
all the ſignes be not yet come to paſſe.<note place="margin">2</note>
               </p>
               <p>There be two <hi>ſignes</hi> in my owne obſervation that muſt come to paſſe
before that time:<note place="margin">Two ſignes to come.</note> The firſt is, <hi>Revel.</hi> 17. 12. that the <hi>tenne kings</hi> that did
uphold the whore, ſhall make her naked and deſolate. Now this ſigne
is not come to paſſe yet, becauſe there be ſome of the kings that doe yet
uphold her, as the French king and the king of Spaine.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, <hi>the calling of the Iewes;</hi> for they be not yet called: It
is true indeed that ſome particular men of the <hi>Iewiſh Nation</hi> bee called,<note place="margin">2</note>
ſuch as belong to Gods Election from day to day: But the Scripture
tells us that there ſhall be a publike profeſſion amongſt the <hi>Iewes,</hi> as there
is amongſt the <hi>Gentiles</hi> with one conſent. Now theſe two ſignes be yet
not accompliſhed, and therefore the judgement day cannot bee yet.
Some ſilly people thinke, that if there bee Thunder or an Earthquake
the day of judgement is come, and are exceedingly affraid: It is good
indeed to take occaſion at ſuch times to repent us of our ſinnes, and to
turne to God, for although the generall judgement day be delayed, yet
the day of thy death may come upon thee, thou knoweſt not how ſoone,
and this is a particular judgement day to thee.</p>
               <p>Now if a man ſhould demand why Chriſt doth defer the judgement
day, ſeeing all <hi>Creatures groane</hi> and long for the comming of it, as <hi>Paul</hi>
                  <pb n="404" facs="tcp:17958:208"/>
ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. the creatures they groane by the inſtinct of Nature, and the
people of God, by the inſtinct of Grace; therefore we may marvell that
God doth deferre the judgement day. I anſwere, there be three cauſes
or reaſons of this delay:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Gods patience in waiting for mans repentance.</item>
                  <item>2.<note place="margin">Three cauſes why the Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is delayed.</note> His goodneſſe to his Creature.</item>
                  <item>3. His care of the Elect.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt, it ariſeth out of <hi>the patience of God,</hi> in that he waits for our repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
as <hi>Peter</hi> ſheweth 2 <hi>Pet.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1</note> 3. 9. <hi>The Lord is not ſlacke concerning his promiſe,
(as ſome men count ſlackneſſe) but is long-ſuffering towards us, not willing that any
ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to repentance;</hi> ſo <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. the Lord gave the
old world, an hundred and twentie yeeres to repent in; this S. <hi>Peter</hi> cals
<hi>the patience of God</hi> in his firſt Epiſtle Chap. 3. verſe 20. Becauſe the Lord
doth give us time to repent, and doth deferre his judgements, and waits
with patience from yeere to yeere, and from day to day, to ſee when we
will returne to him. So then this delation of the judgement day ariſeth
out of the patience of God, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. 21. it is ſaid of the woman <hi>Iezabel,</hi>
that <hi>God gave her time to repent her of her fornications;</hi> and when ſhe did not
the Lord did threaten to caſt her into a bed of ſickneſſe; ſo all the time
that God gives us here is, that we may repent and turne to him, but if we
doe not, but deſpiſe the patience and kindneſſe of God, he will not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
caſt us into a bed of ſickneſſe, but he will caſt us into hell.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> it ariſeth out of the <hi>goodneſſe of God to his creature;</hi> which
hee extendeth to the reprobate, ſo farre forth as it doth not impeach
his juſtice: for ſeeing it is a long time to lye in hell for ever and ever,
in torments where there ſhall bee no mitigation or intermiſſion of
paines, but all the wicked ſhall be tormented day and night, they ſhall
have no Sabbath of reſt, nay they ſhall not have the leaſt moment of
eaſe; therefore the Lord out of his goodneſſe doth deferre the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
day: <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. the devils deſired to be kept from hell, and the Lord
ſhewes his goodneſſe to them. Now if the Lord ſhewed his goodneſſe
to Divels, much more to men.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> this delay ariſeth out of the care <hi>and love that God hath of his
Elect.</hi> There bee a number of men that bee yet unborne, and a number
now living, unconverted; therefore it pleaſeth Chriſt to deferre the
judgement day, till the number of them bee accompliſhed. It is ſaid,
<hi>Revel.</hi> 6. 9, 10. <hi>The ſoules of them that lie under the Altar did crie unto the
Lord, ſaying, How long O Lord, holy and true, doſt thou not judge and avenge
our blood on them which dwell on the Earth?</hi> and anſwer was made, <hi>that
they ſhould reſt for a ſeaſon untill their brethren and fellow-ſervants ſhould be kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
as they were:</hi> ſo there be a number of them that bee yet unborne, and
not yet converted, that the patience of God ſtayes for, and therefore
the judgement is delayed: as <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. the Angell could doe nothing to
<hi>Sodome,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> till <hi>Lot</hi> was in <hi>Zoar,</hi> ſet in ſafety: ſo the <hi>Lord Ieſus</hi> will doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
till hee hath ſet his Elect people in ſafetie. Wee ſee a Ship that
takes in paſſengers,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> lies at Anchor till the laſt paſſenger be come in, then
they hoiſt up ſaile and away they goe: ſo the Lord Ieſus lies (as it were)
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:17958:208"/>
at Anchor here in this world to take in paſſengers, for the number of his
Elect, and when the laſt man is come, then the judgement day ſhall be.</p>
               <p>But ſome man will ſay, if the judgement day be not yet, then it will
make men ſecure. To this I anſwere, that although the judgement bee
not yet, yet we know not how ſoone the day of death may come; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we ſhould prepare our ſelves for it, repent us of our ſinnes, get faith
in Chriſt, for <hi>As the day of death leaves us, ſo the judgement day ſhall finde us.</hi>
It is almoſt ſixteene hundred yeeres ſince <hi>Iudas</hi> dyed, and yet he ſhall
ſtand before God in the ſame condition he dyed in, an unrepentant man,
and in the ſame condition and eſtate hee ſhall ſtand before God in
judgement. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith well, on <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36. Suppoſe, that the day of
judgement cannot bee yet, yet the day of death cannot bee farre off;
therefore, O man, prepare for it, for looke in what eſtate death leaves us,
in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ame eſtate ſhall judgement finde us.</p>
               <p>I,<note place="margin">Object.</note> but yee will ſay, though the judgement day be not yet, yet it is
good to keepe men in feare of it?</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> that Chriſt would not have his Diſciples build on
a falſe ground; and <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 1. <hi>Now wee beſeech you brethren, by
the comming of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and by our aſſembling unto him, that you
be not ſoone ſhaken in minde, nor troubled, neither by ſpirit, nor by word, nor by
letter, as from us, as though the day of the Lord were at hand: Let no man deceive
you by any meanes, for that day ſhall not come, except there come a departing firſt,
and that man of ſin be diſcloſed:</hi> ſo he would not have their feare grounded
on a falſe ground: and I accordingly excite every Chriſtian man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to be quickned hereby, that as death leaves him, ſo judgement ſhall
finde him; therefore we ſhould ſo ſhut up our eyes here in this world as
that they may be opened againe in the kingdome of God.</p>
               <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5</note> 
                  <hi>The perſons that ſhall be judged, be the quicke and the dead;</hi> that
is,<note place="margin">The Perſon that ſhall bee judged.</note> all the men and women that are dead, and all them that are alive, at his
comming: for all men ſhall ſtand before him, of what eſtate and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſoever they be, rich and poore, high and low, we which are preſent,
and they which are abſent; as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>We shall all appear before the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſeat of Chriſt:</hi> no man can be abſent from it; there were many exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from the marriage, but there is no man that can bee exempted from
this; the mountaines cannot hide us, hell cannot hold us, but we muſt all
appeare before Chriſt in judgement: and I would to God this were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in our hearts with the point of a <hi>Diamond,</hi> that it might not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten.
There be many wayes to ſhift mens <hi>Courts</hi> and <hi>Tribunals:</hi> they
may flie the countrey, or bribe the Iudge, or compound and agree with
their adverſary; or if this doe it not, they may be prevented by death:
O but we cannot ſhifts Gods judgement barre, wee cannot fly the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
for whither ſhall wee goe but hee will finde us out? hell cannot
hide us from his preſence, we cannot bribe the Iudge, becauſe he is an
heavenly and a righteous Iudge, and will give to every man according
to his workes; neither can we compound the matter with our adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
for it is the divell that will accuſe us, who will not bee agreed with;
nor can we prevent it by death; for as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith in the <hi>Revelation,</hi>

that <hi>Death and Hell gave up their Dead that were in them:</hi> ſo we ſee nothing
can keepe us from the judgement ſeat of Chriſt. O that this were ſealed
in the hearts of all men, and ſurely it would make them much more
carefull how they paſſe their dayes in this world. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> compares
wicked men to thoſe that gather and treaſure up money in a bag,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> which
being opened diſcovers a number of ſtrange coynes that they did not
know of; ſo every day that a Man ſinnes, hee doth as it were treaſure
it up in his Conſcience, and when the judgement day commeth, then
his bagge ſhall be opened, that is, his Conſcience: then ſhall hee ſee a
number of ſinnes that hee thought not of. Therefore, ſeeing wee ſhall
all appeare before the judgement Seate of Chriſt, let us bee carefull
how wee live and paſſe our dayes here; for although wee may eſcape
<hi>Westminſter Hall</hi> and the <hi>Kings Exchequer,</hi> we cannot eſcape Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
Therefore I ſay, let us labour to repent of our ſinnes and get a
pardon for them, till wee have gotten our <hi>quietus eſt</hi> in our Conſcience,
that so wee may ſtand with comfort at that day; that although wee bee
found ſinners, and great ſinners, yet wee may get a pardon for them
ſealed with the blood of Chriſt, and ſhew it unto God, who will bee
thereby pacified and pleaſed.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> If a Man have committed Treaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the King by coyning money, hee will not bee at reſt and quiet,
till hee hath gotten a Pardon for it; So becauſe wee have committed
Treaſon againſt God, divers and ſundry wayes, wee ſhould not bee at
reſt, till wee have got a Pardon for them ſealed with the blood of
Chriſt.</p>

therby to prepare themſelves, that they may ſtand before God to give in

that there ſhall be an end of this whole world, and that we muſt give in
our accounts of all our thoughts,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> words, and actions. <hi>Philip</hi> king of

laſt end, every night when we goe to bed, and every morning when we
riſe, and every time wee goe into the World, that Chriſt ſhall judge
us, and that we muſt give in our accounts of all our thoughts, ſpeeches,
and actions. When <hi>Paul</hi> preached to <hi>Felix, of temperance, and of the laſt
judgement,</hi> he ſhifted away the matter, and could not abide to heare of it;
becauſe he had a naughtie conſcience; for <hi>Ioſephus</hi> tels us he was a naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
man, for the woman that was with him (whoſe name was <hi>Druſilla</hi>)
he had inticed from her huſband, and therefore his conſcience accuſing
him, hee ſhifted away this thought; but the people of God bee often
thinking of this, that ſo they may be fitted for it; as <hi>Iob</hi> 31. conſidered
with himſelfe, <hi>What ſhall I doe when God ſtandeth up, and when hee viſiteth
me, how ſhall I anſwere?</hi> ſo ſhould we doe.</p>
               <p>The laſt day we ſpake of the perſons that ſhall be judged, and ſhewed
you out of Scripture, that they were all men, of what eſtate and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſoever they be; I that ſpeake, and you that heare; they which are
abſent, and they which are preſent; <hi>both the quicke and the Dead,</hi> as it is in
the Creed, that is, all men and women that ever were, or ſhall be, paſt,
preſent, or to come; no man ſhall be exempted from that day: So Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Wee ſhall all appeare before the Iudgement ſeat of God:</hi> and <hi>Revel.</hi>
20. 12. <hi>I ſaw the Dead both great and ſmall ſtand before God:</hi> Therefore, it is
a ſure thing that all ſhall come to judgement; the Hils cannot hide us,
nor the Mountaines cover us, ſo there is no man can eſcape it, nor no
man can avoide it. Here in this World there bee many ſhifts to eſcape
mens Courts, and Tribunals; they may flie the Countrey, or bribe the
Iudge, or compoſe and agree the matter with their adverſary, or if theſe
doe not ſerve, Death may acquit them; but there is no flying from God;
whither can wee goe where hee will not finde us out? If wee were in
Hell, he would fetch us thence: Neither will this Iudge take bribe, for
he is a ſevere Iudge, and will not be bribed; nor can wee compoſe the
matter with our adverſary, for it is the Divell, and he will not bee ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied;
he is ſo cruell that he will not take the whole World to agree the
matter; nor ſhall wee be acquitted by death, for wee ſee, <hi>Revel.</hi> 20. that
<hi>Death and Hell gave up their Dead that were in them:</hi> ſo there is no way to
eſcape the Iudgement ſeate of God, but all ſhall appeare before him,
from the firſt man that entred into the World, to the laſt that ſhall bee
borne, and therefore this ſhould make us the more carefull to paſſe our
dayes in reverence, and feare before him. <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 20. as when there

(as it were) ſaying, <hi>We ſtand in jeopardie to be accuſed of this daies ſedition:</hi>
So if men would thinke of this, when they be in the heate of their affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
and in the courſe of ſinne, it would ſtoppe them, that one day
they ſhall come to judgement, and give in their accounts for all that

                  <hi>The burning up of the whole World,</hi> even the whole frame of
Nature, all Creatures viſible and ſenſible ſhall be deſtroied and brought
downe into the duſt; Once the World was deſtroyed by water, and
now it ſhall be deſtroyed by fire: God that ſet <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> on a
fire in an inſtant, and deſtroyed it, ſhall ſet this whole World on a fire,
and no man ſhall be able to quench it, and put it out: <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi>
50. 3. <hi>Our God ſhall come, and ſhall not keepe ſilence; A fire ſhall devoure before
him, and a mightie tempeſt ſhall be moved round about him. Daniel</hi> 7. 9. <hi>And
he ancient of dayes did fit, whoſe Garment was as white as ſnow, and the haire of
his head like purple wooll, his Throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheeles like
the burning flame; A firie ſtreame iſſued and came forth.</hi> So 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. it is
ſaid, <hi>When the Lord Ieſus ſhall ſhew himſelfe from heaven with his mighty An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
in flaming fire, rendring vengeance unto them which know not God, nor obey
him in the Goſpell:</hi> ſo that in ſmall time the whole World ſhall be conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
and all the glory of it ſhall be brought to nothing.</p>
               <p>Now if any man ſhall demand and ſay,<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> What be the particulars that
ſhall be deſtroyed? I anſwer, The Apoſtle ſheweth, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 10. <hi>That
the earth with all the workes thereof ſhall bee conſumed and burnt up:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sol.</note> all the
habitations where we now dwell, ſhall bee conſumed and come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:
many times if ordinary and ſlight houſes be burnt, ſuch as be of
bricke and ſtone eſcape, but at the day of judgement, not only the ſlight
buildings ſhall be burned,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> but alſo the ſtronger houſes, ſuch as are made
of no combuſtible matter, of bricke and ſtone. We ſee 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18. <hi>The
fire that came downe upon Elias his ſacrifice,</hi> did not onely burne up the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
and the wood, but <hi>it did licke up the water,</hi> and burne up the ſtones
and the duſt; ſo the fire of heaven will not onely burne the ſlight buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,
but alſo the ſtrongeſt houſes that bee made of ſolid matter, of
bricke, and ſtone, and marble, yea if they were houſes of iron, they ſhall
be deſtroyed and diſſolved, and brought to the matter they were made
of: ſo all the world ſhall be diſſolved, and burnt up. From hence wee
learne theſe Uſes.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> ſeeing the earth with all the workes thereof ſhall be conſumed
and burnt, therefore this ſhould teach us to moderate our care for the
things of this life, that wee bee not ſo eager and greedy of them, as to
ſcrape and ſcratch together theſe things unconſcionably, ſeeing the fire
of Gods wrath ſhall fall upon them, and conſume them; they ſhall bee
diſſolved and burnt up; all theſe goodly houſes, and gardens, hawkes,
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:17958:211"/>
and hounds, all ſhall be burned with fire; therefore we ſhould moderate
our ſelves in the things of this life. For which cauſe <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. when
the Diſciples came to Chriſt, and ſhewed him the goodly buildings of
the <hi>Temple,</hi> ſaith <hi>Chriſt, Doe yee ſo admire theſe things, and dote upon them, the
time ſhall come that there ſhall not be left one ſtone on another:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſo may we ſay,
when men dote on the things of this life, and doe not ſeeke after hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and happineſſe, Why doe yee ſo dote on theſe things, the time ſhall
come that there ſhall not bee a ſtone left upon a ſtone. <hi>Zerxes</hi> when hee
had a purpoſe to goe to warre, did muſter his men in a place, and he ſaw
ſeven hundred thouſand men, whom he went up unto an hil to take view
of, and at the ſight of them wept; his nobles asked him why hee did
weepe? he ſaid, that hee wept to conſider how in the revolution of an
hundred yeares, there ſhould not one of all theſe be left: ſo it is good for
a man to doe as <hi>Zerxes</hi> did, to muſter up all his delights, pleaſures, and
profits, to take a view of them, and to conſider that after the revolution
of a few yeares, all ſhall come to nothing.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> ſeeing this earth with all the workes thereof ſhall be burnt
up, therefore to labour for the rich graces of Chriſt: which is the uſe
Saint <hi>Peter</hi> makes thereof, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 11. <hi>Seeing therefore that all theſe things
muſt be diſſolved, what manner of perſons ought wee to bee in holy converſation
and godlineſſe?</hi> and indeed how ought we to labour to get Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
to be brought to an eſtate of grace, that ſo we may be ſaved and
ſtand with comfort at that day? If a man ſhould gather a great deale of
wealth together,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and put it into an houſe, if one ſhould come and ſet the
houſe on fire and burne up all, he would cry; <hi>I am undone, I am undone;</hi>
ſo if we lay up all our comfort and joy here in this world, when the fire
of Gods wrath ſhall come downe from heaven, and conſume all theſe
things, wee may cry out, <hi>Wee are undone;</hi> and therefore it muſt bee our
wiſedome to lay up our treaſure in heaven, and then it will be ſafe; this
is the counſell that Chriſt gives us; <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. <hi>Lay not up for your ſelves
treaſure upon earth, where the moths and canker corrupt, and where theeves
digge through and ſteale, but lay up treaſure for your ſelves in heaven, where
neither the moth nor the canker corrupteth, and where theeves neither dig
through or ſteale.</hi> Hereupon <hi>Augustine</hi> ſaith well, there was a friend that
came to a friends houſe,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> that he had laid up his Corne in a low
darke roome, telling him that if hee laid it there, it muſt needs corrupt
and putrifie, but lay it up on an high loft, and then it will keepe ſafe; ſo
ſaith he, Chriſt is this friend that commeth to a friends houſe, hee ſees
that we lay up our treaſures in this World where they will corrupt, and
come to nothing; therefore he gives us this Counſell, that wee ſhould
lay up our treaſures in Heaven in an high loft, where wee may bee ſure
they will be ſafe.</p>
               <p>If any man here make a doubt,<note place="margin">Quest.</note> and put this queſtion; What is there
nothing but this world and the workes thereof that ſhall bee conſumed,
and burnt?<note place="margin">Sol.</note> I anſwere him, from the ſame place of <hi>Peter,</hi> not onely the
earth and the workes thereof, but <hi>the heavens ſhall melt with heate, and
the elements,</hi> ſo much as is viſible and ſenſible; even thoſe that are moſt
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:17958:211"/>
true and regular, and conſtant in their courſes, clockes may deceive us,
but theſe will not, they be true in their courſes, and yet theſe ſhall melt
with heare, and ſhall paſſe and runne away from the preſence of Chriſt.<note place="margin">Simile.</note>
Heere we may ſee the lothſomeneſſe of ſinne, that doth not reſt in the
center of the earth, but goeth thorough the clouds, and doth infect the
ayre, almoſt to the ſeate of God himſelfe. I would to God men would
thinke of this; when wee ſee a man ſtrangely taken away by untimely
death, or a houſe on fire, we thinke it ſtrange, but for the ſinne of man,
God will deſtroy the heavens and the earth. Wee ſee in the <hi>Law,</hi> that
if a man had the Leproſie upon him, he ſhould bee ſhut up,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and the wals
of the houſe ſhould bee ſcraped, and if it brake out againe, then the
houſe ſhould be pulled downe, and the timber, and the ſtones, and the

                  </gap> carried away, that it might not infect the people, <hi>Levit.</hi> 40. 41. ſo
the Lord doth ſcrape us (as it were) by his judgements, but becauſe ſinne
breakes out ſtill, he will pull downe the houſe, even deſtroy this whole
world: ſo that at the laſt day no man ſhall know his former houſe, or
his land, to ſay here is my houſe, or here is my land, as <hi>Iob</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>When
a man dyeth, he knoweth neither houſe, nor land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now heere another queſtion may be demanded, ſeeing the heaven
and the earth ſhall be diſſolved,<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> and burnt up, what ſhall become of the
people of God? To this I anſwere out of the Apoſtle <hi>Pauls</hi> words,

Chriſts comming ſhall be changed from mortality to immortality, this
ſhall be their eſtate at that day; the creatures appointed for the fire ſhall
bee burned, and the fire ſhall fall on the wicked, but all the people of
God ſhall be preſerved, as the three Children were in the firy furnace:
Hence we learne what a comfortable thing it will be, when Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
ſhall ſee all the world on a fire about them, over their heads, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their feet, but it ſhall not touch them; <hi>Moſes</hi> told the Children of
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> that the Lord would bring great plagues on the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> which
ſhould not touch any of them, ſo the Lord at the day of judgement will
bring downe fire on the wicked, and the ungodly, which ſhall not touch
any of the people of God, howſoever they be ſet light by here, not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
of, nor regarded, yet at that day they ſhall ſee what a comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
thing it is to be a Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Vſe 3.</note> ſeeing the heavens and the earth ſhall bee diſſolved, and
burnt with fire, let us labour to be found in Chriſt, to be one of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

or a country ſhould be on fire,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and there ſhould be a little houſe of ſtone,

O how men would thr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the fire, when the fire ſhall fall on the wicked and ungodly, and burne
them, then they that be in Chriſt ſhall bee ſafe from danger; therefore
every man ſhould labour to be in Chriſt, that ſo hee may be ſaved: we
ſee <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>that hee accompts of all things to bee but

to eſteeme all things but dung and droſſe, that he may be found in
Chriſt, let who will take the world with all the delights and pleaſures

God our friend, and then we ſhall bee preſerved when this world ſhall
be diſſolved. When the unjuſt ſteward in the Goſpell knew his maſter

17. <hi>every man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that is in Christ is a new creature:</hi> ſo the Heavens
are the ſame in ſubſtance, and new onely in quality and diſpoſition.</p>
               <p>Now the heavens are ſaid to be <hi>new,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heavens how new.</note> firſt, in regard of the <hi>uſe of them;</hi>
now they bring us raine and ſnow and haile at the time appointed, but
at the day of judgement they ſhall bring Chriſt,<note place="margin">1</note> and exhibite him to the
world the goodlieſt ſight that ever mortall eye ſaw, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 64.
ſaith Chriſt, <hi>I ſay unto you, hereafter ſhall you ſee the Sonne of man ſitting at
the Right hand of the power of God, and comming in the clouds of the Heaven,
&amp;c.</hi> ſo we ſee that the heavens ſhall be changed in regard of the uſe of
them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the heavens ſhall be new, in regard of a <hi>new diſpoſition;</hi> now
they never ſtand ſtill,<note place="margin">2</note> but wind and turne up ſomewhat of the thread of
mans life, but then when the expiration is come, and all time ceaſes,
then they ſhall ſtand ſtill, ſo that there ſhall bee no more time; which is
manifeſt <hi>Revel.</hi> 10. 6. <hi>Where the Angell ſweareth by him that liveth evermore,
which created Heaven, and the things that are therein, and the earth, and the
things that are therein, and the ſea, and the things that are therein, that Time
ſhall be no more.</hi> And the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> ſay, that, <hi>Time is nothing elſe but the
mooving of the heavens and revolution of them,</hi> therefore when all time
ceaſes, and eternity is come, then the heavens muſt needs ſtand ſtill.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> the heavens ſhall bee new, in regard of <hi>new effects;</hi> for now
they bee the ſtorehouſe of judgements, and his armorie-houſe from
whence he brings his judgements upon the world, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 29. <hi>The Lord
makes it to thunder from heaven, &amp;c.</hi> But at the day of judgement they
ſhall no more bee the armorie-houſe of His judgements, but the Lord
ſhall there cauſe to flow out abundance of goodneſſe and kindeneſſe:
therefore the Prophet ſaith, that at the day of judgement <hi>the mountaines
ſhall drop downe new wine, and the hils ſhall flow with milke;</hi> ſo that the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of Gods goodneſſe ſhall bee diſtilled out from the clouds. And
thus much for the renewing of the <hi>Heavens,</hi> wee proceed now to the
<hi>Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Earth</hi> ſhall be <hi>new</hi> in foure regards;<note place="margin">The Earth ſhall be new in foure Regards.</note> firſt, we ſee that now there is
a great deale of it waſt and barren, poſſeſſed with wilde beaſts, Serpents
and Oſtriges for the ſinne of man,<note place="margin">1</note> as <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 107. 34. <hi>A fruitfull Land is
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:17958:213"/>
made barren for the ſinnes of the people;</hi> ſo now there is a great part of it
waſt and barren for the ſinnes of men, but when mans ſinnes are taken
away, then the earth ſhall bee made fertile, and every place ſhall bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhed.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> now the earth yeelds nothing without mans labour and
paines, becauſe of the curſe that was laid upon it for ſinne, but at the
day of judgement there ſhall bee no more curſe, for then it ſhall yeeld
fruit without labour and paines.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> now the earth is the valley of teares, where the beſt men
have moſt trouble, but at the laſt day, it ſhall bee a doore to let us into
glory: as <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 2. 15. the Lord doth promiſe to the Children of <hi>Iſrael
to give them the valley of Achor for a doore of hope,</hi> ſo this earth ſhall be the
doore of our hope to let us in to glory, here wee ſhall begin the glory
which afterwards we ſhall have perfect and conſummate in Heaven.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4</note> the earth now is walled and paled, and hedged in a great
part of it, wherein every man labours to draw the commodity of it to
himſelfe, but at the laſt day all ſhall be laid common, there ſhall not need
to bee any ſtatute againſt encloſures, but all ſhall bee laid open for his
Saints and people.</p>
               <p>Now heere may a queſtion ariſe,<note place="margin">Quest.</note> ſeeing the juſt ſhall goe to heaven,
and the wicked to hell, To what end ſhall this Earth be renewed? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
there be three cauſes of it:<note place="margin">Sol.</note>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>1 In Regard of Chriſt.<note place="margin">Three Cauſes why the earth ſhall be rene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed.</note>
                  </item>
                  <item>2 In Regard of the Godly.</item>
                  <item>3 In Regard of the wicked.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">First, in regard of Chriſt.</note> 
                  <hi>In Regard of Chriſt;</hi> becauſe he ſhall ſet up his throne here in
this earth, and make it his judgement ſeat; now we may not thinke that
it can ſtand with the glory of Chriſt, to ſet up his judgment ſeat on the
dead cinders, and fruitleſſe aſhes of this ſinfull world; therefore it ſhall
be renewed to make it a fit place for Chriſt to ſit in judgement: as when
Iudges come to ſit in Iudgement,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> though the place be mean and unhand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
before, yet then they hang it with tapeſtry, decke it, and ſtrew it,
to make it a fit place for the Iudges to ſit in; ſo this Earth ſhall bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
in regard of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Secondly, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the Godly.</note> the Earth ſhall be renewed <hi>In Regard of the Godly;</hi> that they
may ſee that there was nothing loſt by <hi>Adam,</hi> but it is made good againe
by Chriſt; for whatſoever was loſt by the firſt, is reſtored againe by
the ſecond <hi>Adam.</hi> In the <hi>Law</hi> the yeare of <hi>Iubile</hi> being come, when the
trumpet ſounded, and liberty was proclaimed; every owner returned
to his poſſeſſion againe, that hee had beene kept from a long time; ſo
at the laſt Iudgement when the trumpet ſhall ſound, and liberty ſhall be
proclaimed, all the people of God ſhall returne againe to their poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
from which they have beene with-held, ever ſince it was loſt by the
firſt <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But why ſhall the earth be renewed for the Godly,<note place="margin">Quest.</note> ſeeing they ſhall
be in heaven? I anſwer, as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaith, great Kings and Princes
though they keepe in their great chambers of eſtate,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> yet they paſſe into
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:17958:213"/>
them through ſome gallery, or ſome court-yard; ſo ſaith he, though
the people of God ſhall dwell in the great chamber of heaven, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
this earth is the gallery and court-yard that they muſt paſſe
through, therefore it ſhall be renewed.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>For a further increaſe of glory;</hi> as it is a glory and an honour
to our king, that hee is king, and Lord of a great many of countryes,
though it may bee hee meanes never to come into them,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> but dwells here
in this land: ſo this is a great honour to the people of God, that they be
kings and lords of this earth, though they ſtay not there.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> the Earth ſhall bee renewed, <hi>in regard of the wicked,</hi> that they
may the more ſenſibly ſee what a deale of glory their ſins have deprived
them of,<note place="margin">In regard of the wicked.</note> they ſhall not come into heaven to ſee that: for <hi>Revel.</hi> 21. it is ſaid,
<hi>No uncleane thing ſhall come there:</hi> therefore the Earth ſhall be renewed, that
by it they may have a glance of Heaven, and a ſlaſh of the glory that ſhall
bee in Heaven, as it were through a Crevis, that ſo it might bee a further
vexation to them. We read 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 7. 9. when there was great plenty of
victuals, and other things foretold by the Prophet,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> which the Prince there
would not beleeve; the Prophet ſaith to him, <hi>Thou ſhalt ſee it with thine
eyes, but thou ſhalt not taſte thereof:</hi> ſo it ſhall be unto the wicked, ſurely not
without great anguiſh and terrour when they ſhall ſee the Earth renewed
and themſelves to have no part in it. Now the Vſes hereof may be:</p>
               <p>First,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> ſeeing there ſhall be a new Heaven and a new Earth, wee ſhould
labour to be new Creatures, becauſe none but ſuch dwell in this new Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and new Earth: For the Text ſaith, <hi>Wee looke for a new Heaven, and a
new Earth according to his promiſe, wherein dwels righteouſneſſe:</hi> that is, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
men, ſuch as bee renewed by the Spirit and grace of God. Here in
this World there is a mixture of good and bad together, as in <hi>Adams</hi>
houſe <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel,</hi> in <hi>Abrahams Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> and amongſt <hi>Chriſts
Diſciples, Iohn</hi> and <hi>Iudas:</hi> But in this new Heaven and Earth, there ſhall
dwell never a wicked man: therefore labour thou whoſoever thou art, to
be renewed by the Spirit of Grace, and to repent thee of thy ſinnes, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
unto God, and thou ſhalt have thy part in this new Heaven, and new
Earth for evermore.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> that ſeeing the Heaven and the Earth ſhall be renewed, there
is never a wicked man that can claime or challenge a foote of it to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe;
here in this world they may have hundreds and thouſands of Acres
of Land, they may ſay, in ſuch and ſuch a place I have ſo much land, here
is the Patrimonie that my Father gave me, here is that which I did pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe;
Oh but in the new World they cannot claime a foote of it: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they may ſee what a faire threed they have ſpun to deprive themſelves
of all their lands, even ſuch as have had great revenewes here of the old
Earth, ſhall not have a foote of this new Earth. It is reported by ſome Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians,
of a certaine Nation that every yeere did elect and chuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
a king, who had as goodly attendance as might bee, rich apparell
and all things fit and meete for a king; but when the yeere was expired,
they did turne him naked into an Iland, where hee did endure extreame
miſery: Now there was one of them who was wiſer than the reſt, that had
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:17958:214"/>
cloſely and ſecretly before his yeere was expired, conveyed into this
<hi>Iland,</hi> rich apparell and ſervants to attend on him, and had builded him
a houſe, and ſent all things fitte and meete for him thither beforehand,
ſo that when his yeere was expired, and they had turned him into this
<hi>Iland</hi> naked, he having provided for himſelfe before was not diſtreſſed:
The truth of this I ſtand not to diſcuſſe; but the morall I am ſure may
be profitable: for this Kingdome is a Type and figure of this World,
where there bee a number of men that have all things that their hearts
can deſire, but when death commeth, then they are turned as it were
into a waſt Wilderneſſe naked, there to endure extreeme miſery; and
therefore it muſt bee our wiſedome, to doe as the wiſe kings did, every
day to ſend ſomething before, and to provide comfortably for our
ſelves, that when we are turned out of this World, wee may have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
in the World to come.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Vſe 3.</note> ſeeing there ſhall be a new Heaven and Earth, this may bee
a comfort to poore Chriſtians, that though they have but a ſmall porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
here in this World, yet they may have a great portion of the new
Heaven and Earth, if they pleaſe God and walke conſcionably before
him; as <hi>Revel.</hi> 21. 7. It is ſaid, <hi>Hee that overcommeth, ſhall inherit all things,
&amp;c.</hi> What is that which he ſhall inherit? Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> tels us, <hi>that hee ſaw
a new Heaven and a new Earth,</hi> namely the things that are ſpoken of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
<hi>To him that overcommeth,</hi> that is, To him who can overcome his
luſts, his ſinnes, and his corruptions, and is not carried away with the
bad examples of the World,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> the new Heaven and Earth ſhall bee for a
poſſeſſion, as <hi>Dauid</hi> doth acknowledge with thankfulneſſe to God, that
hee had given unto him the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> much more should wee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
with thankefulneſſe that the Lord hath aſſigned to us a <hi>Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall
Canaan:</hi> therefore comfort you your ſelves, O yee holy people of
God, in this that you ſhall have your parts in the New Heaven and new
Earth.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 9</note> It is this that which <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Eye hath not ſeene, nor Eare heard, nor

                  <note place="margin">1 King. 10. 7.</note> ſaid, <hi>The one halfe was not told her which ſhe found.</hi> So the

it be,<note place="margin">Matth. 25. 34. 41.</note> when Chriſt ſhall looke out of the Clouds, and hee ſhall ſay unto
the Godly, <hi>Come yee bleſſed of my Father, receive the kingdome prepared for
you;</hi> when he ſhall chaſe and drive all the wicked to Hell, and ſhall ſay
unto them, <hi>Goe ye curſed of my Father, into everlasting fire prepared for the
Divell and his Angels.</hi> And here let every one of us be exhorted to repent
his ſinnes, for now is the time, yet the gate is not ſhut: Hereafter thou,
if thou now refuſeſt, thou ſhalt not inherit with the people of God, but

ſhall for ever be ſhut upon thee.</p>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies
ſake; becauſe that Chriſt himſelfe immediately upon the
ſigne appeares: for there be two ſorts of ſignes; either <hi>remooved ſignes</hi>
ſuch as precede and goe a long while before Chriſts comming, which
I mentioned heretofore; or <hi>immediate ſignes;</hi> ſuch as are neer or in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
joyned to his comming; as ſome of the Prophets foretold long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Chriſts co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> but <hi>Iohn</hi> was the immediate forerunner, he pointed
at Chriſt; and therefore when they ſaw <hi>Iohn,</hi> they were rowſed up to
the beholding of Chriſt: ſo when we ſee this ſigne, then we muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:17958:215"/>
looke for Chriſt: for therefore it is called the ſigne of the Sonne
of Man, becauſe of the excellencie, that it goeth immediately before
his comming.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Secondly, what this ſigne is.</note> 
                  <hi>What this ſigne is?</hi> there bee divers opinions of this, ſome
thinke one thing, and ſome another; ſome take it to bee Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
but it cannot bee taken ſo, becauſe <hi>alwaies the ſigne is not the thing

                  <note place="margin">1</note> There is an oppoſition betweene theſe two,<note place="margin">Opinion.</note> ſo that the ſigne
can never be the thing ſignified; and therefore it is ſome other thing that

the burning up of this World,<note place="margin">Opinion.</note> becauſe it is ſaid, that <hi>A firie ſtreame iſſued
out when the ancient of dayes ſate upon his Throne.</hi> But it cannot bee this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that this ſigne appeares in Heaven onely, and this univerſall fire
is not onely in Heaven, but alſo in Earth: Others take it to be the ſound
of the laſt Trumpet;<note place="margin">3</note> but it cannot bee this, becauſe there is a diſtinction
betweene them,<note place="margin">Opinion.</note> for Chriſt tels us of the ſigne of the appearing of the
Sonne of Man, verſe 300 and of the ſound of the Trumpet, verſe 31. The
Papiſts they ſay that it is the ſigne of the Croſſe,<note place="margin">4</note> and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith,
that all the fathers doe ſo expound it;<note place="margin">Opinion.</note> But there is a Ieſuite one of their
own fellowes that contradicts him, who affirmes it is not certainly found
out what is meant by the ſigne of the Sonne of Man, for the fathers doe
diverſly expound it: therefore we may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ee that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is too bold to
ſay that all the fathers expound it ſo, becauſe there is no man that reads
the fathers but may ſee it otherwiſe: for <hi>Origen</hi> takes it for the miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
power and vertues of Chriſt: Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> takes it to be Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe:
<hi>Chryſostome</hi> expounds it of the wounds that bee in the hands and
feete and ſide of Chriſt: therefore whereas <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaies the fathers
doe expound it to bee the Croſſe; any man that will conſult them may
ſee there is no one of the fathers who expound it ſo: beſides there bee
two reaſons why I dare not aſſent to take the ſigne of the Sonne of man
to be the Croſſe.</p>
               <p>First,<note place="margin">Two Reaſons why by the ſigne of the Sonne of Man is not meant the Croſſe.</note> it is true that there is the ſigne of Chriſt, but the Croſſe is no
where taken for the ſigne of Chriſt in the Scriptures; therefore there
is no ground for this opinion. Some of the Papiſts thinke that it is the
wooden Croſſe, but that was broken into divers ſhivers; therefore if it
had pleaſed God to make that the ſigne of the Sonne of Man, hee would
have preſerved that,<note place="margin">1</note> and have kept it as he did the bones of Chriſt, that
one of them was not broken. Againe, it is not the wodden Croſſe, for
that is a thing that is turned to corruption,<note place="margin">2</note> unleſſe we will beleeve there
is a reſurrection of the Croſſe, as there is a reſurrection of the body.
The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> indeede doth keepe a feaſt in honor to the Croſſe,
and ſay that it ſhall be joyned with his comming, but thence to inferre it
ſhall be ſo,<note place="margin">3</note> is no good conſequence: Some of them againe doe thinke
it ſhall not be the wooden Croſſe, but a croſſe that ſhall be in the Ayre,
the truth whereof I finde no where in the Scripture. And now to tell
you my heart told me alwaies that Chriſt did expound it in this chapter,
and that the Diſciples did underſtand what the ſigne was, or elſe they
would have asked him of it, as they did <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. when hee told them
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:17958:215"/>
of the tares, <hi>Maſter</hi> (ſay they) <hi>Tell us the meaning of the tares.</hi> Then I
peruſed the Chapter and I did light on verſe 27. where it is ſaid; <hi>As
the lightning commeth from the Eaſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The ſigne of the Sonne of Man, what it is.</note> 
                  <hi>and ſhineth into the Weſt, ſo ſhall the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of the Sonne of Man be.</hi> That is, with infinite brightneſſe and ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
ſhall he come at that day; In which place Chriſt tels his Diſciples,
that there bee many ſhall ſay, <hi>Loe here is Chriſt, and there is Chriſt, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
them not,</hi> for I will give you a ſigne of my comming, and that is
when you ſhall ſee infinite brightneſſe and ſplendor, that ſhall come
from the body of Chriſt, the brightneſſe whereof ſhall darken all other
lights. When they ſhall ſee this, it ſhall awaken the World, and ſtirre
up every man to looke for Chriſt. Now that there ſhall be ſuch bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and ſplendor, come from the body of Chriſt, it is cleare by the
Scriptures, <hi>Revel.</hi> 21. 23. <hi>And the citie hath no neede of the Sunne, nor of
the Moone, to ſhine in it, for the glory of God did light it, and the Lambe is the
light of it:</hi> So the brightneſſe of Chriſts body ſhall bee infinite, more
than all the lights of this World, and <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. when <hi>Chriſt</hi> was transfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured
on the Mount, <hi>His face did ſhine as the Sunne, and his clothes were as
white as the light. Moſes</hi> when he came from the Mountain and had talked
with God,<note place="margin">Differences of Chriſt and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes glory.</note> 
                  <hi>his face did ſhine,</hi> and there was great glory put upon him;
but yet there was great difference between the glory that was on <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
and his;<note place="margin">1</note> For firſt, this glory was but onely on <hi>Moſes</hi> face, but this was
all Chriſts body over. Secondly, when <hi>Moſes</hi> put a veile over his face,
they could not ſee his glory,<note place="margin">2</note> but Chriſt did ſhine through his garments.
Thirdly, the glory that was on <hi>Moſes</hi> was fearefull that the people
fled away,<note place="margin">3</note> but the glory that was on <hi>Chriſt</hi> was amiable, for <hi>Peter</hi> ſayes,
<hi>It is good being here, let us make three Tabernacles, one for thee, one for Moſes,
and one for Elias.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">4</note> Fourthly, <hi>Moſes</hi> could not communicate his glory to any,
but Chriſt he communicates his glory to others; for <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. it is ſaid,
<hi>That the Iuſt ſhall ſhine as the Sunne in the Firmament.</hi> So wee ſee that the
glory of Chriſt is greater, and yet this glory that was on Chriſt in the
Mount was but a type and figure of the glory that ſhall be on Chriſt, at
the day of judgement: and this glory and brightneſſe that ſhall appeare
before his comming, I take to be the <hi>ſigne of the Sonne of Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Thirdly, the effects of the Sonne of mans comming.</note> 
                  <hi>what the effects ſhall bee of the ſigne of the Sonne of man:</hi> and
ſurely, fearefull ſhall they bee to the wicked, and comfortable to the
godly, for when the ſigne of the Sonne of man ſhall appeare, then all
the wicked ſhall mourne,<note place="margin">1</note> weepe, and cry out of their ſinnes, that they
have not loved Chriſt but deſpiſed him, have not obeyed his Lawes,
but contemned, and ſet light by them; therefore it will bee a fearefull
time to the wicked: but to the godly it ſhall bee great comfort, for
<hi>Chriſt</hi> telleth the <hi>Iewes, Matth.</hi> 23. 29. <hi>Ye ſhall ſee me no more, till that ye
ſay, Bleſſed be he that commeth in the name of the Lord;</hi> the very reprobate
ſhall ſay, theſe be the happy and bleſſed men, howſoever wee have ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and deſpiſed them; O, that wee had lived as they did, then wee
ſhould have beene happy too: I have inſtanced often before in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of <hi>Ioſeph, Gen.</hi> 45. 5. and becauſe it is apt to the purpoſe, I cannot
paſſe it at this preſent;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> for when <hi>Ioſeph</hi> did diſcover himſelfe to his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:17958:216"/>
thren, they were abaſhed and aſhamed, becauſe their conſcience told
him that they had betrayed and ſold him for a ſlave before, nay, ſome of
them would have killed him; if they had loved him, and uſed him well,
then it might have beene a comfort to them, when he did diſcover him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
and ſay, <hi>I am your brother Ioſeph:</hi> ſo I ſay of Chriſt, what a terrour
will it be to the wicked and ungodly; becauſe they have deſpiſed and
condemned him, if they had uſed him well they might have had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
at his appearing:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> wee read likewiſe 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 22. when <hi>Aſahel
prest upon Abner, Abner ſaid to him, depart from me, wherefore ſhould I ſmite
thee to the ground? how then ſhall I bee able to hold up my face to Ioab thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</hi>
ſo when wee ſhall ſinne and offend Chriſt how ſhall wee hold up
our faces at that day. So then we ſee it ſhall be a terrour to the wicked,
and to ſuch as have not repented them of their ſinnes; but unto the
godly, <hi>Christs</hi> comming ſhall be greatly comfortable, as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith:
we ſee in reaſon,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> if two men ſhould be beyond ſea, and their lord and
maſter ſhould ſend for them, the one to bee honoured for his good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
the other to be puniſhed for his offences; though it may bee they
both come home in one ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ip, eate at one table, lye in one bed, arrive at
one haven, and come to one place, yet their thoughts would be diverſe,
for the one would thinke, now is the time that I ſhall bee honoured for
my good ſervice, therefore it is a comfortable time to him: the other
would thinke, now is the time that I ſhall be puniſhed for my offences;
therefore it muſt be a time of diſcomfort to him: this is the direct caſe
betweene the godly and the wicked, that they may eate at one table, lye
in one bed, dye all one kinde of death, and yet their thoughts bee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers;
for the godly, they ſhall rejoyce when that time commeth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they ſhall bee honoured and advanced, and it ſhall bee a terrour to
the wicked, becauſe they ſhall be puniſhed for their offences, as <hi>Iohn</hi> 20.
when Chriſt appeared to <hi>Mary,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> (being grieved and dejected for the
loſſe of him,) and ſaid, <hi>Mary,</hi> ſhe turned about and ſaid, <hi>Rabboni, Maſter;</hi>
as if ſhee ſhould ſay, I am glad that I have found thee, Heaven and earth
could not make her ſo glad as ſhe was when ſhe found Chriſt; ſo when
a Chriſtian hath looked out at his windowes and doores to ſee Chriſt,
many a time, and at laſt ſhall ſee him come in glory and breaking the
clouds, and comming to Iudgement, he may ſay as <hi>Mary</hi> did, <hi>Rabb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ni,
Maſter,</hi> I am glad to have found thee, ſo they may ſay, O Lord Ieſus,
art thou come? Thou art Hee that I have longed for a long time, and
bleſſed be God, that this day is come: therefore ſeeing Chriſtians are
deſirous of Chriſts comming, this ſhould teach them to prepare for it:
we ſee a loving wife,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> in the abſence of her husband, when ſhe lookes
for his returne ſhee will trimme up her houſe, garden and walkes to
have all things handſome; ſo wee that bee Chriſtians, when we heare
that Chriſt will come, we muſt trimme up our houſes, that is, our hearts,
and our conſciences, and make all fit to entertaine Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Having declared the ſignes that goe before, and alſo ſuch as joyne
with the comming of Chriſt, wee proceede to the next thing, which is
the <hi>manner of his comming,</hi> and that is glorious, attended on by Angels,
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:17958:216"/>
hee ſhall come in the greateſt glory that Heaven and Earth can afford.
There is great difference betweene the firſt and the ſecond comming of
Chriſt. His firſt comming was baſe and meane, contemned and deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
of all ſorts of men; and wee ſee how unkindly hee was uſed at the
hands of men, in that they condemned him, the Souldiers ſet a crowne
of Thornes on his head, they did mocke at him, buffet him, and crucifie
him; and why? Becauſe hee was apparelled and clothed with our ſins,
which may teach us, that the nobleſt and greateſt one that is, if ſinne be
upon him, it will diſgrace and put him downe: therefore as Chriſt did
caſt away ſinne, and did put it off, and then entred into glory, ſo wee
muſt labour to doe as Chriſt did, to put off ſinne, to kill it, to make a
grave for it, and to bury it, and then as Chriſt comes in glory, ſo wee
ſhall come in glory alſo; But if we do not put off ſin, nor caſt the filthy
ragges of it from us, Chriſt will come in glory, and wee fall to ſhame,
diſgrace and contempt. Now in the manner of Chriſts comming to
judgement, we may obſerve three things:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. How he ſhall come in glory.</item>
                  <item>2. Wherein this glory conſiſts.</item>
                  <item>3. What Benefit we ſhall have by it.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>how he ſhall come;</hi> it ſhall be in glory as we have heard, a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
ſo alſo it is ſaid,<note place="margin">Firſt, Hee ſhall come in glory.</note> 
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 27. <hi>For the Sonne of Man ſhall come in the
glory of his Father, with his Angels, and then ſhall hee give to every man accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his deeds;</hi> and againe, <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 26. <hi>For whoſoever ſhall be aſhamed of me,
and of my Words, of him ſhall the Sonne of Man be aſhamed, when hee ſhall come
in his glory, and in the glory of his Father, and of the holy Angels:</hi> So then
Chriſt ſhall come in all the glory that Heaven and Earth can afford, and
therefore it is manifeſt there is great difference betweene his firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
and his ſecond comming; For his firſt comming was in the eſtate
of humilitie, he was deſpiſed and rejected of men, <hi>Hee was a man full of
ſorrowes, and we esteemed him not;</hi> and as the Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſaith of him,
<hi>a worme and no man,</hi> for our ſinnes brought him to the loweſt ſteppe of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſement.
As a few droppes of water, being put into a lampe, by little
and little,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> the light decreaſeth, till at laſt it dieth and goeth out; ſo our
ſinnes being put upon him did ſo darken and abate his glory, that it
brought him to the loweſt ſteppe and degree of abaſement. We thinke
it no matter when we ſinne againſt God, but here we ſee when our ſins
were imputed to Chriſt, it caſt ſuch darkneſſe and abaſement upon him,
that though he were glorious in himſelfe, yet in the ſight of the world
he was the moſt abject amongſt men: and if Chriſt was thus abaſed,
much more then the moſt noble and the greateſt man that is, if he ſinne
againſt God, it will take away all his glory; we marvell that ſinne ſhould
caſt ſuch diſgrace upon men, and bring ſuch ſhame upon them; but we
neede not marvell at it, ſeeing it caſt ſuch diſgrace on Chriſt, when it
was but imputed unto him.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> 
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 4. it is ſaid of <hi>Reuben, Vnſtable as wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
Thou ſhalt not be excellent, becauſe thou wenteſt to thy Fathers bed, thou didſt
defile it;</hi> therefore thy dignitie is gone; ſo if wee ſinne againſt God, it
will take away all our glory: as the falſe Prophets ſaid, when they were
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:17958:217"/>
demanded, <hi>What are theſe wounds in thy hands? Then hee ſhall anſwere, Thus
was I wounded in the houſe of my friends, Zech.</hi> 13. 6. So we may ſay by our
ſinnes, when they have brought diſgrace and ſhame upon us, what is
this? They be the wounds that I have received in the houſe of my
friend.<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>imile.</note> It is well obſerved of a learned man, that if one take the brigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
colour, let it bee what it will, Scarlet, or Purple, or Watchet; and
hold it in the Sunne, and it will have a darke ſhaddow; ſo the brighteſt
ſinnes, and the moſt brave, they will have but a darke ſhadow when they
come before the Sunne of righteouſneſſe Chriſt Ieſus unto judgement.
Therefore ſeeing ſinne brings ſuch diſgrace upon us, wee ſhould take
heede we doe not ſinne, but rather caſt it from us. We ſee when Chriſt
had caſt away our ſinnes from him, he had the former glory that he had
in the beginning; as <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 28. It is ſaid, <hi>That Chriſt was once offered to take
away the ſinnes of many, and to them that looke for him ſhall hee appeare, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d
time without ſinne unto ſalvation.</hi> Which may teach us, that if wee
caſt away our ſinnes, and labour to bury them in the grave, we ſhall have
that former glory that wee had in the beginning, before the fall of our
firſt Parents:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſo <hi>Iudges</hi> 16. it is ſaid of <hi>Sampſon,</hi> That when he had ſinned
againſt God, hee loſt his ſtrength, but after that <hi>his haire grew againe;</hi> as
ſoone as he had renewed his repentance, his ſtrength did come againe,
as appeared in that <hi>He killed more at his death, than he did in his life;</hi> ſo hee
had more glory at his death, than in his life; ſo howſoever our ſinnes
may bring diſgrace and ſhame upon us, yet if we can repent of them and
turne to God, we ſhall have greater glory than ever wee had at the firſt,
or ſhould have had if <hi>Adam</hi> had ſtood in his innocencie.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Secondly, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this glory conſiſts.</note> 
                  <hi>wherein this glory of Chriſt conſiſts:</hi> which is chiefly in three
things: First, <hi>In the traine of Chriſt,</hi> that hee ſhall be accompanied and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with, all the holy Angels; for there is never an Angell, Archan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell,
Cherubin or Seraphin, but they bee ready to doe ſervice to Chriſt
and to attend him: So <hi>Daniel,</hi> 7. 10. It is ſaid, <hi>A firie ſtreame iſſued and
came forth from him, thouſand thouſands did minister unto him, and tenne thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
did ſtand before him;</hi> and 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 7. <hi>When the Lord ſhall ſhew himſelfe
from Heaven with his mightie Angels, in flaming fire, rendring vengeance unto
all them that know not God nor obey his Goſpell;</hi> and <hi>Iude</hi> 14. the Apoſtle
ſhewes that <hi>Henoch the ſeventh from Adam</hi> did propheſie of this ſaying,
<hi>Behold, the Lord commeth with thouſands of his Saints, to execute judgement
upon all men.</hi> This is one point of the glory of Chriſt, that the Angels
ſhall attend him, and be ready to doe him ſervice: we ſee the perſon of
a King is glorious in himſelfe,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> but when he is incloſed with his Nobles
and Guard, it is more glorious; ſo the perſon of Chriſt is glorious in
himſelfe, but more glorious when hee is accompanied with all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
and Powers in Heaven, who are ready to doe him ſervice: Let this
therefore be a comfort to Chriſtians, for wee ſee when Chriſt came to
his paſſion; hee was guarded with a company of baſe Souldiers; but at
his ſecond comming he ſhall have thouſand thouſands of Angels to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
him.<note place="margin">Secondly, this glory conſiſts in the brightneſſe of his body.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, it conſiſts <hi>in the ſplend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r and brightneſſe of his bodie;</hi> it ſhall
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:17958:217"/>
darken all other lights, even the light of the Sunne and the Moone. So
<hi>Revel.</hi> 21. 23. it is ſaid, <hi>that the Citie hath no neede of the light of the Sunne,
neither of the Moone to ſhine on it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> for the glory of God doth light it, and the
Lambe is the light thereof.</hi> This is another part of the glory of Chriſt,
unto which the moſt eminent glory of the greateſt kingdoms and ſtates
on Earth, is not comparable: and therefore why doe men ſo dote on
the glory of this World.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Thirdly, in the eminencie of his Soveraigne power.</note> it conſiſts <hi>in the eminencie of his Soveraigne power and authority,</hi>
that hee hath to arraigne and judge all men as the ſupreame Iudge. So
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. 1. <hi>The Lord ſaid unto my Lord, ſit thou at my right hand, untill I
make thine enemies thy footestoole:</hi> All the enemies of Chriſt ſhall bee
brought under foote of Chriſt, and ſhall licke the duſt of his feete: ſo
alſo 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 25. it is ſaid, <hi>For he ſhall raigne till he hath put downe all his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
under his feete:</hi> this is another part of Chriſts glory. Tell mee, doe
you thinke that <hi>Adam</hi> was a glorious man, when all the Birds and Beaſts
were brought before him, to receive names from him as their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
Lord? Then what a great glory will this be to Chriſt, that not
onely the Birds and Beaſts ſhall bee brought before him, but alſo all
men, and that not to receive names, but to give a finall ſentence either
of abſolution or condemnation?</p>
               <p>I, but what ſhall we be the better for this glory of Chriſt? I anſwer,
Chriſts glory is for the good of his Saints and People; hee is glorified
not onely for himſelfe, but alſo for the good of Chriſtians that beleeve
in him;<note place="margin">Chriſt hath two keyes.</note> for he hath two keyes; the key of Hell and of Heaven. Firſt,
the key of Hell to ſhut up all the wicked and damned thereinto; As
<hi>Revel.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1</note> 20. <hi>And I ſaw an Angell come downe from Heaven, having the key of
the bottomleſſe Pit, and a great chaine in his hand, and he tooke the Dragon that
old Serpent, which is the Divell and Satan, and he bound him a thouſand yeeres,
and caſt him into the bottomleſſe pit,</hi> and he ſhut him up, and ſealed the doore
upon him, &amp;c. Thus we ſee it is Chriſt that is this Angell that hath the
key of Hell in his hand, to ſhut up the Divell and the damned and the
wicked into Hell; ſo that there ſhall not be left a Devill nor a wicked
man, nor any of the damned to annoy or hurt any good man: So <hi>Matth.</hi>
15. 41. <hi>The Sonne of Man ſhall ſend forth his Angels, and they ſhall gather out of
his kingdome all things that offend, and them which doe iniquitie.</hi> Now in this
world, in the moſt ſanctified Church and beſt reformed, there is a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of diſorders and corruptions that doth trouble toyle and offend the
People of God: but at the laſt day every thing that offends ſhall bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away, the Divell, the Damned and Wicked men ſhall bee ſhut
into Hell; ſo that a dogge (as it were) ſhall not ſo much as moove his
tongue at one of Gods People.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the wicked ſhall not onely bee ſhut into Hell, but Chriſt
hath a key alſo to open Heaven and to let in the godly; as <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. 3.
He ſaith to his Diſciples, <hi>I goe to prepare a place for you, and if I goe to prepare
a place for you, I will come againe and receive you unto my ſelfe, that where I
am, there may you be alſo:</hi> So when he hath locked up the wicked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
in Hell, then hee will make a way to Heaven and open it to his
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:17958:218"/>
Servants; as 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 10. 15. When <hi>Iehu</hi> had ſlaine <hi>Ahabs</hi> ſeventie ſons
and <hi>Ahaziahs</hi> brethren, and the blood was yet warme upon his hands,
meeting with a good man, <hi>Iehonadah</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Rechab; He bleſſed him
and ſaid unto him, Is thine heart upright as mine is towards thine?</hi> and <hi>Iehona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dab
anſwered, It is; If it be, give me thine hand: and he gave him his hand and
tooke him into his Chariot;</hi> ſo the Lord will doe when hee hath chaſed all
the wicked to Hell, and the blood of them is yet warme (as it were) on
his hands, meeting with a good man he will ſay; You are a good man,
your heart is upright; then he will take him up into his Chariot, that is,
into Heaven; ſo God will honour all his ſervants. Thus a <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 10. it
is ſaid, <hi>That he will come to be glorified in his Saints, and to be made marvellous
in all them that beleeve:</hi> Hee will not account himſelfe glorified, till hee
hath glorified his Saints, therefore he will not be onely glorious in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
but he will alſo make his Saints glorious. The Uſes are:</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> ſeeing Chriſt communicates his glory to his Saints, therefore
they ſhould comfort themſelves with the hope of this, that one day
there will bee a time of glory, howſoever they are kept downe here in
this world with many croſſes and afflictions; ſo <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 3. it is ſaid, <hi>Yee
are dead, and your life is hid with Chriſt in God:</hi> there is a life in a Chriſtian,
and that a glorious one too, though the world cannot ſee it becauſe it is
hid in Chriſt,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> yet it is truely in him; as the beauty and life of the flower
lieth hid in the roote all the winter-time; ſo the life of a Chriſtian and
his glory lies hid in Chriſt, but when he commeth then he ſhall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous,
then his glory ſhal appeare.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> When Chriſt came before <hi>Pilate</hi> he
asked him, <hi>if he were a King?</hi> ſure he thought him but a poor king: Chriſt
anſweres, <hi>My kingdome is not of this world;</hi> ſo a Chriſtian may ſay in all
his diſgraces, my kingdome is not of this world, but is above the
clouds, a kingdome of glory and happineſſe. <hi>Chryſostome</hi> ſaith, in this
world is the place of conflict and combate, therefore we muſt looke for
nothing but blowes, wounds, and blood, but when the combate is at an
end, then we may looke for crownes and rewards; therefore wee may
comfort our ſelves in the hope of this, that one day we ſhall have glory.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> ſeeing that Chriſt communicates his glory to his Saints,
all true Chriſtians have good cauſe to long for his comming: the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
care not how long it bee ere hee come, the longer hee tarries they
thinke it the better; O, but the people of God, they care not how ſoone
he come, becauſe it is the better for them, for when he comes they ſhall
have glory; therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>that the creatures groane,</hi>
and the Saints groane desiring and longing when this time of glory
will be, as <hi>Iob</hi> 14. 14. ſaith he, <hi>If a man dye ſhall he riſe againe? all the daies
of my appointed time will I waite, till my change come, &amp;c.</hi> So Chriſtians
looke and waite for a change,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> from mortality to immortality, from an
eſtate of humility, to an eſtate of glory; therefore they deſire and long
for Chriſts comming: as <hi>Siſera</hi>'s mother did waite and long for <hi>Siſera,
Iudg.</hi> 5. 28. where it is ſaid, <hi>The mother of Siſera looked out at a window,
and ſhee did cry out at the latiſe, why is his chariot ſo long a comming, and why
tarrieth the wheeles of his chariot?</hi> ſo the people of God long for Chriſts
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:17958:218"/>
comming,<note place="margin">SERMON XLVII.</note> and when they looke out of their doores and windowes they
may ſay, O, when will Chriſt come in his glory, that wee may be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Vſe 3.</note> ſeeing that Chriſt communicates his glory to his Saints and
to his people, doe thou labour to be one of them, and it will be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
day to thee: therefore <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. <hi>ult. I have gone
aſtray like a loſt ſheepe, ſeeke thy ſervant for I have not forgot thy Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</hi>
as if he ſhould ſay, I have gone aſtray, I have beene a ſinner, but
Lord ſeeke me and make me one of thy ſervants: ſo a Chriſtian may ſay
with the holy father <hi>Bernard,</hi> O Lord Ieſus make me one of thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
and receive mee, and as thou tookeſt away the ſinnes of thy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
ſo doe thou now take away mine; and Lord breede conſcience and
care in me, that when thou glorifieſt thy Saints, I may be glorified with
them: there be many maſters ſtrive for my ſervice, as pride, vaine-glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and covetouſneſſe; but I ſtrive againſt them all, and I renounce them,
and bid farewell to them, for I will beſtow my love only on thee, Chriſt
ſhall be my king, he ſhall be my Lord and Maſter, and ſo when he comes
in glory, I ſhall have glory with him.</p>

                  <q>And they ſhall ſee the Sonne of Man comming
in the Clouds of Heaven, with power and great glory.
And Hee ſhall ſend His Angels with a great
ſound of a Trumpet, and they ſhall gather together His
Elect from the foure winds, from one end of Heaven to
the other.</q>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>EE heard the laſt day that Chriſt ſhall come in
glory to judge the whole world: before hee
came in the eſtate of humility, as a man cloathed
with our ſinne; but now he ſhall come in glory:
before he came in the ſtate of a ſervant, but now
hee ſhall come in the ſtate of a Lord and King:
before he had <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> to his forerunner, but
now hee ſhall have an Archangell to Uſher him:
before he was attended with twelve poore Diſciples, but now hee ſhall
have thouſand thouſands of Angels to guard him: before hee was laid
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:17958:219"/>
in a ſtable, but now he ſhall ſit on a glorious Throne: before he did ride
on an Aſſe to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> but now hee ſhall come on the clouds: before
he raiſed up ſome three or foure dead, but now hee ſhall raiſe up all the
dead: Hence wee learne the greater glory Chriſt ſhall have, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is the comfort of Chriſtians, for hee ſhall not onely bee glorious in
himſelfe, but ſhall be made glorious in his Saints.</p>
               <p>Now the glory of Chriſt ſhall be the greater, that an Archangell ſhall
goe before him, to gather together all men, and to ſet them before him;
or to ſummon or cite all men, and to give warning to the whole world to
appeare before Chriſt, who ſits as ſupreme Iudge to give ſentence upon
all men. In which ſummons three things offer themſelves to our obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Who ſhall ſound the Trumpet.</item>
                  <item>2. What the power of the ſound is.</item>
                  <item>3. To what end it ſhall be.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>who ſhall ſound the Trumpet;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Who ſhall ſound the Trumpet.</note> It is an Archangell, as 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4. 16.
ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>For the Lord himſelfe ſhall deſcend from heaven with a ſhout,
and with the voice of an Archangell, and with the Trumpet of God;</hi> Hence wee
learne, that there is never an Angell nor Archangell, but ſhall be ready to
doe ſervice to Chriſt and to attend him and therefore much more ſhould
we be ready, being but duſt and aſhes, to doe him ſervice, and to attend
him while wee live here: We ſee <hi>Luk.</hi> 7. 38. how ready <hi>Mary</hi> was upon
her converſion to doe ſervice to Chriſt, and to attend him, for <hi>Shee sits
downe at his feete, ſhe weepes, and waſheth them with her teares, and wipes them
with the haire of her head<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> her eyes were as a baſon of water to waſh Chriſts
feet in, and her haire as a towell to wipe them. In like manner, wee upon
our Converſion ſhould be ready to doe ſervice to Chriſt, though we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſit at his feet, as <hi>Mary</hi> did, to waſh them with our teares, and wipe
them with our haire, yet we muſt bee ready to doe him ſervice in the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Faith, Repentance, Love, and Holineſſe; according to <hi>Pauls</hi> exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 18. <hi>For whoſoever in theſe things ſerveth Chriſt, is acceptable
to God; and approved of men:</hi> Therefore although wee cannot with <hi>Mary</hi>
ſit downe at the feet of Chriſt, yet let us labour to doe him ſervice in the
duties of Love, and holineſſe, for ſuch ſervice will be acceptable to Chriſt:
and therefore fie on the pride of men that diſdaine to doe ſervice unto him
in the duties of Prayer, hearing of the Word preached, Repentance, and
the like whereas there is never a ſtate in heaven, Angell nor Archangell,
but is ready to doe him ſervice and to attend him.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>what ſhall be the power of the ſound:</hi> That appeares in two
things;<note place="margin">What ſhall bee the power of the ſound.</note> firſt, that the ſound of it ſhall be heard all the world over to the
furtheſt part of it, and the living ſhall not only heare it, but the dead, ſuch
as have lyen rotting in their graves many yeeres together.<note place="margin">1</note> Secondly, they
ſhall not onely heare it, but they ſhall ſtirre, and ſtartle at it, and move out
of their graves But from whence commeth this power? I anſwere, the
voice is the voice of the Archangell, but the power is of Chriſt; ſo the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery
is the Angels: Therefore ſeeing all the dead ſhall heare it and ſhall
not onely heare it, but ſhall ſtirre and be awaked therewith, what a pitifull
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:17958:219"/>
thing is it, that we daily heare Chriſt call unto us in the Ministery of his
Word, and yet we doe not ſtirre or bee awaked at it, or move out of our
ſinnes and corruptions? In <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. we reade of a number of dead bones
that lye ſcattered here and there, and when the Prophet did propheſie to
them, <hi>There was a noiſe and a cluttering the bones together, bone ran to bone, and
the ſinewes and the fleſh came up upon them:</hi> But God by his Miniſters hath
propheſied to us a long time, and yet there is no noyſe nor cluttering of
the bones amongſt us, bone does not runne to his bone, nor ſinewes grow
on the bones, grace does not grow in our hearts, nor true repentance move
us to newneſſe of life: there is never a man living but he ſhall heare the
voyce of the Archangell; for howſoever hee will not heare the voyce of
Chriſt to his converſion in this world in the Miniſtery of his Word, yet
hee ſhall bee ſure to finde it powerfull to his confuſion at the great day of
judgement in the world that is to come.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>to what end this ſound ſhall be:</hi> to ſummon and cite all men before
Chriſt as the ſupreme Iudge,<note place="margin">To what end the ſound ſhall be.</note> to give warning to the whole world, and to
call all men together, to give in their accounts, not onely the living but the
dead, thouſand thousands of men and women that the grave hath now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured;
thouſand thouſands that the Caves, Rockes and Dennes hath
ſwallowed up thouſands that the beaſts and the birds have deſtroyed, and
thouſand thouſands that the ſea hath devoured; All ſhall come forth and
make their appearance before Chriſt: ſo ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 10. <hi>For wee
ſhall all appeare before the judgement ſeate of Chriſt:</hi> not onely the living but
the dead alſo, all ſhall make their appearance and ſtand before Chriſt, as
the Iudge of this whole world: Hence we learne, how carefull every one of
vs ought to be to paſſe his dayes in Reverence and Feare before God, as
that wee may ſtand with Comfort before him at that great and terrible
day. If we compare theſe two places together, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 19. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.
21. wee ſhall finde that when <hi>Moſes</hi> heard the trumpet blow lowder
and lowder, and ſhriller and ſhriller, <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid, <hi>I exceedingly feare and
quake:</hi> Now if <hi>Moſes</hi> was thus affraid and quaked at the giving of the
Law, when God did ſpeake to him, how affraid ſhall men bee at the day of
Iudgement, how ſhall they quake when the Lord ſhall come to puniſh the
tranſgreſſion of the Law: <hi>Eſay</hi> 6. 5. the Prophet cryes out, <hi>Woe is me, for I
am undone,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> 
                  <hi>becauſe I am a man of polluted lips, and I dwell amongst a people of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane
lips: for mine eyes have ſeene the king, the Lord of hosts.</hi> In like manner,
every wicked man of this world ſhall cry out at that day, Woe is me, I am
undone, I am a ſinfull and polluted man, I have deſpiſed Religion, I have
not walked carefully and conſcionably before God, and now mine eyes
ſhall ſee the Lord of hoſts: O how ſhall men quake and tremble, and how
terrible will that day be? To illuſtrate this unto you and preſſe it home
to your conſciences give me leave to relate a ſtory, the truth whereof is
not to the purpoſe to enquire, for the morall is that which I intend, and
you may make profitable uſe of: and this it is; There was a certaine
king that did weepe and was heavie and ſad, which when his brother
ſaw, he asked him, why he was ſo heavie and ſad? Saith hee, becauſe I
have judged others and now I muſt bee judged my ſelfe: Why (ſaith
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:17958:220"/>
his brother) art thou ſo heavie and ſad for this, it will be a long time ere
that day come,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and beſides that, it is but a ſlight matter: the king ſaid
little to it for the preſent: now it was the order in that country, when
any man had committed any treaſon, there was a Trumpet ſounded at
his doore in the night time, and he was brought out the next day to bee
executed: now the king commanded a Trumpet to bee ſounded at his
brothers doore in the night time, who waking out of his ſleepe, when
hee heard it, aroſe and came quaking and trembling to the king: How
now, ſaith the king, what is the matter you quake and tremble, and are
ſo afraid? I am attached of treaſon (anſwers he) and I ſhall be executed
the next morning: why, ſaith the king to him againe, art thou ſo afraid
and doſt thou ſo tremble at that? knowing that thou ſhalt bee judged
by thy brother, and for a matter that thy conſcience tells thee thou art
cleare of: how much more therefore may I be affraid, ſeeing that God
ſhall judge me, and not in a matter that my conſcience frees me in, but
of that which I am guilty of? and beſides this, if the worſt come it is
but a temporary death, that thou ſhouldeſt dye; but the death I am ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to is eternall, both of body and ſoule. Hereby wee may ſee what
terrour will bee to a guilty conſcience, that hath not repented of his
ſinnes; how dreadfull will that day bee, when the bookes ſhall bee ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and all the thoughts, words and works of every man ſhall be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted,
as well the ſecreteſt luſts of the heart-adultery; as the ſhameleſſe
blaſphemies of open profanenes; aſwel the private corruptions of bribed
juſtice, as the publike gratings of heard-hearted oppreſſion? then nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
poverty nor riches, neither meaneneſſe nor honour, no ſtate or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
ſhall free us,<note place="margin">Quest. Sol.</note> all muſt appeare and anſwere for themſelves. But
what ſhall we doe in this caſe may ſome man ſay? I anſwer, we muſt doe
as <hi>Iaakob</hi> did when his brother <hi>Eſau</hi> came againſt him,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> with foure hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
men, <hi>Genes.</hi> 34. <hi>I will pacifie his wrath with a preſent; if I have found
grace in thy ſight, then receive my gift;</hi> ſo when wee know that God is
comming our againſt us, not with foure hundred men, but with thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
thouſands of his Angels, we muſt doe as <hi>Iaakob</hi> did ſay, I will give
him a gift, I will pacifie his wrath with a preſent, that ſo I may finde
favour in his ſight to compoſe the matter with him before that great
and terrible day come.</p>
               <p>Now the next thing,<note place="margin">The great ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of all.</note> that ſhall be at the day of judgement, is <hi>the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
and gathering together of all men at that day;</hi> ſo that which we heare
now with our eares, wee ſhall ſee then with our eyes; <hi>for the Angels
ſhall gather together God elect from the one end of heaven to the other,</hi> ſo the
words of Chriſt be. In which gathering together of the elect wee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
three things:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. What they be that ſhall be gathered.</item>
                  <item>2. By whom they ſhall be gathered.</item>
                  <item>3. To whom they ſhall be gathered.</item>
               </list>
               <p>First,<note place="margin">First, who ſhall be gathered.</note> 
                  <hi>who they bee that ſhall be gathered; Gods elect,</hi> as the text ſheweth:
now it is out of all queſtion, that not onely Gods elect ſhall be gathered,
but the wicked alſo which Chriſt, ſhewes in two parables; firſt, of the
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:17958:220"/>
                  <hi>tares, Matth.</hi> 13. 41. for as the <hi>tares</hi> are gathered and burnt in the fire,
ſo ſhall it be in the end of the world, ſaith our Saviour, <hi>The Sonne of Man
ſhall ſend forth his Angels, and they ſhall gather out of his kingdome all things
that offend;</hi> and then verſ. 44. in the parable of the <hi>draw-net that is cast in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Sea, and gathereth of all kinde of fiſhes, which when it is full, men draw to
land, and ſit and gather the good into veſſels, and caſt away the bad;</hi> ſo the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
ſhall bee gathered too.<note place="margin">Quest.</note> I, but ſeeing the wicked ſhall bee gathered
aſwell as the godly, why is it ſaid that the Angels ſhall gather together
the elect onely?<note place="margin">Sol.</note> I anſwer, to ſhew the tender care that Chriſt hath of
the elect, that he would not have ſo much as a little bone loſt or a finger
or a toe or a haire of their heads, ſuch a tender care hath he of them: as
<hi>David</hi> gave a charge to his Captaines,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. 5. concerning <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalom,
If you meet with the young man, intreat him kindly for my ſake;</hi> ſuch
a charge Chriſt ſhall give to his Angels, intreat the elect well for my
ſake, have a tender care of them, that there be not one of them wanting.
Now what is the reaſon that Chriſt hath ſuch a tender care of the
elect? I anſwer, becauſe they be his myſticall members and he will bee
compleat in all his members; therefore if we be of hsi elect, there ſhall
not a bone, or a finger, or a little toe, nor ſo much as the haire of their
heads bee wanting, ſuch a tender care God hath of his elect; but the
wicked they ſhall be hurried and haled to the barre as theeves, villaines
and traytors; when the other ſhall bee brought tenderly by the hands
of Angels. Therefore ſeeing there ſhall be ſuch an aſſembly of all men
both good and bad at that day, how great ſhould our care bee to provide
our ſelves againſt that dreadfull appearance. O man, whoever thou
art, doe but conſider with thy ſelfe, and thinke what a number of men
there have beene of the <hi>Romans</hi> ſince it was <hi>Rome,</hi> what a number of
men there have beene in <hi>England</hi> ſince it was inhabited, or in <hi>France,</hi>
and ſo of all other Countries, and then thinke of all the men, that have
beene in all ages, and at all times from the beginning of the world to
the latter end, and that all theſe ſhall bee gathered together before
Chriſt; and then how canſt thou chuſe but bee carefull how thou paſſe
thy daies heere, that thou may'ſt ſtand with comfort before Chriſt, in
ſuch an aſſembly: <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 1. <hi>the wicked ſhall not ſtand in the
Iudgement;</hi> if a man be a wicked man though he be a king or a lord, or a
kinght or whatſoever he be, hee ſhall not bee able to hold up his head in
judgement; but the godly man though he be a poore man he ſhall lift
up his head with comfort, whereas there is never a man that is wicked
which ſhall ſtand before God in this great aſſembly; therefore labour
thou to repent of thy ſinnes, and to get faith in Chriſt, and to be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for that day. I would to God I could perſwade you a little to ſeque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
your thoughts from the world, and to thinke of the day of the Lord,
that all men ſhall bee gathered together before the Lord, and arraig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
to give an accompt of all his actions that he hath done; how would
this worke on our hearts to lay up comfort for that day? <hi>Eſai.</hi> 10. 3.
The Prophet demands,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> 
                  <hi>What ſhall yee doe now in the day of your viſitation
and of deſtruction?</hi> ſo the wicked may ſay, what ſhall we doe at that day,
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:17958:221"/>
when we ſhall be convicted and found haters of God, deſpiſers of good
things, contemners of religion, and deceivers of our neighbours: ſo the
conſideration of this might make every one to be prepared for it. Thus
we ſee that not onely the elect ſhall be gathered, but the wicked alſo.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Secondly, by whom they ſhall egathered.</note> 
                  <hi>by whom they ſhall bee gathered; by the Angels:</hi> Now the
Angels doe ſervice to us; firſt, <hi>when we be living;</hi> ſecondly, <hi>when wee bee
dead;</hi> thirdly, <hi>at the day of judgement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Firſt, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels ſerve us li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</note> 
                  <hi>they doe us ſervice</hi> whilſt wee are living, <hi>they attend us, and carry
us in their hands, as it is ſaid,</hi> Pſal. 91. For hee ſhall give his Angels charge
over thee to keepe thee in all thy wayes; they ſhall beare thee in their hands, that
thou hurt not thy foote againſt a ſtone: <hi>ſo</hi> Pſal. 34. 7. The Angell of the Lord
pitcheth round about them that feare him, and delivereth them.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Secondly, at our death they ſerve us.</note> 
                  <hi>at the day of death,</hi> they bee round about our houſes, attend
our chambers and our ſicke beds, and when wee are dead, they carry our
Soules into Heaven; as we may ſee, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. in the ſtory of <hi>Lazarus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Thirdly, at the day of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> they doe us ſrvice <hi>at the day of judgement;</hi> to open our graves,
to digge and pull away the mould, and to conduct and carry us into the
preſence of Chriſt; therefore doe thou labour to bee a ſervant of Chriſt,
and to feare God, and the Angels ſhall not only attend thee while thou li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt
here, but ſhall digge thee out of thy grave, and take away the moulds,
and ſhall conduct and bring thee into the preſence of Chriſt; as <hi>Acts</hi> 12.
when <hi>Peter</hi> was in priſon, the Angell came and opened the priſon doore,
and there was a light did ſhine round about him, and he ſmote off his fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
and chaines, and led him into the ſtreets of the Citie: ſo the Angels
ſhall do to the godly at the day of judgement, they ſhall open their graves
which is a Priſon, and ſhall knocke off the Gives of mortalitie; a light
ſhall ſhine round about them, and they ſhall take them by the hand (as it
were) and lead them from countrey to countrey till they come at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of Chriſt, to the <hi>new Ieruſalem</hi> to enjoy fellowſhip with God, and his
bleſſed Angels.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Thirdly, to whom we ſhall be gathered.</note> to whom we ſhall be gathered, <hi>To Chriſt,</hi> first, as <hi>to the Head;</hi>
and then one to another, as <hi>to the members.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>wee ſhall bee gathered to Chriſt our Head,</hi> there ſhall not one of his
members bee wanting: which may be a great comfort to all Chriſtians;
for this is that they deſire, that all their praiers they conceive, all the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
they heare, all their labours and paines tend to; it is the center of
their deſires: for this they ſigh and long to bee gathered home to their
Head Ieſus Chriſt. So <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. <hi>Paul deſireth to bee diſſolved, and to bee with
Chriſt,</hi> though it be with the loſſe of life or goods he was contented. <hi>Gen.</hi>
45. 1.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> wee ſee when <hi>Ioſeph</hi> and his brethren met together, what joy there
was; <hi>Ioſeph</hi> did weepe on his brethrens neckes, and they on his: ſo when
Chriſt and his members meete, O what joy there ſhall bee at the day of
judgement; they ſhall not weepe one upon anothers necke, but there ſhall
be joy unſpeakeable and glorious.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>they ſhall be gathered one to another, as to members;</hi> though they
live now in diverſe Countreyes and Kingdomes, in diverſe Townes and
Houſes, and (by reaſon of ſome corruptions) it may be wee may have little
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:17958:221"/>
comfort one of another, yet at the day of judgement all ſhall meete toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
againe, and then we ſhall rejoyce in the company of each other; then
we ſhall meet with all the <hi>Patriarkes, Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles, Martyrs, Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors</hi>
and all our godly friends and acquaintance that ever wee knew, came
of or heard of;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> wee ſee when friends have beene abſent a long time one
from another, and meete together againe, how welcome are they one
to another, and how doe they rejoyce in the company of each other? So
at the day of judgement, when we ſhall meete with our godly friends and
acquaintance that have beene abſent from us a long time, what joy and
comfort will there bee?<note place="margin">Simile.</note> Wee ſee alſo when friends meete together at a
Feaſt, what joy there is one with another: O, but there ſhall be greater
joy at the day of judgement, when all the godly meete together and when
every mans joy ſhall bee our joy: So it ſhall bee a comfortable aſſembly to
bee gathered to Chriſt, and one Chriſtian to another: wee ſee here on
Earth when Chriſtians are met together to pray, and conferre, and to
sing Pſalmes, what joy and comfort is there, and yet there is many times
meanes of diſcontentment; but when all weakneſſe ſhall be at an end, and
all imperfections ſhall ceaſe, much more joy and comfort in Heaven ſhall
wee take one in another? Therefore if wee have any wit in our heads, or
grace in our hearts, let every one of us labour to be one of Gods people, to
be a member of Chriſt, and then we ſhall bee gathered firſt to Chriſt our
Head, and then to one another as fellow-members.</p>
               <p>Now we ſhall not only be aggregated and gathered together,<note place="margin">As a gathering of all, ſo there ſhall be a ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all.</note> but <hi>there
ſhall be alſo a ſeparation;</hi> for all the World ſhall be divided into two flockes
or Heards; the Sheepe ſhall be ſet at the right hand, and the Goats at the
left; and they ſhall bee ſeparated as a Shepheard ſeparateth the Sheepe
from the Goates, who although they feede all the day long in one paſture,<note place="margin">Simile.</note>
drinke all of one water, and are refreſhed all under one ſhaddow; yet when
the night commeth, hee gathereth the Sheepe into the Fold, and leaves
the Goates to bee devoured of the Wolves: ſo the Lord Ieſus Chriſt ſhall
ſeparate the good from the bad, howſoever they lived together here in
this world, may ſit all at one table and lie in one bed, yet when the day
of judgement comes, hee will gather his ſheepe into his fold and leave
the wicked to be tormented with the Divell. Now in this ſeparation, we
observe three things:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1 That there ſhall be a ſeparation.</item>
                  <item>2 The Time when it ſhall be.</item>
                  <item>3 Who ſhall be ſeparated.</item>
               </list>
               <p>First,<note place="margin">Firſt, there ſhall be a ſeparation.</note> 
                  <hi>there ſhall bee a ſeparation of the good from the bad by the power of
Chriſt:</hi> The Scripture is plaine for it, and when the Sonne of man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
in his glory with all the holy Angels with him, then ſhall hee ſit
on the Throne of his glory, and before him ſhall be gathered all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which hee ſhall ſeparate as a ſhepheard ſeparateth the Sheepe from
the Goates. So <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 24. <hi>The Sonne of Man ſhall ſend forth his Angels,
and they ſhall gather out of his Kingdome all things that offeud; and them that
dqe iniquitie;</hi> and verſe 49. ſaith Chriſt, <hi>So ſhall it be in the end of the World,
The Angels ſhall goe forth and ſever the bad from amongst the Iuſt:</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi>
                  <pb n="432" facs="tcp:17958:222"/>
17. 34. ſaith Chriſt, <hi>I tell you in that night there ſhall bee two in a bed, the one
ſhall be received and the other ſhall be left: Two women ſhall be grinding together
at the Mill, the one ſhall be taken, and the other ſhall be left.</hi> So then there ſhall
be a ſeparation in the neereſt and deareſt ſocietie that may be, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the moſt neereſt and deareſt friends: there they ſhall not caſt out
the bondwoman and her ſon onely, but the husband ſhall be taken from
the wife, and the wife from the husband, and the father from the ſonne,
and the ſonne from the father, and one friend from another; ſuch a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
there ſhall bee of them that have dwelt in a houſe a long time
together, laid in one bed, and ſate at one table; the one ſhall goe to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and the other to Hell; the one ſhall goe to joy, the other to paine;
the one ſhall goe to God and his Angels, the other to the Divell and the
damned. Hence we learne for our inſtruction theſe profitable and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
Vſes.</p>
               <p>Seeing there ſhall bee a ſeparation of the moſt deareſt and neereſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie
at the day of judgement;<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> this therefore ſhould teach us what the
care of good couples and friends ſhould be, ſo to live together heere in
Gods feare, as that they may not bee parted at that day. To this Saint
<hi>Peter</hi> exhorts married couples, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 7. <hi>Likewiſe yee husbands dwell with
them, as men of knowledge, giving honour unto the woman as to the weaker veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell,
even as they which are heires together of the grace of life, that your prayers
be not interrupted:</hi> Here wee ſee the Apoſtle would have good couples
live together, as heires of the grace of life, that ſo they may not be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
at the day of judgement: for what a heavie parting ſhall there bee
when the husband ſhall bee taken from the wife, or the wife from the
husband; the father from the childe, or the childe from the father; or
one friend from another, when there ſhall bee a ſeparation in the moſt
deereſt and neereſt ſocietie, even of thoſe that have laid in a bed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
ſate at a table and dwelt in a houſe together a long time? O thinke
of this beloved brethren, what a heavie parting it will bee at that
time, when they which have lived twentie or thirty yeeres together,
muſt be ſeparated! Let husbands and wives, fathers and children, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
and ſervants, and one friend with another all conſider it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let them endeavour ſo to live together in the feare of God heere,
as that they may not be parted at the day of judgement, when this fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
ſeparation ſhall be. We ſee <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 28. It is an aggravation of the
griefe of the wicked, that they ſhall ſee <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> in the
Kingdome of GOD, and they themſelves thruſt out a-doores; but it
will be a farre greater griefe to us, when we ſhall not onely ſee <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> in the Kingdome of GOD, but our Husbands, wives,
Childeren, Friends and Neighbours, and wee our ſelves ſhut out and
never to come to them; they to enjoy happineſſe with God and the
bleſſed Saints and Angels; wee miſery and everlaſting torments with
the Divels and damned reprobates. Wee ſee what a ſorrowfull ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
there is, when a wife buries her husband and commits him to the
Grave to be devoured of the wormes, ſhe goes home, weepes, wails and
takes on; and yet they may meete together in Gods kingdome. O but
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:17958:222"/>
what a heavie parting will there bee, when the one ſhall bee taken up
into Heaven, and the other ſhall be left to bee devoured in Hell, where
they ſhall never meete; but ſhall be as farre aſunder as Heaven and Hell,
as God and the Divell: Therefore, good brethren bee perſwaded to
thinke ſeriouſly of this heavy and dreadfull ſeparation which will be at
that day; and let it bee the care of all good couples, ſo to live together
here in Gods feare, as that they may not bee parted and ſeparated at the
day of judgement.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> ſeeing there ſhall bee a ſeparation at the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
therefore the godly may comfort themſelves with the hope of
this, howſoever they be troubled here with bad neighbors and wicked
men that hate and perſecute them, yet at the day of judgement, there
ſhall bee a ſeparation of the good from the bad, and there ſhall not bee
one wicked man left to trouble or annoy them. It was <hi>Moſes</hi> comfort
<hi>Exod.</hi> 14. 13.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſaith he, <hi>Feare ye not, ſtand ſtill, and behold the ſalvation of the
Lord, which he will ſhew to you this day:</hi> for the <hi>Egyptians whom ye have ſeene
this day, ye ſhall never ſee againe:</hi> So the Lord will ſay to the godly, ſtand
ſtill and behold the ſalvation of your God, which hee will ſhew to you
this day, the wicked which ye now ſee, ye ſhall never ſee them againe;
they ſhall not trouble nor moleſt you any more, but ſhall bee throwne
into Hell: we have often heard that Ieſus Chriſt ſhall come with a great
key in his hand to locke up the Divell and all the damned in Hell; and
therefore wee neede not feare, for there ſhall bee never a wicked man
left to annoy or trouble Gods People.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, ſeeing there ſhall be a ſeparation at the day of judgment,<note place="margin">Vſe 3.</note> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
how ſhould all the wicked of the world be affraid, howſoever they
dwell in the ſociety of good people here in this world, yet one day they
ſhall dwell with the Devill, and the damned: here indeed in this World,
though they dwell not among the godly, yet they may dwell among civill
and ſociable men, ſuch as will doe them no hurt for a world; but at the day
of judgment their caſe ſhall not be ſo good, for they ſhall dwell with all
the vile people, and raſcals, murtherers, theeves, and all the ſcumme of the
World; Nay worſe, with the Devill and his Angels: and therefore how
afraid ſhould a wicked man be to thinke of this? <hi>Chryſostome</hi> ſaith well,
The very name of ſeparation, what a confuſion is it to a wicked man? for if
(ſaith he,) a <hi>King,</hi> a <hi>Duke,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> or a great man ſhould picke one out of a great
Company, ſhould imbrace him, ſhew great kindneſſe and favour to him,
and ſet him in his owne ſeate, but ſhould frowne on thee, lowre, turne his
backe on thee, &amp; ſhut thee out of the doores, with the Dogs, what a terror
would this be to thee? Farre greater horror will it be when the Lord Ieſus
ſhall ſit on his throne, and ſhall ſay to the godly, <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
ſhall imbrace and grace them before Angels and men, but will frowne
on thee that art a wicked man, lowre, turn his backe on thee, and ſhut thee
out of doores with the Dogs, (that is) with the Divell and wicked men:
O let ſuch conſider this as goe on in their profaneneſſe and impenitency,
let the deſpiſers of God and good people, meditate hereon: many there be
now that cannot abide good people, but at that day they would be glad
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:17958:223"/>
to doe them any ſervice; <hi>to be hewers of wood, and drawers of water</hi> to them, as
the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> were to the people of <hi>Iſrael, Ioſh.</hi> 9. 21. We ſee in <hi>Heſter,</hi> that
<hi>Haman</hi> was in great favour with <hi>King Ahaſhueroſh,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> and was bid to the
Banquet, but when his ſinnes brake out, his face was covered, and he was
hanged on the gallowes, which he ſet up for <hi>Mordecay,</hi> ſo it ſhall be with all
the wicked, if they be not wiſe to make God their friend and repent of
their ſinnes, though they may be in favour with Kings and great men, if
they be not in favour with God, they ſhall be thruſt into hell with the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell
and the damned Therefore let it be every mans wiſedome to ſeparate
from his ſinnes in this life, that his ſinnes doe not ſeparate him from <hi>Chriſt</hi>
at the day of judgment: thus the Lord doth ſhew us hell to bring us to
heaven,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> &amp; he preaches terror to bring us to comfort, as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith; He
doth as a man that ſees a bird which hee loves ready to fall into a ſnare, he
hunts after the bird, and makes a noiſe, and ſo the bird eſcapes the ſnare;
ſo all the Prophets and our Lord Ieſus himſelfe, foreſeeing how we are like
to fall into the ſnare of the Devill, and into Hell, they have lifted up their
voyces and made exclamation to us, and have cried to keepe us out of hell,
that we might avoid the danger of it beforehand.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>The time when this ſeparation ſhall be, at the day of judgment;</hi> ſo the
text ſaith,<note place="margin">The time of the ſeparation.</note> 
                  <hi>when the Sonne of Man ſhall ſit on his throne:</hi> Here in this world, they
may continually live and converſe on with another, live in a houſe, lye in a
bed, ſit at a table, dwell in a towne, meete together in a Church, but at
the day of judgment they ſhall bee ſeparated, the ſervants of God ſhall be
ſeparated from the ſervants of ſinne: So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14. <hi>David</hi> ſaith, that <hi>the wicked
are like to the Chaffe which the winde driveth away;</hi> we ſee in a floore of a bame
where there lyes a heape of corne,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> mingled with Chaffe, when the winde
ariſeth, it bloweth away the chaffe, and the corne lyes ſtill on the barne
floore, ſo the godly and the wicked are like unto a heape of corne and
Chaffe in this world, that lyes on the barne floore of Almighty God, but
let the winde of Gods wrath ariſe, and it blowes all the wicked into Hell,
ſo there ſhall not remaine a wicked man in the floore of Gods Houſe: but
this ſeparation ſhall not be till the day of judgement. The uſes are:</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> ſeeing the ſeparation ſhall not be till the day of judgment, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
no man muſt looke for a perfect eſtate of a Church in this world, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
good and bad being layd together in this world as chaffe and
corne, the bad labor to hinder the good, and if they cannot hinder them,
then they will corrupt them; therefore one ſayes well, though there bee
tares in a Church, yet our faith muſt not be hindred, nor no man ought to
bee diſcouraged, becauſe the corne is not ſeparated from the tares, they
ſhall remaine together till the day alſo judgment; and therefore wee muſt
not ſeparate from the floore of Chriſt, but hold to it for all this.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> becauſe the ſeparation ſhall not be till the day of judgment,
therefore we can looke for no perfect peace in this world till that time; ſo
<hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 29. ſaith the Lord, <hi>I will not caſt forth the Canaanites out from thy
face in one yeare, leſt the Land grow barren, (as a wilderneſſe,) and the beaſts of
the fields multiply againſt thee.</hi> So the Lord would not deſtroy the <hi>Canaanites</hi>
cleane,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> but a remnant of them muſt remaine for the good of his people; in
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:17958:223"/>
like manner he will not roote out all the wicked, but there ſhall ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
for the good of his Church, for there be a number of ſinnes that
breake out in Gods people from day to day, and the wicked be as ſcourges
to them, and to ſet a-worke the graces of Chriſt in them; therefore no man
muſt looke for perfect peace in this world.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Thirdly, the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that ſhall be ſeparated.</note> 
                  <hi>Who they be that ſhall be ſeparated?</hi> The <hi>good</hi> and the <hi>bad, ſheepe</hi>
and <hi>goates,</hi> the ſheepe ſhall be ſet at the right hand of Chriſt, and the
goates at the left: Now the properties of the ſheepe be theſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Properties of Sheepe.</note> 
                  <hi>They will heare the voyce of the ſhepheard and follow him, they will not
follow a ſtranger, Iohn.</hi> 10. 4. ſuch a ſheepe was <hi>Samuel,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 10. ſaith he,
<hi>ſpeake Lord for thy ſervant heareth;</hi> ſuch a ſheepe was <hi>David,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85. 8. <hi>I will
hearken what the Lord ſayth.</hi> Let the world ſay what it will, and my friends,
and my pleaſure, and my profit, I will hearken what God ſayes, <hi>for he will
ſpeake peace in his people;</hi> I will have none other teacher, but he: and therefore
when men will not heare the voyce of Chriſt, but will heare what the
world, what pleaſure and profit ſaith, they be none of the true ſheepe of
Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>that they will leave all to follow Christ their ſhepheard;</hi> their
pleaſures, profit, ſinnes, and whatſoever is deere to them, even life; it ſelfe;
ſuch a ſheepe was <hi>Paul, Philip.</hi> 3. 8. where he ſaith, <hi>that he accounted all things
a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> dung</hi> and droſſe to be found in Chriſt; ſuch ſheepe were the <hi>Diſciples,
Math.</hi> 19. 17. And therefore when men will not leave all to follow Chriſt,
all their ſinnes, pleaſure, and profits to follow him, it is evident they are
none of the ſheepe of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The third is, <hi>that they are never well, till they be under the government of
their ſhepheard:</hi> ſuch a ſheepe was <hi>David,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. <hi>Teach me O Lord the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> of thy ſtatutes;</hi> and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40. 8. <hi>I deſire to doe thy will O Lord, &amp;c.</hi> Therefore
when men deſire not to live under the government of Chriſt, but will be
governed by themſelves, they are none of the true ſheepe of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The fourth is, <hi>when he hath lost the ſhepheard, he runnes here and there, and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> at rest till he hath found him againe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">4</note> ſo when men have loſt Chriſt by
their ſinnes, they ſhould not be at reſt, but run here and there, bleate and
take on, til they have found the ſhepheard, and be brought home againe, to
the ſold: Such a ſheepe was <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 119. <hi>ult.</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I have gone aſtray
like a loſt ſheepe, ſeeke thy ſervant, &amp;c.</hi> And therefore when men have loſt
Chriſt by their ſinnes, and can paſſe away the time and yeares merrily, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſocking after, Chriſt, it is a fearefull token they are none of the true
ſheepe of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The fifth is, <hi>that they will carry fleece and wooll to the ſhepheard:</hi> If there be
any grace or vertue in them,<note place="margin">5</note> wherby they may doe ſervice to Chriſt or
good unto his members they will be ready to doe it. He ſhall have the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and glory of it: therefore when men doe not carry their fleece and
wooll to Chriſt, to let Chriſt have all the honour and glory of the good
things they have, they are none of the ſheepe of Chriſt. Let me exhort you
all therefore to labor to finde theſe properties of a ſheepe in you, to heare
the voice of Chriſt and be contented to leave all to follow him, to deſire
to live under his government, and never be at reſt, when thou haſt loſt
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:17958:224"/>
him, till thou finde him againe; to carry your fleece and wooll to Chriſt; if
there bee any vertue or grace in you let Chriſt have the glory of it; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let every one labor to be a true ſheepe of Chriſt, and he ſhall ſit at his
right hand, I doe not ſay, labour to live amongſt the ſheepe, but to bee
one of the ſheepe of Chriſt, for a man may live amongſt the ſheepe, that
is, in the viſible Church, and yet he may be ſhufled out amongſt the ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Goates.</p>
               <p>It is good obſervation of a learned man,<note place="margin">Three rankes of men.</note> that the World may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided
in three rankes or conditions: In the firſt, are <hi>Heathen,</hi> Infidels
and Atheiſts,<note place="margin">1</note> and ſuch as know not God: In the ſecond, are <hi>Carnall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors,</hi>
ſuch as know God,<note place="margin">2</note> Chriſt, and his Word, and yet they feele not
the power of it in their lives,<note place="margin">3</note> and are not reformed by it: In the third
ranke are <hi>Gods Elect,</hi> neere unto the center Chriſt; and therefore O man
conſider thy ſtanding of what ranke thou art of; if thou bee of the firſt
ranke ſuch as know not God, then never reſt till thou art got within the
ſecond ranke, till thou know God and his Word; and when thou haſt
got within the ſecond ranke, labour to come within the third, to be one
of Gods Elect, and to be as neere the Center Chriſt as may be. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
labour to be a true Sheepe of Chriſt, and then thou ſhalt bee ſet at
the right hand of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>We have done with the Sheepe,<note place="margin">Foure proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Goates.</note> and are come to the Goats, whoſe
properties or uſes are chiefly theſe foure; which I muſt diſpatch in one
word.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> the Goates in the Law were offered for a ſinne offering, to
teach us that our ſinnes will make us ſit at the left hand of Chriſt.<note place="margin">2</note> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
a Goate is a ſtinking thing; ſo our ſinnes ſtinke in the noſtrils of
God.<note place="margin">3</note> Thirdly, they toyle with their horne and annoy the water; So
wicked men are turbulent,<note place="margin">4</note> (as <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſpeakes.) Fourthly, they will
feede on the toppe of the Rockes, they cannot abide to feede on the
Plaines; ſo they will bee in the darke places of the Scripture, they will
not feede in the plaine places where Gods people feede; but are full of
wranglings and janglings which profit not.</p>

               <p>Now this conviction ſhall be <hi>in laying open of all our ſins and offences,</hi> for
there be a number of ſinnes that we have committed, which wee doe not
know (the devill doth ſo blinde our eyes that we cannot ſee them) but at
that time all ſhall be made patent and open; there is no ſinne that we have
committed all our life long, but it ſhall come into our minde as freſh as if
we had committed them at the preſent, and ten thouſand of ſinnes which
we tooke to be no ſinnes, then we ſhall know them to be ſinnes, and thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
thouſands that we have forgot ſhall come into our mindes, and then
we ſhall know how we have offended God, and injuried our brethren, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed
his judgements, and abuſed his mercies; theſe ſinnes and a thouſand
others, which wee thinke not on at that very time, ſhall come into our
mindes, and or hearts ſhall frame ſuch a bill againſt us, as we ſhall be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
able to anſwer, howſoever now they be cloſe and covered: wee ſee in
experience of nature,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> if a man write a faire peece of paper with the juyce
of a Lemman or an Onion, there will be nothing ſeene, but bring it to the
light of a candle, or to the flame of the fire, and then all the letters will be
ſeene, and it may be read; ſo it is with ſinne, ſome men write it with ſuch
a cunning pen that none can diſcover it, the paper (their fore-heads) is
faire and cleane, but bring it to the flame of Gods wrath and to the bright
candle of Gods Law, and then all the uglineſſe of their ſins ſhall be laid o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen.
Hence the uſe is:</p>
               <p>Seeing there ſhall be ſuch a conviction at the day of Iudgement,<note place="margin">Vſe</note> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
how carefull ought we to be to live well, becauſe all the ſinnes we have
done ſhall then be laid open before us; ſo <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Eccleſiaſt.</hi> 12. 13.
<hi>Feare God and keepe his Commandements, for this is the whole duty of man; for
God will bring every worke to judgement, with every ſecret thing, whether it be
good or bad:</hi> Therefore, becauſe every ſinne ſhall be knowne, how carefull
ſhould we be to pleaſe God? If a man ſhould think nothing, ſpeak nothing,
nor doe nothing,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> but it ſhould be cried up and downe in the next Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>towne,
he would take heed what he thought, ſpake, and did; it ſhould be
much more the care of Chriſtians to take heed what they thinke, ſpeake,
and doe, for it ſhall be proclaimed in the Theater of this world, before
all men; neither ſhall any part of their actions (though never ſo cloſely
acted)<note place="margin">Simile.</note> lye hid and not be manifeſted; <hi>Gen.</hi> 44. when <hi>Ioſephs</hi> brethren did
goe out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> they went in peace, and all was well, becauſe their ſacks
were ſhut up; O, but when they were made after, and the ſackes opened,
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:17958:225"/>
and <hi>Ioſeph</hi> cup found in one of their ſackes, then they rent their clothes,
and tooke on pitifully; ſo it is with a number of men in this world, when
they die and goe out of this world, they goe with peace, becauſe their
ſackes, their conſciences be ſhut, they doe not reprove them; O, but when
the Lord ſhall open their conſciences, when their ſackes ſhall be opened,
then ſee what a deale of bad ſtuffe there is in them: therefore we ſhould
take heed what we gather into our ſacks:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> As it is in the ſtory of <hi>Aeſop,</hi> his
maſter beat him for eating of figs, but he deſired his maſter before he beat
him, to give unto every one of his fellowes a draught of warme water,
which his maſter did, and they did vomit up the figs againe, whereby the
falſe accuſation laid unto <hi>Aeſop</hi> was diſcovered; ſo it is in this world, there
be figs eaten, and ſome ſay this man hath eaten them, and ſome ſay that
man, and no body knowes who hath the figs; There is ſomething taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
injury and wrong done, this man is blamed and that man; well, the
Lord ſhall give us ſuch a heavie draught at the day of Iudgement, that we
ſhall vomit up all the ſinnes that be in the ſecret corners of our hearts, and
then will be ſeene who hath eaten the figges, who hath had this thing and
that, hereby is manifeſt that there will be a day when the wicked ſhall be
convicted, and all their ſins laid open: therefore we muſt take heed what
we doe, and ſpeake, and thinke;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> we ſee in the ſtory of <hi>Iaakoh, Gen.</hi> 31. when
he fled into <hi>Aſſyria, Lahan</hi> made after him, and when hee had overtaken
him, he went into his tent, and did ſearch to ſee if he could finde any thing
that was his; which if hee had found, hee would have carried all backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
ſo when we flie away from the devill, he will make after and ſearch
us, to ſee whether we have gotten any thing of his, he would make us his
bond-ſlaves, carry us into bondage, into hell: and therefore conſider what
yee gather, and what yee take into your packes.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>The meanes by which they ſhall bee convicted,</hi> ſhall bee by ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the bookes,<note place="margin">The meanes of their convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> which we are not to take literally, that they be paper
or parchment bookes, but it is a metaphor taken from earthly <hi>Iudges,</hi> who
reade all their Indictments out of a booke;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſo all our ſinnes ſhall be laid
open before us, as if they were written in a booke, not by any report,
or ſurmiſes of others: Wee finde in Scripture mention made of two
bookes:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The booke of Gods remembrance.<note place="margin">Two bookes ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at the day of Judgement. Firſt, the booke of Gods remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.</note>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. The booke of every mans conſcience.</item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, there is no ſinne that we doe commit, but it is written</hi> in Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance,
<hi>howſoever wee may forget them, and make little account of
them, yet the Lord will remember them: So we ſee</hi> Hoſ. 7. 2. And they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
not in their hearts, that I remember all their wickedneſſe; and <hi>Malach.</hi> 3.
14. <hi>wee may ſee how the wicked did ſcoffe at the godly, and ſaid,</hi> It is in
vaine to ſerve God, and what profit is it that we keepe his Commandements? &amp;c.
Then ſpake they that feared the Lord, every one to his neighbour, and the Lord
harkened and heard it, and a booke of remembrance was written before him, for
them that feared the Lord and thought upon his name. Now as the Lord hath
a booke written of the good deeds of his ſervants to remember them, ſo it
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:17958:226"/>
is certaine that he hath a booke of remembrance to record all the deeds of
the wicked in.</p>
               <p>The ſecond booke,<note place="margin">Secondly, the booke of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> 
                  <hi>is the booke of every mans conſcience;</hi> For there is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
a fin we commit, but it is written in our conſciences, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 15. <hi>Their
conſcience bearing witneſſe, and their thoughts accuſing one another, and excuſing
at that day, when God ſhall judge the ſecrets of men by Ieſus Christ:</hi> So their
conſcience is a witneſſe to them, whether they have done well or ill.</p>
               <p>Now againſt theſe two bookes no man can take exception:<note place="margin">No exception againſt th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſe bookes.</note> Firſt, they
cannot take exception againſt the booke of <hi>Gods remembrance,</hi> becauſe
God cannot remember that which never was: for he is <hi>prima veritas,</hi> the
fountaine of truth, and therefore he is not capable of any untruth, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
lye like to us:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> As the Sunne is the fountaine of light, and therefore is
not capable of any darkneſſe; and the fire is the fountaine of heat, and
therefore is not capable of cold, ſo God is the fountaine of all truth, and
therefore he is not capable of any untruth; and therefore againſt this booke
no man can take exception: againe, <hi>Philoſophers</hi> ſay, That which is never
done, and that which is falſe, cannot be remembred nor come into minde,
much leſſe then can God remember it, who is moſt true in himſelfe; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
againſt the booke of Gods remembrance no man can take exception:
Neither can any againſt the booke of <hi>mans conſcience,</hi> becauſe he ſhall not
be judged by another mans conſcience, but by his owne, which no other
man hath the writing of but himſelfe, and whereſoever a man goes he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
carries it with him; therefore againſt this booke no man living can
take exception: theſe be the two bookes that ſhall be opened at the day
of Iudgement, wherein every mans ſinnes ſhall be made knowne, and laid
open at that day, howſoever wee may forget them, yet the Lord will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
them, howſoever he paſſeth by them now, and ſeemes to winke
at them, yet they are all written in the booke of his remembrance, and one
day this booke ſhall be opened, and the world ſhall ſee them, for the Lord
will ſet them open before all men: It is ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 21. <hi>But I will reprove
thee, and ſet them in order before thine eyes;</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90. 6. the Prophet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines,
<hi>Thou haſt ſet our iniquities before thee, and our ſecret ſinnes in the light
of thy countenance:</hi> So out of the booke of Gods remembrance, the Lord
will declare all our ſinnes.</p>
               <p>Againe, the booke of every mans conſcience ſhall be opened, and his
conſcience ſhall accuſe him of every particular ſinne that he hath commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
here in this world:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> A mans conſcience is like a ſealed booke, though
he have committed a number of ſinnes, and have offended many wayes,
yet the consſcience never accuſes; but when the bookes ſhall be opened,
then every mans conſcience ſhall crie out againſt him, how he hath ſinned
against God, and againſt men in this thing and that, in this place and that,
and the devill will draw ſuch a bill againſt us, as we ſhall never be able to
anſwer;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> as the Lepers ſaid in the 2 <hi>King.</hi> 7. <hi>O we doe not well to doe thus;</hi> So
every mans conſcience ſhall crie out againſt him, and ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I did not well to
ſweare, to lye, to deceive, to ſlander, to prophane the Sabbath; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
what a fearefull thing will it be, when a mans conſcience ſhall thus
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:17958:226"/>
crie out againſt him; wee ſee what an intolerable burthen it is, when in
this world the Lord touches a mans conſcience but for one ſinne; as <hi>Mat.</hi>
27. 3. when <hi>Iudas</hi> had betrayed his Maſter,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and his conſcience touched him
for it, he could not abide it, but he went and hanged himſelfe: Now if it
were thus into lerable for one ſinne, what will it be, when all our ſinnes ſhal
be made manifeſt before God?<note place="margin">Simile.</note> If it were thus fearefull, when <hi>Iudas</hi> did
reade but one page or leafe of the booke, what an intolerable burthen will
it be, when all the particular ſinnes that we have committed from the firſt
day to the laſt houre of our lives ſhall bee laid open? when wee ſhall not
reade a leafe or a page onely, but all the whole booke from end to end,
how intollerable and unſupportable will it be? Some uſe to ſay that they
doe not love to come on the ſcore, they cannot abide it; but of all ſcores,
take heed thou come not on Gods ſcore,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and on the ſcore of thine owne
conſcience, it will be a fearefull thing; therefore keepe an even reckoning
with God, that ſo thy conſcience may be cleare. And theſe be the meanes
by which the offender ſhall be convicted at the day of Iudgement; firſt, <hi>by
the booke of Gods remembrance;</hi> and ſecondly, by <hi>the booke of every mans

from Chriſt; and although they had their ſinnes and infirmities as other
men had, yet becauſe they did repent of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> labour to be reconciled, and
to be at peace with God, therefore they ſhall not anſwer for them, as <hi>Rom.</hi>
8. 33. ſaith Saint <hi>Paul, Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods choſen?

godly, <hi>Theſe are they which came out of great tribulation, and have waſhed their
long white robes in the bloud of the Lambe:</hi> They were not white by nature,
no, nor did they not keepe them white, the beſt men that were; For (as

therefore although wee have ſinnes as other men have, yet let us labour
to repent of them, and to bee reconciled unto God, and to lay hold on
Chriſt by faith, and to have our conſciences waſhed in the bloud of Chriſt,
and then our ſinnes ſhall not be laid to our charge, we ſhall not be convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted

he ſhould <hi>finiſh tranſgression, and make an end of ſins, and make reconciliation
for iniquitie;</hi> which is a metaphore taken from a man that hath payed a
debt,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> he gets the bonds and bils, and ſeales them up that no body ſhould
ſee them; ſo Chriſt hath payed our debts, and hath ſealed up our ſinnes;
which is a comfort to a Chriſtian, though hee hath committed many
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:17958:227"/>
ſinnes, yet if hee can repent of them, and lay hold on Chriſt by faith,
his ſinnes are ſealed up, with this ſame great ſeale, that neither the devill

<hi>yee ſhall ſee me no more henceforth, till that yee ſay, Bleſſed is he that commeth in

followed their counſell, and that we had beene ruled by them, and (as it
is in the booke of <hi>Wiſdome) This is he which we have had in deriſion, and in
a parable of reproch,</hi> we fooles thought his life madneſſe, and his end with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

ſhall the wicked be, in that they ſhall deſire <hi>the hils to fall upon them, and
to cover them from the preſence of Christ;</hi> as it is, <hi>Revel.</hi> 6. and what a griefe
will it be to them to ſee the godly goe to heaven, into joy and happineſſe,
when they muſt be tormented in hell? <hi>Philoſophers</hi> ſay, <hi>That no Element

                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> as let a man be in the bottome of the Sea, and

So we muſt doe at theſe times, when the Sabbath commeth lay
aſide our labours, and performe the dutie that God requireth at our

               <p>Now concerning the laſt Iudgement, we are come to the laſt point;
the last day we ſpake of the <hi>Conviction</hi> of the offenders, that all the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
ſhall be convicted of all their ſinnes that they have committed; and
then ſhall come <hi>the ſentence of the Iudge,</hi> which will be moſt joyfull and
welcome to the godly, and dolefull, heavie and unwelcome to the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.
In the ſentence of the Iudge we obſerve three things:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The Quality of the ſentence.</item>
                  <item>2. The Order of the ſentence.</item>
                  <item>3. The Sentence it ſelfe.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>The qualitie of the Sentence,</hi> that it is the finall and laſt ſentence,
becauſe it ſhall be the laſt which ſhall be pronounced:<note place="margin">The qualitie of the ſentence.</note> therefore it ſhall
be unrevocable, for looke how the ſentence paſſeth, ſo we ſhal be found
in weale or in woe for ever and ever, never to be altered and changed:
As long as we live here,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> we may finde mercie and favour with God, if
we repent our ſinnes, lay hold on Chriſt by faith, and be brought into
an eſtate of grace; yea, and although it be but the day before this judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:17958:228"/>
come, but if once the ſentence be paſſed, all mercy is excluded, and
the gates of heaven and Hell ſhall be ſhut up, and every man ſhall be ſo
found in weale or woe, for ever &amp; ever to abide and continue. We ſee the
five <hi>fooliſh virgins,</hi> came &amp; knocked at the gate, but becauſe they came too
late they were excluded;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſo likewiſe <hi>Eſau,</hi> ſought the bleſſing, and that with
teares, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. and yet went without it becauſe he ſought it not in time;
this time of life is the time of <hi>Mercy</hi> and grace, therefore we muſt ſeeke it
in this world, for it will be too late when once the ſentence of the judge
ſhall be pronounced:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> It is a fit reſemblance, as long as a man hath a ſtone
in his hand to fling, he may incline the motions thereof this way and that
way, but if it be once throwne then he cannot; ſo as long as we live here we
may diſpoſe of our ſelves, this way or that way, but if once the finall ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of the Iudge be out, it cannot be revoked or altered; therefore it is
good to repent as ſoone as may be, and to lay hold on Gods mercy, offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in Chriſt.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> One compares the time of life to a drawbridge, if a man
ſhould make a goodly houſe, with gardens and walkes, and all things
needfull for it, and make a drawbridge to it; and this ſhould be the order
of the houſe, that when the drawbridge were downe every man that would
come might dwell there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but if they did attend their profit and pleaſure,
till the bridge were drawen up, that there were no way to enter in, they
ſhould be excluded; ſo men may enter into the Kingdome of God, in this
life, as long as the drawbridge is downe, that is, as long as there is life, but
if the drawbridge be once taken up, that is, if this life be once ended and
the ſentence pronounced, it will bee too late to enter, all such loyterers
ſhall be excluded and ſhut out. Therefore while we live heere it muſt be
our wiſedome to repent of our Sinnes, to ſeeke for Gods favor in Chriſt,
for if once the finall and laſt ſentence be pronounced it can never be altered
and changed: this is the qualitie of the ſentence.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>The Order of the Sentence;</hi> For the order of the ſentence, it is
firſt pronounced to the <hi>juſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Order of it.</note> 
                  <hi>Come yee bleſſed,</hi> and then to the wicked, <hi>goe ye
curſed.</hi> Divers Divines doe diverſly conceive of this, ſome thinke that
the reaſon why the ſentence is pronounced firſt to the juſt, is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <note place="margin">Divers opinions.</note> becauſe the
Lord is more inclined to mercy than to judgment,<note place="margin">1</note> as <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. <hi>he will
gather his corne into his barne, and then he will burne the chaffe with unquench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
fire:</hi> So becauſe that the Lord is more inclined to workes of mercy,
which is most agreeable to his nature, than to workes of juſtice; this ſome
thinke to be the reaſon why ſentence is pronounced to the godly firſt.</p>
               <p>There be others thinke that the Reaſon why the ſentence is pronounced
to the godly firſt is,<note place="margin">2</note> that it might be for the more comfort of the juſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they ſhould not be terrified with the terrible and dreadfull ſentence
pronounced against the wicked, when he ſhall chaſe and drive them all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Hell: So it is out of the tenderneſſe of Chriſt, that ſentence is given to

to the godly firſt: Now that the Saints ſhall judge the World,
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:17958:228"/>
it is plaineby Scripture, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. Chriſt ſaith, that <hi>they which follow

Tribes of Iſrael;</hi> ſo alſo 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 6. 2. (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>doe ye not know
that the Saints ſhall judge the world?</hi> and againe in the 3 verſ. <hi>know ye not, that

with him: which cannot but be a marvellous comfort to a Chriſtian,
though the world take upon them to cenſure their care, zeale, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
now, yet one day they ſhall be Iudges of ſuch worldly caitiffes, ſo
that they which have judged others, that is, the Saints, ſhall be judged of

did know that the Saints ſhould judge them, it would make them wary
what they did to them, and carefull to use them more kindly, for how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever

Chriſt calls us to come unto him, here in this world, to come to him by
Repentance, faith and Obedience, and then we may boldly come unto
him at the day of judgment: every man could be contented to come to
Chriſt in the Kingdome of glory, but first we muſt come to him here in the
Kingdome of grace, by repentance, faith, obedience and the like, and then
we ſhall be ſure to come to him in the Kingdome of glory; for no man
comes to him in the Kingdome of glory,<note place="margin">2</note> but by the Kingdome of grace.<note place="margin">The commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>

               <p>Secondly, <hi>The Commendation;</hi> This is layd down in theſe words, <hi>Ye bleſſed
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:17958:229"/>
of my Father:</hi> O you be the bleſſed, that heare me, you that have repented
of your ſinnes, that have faith and obedience, that make conſcience of your
wayes; you be the happy men, and women; here is the glory of the Saints
that in the theater of this world they ſhall bee pronounced bleſſed and
happy by the mouth of Chriſt before Angels and men in the hearing of
the whole world. Now this is to be oppoſed againſt all the judgments of
this world, for the world counts him a bleſſed and a happy man that is
rich, that hath his barnes full of corne, that hath a great deale of Land and
money; O<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but indeed he is the bleſſed and happy man that is in favour
with God, hath repented of his ſinnes, made conſcience of his wayes; and
therefore why doe men ſo dote on this world, to rake and gather to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
a deale of pelfe, that will not ſtand them in ſtead, at that day? Then
they ſhall ſee, that the godly man, is the bleſſed and happy man, and that
a dramme of Religion and of true ſaving faith is better than all the world
beſides; and will doe them more good.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> If a man were to goe into <hi>France,</hi>
and did heare that the coine in this Land would not goe there he would
goe and change all his money for the coine of that country; ſo ſeeing
we are to goe into another countrey, where our goods, lands and money
will not goe, let us labour to change all that we have for that which will
paſſe at that day, let us get repentance, faith and ſanctified grace, and then
we ſhall finde comfort, when this whole world will afford us none. Now
when the godly be pronounced happy and bleſſed by Chriſt, then all the
wicked ſhall be driven to Hell, where they ſhall goe to paines and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and this ſhall make their happineſſe the greater, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 4, 5.
when the Angel of God came downe from heaven and appeared in glory,
<hi>the keepers were aſtonied and became as dead men. But the Angel anſwered and

on <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> and did advance him, yet he kept the Kingdome to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
none might ſit on the Throne but the King; but here is the bounty of
Chriſt, that hee beſtowes a Kingdome on his ſervants: It was a large
proffer that <hi>Ahaſhueroſh</hi> made <hi>Heſter</hi> 5. 6. in that hee <hi>would give Hester one
halfe of his Kingdome;</hi> but God hath made a larger promiſe to us, not that
wee ſhall have one halfe of his Kingdome, but he will give us his whole
Kingdome. We read <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 13. <hi>There was a Man that came to Chriſt, and
ſaid unto him, Maſter, bid my brother divide the inheritance with me:</hi> but Chriſt
will not divide his Kingdome to his ſervants, but will give it whole and
the glory of it to them: therefore men muſt labour to become converted
and bee the ſervants of God, becauſe he will beſtow a Kingdome on them.
Moſt men will labour and toyle in this world for leſſe matters than a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
ſome are ſcattered all the world over to gather ſtraw and ſtubble,
as the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were, and therefore how much more ſhould men
labour to repent of their ſinnes, to get faith in Chriſt, to become one of
Gods ſervants, and then he will beſtow a Kingdome on them. But ſome
man may be ready to ſay, although it be a Kingdome that God will give
his people, yet it may be ſo meane as it is not worth the labour of obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
therefore Chriſt tels us what a Kingdome it is; it is <hi>an heavenly King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
a Kingdome prepared of God:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Three properties of the Kingdome of heaven.</note> So it is ſuch a Kingdome as is worth all

founders were, the more excellent were their countries and Kingdomes;
which granted, it muſt neceſſarily follow, that becauſe no mans wiſedome
is able to compare with Gods wiſedome, no power with his power, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as much as he wiſedome of God goes beyond the wiſedome of
men, and his power beyond the power of men, and heaven beyond this

Kingdomes of this world.</p>
               <p>

               <p>I anſwer,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> by an <hi>Opticke Rule; becauſe things that bee afar off ſeeme to bee but
ſmall, and things that bee nigh ſeeme great:</hi> Therefore becauſe men dwell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the Kingdomes of this world &amp; touch them, &amp; are far off from this

<pb n="450" facs="tcp:17958:231"/>
his ſtanding, and get within the Clouds, and draw neere to God, then
it will bee great in his eyes, and hee ſhall ſee it doth excell all the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
of the World: The Vſes hereof are theſe following:</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> ſeeing this kingdome excels all the kingdomes of this world,
therefore wee have a better eſtate by Chriſt,<note place="margin">Our eſtate bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than Adams in ſixe things.</note> and greater honour than
ever we loſt by <hi>Adam.</hi> For firſt, we loſt by him Paradiſe, but by <hi>Chriſt</hi>
we have Heaven. Secondly,<note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>Adam</hi> was lord onely of the <hi>Earth,</hi> and
we of heaven. Thirdly, he had it but on his good behavior, we ſhal have
it without condition.<note place="margin">2</note> Fourthly, he lived amongſt Beaſts and Birds, and
we ſhall live amongſt the Angels.<note place="margin">3</note> Fifthly, he had the preſence of God
but by fits,<note place="margin">4</note> and we ſhall enjoy it continually. Sixthly, when hee had all
thing he had neede of a help,<note place="margin">5</note> but God ſhall be all in all to us. Therefore
as a learned man ſaith,<note place="margin">6</note> O happy fall of Man, that wee have received all
this good by. This therefore may ſerve to informe our judgement, that
we may ſee that our eſtate by Chriſt, is better than that which <hi>Adam</hi>
loſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> ſeeing this Kingdome excels all the kingdomes in this
World, why doe not men ſeeke and labour after it? as <hi>Iudg.</hi> 18. 9. there
were ſpies ſent to diſcover the land, who came and told the people the
land was a good land, and ſaid to them, <hi>Why ſit you ſtill, and why are you
ſlothfull to enter in,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> 
                  <hi>and poſſeſſe the land?</hi> So ſeeing all the Patriarkes and
Prophets, and Apoſtles, and Chriſt himſelfe, are the ſpies of this good
land, and they tell us that Heaven is a good land, and excels all the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
of this World, why doe ye ſit ſtill, and why are yee ſlothfull, to
enter in and to poſſeſſe it? This is the uſe that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> makes of it,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 28. <hi>Wherefore ſeeing wee receive a kingdome that cannot be ſhaken, Let
us have grace whereby wee may ſerve God acceptably,</hi> with reverence and
godly feare: therefore ſeeing it is not a mutable and a changeable king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
as the beſt kingdomes are in this World, why doe we not labor
to pleaſe God, to ſpend our time well here, attend him that wee may
have it, and enjoy this kingdome? We ſee what labour and paines men
will take for leſſe matters than a kingdome; for a little foode and ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
how early men riſe in the morning, and goe late to bed, to get
in a little corne, and men doe well in it; much more ſhould wee labour
and take paines, that we may enjoy this Heavenly Kingdome.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Vſe 3.</note> ſeeing this Kingdome excels all the kingdomes of this
world, therefore Chriſtians must comfort themſelves with the hope of
this, though they be meane and poore, and it may bee have not houſe
or land, yet let them comfort themſelves I ſay, with the hope of this,
that God will bestow a kingdome that doth far excell all the kingdoms
of this World, if they can repent of their ſinnes, have ſaith in Chriſt,
if they walke with care and conſcience before him; therefore let every
Chriſtian ſtay himſelfe, with the hope of this, and let us enter into the
veile, and lay hold with the <hi>Anchors of the Soule;</hi> as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 19. <hi>To hold faſt the hope that is ſet before us, which we have as an A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>chor
of the Soule, both ſure and ſtedfaſt, and which entereth into that within the
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:17958:231"/>
veile.</hi> Saint <hi>Baſill</hi> ſaith, The hope of reward will carry us through any
affliction in this World with comfort; art thou afraide of ſhame and
reproach for the Goſpell ſake? God will grace thee before men and
Angels: art thou afraid thou ſhalt loſe thy friends? God will bee thy
friend: art thou affraid thou ſhalt loſe thy goods, and thy wealth?
God will beſtow Heaven on thee: therefore thinke on the riches that
God hath prepared for thee: thus every Chriſtian muſt comfort him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
with the hope of Heaven.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> it is no meane kingdome, because <hi>it is prepared for his cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
and Elect.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A kingdome prepared for his Elect.</note> The kingdome of this World God hath prepared for the
good and the bad both together; therefore ſometimes wicked kings
doe raigne; but this kingdome he hath prepared for ſanctified and holy
people onely; as <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. <hi>Except a man be borne againe a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e cannot enter into the Kingdome of God;</hi> So this kingdome he hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for the Elect onely: <hi>David</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 111. 5. <hi>He hath given a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to them that feare him.</hi> We ſee this World that God hath made it
for good and bad, how it is walled in with the ſea, and covered with
the Heavens, and the Sunne and Moone and Starres to give us light;
Birds, Fiſhes and Beaſts to feede us, with Trees and Plants for the uſe
of us: O but it is a ſpeciall portion that hee will beſtow on them that
feare him: therefore when we looke on the kingdomes of this World,
we may ſay, this is not the kingdome that God hath prepared for his
Elect and choſen onely; but together with them for his enemies alſo;
but there is a glorious Kingdome, that God hath prepared onely
for his Elect and choſen, and therefore why doe we not gather up our
hearts, and labour for it? It is the madneſſe of the World to ſpend all
their ſtrength in labouring after toyes and trifles; <hi>Naboth</hi> would not
part with his poſſeſſions;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> 
                  <hi>God forbid</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that I ſhould part with the
inheritance of my father,</hi> or <hi>the Lord keepe me from giving the inheritance of
my father;</hi> ſo we ſhould ſay, when wee meete with temptations in the
world to draw us out of this way; Lord, keepe me from giving the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
of my father:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> 
                  <hi>Eſau</hi> is condemned by the mouth of all men,
for that he ſold his birthright for a meſſe of pottage, ſo how worthily
ſhall many a one bee condemned, that will ſell heaven for a little plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
and profit, for a penny or a halfepenny matter, for a little beere, or
for a draught of ſtrong drinke; even for toyes and trifles.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>it was prepared for the Elect before the foundation of the world;</hi>
for before we were,<note place="margin">It was prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of old.</note> God loved us and prepared this kingdome for us,
before we looked on the Sunne he did regard us, therefore it was not
our merits, that was the cauſe why God did beſtow this kingdome on
us, but his free love in Chriſt which makes the gift the greater: 1
<hi>Sam.</hi> 25. ſaith <hi>Nabal, Shall I take my bread and my water, and my fleſh that I
have killed for my ſhearers, and give it to men whom I know not?</hi> I, but heere
is the love of God, that when wee were ſtrangers and enemies unto
him, then he prepared heaven for us: it is a good ſaying that a learned
man hath; when I had no beginning, thou thoughteſt on mee, and
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:17958:232"/>
when I was nothing thou did'ſt prepare for mee, and therefore it was
nothing in my ſelfe that was the cauſe of it, but it was thy mercy and
goodneſſe to me.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Secondly, the title and tenour.</note> in the <hi>Aſsignation,</hi> wee conſidered the title to his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:
it is a title of <hi>Inheritance,</hi> therefore it is the beſt title and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure,
and the ſureſt, that any man can hold by, for ſo long as a man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
ſo long his inheritance holds good, if hee could live for ever and
ever therefore ſeeing we ſhall have it by ſuch a tenure, wee may aſſure
our ſelves we ſhall have it for ever and ever. And here wee may with
holy admiration admire Gods mercies to us, as 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 18. <hi>David</hi>
doth admire Gods kindeneſſe to him, <hi>Who am I Lord God, and what is my
Fathers houſe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> 
                  <hi>that thou haſt brought mee hitherto? and yet was this a ſmall
thing in thy ſight, O Lord God; but thou haſt ſpoken alſo of thy ſervants houſe
for a long time to come:</hi> ſo wee may much more admire the goodneſſe
and the kindneſſe of God to us, in that he hath prepared, ſuch a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
for us; we may ſay as <hi>David</hi> ſaid, Lord God who am I, and what
is my fathers houſe? I am but a poore ſinfull man, and thou haſt ſpoken
of thy ſervants houſe for a great while: and wee muſt ſtirre up our
ſelves to looke after it, and to take heede we be not carried away with
the ſtreame of corruption: therefore <hi>Augustine</hi> ſaith well; Lord, I
am contented to endure any torture or any paine, to indure impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or the racke, or whipping or burning, ſo that I might bee but in
heaven one day; in like manner ſhould wee bee contented to endure
trouble and paine a little while heere, that wee may bee in heaven for
ever and ever.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> So none but violent people can get heaven; it is a metaphore ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

yea, although hell lay in our way, we ſhould breake thorow it and goe

Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> ſaith, It is a great labour to goe to heaven, but the reward
is greater, for they ſhall be where all the Patriarkes, Prophets, Apoſtles,

ſo it is no leſſe matter that God will beſtow on his people than a
kingdome.</p>
               <p>Now we come to the fourth thing obſerved in the ſentence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muneration;<note place="margin">4</note>
the Reaſon of it,<note place="margin">The reaſon of the Aſſignation.</note> 
                  <hi>For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat,
I thirſted, and ye gave me drinke; I was a ſtranger, and yee lodged me: I was

as you have done it to my ſervants, and to my members, you have done it

to me.</hi> So, <hi>this is the Reaſon of the Aſsignement.</hi> The Popiſh Church lay
hold on theſe words,<note place="margin">Object.</note> and would prove thereby that their workes merit
at the hands of God, becauſe Chriſt gives heaven to thoſe that doe

To which I answer,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> although this be the reaſon,<note place="margin">Workes not the couſe of our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining heaven.</note> why the Lord aſſignes

                  </gap>ow this gift ſhewes, who be the ſubjects of the
King, and who be the enemies: So at the laſt day, when the good and

why I beſtow heaven on you, becauſe I was hungry, and yee gave mee
meat; this is not the cauſe of it, but it ſhewes onely who be the perſons
that God hath aſſigned heaven to, to thoſe that love him and regard
him in his members: therefore one ſayes well, Chriſt ſhewes not for
what he beſtowes heaven in this place, but on what kinde of perſons he
will beſtow it: And <hi>Chryſostome</hi> ſaith, though the Saints doe a thouſand
ſuch things as theſe, yet they deſerve nothing at the hands of God, it is
his bountie to beſtow heaven on them for ſo ſmall and meane things as

to us. And there be foure grounds for it:</p>
               <p>The first ground<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>

                  <note place="margin">Reaſon 1.</note> 
                  <hi>all are ſervants:</hi>
Therefore, whatſoever we doe is but our dutie, and if it be our duty we
cannot merit any thing at the hand of God: So ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 17.
10. <hi>When yee have done all theſe things which are commanded you, ſay, We are
unprofitable ſervants, we have done that which was our dutie to doe:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

                  </gap>w, that wee
cannot merit any thing at the hands of God: And <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaith, No
man is able to ſhew ſuch an holy converſation of life, to deſerve any
thing at the hands of God, but when he hath done all, he is but an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
ſervant.</p>
               <p>The Papiſts reply against this,<note place="margin">Object.</note> and ſay, That although a man cannot
merit any thing being in the eſtate of a ſervant, yet if of a ſervant hee
become a friend, hee may merit: Now that hee may bee a friend, it
is plaine by the words of Chriſt, <hi>Iohn</hi> 15. 15. <hi>Hence call I you no ſervants,
for the ſervant knoweth not what his master doth, but I have called you friends;</hi>
and in the verſe before, <hi>Yee are my friends.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I anſwer,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> we are ſervants ſtill, though it pleaſe God to accept
of us as his friends; we are only made friends by acceptance in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Ieſus Chriſt, which alters not the former condition of duty and
ſervice, as may be proved by theſe places, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 18. <hi>Being then made
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:17958:233"/>
free from ſinne, yee are made the ſervants of righteouſneſſe:</hi> and in the 1 <hi>Pet.</hi>
2. 16. he exhorteth them, <hi>As free, and not uſing the libertie for a cloake
of maliciouſneſſe, but as the ſervants of God:</hi> And Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15. 19.
<hi>Yee are my friends, if yee doe whatſoever I command you:</hi> therefore, becauſe
we be ſervants ſtill, and remaine in the ſame eſtate and condition, wee
cannot merit any thing; but when wee have done all, wee doe but our
dutie.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ground is,<note place="margin">Reason 2.</note> 
                  <hi>our owne impotencie, that we are not able to doe any
good thing of our ſelves;</hi> much leſſe can wee merit anything: Now that
we can doe no good thing, it is plaine by the Scriptures, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 10.
<hi>By the grace of God, I am that I am:</hi> And 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 5. ſaith he, <hi>Not that we
are ſufficient of our ſelves, to thinke any thing as of our ſelves, but our ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
is of God:</hi> So <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 13. <hi>For it is God that worketh in you both the will and
the dead, even of his good pleaſure.</hi> Now then if all we doe is by the power
of grace, and if it is God onely which worketh both the will and the
deed, then we are beholding to God for it, and God is not beholding
to us. <hi>Origen</hi> ſaith well, No workes of man can deſerve any thing at
Gods hand, becauſe they cannot thinke any good, or doe any good, but
it muſt be from God.</p>
               <p>The Papiſts reply and ſay,<note place="margin">Object.</note> that God may give a man grace which he
may ſo husband, as that hee may deſerve any thing at Gods hand; and
they make it plaine by this ſimilitude; A father gives a farme to his ſon,
and gives him a ſtocke, now the ſonne may ſo raiſe the ſtocke and play
the good husband, as he may purchaſe any thing that the father hath; in
like manner, ſay they, God may give a man grace, and hee may ſo huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
it, as he may purchaſe any thing at Gods hand.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> If a father ſhould give his ſonne a farme and a ſtock
to uſe, and when he had done ſo, his childe could not earne a penny, but
it muſt be the father, and the ſon could not ſtirre a foot or a hand, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the father, then the father is not beholding to the ſonne, but the ſon
to the father. This is the caſe betweene God and us, for when he gives
us any grace, he muſt give us a ſecond grace to uſe and to imploy it wel;
and therefore it is manifeſt we cannot merit any thing at Gods hands:
it is the doctrine of the Schoole-men, and <hi>Aquinas</hi> makes it plaine, hee
puts the queſtion and reſolves it; ſaith he, A man may receive a benefit
from another, and may deſerve it at his hands, as a man may give one
an houſe, which he may deſerve; but if a man when he hath given ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
an houſe, must give him alſo power to uſe the houſe, and wiſdome
to governe the ſame; that man cannot be beholding to him that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives,
but the receiver muſt needs be beholding to him that gave it;
ſo although God give a man grace, which he cannot uſe well, unleſſe he
alſo give him power to uſe it: Therefore God is not beholding to us for
any thing, but we are to God; and therefore we cannot merit any thing
at Gods hands.</p>
               <p>The third ground is,<note place="margin">Reaſon 3.</note> 
                  <hi>our imperfection, that in every thing we doe we ſinne
against God,</hi> and if we ſinne againſt him, then we cannot merit any thing
at his hand; it is the doctrine of their owne Schoole-men, that a ſinner
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:17958:234"/>
cannot merit, but we bee all ſinners againſt God; therefore we cannot
merit any thing. Now that we bee all ſinners it is plaine by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<hi>Iob</hi> 9. 3. <hi>If be would diſpute with him, hee could not anſwer him one of a
thouſand:</hi> So <hi>Lament.</hi> 3. 22. <hi>It is the Lords mercy that we are not conſumed, &amp;c.</hi>
Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> ſaith, Who is it that hath not ſinned? and if a man hath
broken but one of the Commandements, hee is guilty of the whole
Law; therefore no man can merit any thing at Gods hands.</p>
               <p>The fourth ground is,<note place="margin">Reaſon 4.</note> 
                  <hi>a diſproportion betweene our workes and Gods juſtice:</hi>
For <hi>merits are grounded on Commutative juſtice</hi> (as they ſay;) and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>
ſaith, That commutative juſtice is equally to give weight for weight, ſo
much for ſo much, but there is no proportion betweene our works and
Gods juſtice; for Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>that all the afflictions of this life, are not
worthy of the glory that ſhall be ſhewed to us, Rom.</hi> 8. 18. One ſaith well, if a
man ſhould ſuffer all the ſufferings that the people of God had done
from <hi>Adam</hi> till this preſent time, having all the vertues of the holy men;
yet he were not worthy of the glory of heaven; if a man ſhould live a
thouſand yeeres, and ſpend them all religiouſly, hee did not deſerve to
be in heaven halfe an houre:<note place="margin">Object.</note> To this the Papiſts have deviſed a ſubtill
anſwer, ſay they, It is in juſtice, that God ſhould give heaven to the beſt
men, not by a proportion, ſo much for ſo much, but becauſe God will
beſtow heaven on ſome body, therefore, it ſtands with the juſtice of
God, rather to beſtow it on the godly, than on the wicked, I anſwer,
this is ſophiſticall that tels us it is juſtice,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> that God ſhould give heaven
to ſome body; but what juſtice is it? it is not to give ſo much for ſo
much, weight for weight, <hi>It is not commutative,</hi> but <hi>diſtributive</hi> juſtice;
and therefore there is a diſproportion betweene our workes and Gods
juſtice. Againe, the Papiſts are overthrowne in their owne argument,
for they ſay, it was <hi>commutative juſtice,</hi> not by an <hi>Arithmeticall,</hi> but a <hi>Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metricall
proportion:</hi> I anſwer, <hi>commutative juſtice,</hi> to give weight for
weight, ſo much for ſo much, is not that, but it is according to <hi>diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
juſtice,</hi> not by Arithmeticall, but by a Geometricall proportion,
ſeeing he muſt give heaven, to give it to the beſt men: So the anſwer of
the Papiſt is ſophiſticall. Now in theſe, words are foure things to bee
obſerved:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That the Iudgement at the laſt day, ſhall paſſe according

looke what our workes be,<note place="margin">The judgement ſhall be accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to workes.</note> ſuch ſhall be the judgement that ſhall paſſe
on us: So <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 6. ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Who will reward every man according
to his workes;</hi> So alſo <hi>Revel.</hi> 20. 18. it is ſaid. <hi>And they were judged every
man according to their workes;</hi> And <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 36. ſaith Chriſt, <hi>But I ſay
unto you, that every idle word that men ſhall ſpeake, they ſhall give account there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
at the day of Iudgement:</hi> So then the judgement ſhall paſſe according
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:17958:234"/>
to works; but miſtake me not, I doe not ſay, <hi>according to the merit of our
workes,</hi> (for we deſerve nothing) <hi>but according to the qualitie of our workes:</hi>
Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> ſhewes out of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 7. It is one thing that God ſhould ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>for</hi> a mans workes, and another thing to render <hi>according</hi> to mans
workes. If God render according to a mans workes, then it will bee
well for good workes, and evill for evill workes.</p>
               <p>I, but here a queſtion may be made,<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> 
                  <hi>ſeeing wee ſhall be judged according

                  <note place="margin">Sol.</note> 
                  <hi>what ſhall faith doe then?</hi> I anſwere, Faith is all in all; for Faith
is propoſed as the price of our Redemption to the Iuſtice of God; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we are ſaved by Faith. And <hi>Acts</hi> 18. 31. it is ſaid, <hi>Beleeve in the

               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>It makes us the ſheepe of Chriſt,</hi> it gathers us to him, and ſets us at

Sonnes of God;<note place="margin">1</note> this is the power of Faith.<note place="margin">Properties of Faith.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>It makes our worke acceptable before God;</hi> as <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. it is ſaid,
<hi>By Faith Abel offered a greater ſacrifice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than Caine:</hi> ſo Faith makes our
workes acceptable before God. I, but ſeeing wee are ſaved by Faith,
<hi>why is there no mention of it then.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Queſt.</note> I anſwere, becauſe there ſhall bee a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
of the juſt judgement of God;<note place="margin">Sol.</note> Now Faith is ſecret in the
heart of a Man, and workes bee open, therefore a man ſhall not
bee judged, by the ſecret and hidden graces, that is in his heart,
but by the Effects and Fruits which are open and manifeſt to the
World.</p>
               <p>The uſe is, that ſeeing wee ſhall bee judged according to the fruites,
and not to the ſecret graces that are in us; therefore wee muſt joyne
to our faith good workes; for looke what our workes be, ſuch ſhall bee
the verdict that ſhall paſſe upon at that day; therefore <hi>Iames</hi> 2. (ſaith
he) <hi>O man ſhew me thy faith by thy workes:</hi> Thou ſayeſt thou haſt faith,
and thou talkeſt of faith, but let mee ſee it, let it appeare in thy life and

<hi>Chriſt ſaw their faith, and he healed them;</hi> Hee did not onely ſee with the
eyes of his Divinitie, but hee ſaw their faith by the effects and fruits of
it; for they laid the ſicke man on a bed, and did breake through the
roofe of the houſe, and let him downe to Chriſt: Therefore (as
one ſaies well) it is faith that is ſeene and viſible that ſaveth us,
not that which is ſecret and cloſe in the heart, but it muſt bee viſible
ſhewed by workes,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> 
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 27. <hi>Iſaac</hi> would not bleſſe <hi>Iaakob</hi> by the voyce,
or by his ſpeech, but hee feeles and handles him; and when hee found
they were <hi>Eſaus</hi> hands, he bleſſed him: ſo Chriſt will not bleſſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
by the voyce, when they ſhall ſay I am a Chriſtian, I am a profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor,
but he will handle them and feele them: If hee finde their hands to
be <hi>Eſaus</hi> hands; that is, his beloveds hands, that they have done good
and have beene open to the poore Saints, and ready to miniſter to their
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:17958:235"/>
neceſſities, then the Lord will bleſſe them and entertaine them into his

               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>All our good workes ſhall bee remembred and rewarded</hi> at the
day of judgement,<note place="margin">All good workes ſhall be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded.</note> and Chriſt will make rehearſall of them; there is
never a good deed we have done, but it ſhall be remembred and rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
ſo that our labour ſhall not bee in vaine, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
15. ult. ſo <hi>Revel.</hi> 20. 12. it is ſaid, <hi>And I ſaw the dead both great and ſmall
ſtand before God, and the bookes were opened, and another booke was opened,
which is the booke of Life, and the dead were judged of thoſe things which were
written in the bookes, according to their workes:</hi> So the Lord hath all the
good deeds of his ſervants written in a booke which ſhall bee remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred,
reported and rewarded: therefore what a comfort is this to a poor
Chriſtian, that in the hearing of all the world, all his good deeds ſhall
be reported: how many painefull Iourneyes they have taken to heare
the Word; how many houres they have ſpent in prayer; how many
teares they have wept for ſinne; that they have entertained the Saints,
that they have fed the hungry, cloathed the naked, viſited the ſicke;
what a great inticement this is to doe good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to thinke what honor it is?
that all their good deeds ſhall be remembred and rewarded; <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.
15. Chriſt ſaith of the woman when ſhe had powred the ointment on
him, that <hi>this which ſhee had done, ſhould bee ſpoken of her whereſoever this
Goſpell ſhall bee preached for a memoriall of her:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> But what is the ſpeech of
men to the ſpeech of Chriſt? the praiſe of men, to the praiſe of Chriſt?
when hee ſhall ſtand out and make a report of all our good deeds wee
have done; therefore what a comfort will this be?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I, but have not the people of God ſinne?</hi> I answer, they have their ſinnes,
and their great ſinnes too,<note place="margin">Object.</note> even the beſt men that be; but here is the
comfort:<note place="margin">Sol.</note> when the day of judgment commeth they ſhall not bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred,
but pardoned, and carried on the ſhoulders and necke of
Chriſt, and our good deeds onely ſhall be remembred. As <hi>Eſay</hi> 33. <hi>ult.</hi>
it is ſaid, <hi>The people that dwell therein, ſhall have their iniquity forgiven.</hi> So
<hi>Ieremie</hi> 31. 33, 34. ſaith the Lord, <hi>I will make a new Covenant with them,
and I will write my lawes in their hearts, and I will bee their God, and they ſhall
be my People; and they ſhall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every
man his brother, ſaying, Know the Lord: for they ſhall all know mee, from the
greateſt to the leaſt (ſaith the Lord) and I will forgive their iniquities, and will
remember their ſinnes no more.</hi> Here is the comfort of Chriſtians, that all
their ſinnes ſhall be forgotten, onely their vertues ſhall be remembred;
<hi>Exodus</hi> 34.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> 
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> put a <hi>veile</hi> on his face, that the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould
not ſee the glory of it; but Chriſt hath hanged a veile over our ſinnes,
that they ſhould not be ſeene, even his holineſſe and ſanctifie, that the
world ſhould not ſee nor behold them, for they are all pardoned, remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and covered with the Robe of his righteouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>the judgement which ſhall paſſe upon us ſhall bee</hi> according
to the workes of mercie,<note place="margin">The iudgement ſhall paſſe, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to workes of mercie.</note> 
                  <hi>and not only workes of mercie, but all other good
workes ſhall have a reward; as</hi> Malach. 3. 16. <hi>it is ſaid,</hi> Then ſpake they
that feared God, every one to his neighbour, and the Lord hearkened and heard
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:17958:235"/>
it; and a booke of remembrance was written before him, for them that feared
God, and thought upon his Name. <hi>So there was a booke written of all the
good deeds of them that did feare God: and ſo</hi> Matth. 5. 11, 12. <hi>ſaith
our Saviour,</hi> Bleſſed are ye when men revile you and perſecute you, and ſay all
manner of evill againſt you, for my Names ſake falſly: Rejoyce and bee glad, for
great is your reward in Heaven; <hi>as also</hi> Matth. 10. 32. Whoſoever ſhall confeſſe
me before men, him will I alſo confeſſe before my Father, which is in Heaven.
<hi>So then wee ſee all our good workes ſhall be rewarded.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But why doth Chriſt mention onely workes of mercie?<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> I anſwere,
there be two reaſons of it:<note place="margin">1</note> Firſt,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> becauſe the Lord doth not accept of
any worke we doe,<note place="margin">Why the Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment paſſes chiefly by works of mercie.</note> of hearing of the Word, of praying, nor of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
good dutie we doe, if wee doe not ſhew mercie and compaſſion to
our brethren. As 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 3. <hi>And though I feede the poore with all my goods,
and though I give my body that it bee burnt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>and have not love, it profiteth me
nothing:</hi> and <hi>Eſay</hi> 1. 14. ſaith God, <hi>My ſoule hateth your new Moones and
your appointed Feaſts; they are a burthen to me, I am wearie of bearing them:</hi>
and the reaſon was becauſe they did not ſhew compaſſion to their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
as may be gathered out of the 15. verſe. In like manner the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
bringeth in the people expoſtulating with God, and he anſwering
them, <hi>Eſay.</hi> 58. 3. <hi>Wherefore have we fasted and thou ſeeft not? wherefore have
we puniſhed our ſelves, and thou regardeſt is not, &amp;c? Is not this the fasting that
I have choſen, to looſe the bands of wickedneſſe, to take off the heavie burthens,
is let the oppreſſed goe free, and that ye breake every yoke?</hi> verſe 6, 7. <hi>Is it not
to breake thy bread to the hungrie, and that thou bring the poore that wander
unto thy houſe, and when thou ſeest the naked that thou cover him, and hide not
thy ſelfe from thine owne fleſh;</hi> and therefore wee may aſſure our ſelves the
Lord will accept of none of our workes, without we be mercifull to our
brethren.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> becauſe as it is <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6. 6. <hi>The Lord deſires mercy and not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice;</hi>
when both may ſtand together then God will have both: But if
they cannot, he will have mercy ſhewed; hee had rather loſe his owne
part, than a poore man ſhould loſe his. So the command is, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 16.<note place="margin">Gods mercie ſo great, that hee had rather a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate of his owne ſervice, than man want his comfort.</note>
                  <hi>But to doe good and to diſtribute, forget not, for with ſuch ſacrifices God is well
pleaſed:</hi> Such is the tenderneſſe of God, that hee is contented to abate
of his owne ſervice, rather than man ſhould want of his comfort. As
<hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 23. <hi>If thou bring thy gift to the Altar, and there remembreſt that
thy brother hath ought againſt thee; leave there thine offering before the Altar,
and goe thy way; firſt bee reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer
thy gift.</hi> Hence we ſee though it be a great dutie that we owe to God,
yet for mans good hee will bee contented to ſtay for his owne ſervice.
<hi>Philoſophers</hi> ſay,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> that the fire which is fartheſt remooved, is the hotteſt
and moſt vehement; ſo it is in love, that love which is furtheſt remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from God, is the hotteſt and the moſt vehement love of all other.
It is an eaſie matter to love God in himſelfe: O but for a man to love
God in his poore diſtreſſed members; to love him in his poore Saints
and People, this is the hotteſt love, and moſt difficult. Now ſince all
our good workes ſhall be remembred, and more eſpecially our workes
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:17958:236"/>
of mercie: Therefore it is a good thing for a man to feede the hungrie,
to cloth the naked, to viſit the ſicke: and let us meditate with our ſelves
in this caſe,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> as <hi>David</hi> ſaid, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 2. <hi>I dwell in a houſe of Cedar, and the
Arke of God remaines within curtaines;</hi> ſo we ſhould ſay I dwell in a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
houſe and many of Gods people have not a houſe to put their heads
in; I lie in a ſoft bed, when many of them have not a bed to lie on; I
have good food, when they have not a bit of bread to eate. So then
it is a good thing for a man to go out of himſelfe to conſider the wants
of other, and to ſhew mercy to them, eſpecially at this time, becauſe
God hath beene mercifull unto us, in giving us ſeaſonable times to inne
the fruits of the earth to our comfort, and <hi>giving to us the appointed
weekes of the harveſt,</hi> as <hi>Ierem.</hi> 5. and giving of us ſtrength to undergoe our
labours: we ſee <hi>Numb.</hi> 31. 49. when the captaines had beene at warre,
and were returned home againe,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> they muſter their men and finde not a
man loſt, therefore they bring an offering and offer it to the Lord in
thankefulneſſe for it: ſo we ſhould doe, every one looke into his family
and number his men, and when hee ſees that there is not one of them
hath miſcarried, but that he hath his number ſtill, give thankes to God
for it, and as God hath beene mercifull to us, ſo to bee mercifull to our
brethren.</p>
               <p>I, but ſome will ſay,<note place="margin">Object.</note> I am a poore man and cannot feede the hungry,
cloath the naked, nor (as Chriſt ſpeaketh) doe any great matter, what ſhall
I doe? I anſwer,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> that the leaſt and ſmalleſt matter that is done in true love
to Chriſt ſhall not want his reward, if it be but a draught of drinke, or vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
of the ſicke; ſo Chriſt ſhewes, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 42. <hi>And whoſoever ſhall give
unto one of theſe little ones a cup of cold water to drinke (onely in the name of a
Diſciple) verily (I ſay unto you) he ſhall not loſe his reward;</hi> ſo we ſee <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.
the <hi>poore widdow that cast into the treaſurie but two mites was more accepted
than them that caſt in of ſuperfluitie;</hi> it is not the great quantitie that is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,
but with what affection; for the ſmalleſt thing done Chriſt will
accept, if it be done in love. <hi>Exod.</hi> 35. we ſee the people brought gold and
ſilver, and braſſe and ſilke, ramskins and goates haire, and ſo forth, for the
building of the Tabernacle; <hi>Origen</hi> ſaith well on that place, Grant Lord
(ſaith he) that I may bee found to bring ſomething to the building of thy
Temple, that I may bee found to being a little gold to make the mercy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeate
on or the Arke, or to make the candleſtick, or a little ſilver to make
the pillars on, or a little braſſe to make the boſſes on, or a little ſilke to make
the curtaines on, a little goates haire, that ſo I may not be found empty to
have brought nothing to the building of thy ſpirituall Temple.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> So what a
griefe may it be (at that day) when Chriſt ſhall ſay; here is the gold, ſilver;
braſſe, ſilke or the goats haire that ſuch a man and ſuch a woman brought,
and I ſhall be found to bring nothing? what a ſhame and what a griefe (I
ſay) will this bee? therefore will I ever beſeech God to give me the grace
that I may be found able to bring ſomething and beſtow it on Gods ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
houſe, that it may bee a comfort to me at that day; and let every man
be exhorted to doe what they can out of true love to God and compaſſion
to his poore members, and no queſtion it ſhall bee accepted, though it be
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:17958:236"/>
but a little goates haire: wee ſee <hi>Math.</hi> 21. when Chriſt rode to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi>
every man was ready to doe him ſervice and honor, ſome ſtrowed their
garments in the way,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſome cut downe boughs and branches to make way
for his comming; ſo doe thou, if thou have not changes of garments to
ſtrow, yet cut downe a boughe or ſome little branch: beſtow ſomething
on Chriſt, on the Church of God, on his poore Saints &amp; people, and God
will accept it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for as it is 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. <hi>if there be but a willing minde, it is accepted
according to that a man hath, and not according to that which hee hath not;</hi>
therefore let men doe what they are able, and God will accept of it, though
it be but a little.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4</note> the judgement that ſhall paſſe upon us at the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ſhall bee,<note place="margin">The Iudgement ſhall paſſe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to works of mercie to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</note> 
                  <hi>of ſuch workes of mercy as are done to Chriſtians becauſe they
are Chriſtians;</hi> it is good thing to doe good to all, as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 11.
<hi>caſt thy bread on the waters, for after many dayes thou ſhalt finde it;</hi> though it
ſeeme to thee to be loſt and to bee caſt away, yet thou ſhalt finde it againe.
But eſpecially doe good to Chriſtians becauſe they be Chriſtians, as it is
<hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 9. <hi>doe good to all, eſpecially to the houſhold of faith;</hi> and ſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 13.
the Apoſtle exhorts to <hi>diſtribute to the neceſsities of the Saints:</hi> for, that
which is done to the Saints, is done to Chriſt himſelfe, thus 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
makes inquirie,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> 
                  <hi>if none of the houſe of Saul was left,</hi> for <hi>Ionathan</hi> was dead
unto whom hee could ſhew no kindneſſe, therefore hee makes inquiry to
ſee if any of his race, were left that hee might ſhew kindneſſe to them for
<hi>Ionathans</hi> ſake; ſo <hi>Chriſt</hi> is in heaven, wee cannot beſtow our bread or our
cloth on him: O but there are a number of his brethren and ſervants here
in want and in need, theſe wee muſt feede, cloath and ſhew kindneſſe to
for Chriſts ſake: againe, though we are to doe good to all, yet eſpecially to
Chriſtians becauſe they are Chriſtians, for there is ſuch a neere conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
betweene Chriſt and Chriſtians, that their wants hee takes to bee
his wants, their injuries and wrongs to bee as done to him. Therefore
one ſaith well; that Chriſt takes all the injuries and wrongs that are done
to his ſervants as if they were done to himſelfe; as <hi>Acts</hi> 9. <hi>Saul</hi> perſecuted
the Church, and Chriſt cries out of heaven, <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecutes thou
mee? Saul,</hi> kicked at the foote, and the head cries out of heaven, why doſt
thou perſecute mee, ſuch a neere conjunction there is betweene Chriſt and
his members that all the injuries and wrongs that are done to them are
accounted as done to Chriſt, and all their wants to bee his wants: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
tell me O man or woman, if Chriſt ſhould hang on the croſſe and crie
out and ſay, I thirſt, what wouldſt thou doe? Let him thirſt ſtill; nay
wouldeſt thou not rather bring him wine or milke to comfort him? this is
the ſame caſe ſtill,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> for when a Chriſtian is a-thirſt, or an hungred, or in any
want, Chriſt cries out of heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I thirſt, I am an hungred, I am in want, and
therefore looke what thou wouldeſt doe to Chriſt, that doe to his ſervants
and hee will accept it as if it were done to him.</p>
               <p>Now their remaines ſomething to be ſpoken morr, but becauſe the time
paſſeth I will ſpeake breifely of it: The Saints replie and ſay to Chriſt,
<hi>when ſaw wee thee an hungred, or a-thirſt, or naked,</hi> did they not know it? were
they ignorant of it? I anſwer, they did know it, but theſe words only are
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:17958:237"/>
Parabolicall, not that the ſaints do ſay ſo, but it is to teach us ſomewhat;
as <hi>Luke</hi> 16. of the ſpeech that paſſed betweene the <hi>rich man</hi> in Hell, and
<hi>Lazarus,</hi> we are not to thinke that there was any ſuch ſpeech, but it is
Parabolicall, to teach us that we muſt not looke for one to be sent from
the dead to tell us newes, but muſt looke unto the Scriptures, and take
warning by them; ſo be theſe words Parabolicall, and are to teach us
two things:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1</note> That Chriſt hath an eye to all the workes of Mercie that wee doe to
our brethren, <hi>and takes it as if it were done to himſlfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>That the People of God when they have done all the good they
can they will not know of any thing,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>they carrie themſlves ſo humble and ſo
low, when they come to ſtand before Chriſt.</hi> So when we have done all the
good wee can, when wee come to ſtand before God, let us endeavour
to bee humbled and carrie our ſelves very low.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> If a man goe in at a
low Doore, hee can take no hurt by ſtooping low; O but if hee riſe
one inch above the Doore, hee may breake his head, or daſh his
braines out: So by ſinking low and by humbling our ſelves before
God, we can take no hurt; but carrying our ſelves too high, we may
breake our heads, or bee confounded. Therefore it is a good thing
when men have done well to bee humble and to carry themſelves
ſubmiſſively.</p>

ſo there ſhall not be a wicked man left behinde; even the ſweet
mouth of Chriſt that ſhall gather all the godly to him,<note place="margin">They ſhall be ſhut out of Heaven.</note> ſhall drive all
the wicked into Hell; for no ſooner ſhall Chriſt give out the word, and
ſay, <hi>depart from me;</hi> but it ſhall bee of force to drive all to Hell, there is
never a wicked man that is able to withſtand. <hi>Depart from mee ye wicked

drunkards, and covetous perſons, ſuch as prophane the Sabboth, and
ſpend your time looſely, and badly; depart (I ſay) from me, away to
Hell with you, to the Divell, to paines and torments. Now what a
fearefull thing is this, to be caſt out of Chriſts preſence, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1. 5.
<hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>the wicked ſhall not ſtand in the judgement;</hi> they come into

once he was greatly in favor with him; ſo it ſhall be with all the wicked
of the world, howſoever here they may be in great favour with Kings
Princes and great men, yet they ſhall bee caſt out of the preſence of

when Chriſt ſhall caſt us out, becauſe <hi>in his preſence is all fulneſſe of joy, and
pleaſures for evermore;</hi> as it is, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. Therefore to be caſt out of Chriſts
preſence, is to bee caſt away from the fountaine of all joy and pleaſure,
and out of the glory of this World: O what a Hell and a torment will
this be at that day? Therefore the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of ſuch 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 9.
<hi>Who ſhall bee puniſhed with everlasting perdition from the preſence of the Lord,

Gods people leave behinde them; howſoever that the perfection of the
glory of the Saints ſhall be in heaven, yet here in this world they have
their inchoation and beginning of glory, but the wicked ſhall not be
left here to gather up the crummes that are left behinde them when
they goe to heaven, O it were well with them, if they might live here
and tarry on this earth, but they ſhall nor enjoy the leaſt commoditie
that Gods people leave behinde them. We reade <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 23. that <hi>Adam</hi>
was caſt out of <hi>Paradiſe, to till the earth from whence he was taken;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> this was
a grievous and great puniſhment; yet if the wicked of this world were
but caſt into the field to till the earth from whence they were taken, or
if they might be put into a cave, a dungeon, a priſon, or any ſtrait place,
it were well with them; but they ſhall not remaine in any part of the
earth, but ſhall be driven all into hell, this is a torment of all torments,
not onely to be expelled out of the glorious preſence of Chriſt, but alſo
to be driven out of this earth into hell.</p>
               <p>The uſe is,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> ſeeing all the wicked of the world ſhall be baniſhed out of
the preſence of Chriſt; this muſt teach us to love the preſence of Chriſt
in grace; for it is a ſure thing, if wee love not the preſence of Chriſt in

<pb n="466" facs="tcp:17958:239"/>
love to be at the preaching of the Word, love the Sacraments,
love prayer, and the ſocietie of Gods people; this is a comfortable te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
that we ſhall live in the kingdome of glory; we have heard out
of <hi>Hester</hi> 2. that <hi>Abaſhueroſh</hi> had two houſes, there was the houſe of
ſweet perfume, and the Kings houſe, and this was the order of them;
that firſt the Virgins were perfumed and trimmed in the houſe of ſweet
odors,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and then were brought home to the Kings houſe; ſo the Lord
hath two houſes, the houſe of grace, and the houſe of glory; whereof
this is the order, in the firſt, wee muſt be perfumed with all the ſweet
graces of the Spirit; ſo when wee have lived here a time in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of grace, we may be taken into the ſecond houſe of the kingdome
of glory.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> ſeeing the wicked ſhall be caſt out of Gods preſence at the
day of Iudgement, we muſt be carefull to caſt away our ſinnes, or elſe
our ſinnes will caſt us out of Gods preſence: It is a good ſaying of one,
O man deſtroy thy ſinnes,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> or thy ſinnes will deſtroy thee: If a man had
a ſervant that would rob him at night of all hee had, if hee knew it, hee
would be ſure to caſt him out of doores before night came; ſuch a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
Sinne is, that it will rob us of all when night commeth, when the
day of death, and when the judgement is come, it will cause us to be caſt
out of heaven, out of the preſence of Chriſt, and out of this earth, and
will not leave us a bit of bread, nor a draught of drinke to comfort us;
therefore let us, before the day of death and judgement come, caſt ſinne
out of the doores, for it will not only take away Chriſt and heaven from
us, but all our earthly comfort alſo.</p>
               <p>The ſecond puniſhment or paine is,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>Malediction</hi> or <hi>Gods Curſe;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Puniſhment, or malediction.</note> So
they ſhall not only be caſt from the preſence of Chriſt, but they ſhal goe
away with the curſe of God upon them, even the ſweet mouth of Chriſt
that ſhall bleſſe all the godly, it ſhall curſe all the vile and wicked peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the world, ſwearers, lyars, drunkards and bad livers, &amp;c. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
conſider what an heavie thing it is to goe away with Chriſts curſe
upon them, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 2. 24 we reade that <hi>Eliſha</hi> curſed the children that
mocked him, and there came two Beares out of the Forreſt and devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
them; O, but it is a more heavie thing to have Gods curſe on them;
it is not two Beares that ſhall devoure them, but they ſhall be devoured
in hell with the devill and his angels, if it were to paſſe thorow fire and
water, a man might have comfort if hee were in Gods favour, or if hee
did live in a cave, a dungeon, or a priſon; for we ſee the three Children
went into the fire with comfort, and God was with them, and there
was not the leaſt ſmell of fire on them; So <hi>Daniel,</hi> he was throwne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Lions den, and was not afraid, becauſe hee was in favour with
God; and <hi>Ieremie</hi> was caſt into the dungeon, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> into priſon,
with their feet in the ſtockes, yet they ſung ſalmes at midnight and
rejoyced; if the bleſſing of Chriſt be upon a man with a perſwaſion of
Gods, love, this will allay all extremities, but the wicked ſhall goe to
hell, and ſhall have Gods curſe upon them; therefore what a fearefull
thing will it be at that day?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="467" facs="tcp:17958:239"/>
Now there is good uſe to be made of this point, firſt, ſeeing all the
wicked ſhall goe away with Gods curſe;<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> therefore it muſt bee every
mans care to rid himſlfe of his ſins, becauſe it is they that bring Gods
curſe upon us; many a man is not afraid of this: we see <hi>Iudg.</hi> 17. when
<hi>Micha</hi> had ſtollen his mothers money, and heard her curſe him, though
he had the money in his hands,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> which was ſweet betweene his fingers,
he was ſo afraid of his mothers curſe that he durſt not keepe it; now if
<hi>Micha</hi> were thus afraid of his mothers curſe, much more ſhould we be
afraid of Gods curſe; ſeeing we heare that our ſinnes will bring it upon
us; how afraid ſhould we be to ſinne, though it be ſweet and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
yet to rid our hands of it, and expell it aſſoone as may be, that ſo

ſecret and cloſe in our hearts that no body knowes of them, if wee be
not wiſe to rid our ſelves of them, the judgement of God will ſeize up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us and it will never leave us, till it hath deſtroyed ſoule and body;
and therefore ſeeing our ſinnes will bring Gods curſe, let us labour to
avoid them.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> ſeeing all the wicked ſhall goe away with Gods curſe, we

of fire it is) whether it bee bodily and materiall fire, ſuch as wee have
here, or whether it be metaphoricall; for (ſay they) it is moſt agreeable
to the Scripture,<note place="margin">Foure reaſons ſhewing hell fire not to be natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall fire.</note> and moſt probable, that it is bodily and materiall fire.
But I will produce foure Reaſons to ſhew that this fire cannot bee bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fire.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>becauſe hell fire is prepared for the devill and his angels to torment
them in;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1</note> now they bee ſpirits, therefore it muſt bee ſpirituall fire that
muſt torment them, bodily fire will doe them no hurt; as we ſee, <hi>Matth.</hi>
17. 15. <hi>how the devill caſt himſelfe into the fire,</hi> and yet was not burned;
therefore it is not bodily, but ſpirituall fire that muſt torment them; and
<hi>Damaſcene</hi> ſaith that the great devils and the petty divels,<note place="margin">Damas. lib. 4. cap. ult.</note> ſhall be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
with fire, but that fire ſhall not be ſuch fire as wee have, but ſuch
as God knowes of.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Reaſon 2.</note> 
                  <hi>looke what the brimstone, the wood, the lake, the ſmoake and the
worme is, the ſame is the fire;</hi> but the <hi>wood,</hi> the <hi>brimſtone,</hi> the <hi>lake,</hi> the <hi>ſmoke,</hi>
and the <hi>worme</hi> are metaphorically and ſpiritually to be taken, therefore
ſo is this fire; ſo we ſee <hi>Eſai.</hi> 30. <hi>ult. Topheth is prepared for the king, hee
hath made it deepe and large, the burning thereof is fire, and much wood, the
breath of the Lord like a river of brimſtone doth kindle it:</hi> now this cannot
be taken for bodily fire, but is to be taken metaphorically, and Saint <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi>
ſaith, that the <hi>brimstone,</hi> the <hi>wood,</hi> the <hi>ſmoake,</hi> the <hi>lake,</hi> and the <hi>worme</hi> is
to be taken metaphorically and ſo is the fire, for the worme is not an
outward worme, but it is inward in the conſcience, nor the fire is not
naturall ſuch as every man makes, but is ſpirituall, and ſo are all the
reſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Reaſon 3.</note> 
                  <hi>if it bee bodily fire, then there are a member of miracles wrought in
hell;</hi> for it is a miracle, that fire ſhould burne without fuell, and that
mens bodies ſhould burne and never conſume, and that there ſhould be
fire and yet darkeneſſe: but hell is no place for miracles, for they are
either for <hi>converſion</hi> or <hi>conviction;</hi> and converſion cannot be in hell, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the time of life is the time of converſion onely; and againe, they
ſhall not neede to be convicted, becauſe all men ſhall be ſufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
at the day of judgement by their owne conſciences; therefore
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:17958:240"/>
hell is no place for miracles.<note place="margin">SER. LII.</note> Now ſince that wee may not ſpeake without
ground, wee will proove it by Scripture, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88. 10. ſaith the Prophet:
<hi>wilt thou ſhew a miracle to the dead, or ſhall the dead praiſe thee?</hi> If a man bee
once dead there is no need of miracles.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, becauſe wee bee but yonglings, therefore wee will inquire of
the ancient, as (<hi>Bildad</hi> ſaith) <hi>Iob</hi> 8. 9. <hi>Origen</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Reaſon 4.</note> the fire of Hell cannot
bee ſuch fire as wee have here, becauſe our fire cannot burne unleſſe there
be fuell to nouriſh it, and ſome body to blow it; but there is no fuell in
Hell, nor no body to blow it, but the wrath of God; and therefore it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
bee ſuch fire as wee have here.</p>
               <p>Now there is one Scripture that ſeemes to make for it, as <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. when
the <hi>rich glutton</hi> was in Hell, ſaith hee complaining, <hi>I am tormented in this
flame.</hi> To this <hi>Augustine</hi> ſhall anſwer, this flame cannot bee taken for any
bodilie flame; and <hi>Durandus,</hi> one of their owne Schoolemen ſaith, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it may ſeeme to bee ſuch fire as wee have heere, yet if we marke the
place well, wee may conclude the oppoſite, for ſuch as is the <hi>finger,</hi> the <hi>drop,</hi>
the <hi>water,</hi> the <hi>tongue,</hi> ſuch is the <hi>flame;</hi> but all theſe are not bodily becauſe
his body lay in the grave, and a ſoule hath no eyes, hands, fingers or
tongue. So then it is not bodily fire, that the wicked ſhall be tormented
with, but it is the fire of Gods wrath, which is a thouſand times more ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
than all the fire in this world, which is but as Ice in compariſon of it:
And that for two reaſons.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Two reaſons of the extremity of Hell fire.</note> becauſe <hi>it is kindled by the wrath of God,</hi> as <hi>Eſai.</hi> 30. <hi>ult.</hi> all the fires
in this world that are kindled by men, are the more terrible and the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
the ſtronger and mightier that men bee to carry fuell to nouriſh,<note place="margin">Reason 1.</note> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe,
and lay it together: But what is the ſtrength of man to the ſtrength

and terrible will it be, as <hi>Revel.</hi> 18. 8. ſaith hee of <hi>Babylon, therefore ſhall
her plagues come upon her at one time, death, and ſorrow, and famine, and ſhe ſhall
bee burnt with fire, for ſtrong is the Lord God, that ſhall condemne her;</hi> therefore
when the ſtrength of God ſhall heape paines and torments together how
terrible will it bee. Wee ſee <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. 19. <hi>Nabuchadnezzar,</hi> full of fury and
rage, cauſed the furance to bee heat ſo hot as that it did burne thoſe that
came neere it;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> how much more terrible fire ſhall it be, when the Lord ſhall
ſtur up all his power to make it? ſurely ſurpaſſing all the fires in this world;
wee ſee what terrible paines and puniſhments the cruell hart of man can
deviſe; O but when God, ſhall ſet his head a worke to deviſe puniſhment,
how terrible and how fearfull will they bee? for (to give you an inſtance)
as long as the Sea keepes within her Bankes all is well,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> but when it breakes
over it drownes all; ſo when the Iuſtice of God ſhall breake her bankes,
all the paines and torments and puniſhments in this world ſhall tumble
into Hell; therefore how terrible and fearefull will it bee?</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Reaſon 2.</note> 
                  <hi>becauſe our fire cauſeth but one kinde of paine; and takes away the
ſenſe and feeling of all other paines,</hi> let it bee what it will heade-ach, back-ach,
tooth-ach, collick, or the gout, but in the fire of hell, there is all the
paines and torments that the torments that the hart of man can thinke of; for it ſhall not bee
in one part of a man but all over; the <hi>eyes</hi> ſhall bee tormented with ugly
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:17958:241"/>
and fearefull ſights, the <hi>eares</hi> with farefull ſhreeking and crying, the <hi>noſe</hi>
with ſtincking ſmells, the <hi>tongue</hi> with drought and thirſt, the minde with
horrors and ghaſtly feares, and that without any intermiſſion or reſt. The
paines that wee have heere are but in one part, but there in every part in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
and outward; our paines here bee but particular, but there they ſhall
bee univerſall; for (as one ſaith well) as heaven includes all the joyes, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
and delights that this world can aſſord; ſo hell in cludes all the
paines and torments that bee in this world, every part ſhall bee tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
Now if the paine bee ſo great when it is in one part of a man,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> in the
hande, toothe, or belly, that a man would give any thing for eaſe, what an
intolerable paine will it bee when all paines that we have had all our life
time, ſhall meet together? therefore I pray God give us grace to thinke of
it, and care to avoide it.</p>
               <p>And the paine ſhall bee the more terrible,<note place="margin">For ever.</note> that it ſhall bee (<hi>for ever and
ever</hi>) everlaſting; All the paines and puniſhments which we have here are
temporary, but the paines of hell are everlaſting. The <hi>fire</hi> that fell on <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
laſted but a day; The <hi>floud</hi> that came upon the <hi>old world</hi> laſted but one
yeare;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> The <hi>famin</hi> that was in <hi>Egypt</hi> laſted but 7 yeere; The <hi>Captivitie</hi> laſted
but 70 yeares; but the paines of hell ſhall be thouſand thouſands of yeares,
it ſhall bee for ever and ever; And when they have lyen a thouſand thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
yeares, they ſhall bee as new to begin as the firſt day they came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>Revel.</hi> 14. 11. It is ſaid, <hi>that the ſmoake of their torments ſhall aſcend ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more;
and they ſhall have no reſt day nor night,</hi> but ſhall bee tormented for
ever and ever. If a ſinner in hell might ſuffer paines and torments but as
many yeares as there bee ſands on the Sea ſhore,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and ſtarres in the skie, or
pikes of graſſe on the ground, there were ſome hope of eaſe and allayment
of their griefe; but when they have lyen as many yeares in torments as
there is ſands on the Sea ſhoare, or pikes of graſſe on the ground, they ſhall
bee as freſh to begin as the firſt day they came into hell. O how ſhould
this breake the heart of a ſinner to thinke that the paines of hell are ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting?
for when they have lien a thouſand yeares, it ſhall be as if it were
the firſt day they came thither: wee ſee if a man bee on the racke, or hang
by the hand or foote,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> or put his hand into fire, hee would not long indure
it for the gaining of a world, much more to lye, in torment for ever and
ever; againe, if a man lye on a ſoft bed, and have his friends to attend him,
when hee is sicke,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> yet hee turnes himſelfe, toſſes, and tels the hours of the
night, and wiſhes that it were day, and if hee could be rid of that paine hee
would part from any thing, then conſider what a paine and torment it is
to lye in hell, where one ſhall not have a ſoft bed to lye on, nor friends to
attend one, but ſhall have the Divels to torment one, and ſhall have no
allaiment of paines, but bee tormented for ever and ever.</p>
               <p>But ſeeing ſinne is temporary how doth it ſtand with the Iuſtice of
God,<note place="margin">Queſt. Sol.</note> to puniſh ſinne eternally? I anſwer two wayes.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>every ſinne is eternall according to the intention of the doer,</hi> for, if wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked

it. The uſes are:</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> ſeeing hell fire is the portion of ſinners, therefore, as a man will
take heed of fire and water, and be afraid to goe into it, how much more

peyſe it, and conſider the waight and burthen of it, whether we bee able
to live in everlaſting fire, and if wee feele wee cannot, then let us not have

in his blood, we ſhall not have our hand or foote to bee in fire
halfe an hower, but every part of us for ever and ever ſhall bee tormented
in hell fire.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> ſeeing hell fire is the puniſhment of ſinne, and the eſtate that
every wicked man muſt paſſe into; therefore wee may ſee the madneſſe of
men to bee carried away with the pleaſures and delights of ſinne as with

for it:<note place="margin">A ſinner compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Pharaohs Kine.</note> One ſayes well that a ſinner is like to <hi>Pharoahs d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in the 7 yeares of plenty, ſo this is the eſtate of a ſinner, all the time that a
ſinner liveth here is the 7 yeares of plenty, and when hee goes out of this
world then commeth the 7 yeares of famine: O if it were but ſo, all were
well, but it ſhall bee 7 hundred thouſand yeares, nay it ſhall bee for ever
and ever in hell fire. One compares the pleaſures of ſinnes to the Streames
of <hi>Iordan</hi> that the fiſhes are delighted with,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> play and skip in, but at laſt are

Chriſt ſhall doe after the laſt judgement,</hi> therefore
not I will finiſh up this Scripture, and ſo will
come the next time to that point wee ſpake of.
Wee heard out of the former verſe of the heavy ſentence that ſhould

man ſhould thinke that it is for ſome horrible and heynous ſinnes that
they be judged to hell torments, therefore <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhewes in theſe words
that the people of the world are deceived, for they thinke that none
but idolaters, theeves, murtherers, whoremaſters, and ſuch like perſons
ſhall goe to hell; and that it cannot ſtand with the goodneſſe of God,
that all theſe terrible and fearefull judgements ſhould bee inflicted for
ſmall and petty ſinnes. Now Chriſt ſhewes that the world is deceived,
and that men ſhall bee condemned for ſmall ſinnes, aſwell as the great,
if they doe not repent for them. In theſe words wee are to obſerve
three things:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That ſinnes of Omiſſion, as well as ſinnes of Commiſſion
will damne a man.</item>
                  <item>2. Not onely great ſinnes will damne a man, but ſmall ſinnes
will doe it.</item>
                  <item>3. Though they ſeeme ſmall to us, yet they bee great in Gods

               </list>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Firſt, ſinnes of Omiſſion as well as Commiſſion damnes.</note> 
                  <hi>ſinnes of Omiſſion will damne a man as well as ſinnes of Commiſſion;</hi>
for Chriſt will not ſay yee have robbed the poore and taken away their
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:17958:243"/>
cloathes, but ye have not fed the hungry, cloathed the naked, viſited the
ſicke, lodged the ſtranger: the omitting duties of Prayer, of holineſſe
to God, of love that we owe one to another, this wee ſhall bee damned
for, as well as ſinnes of Commiſſion. For (as <hi>Augustine</hi> ſaith) how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things might Chriſt ſay to the wicked at the day of judgement: If a
wicked man ſhould ſay, Why haſt thou judged us to Hell torments? He
might ſay, becauſe ye be murtherers, theeves, deceivers of your brethren,
ſwearers, and becauſe ye be bad livers: But Chriſt ſhall ſay none of theſe
things to them, but it is becauſe ye have not ſed the hungry, cloathed the
naked, lodged the ſtranger, viſited the ſicke: ſo then the very omitting
of Chriſtian duties, Chriſt ſhall charge us with at the day of judgement,
will bee of force enough to condemne us. Therefore the World is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
for they thinke if they doe not body harme, and pay every man his,
all is well enough though they doe no good, but wee ſee that for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
of good and Chriſtian duties, a man ſhall as well bee damned,
as for ſinnes of Commiſſion: therefore it is good for us to be wiſe, and to
profit by this, leſt we be caſt out of the preſence of Chriſt. As a man may
ſpend the day well in his daily vocation, yet when night commeth, if he
creepe into his bed without prayer, and wilfully remaine in that ſinne,
he may be condemned for it if he repent not: ſo likewiſe a man may eate
his meate, come to dinner or ſupper, which a man may have becauſe hee
gets it with his labour, but becauſe he doth not ſanctifie it by prayer, and
draw down a bleſſing from God upon it; therefore notwithſtanding other
performances, he may be damned: ſo likewiſe on the Sabbath day, though
a man doe no worke, though he doe not ride abroad, yet if he lye idle at
home, and do not come to publike aſſemblies, and is not carefull to keepe
it holy to the Lord, he may be damned for it. And this is the firſt point,
that ſinnes of Omiſſion, as well as ſinnes of Commiſſion damne a man,
if he doe not repent of them.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Secondly, ſmall ſinnes damne as well as great ones.</note> Chriſt ſhewes, that not onely great ſinnes damne a man
and caſt him out of the preſence of Chriſt, but the ſmall too, if hee doe
not repent them: this is another thing that the wicked are deceived in,
for they thinke if a man be not a theefe, a murtherer, a whoremaſter or
a great ſinner, all is well enough, but Chriſt ſhewes us that little ſinnes
damne, as well as great: If we doe not feede the hungry, cloth the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
viſite the ſicke, and lodge the ſtranger, the leaſt ſinne is enough to
damne a man, if he doe not repent of it. As <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 36. <hi>Wee ſhall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
for every idle word;</hi> So <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 39. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall
breake one of the leaſt of theſe commandements (and teach men ſo to doe) he ſhall
be called the leaſt in the Kingdome of Heaven:</hi> So then the leaſt ſinne is
enough to caſt us from the preſence of Chriſt: we ſee if a Ship leake wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
though the hole be but as bigge as a mans finger, if it bee not ſtopt,
it will drowne the Ship; ſo the leaſt ſinne that is will damne a man, if
he doe not repent of it; therefore we muſt take heed that wee doe not
give way to the leaſt ſinne; for as Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> ſaith, there is no ſinne ſo
little, but it deſerveth the wrath of God, and eternall condemnation.</p>

<hi>Now when ye ſinne againſt the bretheren, and wound their conſciences, yee ſinne

his ſervants: It is a good thing therefore for a man to bee mercifull and

that is, all the Children of God the Elect and choſen hee ſhall bring
them to God, and deliver them to him, that hee may bleſſe them, and
receive them into Heaven: that he may be made partaker of all the
glory that is prepared for them, and he ſhall preſent them to God,
in the merits of his death, and ſay, Father, theſe bee they that I have

ſhall render up the kingdome unto God, when hee ſhall bring all the

render up the Kingdome.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> Wee read in <hi>Philemon</hi> when <hi>Oneſimus</hi> had
runne away from his maſter, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> meets with him, and ſends
him backe againe to his Maſter with a letter in his hand, to the end his
Maſter might receive him; but Chriſt will doe much more for us, hee
will not onely ſend us with a letter in our hands to God, but hee will
take us by the hand and preſent us to God in the merits of his death,
that God may receive and bleſſe us.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> he ſhall render up the kingdome, that is, <hi>his governement

we doe now is by meanes of a spokes-man but when Chriſt ſhall bring
us home to God, when we ſhall bee brought to Heaven, then wee ſhall
have recourſe unto God without a ſpokes-man, then we ſhall not need
a Mediator, and thus Chriſt ſhall render up the kingdome; that is, hee
ſhall give up his office and his government into the hands of God: A
learned man thus expreſſeth it, there is a number of Rebels that bee up
in Armes againſt the king, who makes his ſonne Generall, and ſends
him out to ſubdue the Rebels,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> to ſhew mercy to thoſe that would ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit

againe to his father, and tels him that he had done what hee was ſent for,
and then renders up his Generalſhip to live with his father as he did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
ſo God hath ſent his Sonne here into the World, to reconcile unto
himſelfe all his Elect people, and to ſubdue his enemies; when Chriſt
hath performed this, then he delivers up his office, and lives with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as before;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> 
                  <hi>Adam</hi> in the time of his innocency and Communion
with God, was without a Mediator; ſo when wee are all brought home
to God againe into Heaven, then wee ſhall have communion with God,
without a Mediator: Now becauſe this is a hard point, and that which
ſome Divines ſtumble at; therefore I will make it as plaine as I can: A
man that hath ſore eyes, he will have ſilke to hang before them, or he muſt
have a glaſſe to ſee by,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> but when his eyes bee well, hee will take away the
glaſſe, and lay aſide his ſilkes; ſo as long as wee were in our ſinnes, wee
could not deale with God; but wee muſt have our ſilkes, it muſt bee by
a Mediator; but when our ſinnes ſhall be healed, then wee may lay aſide
our ſilkes, and we ſhall ſee the face of God, without a Mediator.</p>

                  <hi>That the holy Ghoſt is God;</hi> it is a ground in Divinitie, that hee

taught to beleeve in the holy Ghoſt; therefore it is a ſurething that the
holy Ghoſt is God. But for the truth of this point, becauſe it is one of
the grounds of our Chriſtian faith, I will prove it by Scripture and by
reaſon.</p>
               <p>Firſt, by Scripture; <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 3. ſaith <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>An<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

three that beare record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the holy Ghoſt, and
theſe three are one;</hi> what one are they but one God? The Papiſt telleth
us that the Divinitie of the holy Ghoſt cannot be proved by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but by tradition; but this is erroneous and falſe, and there are
Schoole-men teach to the contrary, as <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> who ſaith, A
man muſt ſpeake nothing of God, or beleeve nothing but what is found
in Scripture, either in expreſſe words or ſenſe; and therefore if it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be proved by the Scriptures that the holy Ghoſt is God, we are not
to beleeve it, becauſe wee are to beleeve nothing but that which is
grounded upon the Scripture: Another of them ſaith, that he can bring
a whole ſwarme of teſtimonies to demonſtrate unto us the Divinity of
the holy Ghoſt: So then we ſee it may ſtrongly be confirmed by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that the holy Ghoſt is God; and <hi>Cyrill</hi> ſaith, that it is the holy
Ghoſt that is the inditer of the Scripture, and therefore he teſtifieth of
himſelfe and revealeth himſelfe as much as is fit and needfull for us to
know of him, that which he hath written of himſelfe, we may be bold
to ſpeake of: And <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, that all the ancient Fathers have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
to confirme this by Scripture, that there is three diſtinct Perſons
and one God: beſides, in the Remiſh Teſtament, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 7. we finde
obſerved upon the note of <hi>One,</hi> that there be three divine perſons in the
Trinitie; and therefore this doth affirme the God-head of the holy
Ghoſt: but here ſeeing it is ſo plaine by Scripture, and by the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of the Fathers, and by their owne Schoole-men, (as many as bee
well adviſed) that the holy Ghoſt is God,<note place="margin">Foure Reaſons to prove the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost to be God.</note> wee need not doubt of the
truth of it; but for the unbeleevers ſake (if any ſhould be here) I will
give foure reaſons to prove it.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Reaſon 1.</note> becauſe <hi>it is proper to none but God, to be in all places at one time;</hi> as

onely of God, on bodily ſubſtance can, becauſe they cannot be
but in one place at one time, and muſt be bounded in their owne eſſence;
but the Holy Ghoſt is in all places, he is in heaven and earth, and in the

but the Holy Ghoſt doth all this, and therefore the Holy Ghoſt
is God:<note place="margin">1</note> Firſt, we may ſee the Holy Ghoſt <hi>creates</hi> as well as the Father
and the Sonne, as <hi>Iob</hi> 33. 4. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord hath made mee, and the
breath of the Almighty hath given me life:</hi> So <hi>Psal.</hi> 33. 6. <hi>By the Word of the
Lord were the heaven and the earth made, and all the hoſt of them by the breath
of his mouth:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2</note> Secondly, no man <hi>knoweth</hi> the things of God, but God the
Holy Ghoſt knoweth all, and therefore he is God, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 11. <hi>For
what man knoweth the things of a man, ſave the ſpirit of a man which is in him;
even ſo the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God:</hi> Thirdly,
none but God <hi>gives gifts</hi> of grace to men;<note place="margin">3</note> but the Holy Ghost doth;
therefore the Holy Ghoſt is God. Now that the Holy Ghoſt doth give
gifts and graces it is plaine, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 6. <hi>There are diverſities of operations,
but God is the ſame that worketh all:</hi> ſeeing then it is the Holy Ghoſt that
doth create, that knoweth the things of God, and that gives gifts of
grace into the hearts of men; therefore the holy Ghoſt is God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Reaſon 3.</note> 
                  <hi>No man is to be baptiſed into the name of any creature, but into
Gods only;</hi> but wee are commanded to be baptiſed into the name of the
Holy Ghoſt; therefore the Holy Ghoſt. Now that no man is to
be baptiſed into the name of any creature, it is plaine by the Apoſtles
words, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 13. where he demands, <hi>Were yee baptiſed into the name of
Paul? I baptiſed (I thanke God) name of you, but Criſpus and Gaius, leſt any
man ſhould ſay, that I baptiſed into mine owne name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe.<note place="margin">Reaſon 4.</note> 
                  <hi>We that be baptiſed are grafted into another ſtocke, and ſo draw ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
grace into our ſelves, but if a man be baptiſed into any other name, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
draw ſpirituall grace;</hi> and therefore wee are to be baptiſed into none
other name, but into Gods Name; beſides, there is an expreſſe charge
and command to baptiſe in no other name, but <hi>in the Name of the Father,
the Sonne, and the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> Therefore the Holy Ghoſt is God. Now I
ſpend the more time in this, that yee might have your Chriſtian faith
grounded; for <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. wee ſee that <hi>the ſeed that was ſowen in the ſtony
ground withered and came to nothing,</hi> becauſe it <hi>wanted a root of judgement;</hi>
ſo if our knowledge be not rooted and grounded, it will come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
every temptation will ſhake it; and therefore we muſt labour to
have our knowledge grounded: Let us come to make uſe of it.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> ſeeing the holy Ghoſt is God: therefore <hi>we muſt take heed we doe
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:17958:246"/>
not grieve him with our ſins,</hi> and our corruptions; this is the uſe Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
makes of it, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 30. <hi>And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, by whom ye
are ſealed unto the day of redemption:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> It is a great fault to grieve man, but
it is a greater to grieve God; it is ſaid in the Law that the people grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
God, and <hi>Moſes</hi> his ſervant; and <hi>Eſay</hi> 7. 10. the queſtion is asked, <hi>Is
it a ſmall thing to grieve man, but ye will alſo grieve my God?</hi> Now there is
never a ſinne we commit,<note place="margin">All ſinne is a griefe to God.</note> but wee grieve God, every oath wee ſweare,
every lye we tell, &amp;c. and therefore we muſt take heed, we doe not ſin
to grieve the holy Spirit and to cauſe him to depart from us; as <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.
10. God complaines, <hi>Forty yeeres long was I grieved with this generation,</hi>
&amp;c.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſo it is our ſinnes that grieve the holy Ghoſt: If a man hath a gueſt
that commeth to his houſe to tarry but a night, he will be wary leſt hee
offend him; much more wee ſhould be loth to offend the holy Ghoſt,
ſeeing he commeth to dwell with us not a night, but for ever: conſider
with thy ſelfe,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> O man, if thou have a friend that will helpe thee in all
times of extremitie, and releeve thee, wilt thou offend him? nay, thou
wouldſt labour to pleaſe him; So the holy Ghoſt is a friend to us, and
will ſpeake comfortably and kindly to us at the day of death, and in our
troubles; therefore, if we grieve him, what comfort can we looke for
at the day of death, and in the time of trouble?</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> ſeeing the holy Ghoſt is God, <hi>we muſt take heed that we doe
not deſtroy the temple of the holy Ghoſt:</hi> now our bodies be the temples of
the holy Ghost, therefore we muſt take heed we doe not destroy the;
So 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 16. ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Know ye not that yee are the temples of God,
and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? and if any man deſtroy this temple,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">How man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyes the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God.</note>
                  <hi>God will deſtroy him;</hi> which is done, firſt by pulling downe the wals, and
then by defacing of it,<note place="margin">1</note> which bloudy tyrants doe when they kill good
people, and deface them: If a Noble-man have his houſe pulled downe
over his head, he will not take it well at their hands, but he will labour
to deſtroy them who did it; ſo if tyrants pull downe Gods Temple, he
will not take it well at their hands,<note place="margin">2</note> but will deſtroy them. Secondly,
we may deſtroy this temple by polluting it, for though they let the
wals ſtand, yet they may deſtroy Gods temple, by deſtroying the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitie
and the holineſſe of it by their bad luſts, and vile ſinnes that they
doe commit, and then God will deſtroy them; as <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. you ſee how
angry Chriſt was, that hee made a whip and <hi>did ſcourge them out of the
Temple</hi> that brought oxen,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and ſheepe, and doves to ſell there; now if
Chriſt were angry with them that defiled the materiall Temple with
their oxen, ſheepe and doves, much more will he be angry with them
that pollute his ſpirituall Temple with their ſinnes and corruptions, and
vile luſts.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing that we are to beleeve concerning God the holy
Ghoſt, is, <hi>That he is perſon really ſubſisting, and diſtinct from the Father and
the Sonne:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1</note> And here we are to obſerve two things; First, <hi>That the holy
Ghost is a Person or a reall ſubſistence,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Holy Ghoſt is not a quality or motion in God.</note> 
                  <hi>and not a quality or motion in God,</hi> as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
heretikes hold, but hee is a Perſon that hath reall ſubſiſtence by
himſelfe; which we may ſee by divers acts that he doth; as to ſend the
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:17958:247"/>
Prophets and Apoſtles, and give ſpirituall gifts and graces; <hi>Eſay</hi> 48. 16.
it is ſaid, <hi>The Lord God and his Spirit hath ſent me;</hi> therefore becauſe the
holy Ghoſt is ſaid to ſend, he is not a quality or a motion, but a perſon:
So alſo <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 2. The holy Ghoſt ſaid, <hi>Separate me Paul and Barnabas for
the worke whereunto I have called them:</hi> So then it is plaine by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
that the holy Ghoſt is perſon, and not a qualitie or a motion in
God: Now, two wayes the holy Ghoſt is taken in the Scripture, for the
gifts and graces of the holy Ghoſt;<note place="margin">Sinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt.</note> as <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. Chriſt ſhewes, <hi>He that
ſinnes against the holy Ghoſt ſhall not be forgiven, neither in this world, not in
the world to come:</hi> A man may ſinne against the Perſon of the holy
Ghoſt, and yet may be forgiven, but the ſinne that is here ſpoken of, is
the gifts and graces of the holy Ghoſt; and in other places of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
it is taken for the perſon of the holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> the holy Ghoſt is a diſtinct Perſon from the Father and
the Sonne,<note place="margin">He is a diſtinct Perſon from the Father and the Sonne.</note> 
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. Chriſt ſaith to his Diſciples, Goe teach all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
baptiſing them in the name of the Father, and of the Sonne, and of the holy
Ghoſt; <hi>and ſo alſo,</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 7. he ſhewes <hi>there are three that beare record in
heaven, the Father, the Word, and the holy Ghoſt, and theſe three are one;</hi> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 3. when Chriſt was baptiſed, there was the voice of
the Father, ſaying, <hi>This is my welbeloved Sonne in whom I am well pleaſed;</hi> and
<hi>the holy Ghoſt deſcending on Chriſt in the likeneſſe of a Dove;</hi> ſo it is plaine
by the Scripture, that the holy Ghoſt is a diſtinct perſon from the Father
and the Sonne.</p>
               <p>Now the uſe hereof is briefly,<note place="margin">Vſe</note> that as we feele the power of God the
Father in our creation, and the mercy of the Sonne in our redemption,
ſo alſo we muſt labour to feele the worke of the holy Ghoſt in ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of our hearts and quickning of us to all holy duties, there were
ſome as wee may reade of in the <hi>Acts, that did not know there was a Holy
Ghoſt;</hi> but if we feele our hearts to be ſanctified, and the power of the
holy Ghoſt to quicken us, this is an argument to us againſt all heretikes,
to prove there is a holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>The third point that we are to beleeve is,<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>that the holy Ghoſt is holy in
himſelfe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">That the Holy Ghoſt is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly holy in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, but cauſer of it in others.</note> and that he is the cauſer and effecter of holineſſe in others: So Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 3. <hi>No man can ſay that Ieſus is the Lord, but by the holy
Ghoſt;</hi> that is, no man is able to doe any thing that is pleaſing to God but
by the holy Ghoſt; and verſ. 11. (ſaith he) <hi>All theſe things worketh even
the ſelfe-ſome Spirit, diſtributing to every one ſeverally as he will.</hi> So the holy
Ghoſt is not onely holy in himſelfe, but he is the cauſe of holineſſe, in
all the people of God.</p>
               <p>The uſes are,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> firſt, ſeeing the holy Ghoſt makes men <hi>holy, there is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
a man that hath one deep or dram of holineſſe in himſelfe, but the holy Ghoſt
must worke it in him;</hi> as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. we ſee the <hi>dead bones</hi> were ſcattered all
the field over,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> till the Spirit of God came into them, then there was a
noiſe, a clattering and running together of the bones; ſo we be ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
all the field over, and lye like dead bones till the Spirit of God
come into our heart, then there is a noiſe and a clattering together of
the bones, then men begin to ſtirre in the life of holineſſe: therefore
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:17958:247"/>
doth any man deſire ſpirituall graces,<note place="margin">SER. LIV.</note> and is often in prayer? doth any
man find in himſelfe holy motions to good? let him comfort himſelfe,
for ſuch deſires are of and by the Spirit of God; it is the holy Ghoſt
that workes them in him, for no man hath a dram or a drop of holineſſe
in himſelfe, but it is the holy Ghoſt workes it in him.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> ſeeing it is the holy Ghoſt that makes men holy, <hi>as often as
we feele any good motions, or good deſires, we may know from whence they come,
that it is the holy Ghoſt which is the beginner and worker of them:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> If a man lye
in a trance, and neither moves nor ſtirres, if one layes his eare to the
man and heares him breath, he may ſay there is life in the man; even ſo,
although a man be not able to ſtirre in the life of holineſſe, yet if he doe
but breath that there be good thoughts, and good motions, and good
deſires, this is a token that there is the life of grace in him, and that the
holy Ghoſt hath begun to worke in him, there is the beginning of grace
in him.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Oure points yee heard wee are to beleeve concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the holy Ghoſt; firſt,</hi> That the holy Ghoſt is
God; <hi>ſecondly,</hi> That he is a perſon, and not a motion
or a qualitie in God, but hath a reall ſubſiſtence, and
that hee is a diſtinct Perſon from the Father and the
Sonne; <hi>thirdly,</hi> That he is not onely holy in himſelfe,
but he is the Effecter and Cauſer of holineſſe in others;
<hi>and that no man hath one dram or drop of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in him, but it is wrought by the holy Ghoſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fourth point (which we are at this preſent to handle) is,<note place="margin">Fourthly, the Holy Ghoſt will make me holy.</note> that <hi>He
is not onely the cauſer of holineſſe in others, but I muſt beleeve that he will parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
make me holy, and give me ſuch a meaſure of ſanctitie as ſhall be meet
and fit for me:</hi> This is properly the faith of a Chriſtian, which herein
goeth beyond the faith of all others, the devils doe beleeve that the
holy Ghoſt is God, and that hee is a Perſon that hath reall ſubſiſtence,
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:17958:248"/>
and that he is a diſtinct Perſon from the Father and the Sonne; and they
doe beleeve that the holy Ghoſt is the cauſer of holineſſe in all the
faithfull people of God; but they doe not beleeve that he will worke
holineſſe in them: But here is the faith of a Chriſtian to appropriate
the holy Ghoſt to himſelfe; ſo they have not faith onely in God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and in Ieſus Chriſt their <hi>Redeemer,</hi> but alſo in the holy Ghoſt, and
are perſwaded he will worke grace in them, and give them ſuch a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of holineſſe as ſhall be meet for them; here is properly the faith of
a Chriſtian, which goeth beyond the faith of the wicked, for they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
they have their ſinnes, but they doe not beleeve that the holy
Ghoſt will weaken them, or ſubdue and aboliſh their corruptions;
when as the people of God have their ſinnes alſo, and their great ſinnes
too, but yet they beleeve that the holy Ghoſt will weaken, ſubdue and
aboliſh their ſtrong corruptions: for what is it to beleeve that there is
a holy Ghoſt, and be never a whit the better? the people of God, doe
beleeve though they have their ſinnes yet they ſhall have grace from
God to ſubdue them; for this is the promiſe of God to them, <hi>Ezek.</hi>
36. 25. <hi>Then will I powre cleane water upon you, and ye ſhall be cleane, yea, from
all your filthineſſe, and from all your Idols will I cleanſe you;</hi> So <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 9. 26.
the reaſon is given, <hi>The hee might ſanctifie it and cleanſe it, by the waſhing
of water through the Word;</hi> here is Gods promiſe that he will cleanſe and
waſh his people from their ſinnes, and where there is a promiſe of God,
there is the faith of a Chriſtian to apprehend it: ſo then it is the faith
of a Chriſtian, to beleeve God will waſh away our ſinnes, and cleanſe
us from them: but the divinity of the world is quite contrary, for they
beleeve God made them, and the mercy of the Sonne in their redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but they doe not beleeve that the holy Ghoſt will worke holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe

ſo alſo wee muſt labour to feele the grace and power of the

the faith of a Chriſtian goeth beyond both devils and wicked men.</p>
               <p>Now here is a very profitable point of enquiry to be made,<note place="margin">Quest. How the Holy Ghoſt workes holineſſe in us.</note> 
                  <hi>How doth
the holy Ghoſt worke holineſſe in us?</hi> as <hi>Mary</hi> ſaid, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 34. to the Angell,
when he told her that ſhe ſhould conceive and beare a Sonne; <hi>How ſhall

                     </gap>an?</hi> Shee doubted not of the matter, but of the
manner; ſo a Chriſtian doubts not of the matter, but of the manner of
this ſanctifying: therefore wee may with holy reverence ſay to God,
How ſhall this be, ſeeing I am a ſinfull man?</p>
               <p>For anſwere hereunto the Scripture declares by ſix meanes the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Holy Ghoſt in us.<note place="margin">Sol.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt is,<note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>by reprooving us of our want of holineſſe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">By convincing us of our impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.</note> 
                  <hi>ſhewing us the impuritie
of our nature and that we have not a drop of holineſſe in our ſelves:</hi> It checkes
us for our ſinnes, and reprooves us for them, untill wee feele this, wee can
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:17958:248"/>
have no comfort, that the Holy Ghoſt hath wrought holineſſe in us, as
<hi>Iohn</hi> 16. 8. Chriſt ſhewes; <hi>when the Spirit of God is come into the world hee
ſhall reproove the world of ſinne;</hi> ſo if the Holy Ghoſt bee come once into a
mans hart, hee will ſhew him the impuritie thereof, check and controule
him for his ſinnes.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> we ſee if a man come into a houſe in the darke nothing
ſhewes amiſſe, but if the light ſhine in, then wee may ſee all the ſluttiſh
corners of it, ſo as long as a man is in darkneſſe, all ſeemes well with him,
but if once the light ſhine in, then all the ſlutriſh corners of his heart will
bee diſcovered: This is the firſt work that the Holy Ghoſt workes in us to
reproove us of our ſinnes and our want of holineſſe: as if a man bee ſick of
a dead palſie,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> the way to recover him is by hot oyles and bathes, when if
once a man come to feele the ſtiffeneſſe of his joynts, there is hope that he
will recover; ſo it is in the worke of grace, if a man ſee his own weaknes
and wants, how uncheerefull hee is in prayer and in Chriſt and duities that
hee cannot repent, though hee deſires to repent, that hee cannot beleeve
as hee doth deſire to beleeve; there is comfortable hope hee ſhall recover
and that there is a ſeed of grace in him: But if the Spirit of God doth not
reproove a man of his ſinnes ſo as to ſee the impuritie of his nature and
want of holineſſe, hee may feare that there is not the beginnings of grace.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>by inlightning of us:</hi> for naturally we are all blinde and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of the wayes of God,<note place="margin">By inlightning us.</note> therefore when the Holy Ghoſt commeth into
us hee makes us ſee, what is pleaſing to God, and what is diſpleaſing; what
is right and what is wrong, as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. wee may ſee that the <hi>Iewes</hi> had a
veyle hung over their hearts in the reading of the Law, that they could
not underſtand and ſee heaven and happineſſe: Now the holy Ghoſt takes
away this veyle, openeth our underſtandings, and makes us to ſee &amp; know
the good way that wee are to walke in: So then the Holy Ghoſt doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten
us, as 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. 27. ſaith hee, <hi>but the annointing which yee have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
of him abideth in you; and you need not that any man teach you, but as
the ſame anointing teacheth you of all things, &amp;c.</hi> We ſee <hi>Genes.</hi> 1. when God
made the world, one of the firſt things hee made was <hi>light;</hi> ſo when the
Holy Ghoſt commeth into a mans hart,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> one of the firſt things that he doth
is, he inlightneth him it is obſerved when a good Tenant commeth into a
houſe hee will make windowes into the ſame (if need bee) that hee may
have good light to ſee how to doe his buſineſſe by;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſuch a Tenant the holy
Ghoſt is, that when hee is come into a mans hart, hee will make windowes
and let in light, that ſo the man may not doe things in darkneſſe; but by
the light of Gods words, giving them heavenly knowledge.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>by uniting us to Chriſt;</hi> because Chriſt is the fountaine of all
holineſſe,<note place="margin">By uniting us to Chriſt.</note> as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1. 19. <hi>for it pleaſed the Father that in him ſhould
all fullneſſe dwell.</hi> Chriſt is the ſtore houſe and the treaſury-houſe of all
riches to his Church, and the Holy Ghoſt will never leave a Chriſtian till
hee hath brought him to the fountaine of grace; if a man dig a trench, hee
will never leave till hee gets to the fountaine,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> that it may flow into it and
fill it with water; ſo the Holy Ghoſt will worke us till he bring us to Chriſt
which is the fountaine, and then hee will convey into us ſpirituall graces,
and ſo fill us.</p>

complaineth (being in the eſtate of grace) of his corruption when hee had
the Spirit of God to worke on his rebellion for the waſting and conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of ſinne, therefore men may much more complaine being in the
eſtate of nature when they want the Holy Ghoſt to worke on their hearts
for the waſting and conſuming of ſinne; and indeed no marvell though
they are carried away with the world, and cannot bee brought to performe
good dueties, ſeeing ſinne hath ſuch power and rule in their hearts: We
ſee <hi>Ioſhua</hi> 10.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> that hee ſhut up 5. Kings in a cave that they ſhould not ſtir
nor eſcape till hee had time to kill them; ſo the Holy Ghoſt getteth our
ſinnes into a cave (as it were) and roules a great ſtone upon it till he take
away all the power of ſinne and kill and subdue it.</p>

worldly before, now they are heavenly and holily affected: And therefore
when wee feele this change and alteration, ſure it is the Holy Ghoſt that
works it: wee read <hi>Math.</hi> 8. how Chriſt ſaith to the <hi>Centurion, when I come I
will heale thy ſervant;</hi> I will not bee idle, and doe nothing: But when I

but if a man could put the Spirit of God and the Spirit of grace into a

and of heaven and happineſſe: this is our eſtate and condition, as long as
there is nothing but the life of Reaſon, we talke of nothing but the world,

               <p>
                  <hi>Now there bee many profitable and fruitefull queſtions to bee mooved
concerning the Holy Ghoſt:</hi>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. How wee may come by the Holy Ghoſt?</item>
                  <item>2. In what meaſure hee is given?</item>
                  <item>3. How a man may know whether hee have the Holy Ghoſt or no?</item>
                  <item>4. What bee the benefits wee have by him?</item>
                  <item>5. Whether a man may loſe the Holy Ghoſt or no?</item>
                  <item>6. How wee may retaine and keepe him?</item>
               </list>
               <p>First, <hi>how a man may come by the Holy Ghost?</hi> But before wee come to
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:17958:249"/>
ſpeake of this wee muſt make anſwer to another queſtion; there hath been
great diſputing amongſt the Schoolemen whether a man receiveth the
Holy Ghoſt:<note place="margin">Quest.</note> or onely the giftes and graces of the Holy Ghoſt: To this I
anſwer,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> this queſtion need bee no queſtion, ſeeing wee receive the Holy
Ghoſt really and actually;<note place="margin">The Holy Ghoſt is really and actually in us.</note> The Scripture is cleere for it, as in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.
19. <hi>know yee not that your bodies are the Temples of the Holy Ghoſt?</hi> this is the
exceeding great goodneſſe of God to give the Holy Ghoſt to us, to be a
roote and a fountaine of holineſſe in us:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> If one give us a fruit tree, it is
better than to give us a little, becauſe the fruit is but for the preſent,
but the tree is for a long continuance,<note place="margin">1</note> ſo it is a greater goodneſſe of God
to give us the Holy Ghoſt than to give us the giftes and graces of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
But the queſtion in hand is,<note place="margin">How to come by the Holy Ghoſt.</note> 
                  <hi>how a man may come by the Holy Ghost?</hi> here
wee are to conſider two things:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. By a remoovall of the falſe way.</item>
                  <item>2. By taking the right way.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>by a removall of the falſe meanes;</hi> for <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 18. <hi>Simon Magus</hi>
would have bought the Holy Ghoſt with money,<note place="margin">A removall of the falſe meanes.</note> but <hi>Peter</hi> tels him, <hi>that
his money and hee ſhall periſh,</hi> Therefore it is meer madnes of any man to
thinke that they may attaine to have the Holy Ghoſt or any gift or grace
for money: we ſee in earthly Kingdomes that there be ſome things that a
man may buy becauſe hee may give the full value and true price for them,<note place="margin">Simile.</note>
and that in exact Iustice, as foode and raiment; and there bee ſome things
that a man cannot buy, becauſe they bee uneſtimably good and unvalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
as to buy a mans life and the Kings Crowne, becauſe no man can give
the worth of theſe; ſo it is in the Kingdome of God, all the graces and
giftes of the Holy Ghoſt no man can buy becauſe they cannot give to
the worth of them; for they bee uneſtimable and unvaluable things; as
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 7. It is ſaid of <hi>faith that it is more precious than gold,</hi> ſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 10.
hee ſhewes that <hi>the word is more to bee deſired than fine gold;</hi> even ſo the
graces and giftes of Gods Spirit, are above price or value, all the wealth
in the world cannot procure one of them; therefore it is good for a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
to thinke before hand, that when hee lyes on his ſicke bed hee
cannot buy <hi>faith</hi> or repentance or any gift or grace with money, for
they are above value and price: hence wee may conclude this is not the
meanes to come by the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>by taking the right way;</hi> for the true meanes that God hath
appointed for a man to come by the holy Ghoſt are three.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>by the hearing of the word preached;</hi> which is the ordinary meanes
wherby the Holy Ghoſt is conveyed into men;<note place="margin">Meanes to come by the Holy Ghoſt.</note> therefore <hi>S. Paul</hi> demands
<hi>Galath.</hi> 3. 2. <hi>Received ye the Spirit by the workes of the Law or by the preaching
of faith?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1</note> So <hi>Acts</hi> 10 44. <hi>when Peter preached, the Holy Ghoſt fell on thoſe that
heard the word:</hi> So that preaching is the ordinary meanes whereby God
conveyes the Holy Ghoſt to us, therefore it is good for men to attend
preaching and to be hearers, becauſe it is one of the meanes whereby we
may come by the Holy Ghoſt,<note place="margin">Simile</note> if a man would have good plants and
herbs in his Garden, then hee muſt labor to have good ſeeds, ſo if a man
would have the <hi>H. Ghoſt,</hi> hee muſt get the ſeed: called by <hi>S. Peter, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:17958:250"/>
ſeed of the word; by the which wee are begotten againe:</hi> It is a good
thing to attend unto the word, for howſoever wee doe not feele that
which we doe deſire, yet let us heare it ſtill, and in due time wee ſhall have
that which wee deſire; as <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. wee ſee the <hi>lame man</hi> lay by the <hi>Poole</hi> of
<hi>Betheſda</hi> a long time,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> when one or other did ſtill intercept him, and yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he tarried ſtill Chriſt came at length and did heale him; ſo although
we cannot finde the bleſſing of God, upon us as wee doe deſire to day, yet
let us come the next day, If wee cannot finde it then, yet let us not give
over, and at laſt wee ſhall feele the bleſſing of God upon us as wee doe
deſire.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>by Prayer;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Meanes.</note> for if wee pray to God hee will give us the Holy
Ghoſt; as it is <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. 13. <hi>If you that are evill can give good gifts unto your
Children, how much more ſhall your heavenly Father give the holy Ghoſt to them
that aske it?</hi> a man may ſow ſeed in his field,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and it may perish, the wormes
may eate it, and the birds devoure it, or it may rot in the ground, <hi>but
prayer is ſeede ſowne in the eares of God,</hi> nay it goeth deeper, <hi>it is ſowne in the
heart of God;</hi> And therefore although our ſeede periſh that is ſowen in the
field, yet our prayer ſhall not periſh becauſe it is ſowne in the hart of God:
Saith <hi>David,</hi> All any teares are in thy botle, are they not in thy Regiſter?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3</note> by repentance and reconciliation with God, <hi>as</hi> Ioel 2 Rent your
hearts and not your garments,<note place="margin">Meanes.</note> and turne unto the Lord, and weepe betweene the
porch and the Atar; <hi>And then ſaith the Lord,</hi> I will powre out my Spirit upon
you: <hi>So that theſe bee the three meanes whereby wee may come by the
Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond queſtion is, <hi>In what meaſure the Holy Ghoſt is given?</hi> The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
whereto wee will lay downe in foure Concluſions:</p>
               <p>First,<note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>that God giveth but a portion of the Spirit in regard of efficacy and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
to his ſervants in this life;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Conclusion.</note> indeed the holy Spirit dwels in us, becauſe
the Holy Ghost is God, and therefore hee is undividable and cannot bee
divided into parts, but in regard <hi>of the efficacy, operation or working</hi> of the
Spirit hee giveth but a portion: So no man living hath all the gifts and
graces of the Spirit, becauſe God giveth but a portion of the Spirit: and a
meaſure of it according as hee ſees fit and meete;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 8.</note> So 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 8. <hi>S. Paul</hi>
ſaith, <hi>That to one is given the Spirit of wiſedome to another the Spirit of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
to another faith, to another the gift of healing, and all theſe things worketh
the ſelfe ſame Spirit diſtributing to every man as hee willeth;</hi> and ſo againe,
<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 7. ſaith hee, <hi>but unto us is grace given according to the meaſure of the
gift of Chriſt:</hi> and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 9. ſaith hee, <hi>for wee know in part and prophecie in
part,</hi> and a little after, <hi>for now wee ſee through a glaſſe darkly, but then face to
face, now I know in part, &amp;c.</hi> So the Doctrine is plaine, that God giveth but
a portion of the Spirit in this life, according as hee ſees fitteſt for man. But
let us come to the uſes which follow.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> ſeeing that God giveth but a portion of the ſpirit in this life,
a man may have the ſpirit, bee a true Chriſtian, and yet want many of
the gifts and graces that another hath: thou ſeeſt another man hath the
gift of knowledge, of wiſedome, memory, or the gift of utterance, be
not perplexed at it, looke that thou have the maine, that thou have the
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:17958:250"/>
Spirit of God to mortifie thy luſts and ſins, and to quicken the to new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of life, then all is wel with thee, though thou have not al the graces
of the Spirit, yet thou may'st be a true Chriſtian: ſo <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſheweth by a
compariſon taken from the members of our bodies;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>Shall the foot ſay unto
the body,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> 
                  <hi>I am not of the body becauſe I cannot gather and draw things to mee as
the hand doth? or ſhall the eare ſay, becauſe I cannot ſee my danger before it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
neere me, (as the eye can) therefore I am not of the body:</hi> if all were hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
where were going? and if all were ſeeing, where were hearing?
ſo that every member hath a ſeverall gift. Wilt thou ſay becauſe thou
haſt not the great gifts which another man hath, thou art no member of
Chriſt, or thou haſt not the Spirit of God? we ſee that every member
hath a ſeverall gift: <hi>Augustine</hi> ſaith (in his tract upon <hi>Iohn) Peter</hi> caſt
out devils, thou haſt the ſame and yet thou canſt not caſt out any:
for all this thou art a member of the ſame body: <hi>Peter</hi> was an eye and
thou art a little toe, or a little finger in the body of Chriſt, better it is
for a man to bee a toe or a little finger in the body of Chriſt, or a little
bone, than to have all the excellent gifts of nature, and periſh: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
though a man have not thoſe excellent gifts and graces that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
have yet labour to have the maine; labour to feele the Spirit of
God to mortifie thy luſts, and then thou may'ſt bee a true Chriſtian
notwithſtanding all thy weakeneſſes.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vſe 2. No fulneſſe of Spirit in this life.</note> ſeeing we have but a portion of the Spirit, therefore there
will be a tang and a taſt of the fleſh as long as we live here in this world,
if there were fulneſſe of Spirit in us then it would change all into Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;
as fire changeth all into the nature of fire,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſo if wee had fulneſſe of
Spirit, it would change all into Spirit, but becauſe wee have but a porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Spirit, therefore there will bee a tang and taſte of the fleſh,
howſoever the Spirit workes on the fleſh for the waſting, conſuming
and weakening of it, yet a man ſhall feele the power of ſinne buſtling
and vexing him while he lives; whereof all the holy men have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained,
as <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 21. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>hee findes by the Law that when hee would
doe good,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> 
                  <hi>evill is preſent with him;</hi> and againe <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 17. he ſaith, <hi>The ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
luſteth against the fleſh, and the fleſh agaiſt the ſpirit, and theſe are contrary
me to the other, ſo that yee cannot doe the ſame things that yee would:</hi> hence it
is manifeſt, wee have but a portion of the Spirit in this life, and there
will be ſtill a tang and a taſte of the old man in us. If a man put wine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a glaſſe, then there will be a taſte of nothing but wine, but if hee put
water into it, howſoever it may change the colour of the water, yet
there will be a tang and a taſt of the water; even ſo if wee were all
Spirit, then all we did would ſavour of the Spirit, but becauſe there is
fleſh, therefore all that wee doe, will have a tang, and a taſt of the fleſh.
<hi>Cyrill</hi> doth obſerve that there is no rocke or ſtone ſo hard,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> but it hath
ſome ſeames in it, whereby weeds may ſpring up and grow in it, ſo there
is no mans heart ſo filled with grace, but there will ſome ſinne or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
appeare by one occaſion or other, as matter to humble us, and
yet to comfort us in that wee ſee and hate it.</p>
               <p>The ſecond concluſion is,<note place="margin">The ſecond con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion.</note> 
                  <hi>that it is but a ſmall portion of the Spirit, and
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:17958:251"/>
meaſure of grace that God giveth at the firſt to his ſervants:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">ART. VIII.</note> for all the great
workes of God begin in weakeneſſe, all the glory of this world was
but a confuſed heape, man was made of a lumpe of earth, and Chriſt
<hi>which is God over all bleſſed for ever, Amen;</hi> he was a little childe: for
as it is in the life of <hi>Nature</hi> so it is in the life of <hi>Grace,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> in the life of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
at the first when a childe is borne, it hath all the parts of a man, a
face, eyes, hands and feete; which though they bee but little at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
yet after in time they grow to the full growth that God hath
appointed; in him at first there are the true parts of a man, though they
are not come to the full perfection: ſo it is in the life of <hi>Grace,</hi> there is
in a Chriſtian at his first conversion <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance, Love, Zeale,</hi> and
all the graces of the Spirit though but in weake meaſure, yet truely and
really, which afterwards will grow up to a greater degree of ſtrength,
till they come to full perfection: and therefore as the man ſaid, <hi>Mark.</hi> 9. <hi>I
beleeve Lord, but helpe mine unbeleefe;</hi> ſo may every weake Chriſtian ſay,
Lord, I have faith, but helpe the weakeneſſe of my faith; I have repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
but helpe the weakeneſſe of my repentance; I have love, but
helpe the weakeneſſe of my love; ſo then all the graces of God begin
in weakeneſſe.</p>
               <p>But here ſome man may say,<note place="margin">Queſt. The leaſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of ſaving grace what.</note> 
                  <hi>what is the leaſt meaſure of Grace that God
giveth to any man that he ſaveth?</hi> I answer, there are <hi>two degrees of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>a deſire to beleeve, to repent, and obey;</hi> for generally Divines ſay,
that the deſire of faith,<note place="margin">Ans. 1.</note> is faith it ſelfe, the deſire of repentance is repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
it ſelf,<note place="margin">It ſtands more in desires than actions.</note> and the deſire that we have to obey God, is obedience it ſelf;
not in deed, and in act, but in Gods acceptance, becauſe it pleaſeth him to
accept the will for the deede; according to that which the Apoſtle
<hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 12. <hi>If there be firſt a willing minde it is accepted accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not;</hi> ſo if there bee
but a deſire to beleeve, repent, and obey (if they be conſtant, ſetled, and
fleeting) without doubt it ſhall be accepted: and this is the leaſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of grace that he giveth to any that he ſaveth.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> the leaſt meaſure of ſaving grace is, <hi>to mourne and to grieve
that wee cannot repent and beleeve:</hi> in this caſe one mourneth and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
that hee findeth ſuch hardneſſe of heart in himselfe whereof the
Church of God complaineth <hi>Eſai.</hi> 63. 17. <hi>O Lord, why haſt thou made us
to erre from thy waies, and hardned our hearts from thy feare?</hi> when a man
findes this,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> there is ſurely a beginning of grace in him: wee ſee a little
Childe though it want power and ſtrength to goe to the mother, yet it
will cry and moane it ſelfe to her; ſo although a Chriſtian wants pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and ſtrength to goe to God, yet if they can cry to God; and bemoane
themſelves to him they may have comfort: and theſe be the leaſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of grace that he giveth to any man that he ſaveth. Now come we
to make uſe of this point.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> that ſeeing God giveth but a ſmall meaſure of grace at the firſt,
therefore no man ought to be diſcouraged for the ſmall and weake be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings
of grace he finds in himſelfe; for <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 31. the graces of
God are likened to <hi>Seede;</hi> now ſeeds are not trees by and by, but they
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:17958:251"/>
grow by little and little till they come to perfection, ſo the graces of
God are ſmall at the beginning, come not to perfection at the firſt, but
grow by little and little; and therefore no man is to be diſcouraged,
though he feele but ſmall and weake beginnings of grace.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> ſeeing God giveth but a small portion of grace at the first,
no man must deſpiſe any for the ſmal and weake beginnings that he ſees
in his brethren; <hi>Zech.</hi> 4. 10. ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Who hath deſpiſed the day
of ſmall things? but they ſhall rejoyce, &amp;c.</hi> ſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 1 we are enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to the contrary; <hi>him that is weake in faith receive unto thee;</hi> doe not
deſpiſe him becauſe God is able to increaſe and to effect grace in him;
and therefore no man muſt deſpiſe the ſmall and weake beginnings in
any of his brethrn.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, ſeeing God giveth but a ſmall portion or meaſure of grace
at firſt,<note place="margin">Vſe 3.</note> therefore it must be every mans care to husband his graces well
he that had but one Talent given him ſhould have beene the beſt huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
and ought to have beene ſo, but indeed he was the worſt, ſo we
(contrary to his practice) ſeeing wee have but a ſmall meaſure of grace,
ſhould labour therefore to increaſe it and to bee the better husbands:
Wee ſee young men that have but a little ſtocke when they begin the
world,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> will omit no time for their owne good; if any man ſhall ſay
to them, why doe you labour thus and take ſo great paines, they reply
preſently, Alas, I had but a ſmall ſtocke, and therefore I had need to
take the more paines; in like manner wee, becauſe wee have but a ſmall
beginning of grace, ſhould labour to increaſe it.</p>
               <p>The third concluſion is,<note place="margin">The third con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion.</note> that <hi>although God give but a ſmall meaſure of
grace yet it doth grow and increaſe in a Chriſtian:</hi> as I told you even now
the graces of God are compared to <hi>Seed,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> 
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 31. and not to a
ſtone, becauſe a ſtone groweth not but ſeed if it bee ſowne, will grow
and increaſe; ſo if a man have the graces of God in him they will grow
and increaſe if they be nouriſhed by the uſe of good meanes: therefore
if thou finde not an increaſe and a growth of grace, thou may'ſt doubt
whether thou haſt the graces of God or no: we ſee when a man ſowes
ſeed in his garden,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> if he water them and they grow not; he ſaith, Sure
the ſeed was naught; in like manner if we finde not a growth and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
of grace in us but are as ignorant, and no more forward now than
we were ſeven yeares agoe in the practiſe of knowledge and duties of
faith and repentance; wee juſtly may ſay, the ſeed was not good, and
truly doubt our ſelves that our caſe is bad ſeeing wee cannot finde the
graces of God in us; for of a truth they will not lye hid, but will grow
and increaſe if they be nourished by the uſe of good meanes.</p>
               <p>But here may be an objection made,<note place="margin">Object.</note> many a Chriſtian complaineth,
he cannot feele there is a growth and an increaſe of grace in him:<note place="margin">Of ſuch who complaine for want of ſeeling</note> to
this I anſwer two things:</p>
               <p>Firſt, a Chriſtian may grow (though he feele not the growth) in one
grace, or other, even as a tree groweth continually till it commeth to a
perfection and to his full growth; but it doth not alwayes grow in one
place, ſometimes it groweth in the body, ſometimes in the bough, and
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:17958:252"/>
branches; and ſometime cloſe and ſecret in the rootes; which cloſe and
ſecret growth is as needfull for the tree as that which is ſenſible and
viſible; ſo a Chriſtian growes continually, but not alwayes in one
grace; ſometimes in one, and ſometimes in another, ſometimes in the
body, and ſometimes in the branches, and ſometimes in the roote cloſe
and ſecret, that is, in humility; which cloſe and ſecret growth in a
Chriſtian is as needfull as that which is viſible and ſenſible.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Ans. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>I anſwer,</hi> that a Chriſtian ſees not his growth, becauſe there
be ſome impediments that hinder the ſame: we ſee in experience that
a Childe may feed on good meat, and yet he may not grow nor thrive
with it, and the reaſon is, becauſe it doth ſecretly eate chalke, or coales,
or dirt, or ſalt, and then it will not grow; even ſo it is in a Chriſtian,
though he feed on good meat, on the Word of eternall life, yet becauſe
he feeds on chalke, or coales, or dirt, or ſalt ſecretly, that is, he hath cloſe
and ſecret ſins which he commits unſeene, and this it is that hindereth
his growth in grace, but if he leave his ſinnes and repent of them then
he ſhall feele a growth and an increaſe of grace in him.</p>
               <p>The foruth concluſion, is,<note place="margin">The third con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion.</note> 
                  <hi>although the graces of God grow and in
creaſe in a man yet they come not to perfection in any here in this life,</hi> as <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.
23. ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>and not only the creatures, but al we which have received
the firſt fruits of the Spirit,</hi> even wee which are Apoſtles and Teachers of
the Church <hi>doe ſigh and groane, &amp;c.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> we ſee <hi>Numb.</hi> 13. 23. that the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of <hi>Iſrael</hi> being in the wilderneſſe, ſent certaine men to ſpy out the
land, who when they returned home brought with them a cluſter of
grapes, that they might taſte of the fruit of the land, and ſo long poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe
it; ſo the Lord hath given us a taſte of the Spirit and of heaven
here in the wilderneſſe of this world that we might long for enjoying
thereof and be in love with it.</p>
               <p>Here an objection may be made;<note place="margin">Object. Of fulneſſe of ſpirit that ſome had.</note> is there no man full of the Spirit of
God; we ſee <hi>Act.</hi> 6. that <hi>Steven was full of the Spirit of God;</hi> and <hi>Act.</hi> 11.
<hi>Barnabas was full of the Spirit of God?</hi> Now this may be anſwered three
wayes.</p>
               <p>First,<note place="margin">Ans. 1. A fulneſſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative.</note> 
                  <hi>Comparatively, in compariſon of others,</hi> they were ſaid to bee full
in regard they had a greater meaſure of the Spirit than others, as <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.
12. the Apoſtle saith of himſelfe, <hi>that he is not yet perfect, but he ſtriveth to
perfection;</hi> and yet afterward he ſaith, <hi>as many as be perfect, let them be thus
minded,</hi> that is, that are perfect in regard of others; ſo, <hi>they were full of
the Spirit in compariſon of others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Secondly, there is a fulneſſe in working diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</note> 
                  <hi>they were full in regard of the stirring and working of the Spirit:</hi>
fill a veſſell brim-full and it will runne over, fill a pot with water halfe
full and ſet it on the fire, and the heate of the fire will make it goe over
and fill the pot; ſo although a man bee not full of the Spirit; yet hee
may be full in regard of the working and ſtirring of the Spirit ſo they
might be full of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Thirdly, a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe may be in regard to ſome particular act.</note> 
                  <hi>they might be full of the Spirit in regard of ſome particular act,</hi> as
the <hi>Schoolemen</hi> ſay; that is, that they were fitted for the place and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
they were appointed to: and ſo <hi>Stephan</hi> was full of the Spirit of
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:17958:252"/>
God,<note place="margin">SER. LV</note> becauſe he was fit for the office he was appointed; and ſo likewiſe
of <hi>Barnabas.</hi> Now there be two conſequents that ariſe from this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine

the Holy Ghoſt, firſt, <hi>how a man may come by
the Holy Ghoſt?</hi> and ſecondly, <hi>in what meaſure hee is
given to the Faithfull?</hi> the anſwer thereunto we laid
downe in foure concluſions; firſt, <hi>That there is but
a portion of the Spirit given to the Faithfull here in this
life.</hi> Secondly, <hi>as it is but a portion of the Spirit that
is given; ſo it is but a little portion and a little meaſure, becauſe all the workes of
God beginne in weakeneſſe.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>though it begin in weakeneſſe yet it growes
and increaſes.</hi> Fourthly, <hi>though grace growes in a Chriſtian, yet that it never
comes to fulneſſe of ſpirit,</hi> they doe receiver but the firſt fruits and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of the Spirit. Now follow the two conſequents of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine:</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That ſeeing no man hath fulneſſe of Spirit in this world, therefore no man
hath fulneſſe of joy;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The firſt Conſequent.</note> for all our comfort is mixed with ſorrow; like as in the
cup that Chriſt did drinke of at this paſſion,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> vineger and gall were min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
together;<note place="margin">Matth. 27. 34.</note> So the cup of every man comfort here is mingled with
griefe and ſorrow: If we had fulneſſe of Spirit, then wee ſhould have ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of joy, but becauſe wee have not, therefore our joy is mingled with
griefe.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">The ſecond con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent.</note> that ſeeing no man hath fulneſſe of the Spirit in this world,
therefore, <hi>there is no man that is perfectly regenerated or perfectly ſanctified in
this world,</hi> all the people of God lie under the burthen of their corruption
groning, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> complaineth of himſelfe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 22. <hi>When I
would doe good evill is preſent with mee.</hi> Many times when a priſoner is let out
of priſon his chaines and bolts are not ſtraight knocked off,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> but hee is
glad to trayle them about with him till he hath begged his fees; ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
a man bee freed by the Spirit of God, yet he muſt traile his chaines
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:17958:253"/>
and his fetters about with him, till hee hath begged his fees, that is, till the
clogs and fetters of his ſinnes bee knocked off by mortalitie and death:
hence wee conclude there is no freedome from this burthen till wee come
to heaven.</p>
               <p>The third Queſtion is,<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>How wee may know whether wee have the holy Ghoſt
i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> us or no?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">How to know that wee have the Holy Ghost.</note> which is a point worthy our learning, becauſe it is the Holy
Ghoſt that ſeales us up againſt the day of redemption; as <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſaith,
<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 30. <hi>Grieve not the holy Spirit of God, by whom yee are ſealed unto the
day of redemption:</hi> ſo alſo in this place that I read unto you, <hi>If any man hath
not the Spirit of God in him, hee is none of his:</hi> Therefore it is good for a man
to know by certaine and unfallible markes and tokens whether hee hath
the Holy Ghoſt in him or no. The Papiſts ſay we cannot bee certaine and
ſure of this by unfallible tokens, there may bee ſome probabilitie of it and
ſome likelihood, but it cannot be certaine: But this is erronious and falſe.</p>
               <p>For firſt,<note place="margin">The Papiſts opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is contrary: Firſt, to the Scripture.</note> 
                  <hi>it is contrary to the Scripture,</hi> as 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 13. <hi>hereby know wee that
hee dwelleth in us and wee in him, becauſe hee hath given us of his Spirit;</hi> ſo alſo
2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 1. 22. <hi>who hath ſealed us and hath given us the earnest of the Spirit
in our hearts,</hi> and <hi>Chapter</hi> 13. of the ſame <hi>Epiſtle, know yee not your own ſelves
how that Chriſt is in you, except yee bee reprobates?</hi> ſo it is plaine by Scripture
that a man may know certainly that the Spirit of God is in him.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Secondly, to Reaſon.</note> 
                  <hi>it is contrary to reaſon;</hi> for we ſee in nature, that a man cannot
have life in him but it will bee ſeene by breathing,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſtirring or moving: ſo
there cannot bee the Spirit of God in a man, but it will bee ſeene by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
or ſtirring in the life of grace.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Thirdly, to their owne Divines.</note> it is contrary to the Doctrine of their own Divines, not onely
their old Schoolemen, but alſo their late writers, which now I will not
trouble you with: So we ſee our Doctrine is plaine by Scripture, by reaſon,
and by their own Schoolemen and late writers who diſproove them; but
wee will ſpend no more time about it, but doe with this queſtion as they
did by the body of <hi>Amaſa,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſpreade a cloath over it, that it doe not hinder
us in the purſuite of better things. Now the point is how a man may
know, <hi>whether the holy Ghoſt bee in him or no:</hi> In handling wherof there muſt
bee good caution uſed, that the wicked bee not hardened and the godly
diſcomforted: Therefore wee will obſerve two things:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. A rejection of the falſe markes.</item>
                  <item>2. A declaration of the true markes.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>a rejection of the falſe notes and markes,</hi> being five in number.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">5</note> 
                  <hi>that there may bee many good things of nature in a man, and yet he may
want the holy Ghoſt;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Falſe marks of the Holy Ghoſts being in us.</note> hee may bee a mercifull man, pittifull to the poore,
quiet and peaceable, a juſt dealer, a chaſte man, and yet hee may want the
ſanctifying Spirit,<note place="margin">1</note> as <hi>Rom.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Many good parts of nature prooves it not.</note> 2. 14. the Apoſtle ſhewes, <hi>The Gentiles which
have not the Law, doe by nature the things contained in the Law.</hi> Now the
Gentiles had nothing but meere nature, and yet they did many things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the Law; they were inclined to love and to mercy, &amp;c. So <hi>Act.</hi>
28. 2. when <hi>Paul</hi> and thoſe that were with him had ſuffered a Shipwrack
and were come to the ſhore, the <hi>Barbarians</hi> kindled them a fire, and being
meere naturall men yet they were mercifull and pittifull men, for it is said,
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:17958:253"/>
                  <hi>they ſhewed kindneſſe to them:</hi> ſo <hi>Math.</hi> 19. 11. Chriſt ſhewes that there were
ſome chaſt that were ſo borne of their mothers belly, they are not made
chaſt by the Spirit of God, but they have it by nature. Now there bee
thouſands deceived this way, becauſe they bee peaceable and quiet men,
doe no body any harme, are juſt dealers, and chaſt livers, they thinke the
bee as holy as the Spirit of God can make them, and their eſtate is very
good; but they are deceived, becauſe a man may have good parts of nature
and yet want the Spirit of God: goodneſſe of nature is a good thing, and
as not to bee condemned, ſo not to bee built upon; therefore let us ſee,
<hi>what is the defect?</hi> I anſwer, the defect is that there was nothing but nature,
and they went no further than nature would lead them; therefore we muſt
not content our ſelves with meere nature, but wee muſt labour to feele
ſome things in our ſelves above it:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> I will make this plaine by example; a
man by nature is able lift a hundred weight or two, but if hee bee able to
lift a thouſand pound weight, there is something above nature in him: ſo
by nature a man may love his friends, but when hee feeles this, that hee can
love God above his enemies, pray for them that hate him, then there is
ſomething above nature in him. So likewiſe, by nature a man loves ſinne
and delights in it, now when hee feeles in himſelfe that hee hates ſinne
and labours to repent it and to beleeve the Goſpell, this is a comfortable
evidence that there is ſomething above nature, that there is the worke of
grace in him.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>a man may have restraining grace, and yet want the Spirit of God:</hi>
A man may refraine from ſwearing,<note place="margin">Falſe marke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining grace.</note> lying, whoredome, drunkenneſſe, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertouſneſſe,
deceiving, and from a number of ſinnes, and yet hee may want
the ſanctifie of the Holy Ghoſt, as <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. 11. ſaith the <hi>Phariſee, Lord, I am
not as other men, extortioners, unjuſt, adulterers, &amp;c.</hi> the <hi>Phariſee</hi> had reſtraining
grace, hee refrained from a number of ſinnes, and yet he wanted the Spirit
of God: for Chriſt tels us, that <hi>the Publican went away juſtified rather than
hee:</hi> ſo likewiſe <hi>Lahan, Geneſ.</hi> 31. 29. ſaith <hi>to Iacob, I am able to doe you evill, but
the God of your Fathers ſpake unto mee yeſternight, ſaying, Take heede that thou
ſpeakeſt not to Iaakob ought ſave good: Laban</hi> had reſtraining grace, and yet
wanted the Spirit of God, for hee had a number of other ſmall ſinnes. This
deceiveth a number, for becauſe they refraine from ſwearing, lying, whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
drunkeneſſe, and from a number of groſſe ſinnes, therefore they
thinke they have the Holy Ghoſt in them; But here we ſee that we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraine
from many ſinnes, and yet want the Spirit of God.</p>
               <p>Now because reſtraining grace is a good thing, and is that <hi>David</hi>
prayeth for, <hi>Psal.</hi> 19. <hi>Lord keepe me from presumptuous ſinnes;</hi> that is, Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine
mee, or Lord hold me back; <hi>where is then the defect?</hi> I answer, the
defect is in two things: Firſt, <hi>They did labour to reſtraine their ſinne and did
not kill it:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Two defects in restraining grace.</note> Secondly, <hi>They did reſtraine from ſome ſinnes,</hi> and <hi>did not refraine
from all ſinnes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>they did restraine their ſinnes, and did not kill and mortifie them:</hi> As a
man that comes into his garden,<note place="margin">It doth not kill ſinne.</note> and ſees a Moule hath caſt up and hath
made a foule racket and ſtir, if hee treades it onely downe with his feete
and doth not kill the Moule,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> within a little while after it will bee as bad as
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:17958:254"/>
it was at firſt; ſo when men reſtraine ſinne and doe not labor to kill it,
upon every occaſion it will be ready to break our againe: <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſhewes
this by an example,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> if a wolfe commeth into a flocke of ſheepe, the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard
is awake and the Dog barkes, ſo that the wolfe goeth away &amp; doth
no harme; yet (ſaith hee) a wolfe hee came and a wolfe hee goes away, in
like manner a man may come into a Church amongst Gods people and
bee reſtrained from ſome ſinnes, either for feare of men, or for feare of the
law, or of ſome puniſhment; yet ſtill hee is a wolſe, hee retaines his wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh
nature, a wolfe hee comes and a wolfe hee goes; therefore we muſt not
onely reſtraine ſinne but wee muſt kill and mortifie it.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>they did refraine from ſome ſinnes and not from all:</hi> So wee ſee
the <hi>Phariſee</hi> did refraine from ſome ſinnes but not from all,<note place="margin">It doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraine from all ſinnes.</note> hee was not an
extortioner or an unjuſt man, but hee was a proud perſon, a hater of the
poore, and a contemner of his brethren: And ſo likewiſe <hi>Laban</hi> hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frained
from ſpeaking ought but good to <hi>Iacob,</hi> and yet he was an idolater,
or elſe hee would not have made ſuch ſearch for his idoles: Therefore we
muſt not refraine from ſome ſinnes onely, but wholly and univerſally, from
all of what kinde ſoever they bee.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>a man may bee inlightned and have a great deale of knowledge</hi> (hee
may know God and Chriſt,<note place="margin">Falſe marke ſome kinde of inlightning.</note> what ſinne is, and puniſhment due unto it
with many other profitable notions) <hi>and yet want the Spirit of God: Hebr.</hi>
6. 4. we read that there may be ſome that <hi>may bee inlightened and taſte of the
word of God, and of the powers of the world to come,</hi> and yet never bee renewed
againe by repentance, if they fall away: ſo <hi>Iudas</hi> was a preacher, had great
knowledge and many good gifts, and yet hee was a Devill; therefore hee
had not the ſanctifying Spirit; in like manner a man may have great gifts
of memory and knowledge, have a rare and an excellent gift in prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
and neverthelesse want the ſanctitie of the Holy Ghoſt. Here becauſe
illumination and knowledge is a gift of the Spirit of God, and a thing
to bee deſired and labored for,<note place="margin">Coloſ. 3. 10.</note> as <hi>S. Paul</hi> exhorts the <hi>Coloſsians, to put off the
old man and to put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge;</hi> therefore (I
ſay)<note place="margin">Quest.</note> becauſe knowledge is a gift of the Spirit, let us ſee, <hi>what is the defect
of this illumination and knowledge.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Anſ. Two defects in knowledge.</note> To this, I anſwer, There are <hi>two defects in
it:</hi> Firſt, <hi>men doe not labor for the right kinde of knowledge:</hi> And ſecondly, <hi>they
doe not make a right uſe of their knowledge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>men did not labour for a right kinde of knowledge?</hi> For there are two
kindes of knowledge:<note place="margin">Such knowledge is not of a right kinde. Speculative knowledge. Practicall knowledge.</note> Firſt, <hi>ſpeculative:</hi> Secondly, <hi>practicall knowledge: ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative
knowledge</hi> is to know things to diſcourſe of them, and to make ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-talke
and to ſpeake of them; <hi>practicall knowledge</hi> is to know things to
put them in practiſe, that they may bee layd to their hearts and to their
lives to bee reformed thereby. Now let us all labour for this laſt kinde
of knowledge, and not for the firſt: and this is the firſt defect of mans
knowledge.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>that men doe not make a right uſe of their knowledge;</hi> they doe
not apply it to their hearts and to their lives for the bettering and refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of them;<note place="margin">Such make no right uſe of their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</note> for it is a ſure thing, <hi>we can have no more comfort of our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
than ſo farre as we put it in practise:</hi> A man may have a flint ſtone in his
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:17958:254"/>
pocket, and yet bee a cold if hee doth not make uſe of it to ſtrike fire; ſo a
man may have knowledge, and have no comfort by it, unleſſe he make uſe
of it to the bettering of himſelfe. Therefore it muſt bee our wiſedome
that when we have knowledge, to bee ſure to apply it to our hearts and to
our lives for the bettering of both.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>a man may have a kinde of repentance,</hi> hee may bee humbled for
his ſinnes,<note place="margin">4</note> cry out againſt them, confeſſe them, <hi>and weepe for them, and yet
nevertheleſſe want the Holy Ghoſt;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Falſe marke an unsound ſorrow and repentance.</note> as <hi>Pharoah, Exod.</hi> 9. 27. ſaid to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and
to <hi>Aaron, I have now ſinned, the Lord is Righteous, but I and my people are
wicked:</hi> Heere wee ſee that <hi>Pharoah</hi> ſaw his sinnes, confeſſed them; and yet
hee had not the ſanctifying ſpirit; ſo <hi>Saul</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 17. where of him it is
ſaid, <hi>and Saul lift up in his voyce and wept, and ſaid to David, Thou art more
righteous than I; for thou hast rendred mee good, and I have rendred thee evill;</hi>
ſo alſo of <hi>Iudas, Matth.</hi> 27. 3. it is ſaid, <hi>Then when Iudas, which betrayed him,
ſaw that hee was condemned; hee repented him and brought back the thirty peeces
of ſilver to the chiefe Priests and Elders, ſaying, I have ſinned in betraying the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
blood:</hi> So then we ſee a man may repent of his ſinnes, confeſſe them,
bee humbled and weepe for them, and yet want the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>Now ſeeing repentance is a good gift of the ſpirit,<note place="margin">Quest.</note> let us ſee, <hi>what is the
defect?</hi> I anſwer, it is, in three things:</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Anſ.</note> 
                  <hi>theſe men did weepe and ſorrow more for the judgment that was like to
come upon them than for the hatred of the ſinne:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The defects in repentance.</note> So wee ſee <hi>Ahab</hi> did weepe
and cry out when the judgment was pronounced againſt him by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
and yet his repentance was faltie.<note place="margin">1</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Sorrow more for the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than the ſinne.</note> 
                  <hi>they did weepe for one and not for all their ſinnes;</hi> ſo we ſee <hi>Iudas</hi>
did, hee repented this one ſinne of the betraying of Chriſt, and had a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of other ſinnes hee never repented of;<note place="margin">2</note> ſo <hi>Pharoah</hi> hee repented of this
one ſinne of detayning and holding back of the Children of Iſrael,<note place="margin">Sorrow not for all ſinnes.</note> but
did not repent of his other ſinnes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>They did weepe for their outward ſinnes,</hi> and <hi>not for their inward
corruption:</hi> Therefore thou whoſoever thou art muſt labour of finde in thy
ſelfe whether thou mourneſt for the hatred of ſinne,<note place="margin">Sorrow not for inward corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> or for feare of Gods
judgment, if it bee for feare of puniſhment and for feare of Hell, thou canſt
not have any comfort; but if it bee for the hatred of ſinne, becauſe it is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing
to God,<note place="margin">S. Auguſtines wiſh.</note> thou mayeſt have comfort: therefore, (as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith)
ſhew mee the man firſt that can weepe and mourne for ſinne though hee
knowes that God will not damne him;<note place="margin">1</note> that hell is ſhut up, and the Divell
ſhall not torment him,<note place="margin">2</note> this man may eſpecially have comfort: Secondly,
that ſo repents for one ſinne as that hee drawes in all his ſinnes as far as
judgment informes him. Thirdly, that is humbled not onely for his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
ſinnes but eſpecially for his inward corruption. Thus wee ſee <hi>Paul</hi>
did, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. <hi>O wretched man that I am who shall deliver mee from this body of
ſinne?</hi> If thou canſt finde theſe three things in thy repentance, thou mayeſt
have comfort in it.</p>
               <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5</note> 
                  <hi>a man may have a kinde of love to heaven,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Falſe marke, an unſound deſire of heaven and glorie.</note> 
                  <hi>a deſire to be ſaved, and
to behold God in glory, and yet may want the holy Ghoſt:</hi> Two examples wee
have of it; firſt of <hi>Balaam, Numb.</hi> 23. 10. who deſired <hi>to die the death of
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:17958:255"/>
the righteous;</hi> and ſecondly, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 16. of the young man that came
to Chriſt, and ſaid unto him, <hi>Master, what ſhall I doe to be ſaved?</hi> ſo a man
may have a deſire to be ſaved, and to be in heaven and happineſſe, and
yet want the ſpirit of God.<note place="margin">The defect of unſound deſire of heaven. Firſt, in a flee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting unconſtant deſire.</note> Here therefore as before, ſo now let us ſee,
<hi>what the defect is?</hi> I anſwer, it is <hi>in three things:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>It is a fleeting deſire, not conſtant and ſetled: Balaam</hi> had a good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,
but it was but in a mood or a fit, he deſired hee might die the death
of the righteous, and it was but once that he did ſo, that we reade of, and
that alſo when hee ſaw the glory of the Saints; this is the firſt defect
that <hi>their deſires are but for a fit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Secondly, such deſires are idle and lazie ones.</note> 
                  <hi>they were idle deſires;</hi> they deſired heaven, but were loth to
take any paines; as it is ſaid of the <hi>Sluggard, Prov.</hi> 13. 4. <hi>The ſluggard luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
but his ſoule hath nought;</hi> though hee deſire ſuch and ſuch things, yet
he goes without them, becauſe he would not take pains for them: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we muſt ſee that our deſires be ſuch as will put us upon any paines
and labour ſo we may be ſaved.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Thirdly, ſuch deſires are not earneſt ones.</note> 
                  <hi>Such have not earneſt deſires,</hi> but thoſe that every little mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
will put over; we ſee if a childe askes the breſt or meat, the mother
ſometimes will give him a booke into his hand, when this quiets the
childe, it ſhewes that it was but a flight deſire that the childe had; for
if it had beene an earneſt deſire, nothing would quiet the childe till it
had the breſt or ſome meat: So it is with many men, they deſire to be
ſaved, and to have heaven, and then the devill puts (as it were) a booke
into their hands, matter of pleaſure and profit which quiets them; this
ſhewes that their deſires were but ſlight, for if they had beene earneſt,
nothing would content them till they had had the thing that they deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
And thus much of the <hi>falſe markes.</hi>

it will be very neceſſary and profitable for

ſignes</hi> of the holy Ghoſt his being in us. And this
we may diſcover by conſidering it two wayes:<note place="margin">1</note>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Generally:<note place="margin">Generally two wayes.</note>

               </list>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>Whereſoever the holy Ghoſt is, in what man ſoever, he makes a ſenſible
and a through change,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">He makes a great change.</note> 
                  <hi>and alters him in his will, affections and in every part,</hi> as
<hi>Matth.</hi> 8. Chriſt ſaith unto the <hi>Centurion, If I come I will heale thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant;</hi>
I will not be idle and doe nothing,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> but if I come I will heale him;
ſo if the holy Ghoſt come into a man, hee will not be idle, but hee will
heale him of his ſinnes, and make a ſenſible and a through change in him
in all parts; So <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 7. Chriſt ſhewes <hi>that no man can enter into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of heaven, unleſſe there be a ſecond birth of the holy Ghoſt in him;</hi> and
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 17. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>that every one that is in Chriſt muſt be a new creature:</hi>
So then there muſt be a ſecond birth of the Spirit, people muſt become
new men and women: It is a ground in nature, that <hi>the generation of one
thing, is the corruption of another;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> as Ice when it turnes to water there is
corruption of the Ice; ſo when Chriſt turned water into wine, there
was corruption of the water: even ſo it is in the worke of the Spirit, <hi>as
there is encrease of holineſſe wrought in a man, ſo there is a decreaſe of ſinne and
corruption.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> Wee ſee in the Goſpell that thoſe that were brought to
Chriſt, who lay and wanted their feet, went away with them; ſuch as
were blinde, went away with their eyes opened; ſuch as were deafe and
dumbe, went away ſpeaking and hearing; and ſuch as were dead, went
away alive; ſo, when the Spirit of God comes into a man, though hee
were lame and not able to walke in the wayes of God, yet that will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:17958:256"/>
him; if he were blinde and ignorant, that will open his underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and give him heavenly knowledge; if he were dead in sinnes, that
will put the life of grace and holines into him: thus the holy Ghoſt will
make a through change; therefore every man muſt labour to ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this change be wrought in him or no, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 10, 11. it is ſaid,
that <hi>no theeves, covetous perſons, drunkards, railers, nor extortioners ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit
the Kingdome of God; and ſuch were ſome of you, but ye are waſhed, but ye
are ſanctified, but ye are juſtified, in the name of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and by the
Spirit of our God:</hi> Here was a change indeed wrought in theſe men; So
alſo, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Before I was a blaſphemer, and a perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and an oppreſſour, but I was received to mercy, becauſe I did it ignorantly,</hi>
now I thanke God;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> it is otherwiſe with me; when a man can feele this
change and alteration in him, that he can ſay indeed, I have beene a bad
liver, I have beene a ſwearer, and a lyar, and a drunkard, but now Lord
I thanke thee, it is otherwiſe with me, I am changed and altered; this
is a good evidence that the holy Ghoſt is in him, but if a man be not
changed and altered, but remaines the ſame man that ever he was, the
holy Ghoſt is not in him, for where the holy Ghoſt is, there he makes
a ſenſible and a through change.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Secondly, hee ſtirs and moves to holineſſe.</note> 
                  <hi>If the Spirit of God come into a man, it will ſtirre and move a
man to good things;</hi> as <hi>Act.</hi> 2. when the Spirit of God came downe upon
the Apoſtles <hi>in firy tongues,</hi> they began to ſpeake with new tongues; the
holy Ghoſt did worke in their hearts and on their tongues; ſo <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 6.
(ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>God hath ſent the Spirit of his Sonne into our hearts, which
crieth Abba Father;</hi> even ſo, if a man hath the Spirit of God in him, it
will ſtirre him to repentance, and to the duties of prayer and holineſſe:
therefore we are to conſider no man can have the Spirit of God, but he
ſhall feele movings and ſtirrings of the Spirit;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> for as it is in the naturall
life, that there cannot be life in us, but it will be ſeene by breathing or
panting, ſtirring or moving, there will be operations of life; ſo it is in
the life of grace, there cannot be the Spirit of God in a man, but there
will be operations and motions of the Spirit, it will not be idle; A ſhip
on the Sea lies ſtill when there is no body in it,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> but put marriners there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
then they will weigh up their anchors, hoiſt up their ſailes, and away
they goe; ſo men lye idle in the wayes of God, but if the Spirit of God
be in them, it will ſtirre and moove them to performe good duties, to
prayer, to repent of their ſinnes, to duties of love, and ſuch like; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when wee be idle and doe not feele this ſtirring and moving unto
good things, the holy Ghoſt is not in us, becauſe hee would be ſure to
ſtirre and moove us, as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1. 21. it is ſaid of the <hi>wheeles, that when the
beaſts went,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> 
                  <hi>the wheeles went with them, and when they ſtood, they ſtood, and when
they were lifted up from the earth, the wheeles were lifted up beſides them; for the
ſpirit of the beaſts were in the wheeles,</hi> they had all one ſpirit; ſo if the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God be in a man, if Chriſt moves, he will move, and when Chriſt
makes a ſtand, he will ſtand, and when Chriſt lifts up himſelfe, hee will
lite up himſelfe: Hence we may be taught his ſure marke, that when a
man feeles nothing, is not ſtirred up to the duties of repentance, prayer,
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:17958:256"/>
holineſſe, and love, feeles no operation nor working of the Spirit in
him, let not that man wilfully put out his owne eyes, for then of a truth
he may ſee, and there is no work of grace yet wrought, the holy Ghoſt
is not in him. And thus much of the generall.</p>
               <p>Now for the <hi>particular,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>there be divers degrees,</hi> for all have not one mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of the Spirit,<note place="margin">Particularly: divers degrees of the Spirit.</note> but ſome more, ſome leſſe; therefore every one is to
conſider of his eſtate, whether he be a beginner in religion, or a ſtrong
Chriſtian, or whether he be weakned by ſinne and temptations, the
weaker Chriſtian hath weaker motions, actions, and operations; the
ſtronger hath ſtronger motions, actions and operations of the Spirit:
we ſee in the life of nature,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> that God gives divers degrees of life to his
creatures; there is not that degree of life in a little childe, that is in a
man who is come to his full growth; therefore the actions and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of a man are ſtronger than a childes. Againe, there is no man ſo
ſtrong but he may be weakened by sickneſſe and diſtemperature; ſo it is
in the life of grace; there be divers degrees of the Spirit, in a weake
Chriſtian the actions and operations of the Spirit be weake, in a ſtrong
Chriſtian they be ſtronger, and yet a ſtrong Chriſtian may be weakned
by ſinne: therefore if a Chriſtian would give a right judgement of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
whether he have the Spirit or no, he muſt conſider in what ranke
hee is, and in what eſtate, whether a beginner in religion, or a ſtrong
Chriſtian, or whether he be weakened by ſome ſinnes: If hee be a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginner
in religion, then he may looke to two things:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Whether there be a right worke of the Spirit.<note place="margin">Two things a weake beginner muſt looke to.</note>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. Whether there be a right uſe of the worke.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> he muſt <hi>looke for a right worke of the Spirit;</hi> and that we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
in foure things;<note place="margin">A right worke of the Spirit in foure things: Firſt, that there be humbling.</note> Firſt, <hi>whether they have beene truly humbled for their
ſinnes, and caſt downe in the ſenſe and feeling of them;</hi> ſeeing that they were
in an eſtate of damnation, and under Gods curſe, till they be brought
home to Chriſt: as <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 6. we ſee <hi>Paul</hi> was firſt humbled, and caſt
downe before God did raiſe him and give him comfort; and ſo <hi>Act.</hi> 2.
37. the converts were firſt <hi>pricked in their hearts and cried out, Men and
brethren, what ſhall we doe to bee ſaved?</hi> before they were raiſed up by the
miniſtery of the Apoſtles.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> I have ſhewed you heretofore, when a man
appoints a tree to build with; he firſt takes an Axe and cuts it downe by
the root, and layes it flat on the ground, then he cuts off the boughes and
branches, and leaves it naked before he takes it into his building; even
ſo the Lord doth, when he doth purpoſe to take us into his building, he
firſt comes with the axe of his Law, cuts us downe, and layes us on the
ground; then he cuts off the boughes and branches, and leaves us naked
without any hope of our owne merits or deſerts, before hee pluckes us
into this ſame heavenly building. And this is firſt worke of the
Spirit.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Secondly, deſire of reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> the worke of the Spirit is, <hi>an earneſt deſire to be reconciled to
God, to bee at one with him:</hi> The hungry man doth not more deſire his
meat, nor the thirſty man his drinke, than he longs and deſires in this
eſtate to be in the covenant of grace; as <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 22. <hi>Paul</hi> eat no meat for
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:17958:257"/>
three dayes together, but prayed and cried unto the throne of grace,
and could not be quiet till hee was certified by <hi>Ananias</hi> that his ſinnes
were pardoned:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> A poore priſoner, when he is condemned to die, all he
doth is for a pardon, ſay what you will, and doe what you will, hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards
nothing elſe; ſo it is with a Chriſtian, when he ſees he is condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the Law of God, and guiltie of eternall death, ſay and doe what
ye will, all his mind is for a pardon, which till he hath obtained nothing
will quiet him, nothing will content him, till hee hath his diſcharge
from God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Thirdly, it ſtirs up to lay hold on the Promiſes.</note> 
                  <hi>It ſtirres up a man truly to lay hold on the ſweet promiſes that God
hath made to him in Chriſt;</hi> So as he labours to be found in him, and to
renounce himſelfe, ſaying, Lord, I am a ſinner, but Chriſt hath ſatisfied
thee for my ſinnes; I am uncleane, but Chriſt hath waſhed me in his
bloud: I come ſhort of that which thou requireſt, but Chriſt hath ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
the Law for me; ſo <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 11. <hi>Peter</hi> was bold to ſtand up and ſay, <hi>We
beleeve through the grace of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt to be ſaved, even as they doe;</hi>
ſo alſo, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 69. <hi>Zachariah</hi> bleſſeth and praiſeth God, becauſe he hath
raiſed up <hi>a horne of ſalvation unto us;</hi> and <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. there was Leper that
came to Chriſt, and ſaid unto him, <hi>Lord I am an uncleane perſon, but if thou
wilt thou canſt make me cleane;</hi> in like manner the Spirit of God drives a
man to Chriſt, and makes him to ſay, Lord, though I am a Leper, though
I am an uncleane perſon and polluted, yet if thou wilt thou canſt make
me cleane, and therefore Lord waſh me in thy moſt precious bloud, that
I may be found unblameable before thee.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Fourthly, a ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led walking with God.</note> 
                  <hi>It workes a ſetled courſe to walke with God, ſo farre forth as frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie

ſaith, <hi>What wilt thou that I doe?</hi> before Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was ſtubborne, and
would not bend nor buckle to the will of God, but now he is readie to
yeeld to any thing; ſo ſaith he, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 22. <hi>But being freed from ſinne, wee
are made ſervants to God:</hi> this is another worke of the Spirit, that a man
is deſirous to pleaſe God alwayes; for <hi>Iustification</hi> and <hi>Sanctification</hi> ſtill
goe together, there is no man can finde the pardon of his ſinnes, but in
ſome meaſure hee ſhall hae ſtrength againſt them: theſe be the foure
workes of the Spirit in a new beginner; therefore conſider with thy
ſelfe, haſt thou beene ever humbled for thy ſinnes, not for ſome one, (as
<hi>Iudas</hi> was) but for all ſinnes; haſt thou drawne in all thy ſinnes as farre
as thy judgement can informe thee? then haſt thou deſired to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled
to God, and to be at one with him, to be brought into the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of grace? haſt thou deſired, I ſay, it as an hungry man doth his meat,
or a thirſtie man his drink? doſt thou deſire it above life and liberty, and
whatſoever is deare in thy ſight? Againe, haſt thou laid hold on the
promiſes that God hath made in Chriſt? doſt thou labour to be found
in Chriſt? Laſtly, haſt thou a ſetled purpoſe to walke with God as farre
as frailtie will permit? if thou feele theſe things in thee, bee of good
comfort, here is the worke of the Spirit; but if thou feele not theſe
things in thee, there is as yet no worke of the Spirit, for theſe things

bee in a Chriſtian, though hee bee but a day old in Religion.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing that we are to conſider is,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>whether there be a right or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

that they were but dead and drie bones; Secondly, there was a noyſe

Thirdly, there were ſinewes grew on the bones, and fleſh on the
ſinewes; Fourthly, life came into them and then they ſtand up;
ſo it is in the converſion of a ſinner;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> Firſt, there is a voyce to forewarne
them that they are but dead and drie bones, that there is no life of grace
in them, not being able to ſtir a foote in the wayes of God. Secondly,
there is a noyſe and running together of the bones; a deſire of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation,
and to bee brought within the eſtate of grace. Thirdly, fleſh
on the bones, that is to lay hold on the promiſes of God. And laſtly,
life comes into the bones, they ſtand up; then a man is inabled in ſome
meaſure to walke with God: And therefore conſider with thy ſelfe,
Haſt thou motions and deſires, and haſt not beene humbled firſt in ſenſe
and feeling of thy ſinne? here indeede is a worke, but it is not the right
order of the worke; for firſt they muſt be humble.</p>
               <p>Now as the Spirit growes ſtronger, ſo there are ſtronger motions
and actions wrought in a Chriſtian;<note place="margin">Strength of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on increaſes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſtrength of the ſpirit.</note> for as it is in the naturall life, ſo it
is in the life of grace: wee ſee the weaker a man is, the weaker bee his
actions, and the ſtronger he is, the ſtronger bee his actions. As when a
man is ſicke, he may bee ſo weake that hee is not able to goe by a ſtaffe;
but as he growes well, ſo his ſtrength growes againe; and his actions
are ſtronger;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſo it is with a Chriſtian, although he bee weake and not
able to creepe at firſt, yet as he growes ſtronger, ſo his Actions will
be ſtronger and ſtronger. Now the worke of the Spirit is in two things
in a ſtrong Chriſtian:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. In his Mortification.</item>
                  <item>2. In his quickning.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Mortification,</hi> and that is in <hi>three things:</hi> as firſt, <hi>A man that is
ſtrong in the ſpirit will make ſtrong reſiſtance againſt ſinne,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The worke of the ſpirit mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying in three things.</note> 
                  <hi>and will not be eaſily
foyled and put off for every little matter;</hi> Wee ſee a weake tree the winde
will bend and bow it,<note place="margin">1</note> as if it would fall downe, and make the tops touch
the ground, and yet the tree may be rooted; but if it bee a ſtrong tree
the winde cannot bend or bow it:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſo if a Man be a weake Chriſtian, he
is carried this way and that way with every winde (as it were) but if he
be ſtrong, he will make ſtrong reſiſtance againſt ſinne; therefore it is
ſaid of <hi>Ioſeph, Gen.</hi> 39. 15. That hee conſented not to his Miſtris though
ſhe lay at him <hi>from day to day:</hi> and 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 9. it is ſaid, <hi>Reſiſt the Divell,
being ſtrong in the Faith.</hi> So then a ſtrong Chriſtian will make ſtrong re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
againſt ſinne: therefore when as it is ſo with a man that there
is a temptation offered, and hee makes no reſiſtance, hath no ſtrength
againſt ſinne, but falls into it, I will not ſay this man is no Chriſtian, but
I will ſay he is but a weake Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="504" facs="tcp:17958:258"/>
The ſecond is, <hi>That no Man that is ſtrong in ſpirit, although hee ſinne
through temptation, doth fall into it ſo eaſily as others or with that delight, but
there is a reluctation and a ſtriving againſt it:</hi> as <hi>Peter, Marke</hi> 14. 68. when
he denied his Maſter he crept into the Porch, hee would not willingly
have done it. If a Man ſtrike a blow at one, though hee cannot keepe
of the blow,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> yet he may breake it, ſo that it ſhall not be ſo great; ſo the
Spirit of God doth, though it keepe not a Man from ſinne, yet it may
breake the force of it, that a Chriſtian ſhall not ſo eaſily commit it, but
that there will be a reſiſtance and a reluctation againſt it, they will not
ſo eaſily commit it as others doe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>although they fall into ſinne, yet they will not lie long in their ſinne:</hi>
but will returne to God, upon every little touch. So <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam. ult.</hi>
when he had numbred the people <hi>his heart ſmote him:</hi> and 2 <hi>King.</hi> 7. <hi>the two
Lepers</hi> their hearts ſmote them, and they ſaid, <hi>we have not done well in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing
good newes:</hi> ſo it is with a ſtrong Chriſtian, every little touch will
make him returne to God, renew his faith, repentance and hope of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
he is never at quiet, till he bee brought home to God: Theſe are
the workes of Mortification.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is <hi>workes of quickning</hi> in a ſtrong Chriſtian, and they are
foure:</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">4</note> 
                  <hi>Hee that is ſtrong in the Spirit, the Spirit will enable him to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
ſpirituall Service;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Workes of quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in a ſtrong Chriſtian.</note> put him on prayer and other Chriſtian duties,
hee ſhall doe ſuch things as hee never thought he ſhould have done: as
<hi>Phil.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1</note> 4. 13. ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>I am able to doe all things through the helpe of
Chriſt which ſtrengthens me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>A ſtrong Chriſtian hath a ſtrong Certificate that his ſinnes are
pardoned:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2</note> For the weaker a Chriſtian is, the weaker is his certificate, and
the ſtronger he is, the ſtronger it is: as a Childe in the cradle, the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
it is,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> the weaker is the crie; and the ſtronger it is, the more
ſtrength hath the cry in the eares of the parents; ſo it is with a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,
if hee bee ſtrong hee makes the ſtronger crye in the eares of
God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>A ſtrong Chriſtian is bold to confeſſe Chriſt in the time of
trouble;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3</note> as the Apoſtle did, <hi>Acts,</hi> 5. ſo it is ſaid of the Saints, <hi>Revel.</hi> 12.
<hi>That they loved not their lives to the death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4</note> 
                  <hi>A ſtrong Chriſtian is contented with any thing that God ſends,</hi>
as <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>I have learned in all eſtates therewith to be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
to want and to abound, to be full, and to be emptie:</hi> ſo old <hi>Eli</hi> ſaid, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.
<hi>It is the Lord, let him doe as it pleaſeth him.</hi> Now theſe are in a Chriſtian,
either ſtronger or weaker, according as he is weakned with temptations
And therefore let us labour to feele theſe workes of the Spirit, for the
Spirit is all the evidence we have of Heaven and happineſſe: therefore
let us looke to have the ſpirit, that we be not deceived. A man that hath
houſe and land would be loth to have his deeds and his evidences to
prove naught,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and ſo to loſe his houſe and land: much more ſhould we
be loth to have our evidence that we have of Heaven and happineſſe to
prove naught.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="505" facs="tcp:17958:258"/>
Here it will be worthy our inquiry;<note place="margin">SER. LVI.</note> 
                  <hi>How a Chriſtian that was ſtrong
and is weakned by ſinne may know that the Holy Ghoſt is in him? In all the
declinings and fallings of the faithfull,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">How a ſtrong weakned Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian may know the Holy Ghoſt is in him.</note> 
                  <hi>there is a roote of grace left;</hi> although
the Diuell cut off the Boughes and the Branches, yet the root is ſafe; as
<hi>Daniel</hi> 4. <hi>Nabuchadnezzar</hi> is compared to a tree, which the Angell is ſent
to cut downe the body and the branches, but to let the ſtumpe of it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine,
and bee bound with iron: ſo though the Divell cut downe the
boughes and branches,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> yet the roote is faſt, which is a comfort to the
Church, that in all their falls, there is a roote of grace remaining.</p>
               <p>But how may a man know this?<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> I anſwere, three wayes:</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>If ever he had the workes of grace in him at any time, though hee ſee or
feele nothing,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>yet there is a roote of grace remaining.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sol.</note> I have ſhewed you, if
God give his Spirit, hee will never quite take it away; therefore if hee
can finde this,<note place="margin">The roote is not gone.</note> that there hath beene a worke of grace in him, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
there is a roote left: if he can finde but a few live-coales raked up
in the dead aſhes, there is hope of fire and ſome comfort though he ſee
nothing for the preſent: therefore we muſt looke backe to ſee whether
ever we have felt the worke of grace or no; if wee can finde wee have,
we may aſſure our ſelves that the ſpirit of God is in us, and that there is
a roote of grace left in us. This was <hi>Davids</hi> comfort, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77. saith hee,
<hi>I thought on the time paſt, and my ſoule received comfort:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> If a man put fiſh
into a Pond, and comes thither againe and ſees them not, yet he is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
that they are there, though covered with water: ſo if a man be
once ſtored with the graces of God, though hee ſees and feeles them
not, yet muſt he be perſwaded that he hath them ſtill: it is a corruption
in the eſtate of weakneſſe, to thinke the Divell hath deceived them, and
that all was nothing that was in them: but wee muſt take heed of this,
that we doe not bely God. We read <hi>Malach.</hi> 1. How<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Lord ſaith,
<hi>That he hath loved the people:</hi> and they ſay, <hi>wherein haſt thou loved us?</hi>
Therefore it is a good thing when the Lord ſhall love us in our conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and in our repentance that we doe acknowledge it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">4</note> A man may know it by the deſires of grace that there is a roote
left,<note place="margin">By deſires of grace left.</note> 
                  <hi>which are foure in number:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>to grieve that wee cannot grieve for ſinne;</hi> and to mourne that
we cannot mourne:<note place="margin">To grieve that we cannot griev for ſinne.</note> If we deſire to weepe as others doe, this is a deſire
of grace, nature will not doe this. So <hi>Eſay,</hi> 63. 17. The Church of God
complaines of this, ſaying, <hi>O Lord, why haſt thou made us to erre from thy
wayes, and hardened our hearts from thy feare?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>to deſire the reconciliation and love and favour of God above all
things,</hi> which though he feeles not,<note place="margin">Deſire of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation.</note> yet hee longs for it, and deſires it
above all worldly things whatſoever, and would give a world to have
the ſenſe and feeling of Gods favour; Thus we ſee the Church <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.
when ſhe had loſt Chriſt, ſhe ſeekes after him, and ſhe runnes here and
there to find him: ſo when we have loſt Chriſt, we long for him and our
deſire is after him, this of a ſuretie is a deſire of grace: ſo <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. ſaith
<hi>Chriſt, Bleſſed are they that hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſſe,</hi> though they
have it not, yet <hi>they ſhall be ſatisfied:</hi> A man in the time of his weakeneſſe
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:17958:259"/>
thinkes his caſe to bee but miſerable; and yet the Spirit of God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth
him a happy man.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>a deſire to beleeve;</hi> though a man doe not beleeve for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
yet he deſireth to beleeve,<note place="margin">A deſire to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve.</note> and ſtriveth againſt infidelity; this is a
deſire of grace; if a man feeles this, hee may aſſure himſelfe there is a
roote of grace left in him. <hi>Mark.</hi> 9. ſaith Chriſt unto the man, <hi>canſt thou
beleeve? Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I beleeve, but helpe my unbeleefe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4</note> 
                  <hi>a deſire to pleaſe God in all our courſes;</hi> though wee have ſome
ſinnes and corruptions,<note place="margin">A deſire to pleaſ God in all things.</note> yet wee deſire to bee rid of them and to walke
with God; theſe deſires of new obedience, doe ſhew there is a roote
of grace left. As <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. ſaith <hi>David, O that my heart were directed to
keepe thy Law:</hi> and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40. <hi>I deſire to doe thy will O Lord:</hi> indeed Lord, I
confeſſe I doe not thy will, but I deſire to doe it: by theſe deſires wee
may know that there is a roote of grace left.</p>
               <p>But here may be <hi>an Objection</hi> made;<note place="margin">Object.</note> 
                  <hi>Had not Herod good deſires and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam,
yet theſe had no roote of Grace in them?</hi> To this I anſwere, <hi>Balaam</hi> had
good deſires,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> hee deſired the end, but not the meanes that tends to the
end; he deſired to be happy, but he did not deſire to be holy: The wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
deſire grace, but they doe not uſe the meanes to come to it:
A carnall man may deceive himſelfe in this, therefore if men
deſire grace, Heaven, and happineſſe, they muſt vſe the meanes to
come by it, which is by Prayer, and hearing the Word preached,
receiving the Sacraments, reading of the Word, and ſuch like
duties.</p>
               <p>The third meanes whereby a man may know that there is a roote of
grace left in him,<note place="margin">3</note> is,<note place="margin">By ſome wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</note> 
                  <hi>If he can finde ſome working of the Spirit, in this estate,
the roote is faſt:</hi> As a man may know the Sunne is up though hee ſee not
the Sunne,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> but a little glimpſe of it, ſo by ſome little workings of the
Spirit, he may know he hath the Spirit. The firſt worke is, <hi>That hee
would not grieve God for a world;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1</note> hee hates ſinne, he cannot abide it; hee
would not ſweare, nor lie, nor prophane the Sabboth, nor commit any
ſinne willingly: in this caſe he may aſſure himſelfe he hath the Spirit of
God in him. Secondly, <hi>that although hee falls into ſome ſinne, yet hee holds
his care and love to all other holy duties:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2</note> as <hi>David</hi> did in that foule ſinne of
adultery, when he had fallen into it, yet hee came to the Temple, did
hold himſelfe to performe holy duties ſtill. Thirdly, <hi>to hold our love to
God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>and to Gods people:</hi> when he loves a Chriſtian as a Chriſtian; ſaith S.
<hi>Iohn, hereby we know that we are tranſlated from death to life, becauſe wee love
the brethren.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, the Vſe of this is, that ſeeing in the falls of the Godly there
is alwayes a roote left,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> therefore wee ſhould labour to nouriſh and to
hold this roote; that is, to nouriſh theſe good deſires, the love of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and the hatred of ſinne. If a man hath a good plant in his Garden,
if bad fellowes come and cut downe the boughes and branches,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> what
will he doe? he will goe and digge about the roote, dung it, and labor
to preſerve and nouriſh it: ſo when there is a plant of goodneſſe in a
Chriſtian, if the Divell come and cut downe the boughes and branches,
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:17958:259"/>
nevertheleſſe, we muſt labour to nouriſh the roote by the Uſe of good
meanes.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> ſeeing there is a roote left in all the falls of the godly,
therefore wee muſt bee thankefull to God, when wee have a deſire to
pleaſe him in all our courſes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, ſeeing there is a roote of grace left in all the falls of the
godly:<note place="margin">3</note> Therefore if we cannot finde theſe workings of the Spirit, nor
the deſires in us, but perceive our ſelves to be dead hearted, it is a ſhrewd
ſigne that there is no roote of grace: yet I ſay not but that God may in
time, and in the uſe of meanes, worke grace in ſuch a heart, but for the
preſent, I can give such a diſpoſition no incouragement of that eſtate,
till God worke more in them.</p>

good and benefit wee have by the Holy Ghoſt:
for when we know the great good that comes by
the Holy Ghoſt, it will make us to priſe it when
wee have it, and to ſeeke for it when we want it:
Therefore, it ſhall not be amiſſe to ſee what this
great good and benefit, is, that we have by the holy Ghoſt. The Prophet
<hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 51. 11. prayes, <hi>Lord take not thy Holy Spirit from me,</hi> though
thou take away my peace, my Children, my crowne and kingdome,
and other bleſſings, yet Lord take not thy Spirit from me; <hi>David</hi> knew
the Spirit of God was a greater bleſſing than Peace, Children, Crowne,
Kingdome, than all other bleſſings, and benefits whatſoever. It is true
indeede that the benefits of the Holy Ghoſt are unſpeakeable, that no
man can ſee them in the full latitude and extention, becauſe God is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite,

ſixe <hi>ſpeciall benefits that we have by the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt worke is <hi>to ſhew us our wretched and miſerable eſtate,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sixe benefits we have by the holy Ghoſt.</note> that wee
ſtand in till we be brought home to Chriſt: for no ſooner are wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
to enter into an eſtate of grace,<note place="margin">1</note> but preſently there is kept a
marvellous ſtirre,<note place="margin">To ſhew us our miſerable eſtate.</note> which troubles and diſquiets us as long as the <hi>ſtrong
man holds poſſeſsion: Luk.</hi> 1. 21. Becauſe the Spirit of God once come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us, ſhewes us our ſinnes, and the wrath of God againſt them, and
that Hell is ready for us, and then our thoughts cannot chuſe but bee
exceedingly troubled, and we are ſo amazed, as wee know not how to
turne us. Thus we ſee <hi>Paul</hi> was, <hi>Act.</hi> 9. three dayes together <hi>he eate no
meate,</hi> but prayed in heavineſſe and ſorrow: as <hi>Ezechiel</hi> 37. before life
came into the dead bones, there was a noyſe, a ratling, ſhaking and
trembling amongſt them:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſo before the Lord puts ſpirituall life into us,
there is as it were a noyſe, and a trembling, and a ſhaking for ſinne. This
is the worſt wee ſhall feele from the Holy Ghoſt, which is harſh to the
fleſh, but comfortable to the Spirit; becauſe it is as an holy vomit that
the Lord gives us to purge out our ſins and corruptions, which though
bitter in taſte at firſt, is comfortable and giving eaſe at the latter end:
So <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. Chriſt ſaith <hi>Bleſſed are ye that mourne, for ye ſhall be comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;</hi>
and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 126. <hi>They which ſow in teares, ſhall reape in joy:</hi> So that there
is no teares more bleſſed and happy, than thoſe that are ſhed out for
ſinne. Therefore in the harſheſt worke of the Spirit there is comfort:
as <hi>Matth.</hi> 1. <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was ſore perplexed about <hi>Mary,</hi> and he thought
to put her away ſecretly,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> till the Angell came to him and ſaid, <hi>Feare not
Ioſeph to take Mary to be thy Wife, for that which is conceived in her, is of
the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> So when a chriſtian is perplexed and troubled with his
ſinnes, let him not be afraid, for it is from the Holy Ghoſt: So <hi>Gen.</hi> 25.
21. when <hi>Rebecca</hi> had conceived the Children daſhed in her wombe,
that is,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> they ſtrove together, <hi>Why am I thus, ſaith ſhee?</hi> and thereupon
asked the Lord, who ſaid unto her, <hi>Two Nations are in thy Wombe; of whom
the one ſhall be mightier than the other; and the elder ſhall ſerve the yonger;</hi> So
when a Chriſtian ſhall feele a ſtriving in him, let him be of good comfort,
there are two within him, the ſpirit and the fleſh, the elder ſhall ſerve
the younger; the fleſh ſhall bee but a ſlave to the ſpirit. So then in the
harſheſt worke of the ſpirit there is comfort; and if there bee comfort
in the troubleſomeſt worke, what comfort is there in the reſt of the
benefits?</p>
               <p>The ſecond benefit is,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>Illumination, to teach us the whole will of God as
ſhall bee needfull for our ſalvation;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Illumination of Gods Will.</note> and ſo Chriſt ſaith in this place, <hi>But the
comforter which is the holy Ghoſt, whom the Father will ſend in my name, he ſhall
teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance which I have told
you;</hi> and <hi>Iohn.</hi> 6. 45. ſaith he, <hi>they ſhall all be taught of God:</hi> ſo alſo 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi>
2. 27. <hi>But the anointing which yee receive dwelleth in you, and yee need not that
any man teach you, but as the ſame anointing teacheth you all things:</hi> this is
another benefit we have by the Holy Ghoſt, to teach us all knowledge
needfull for our ſalvation. A number of people complaine they can
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:17958:260"/>
learne nothing though they have meanes and good meanes too:
the reaſon is, becauſe they have not got this inward Doctor the Holy Ghoſt
to teach them: therefore let us pray to God to give us this inward Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
to teach and inſtruct us, and to give us all knowledge needfull for
our ſalvation.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>by two meanes the holy Ghoſt doth teach us;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Two waies the Holy Ghoſt teacheth. Firſt, by opening our hearts.</note> firſt, <hi>by opening our hearts
to underſtand the Scriptures,</hi> making us capable of the high things of God;
the <hi>Iewes</hi> had a veile hung over their hearts in the reading of the Law,
as ye may read, 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 3. 13. ſo all people have a veile hung over
their hearts, that in ſeeing they cannot ſee nor perceive. Now the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghoſt takes downe this veile, for as at the death of Chriſt the veile
of the Temple was rent that a man might see into the most Holy place;
ſo the Holy Ghoſt doth teare this ſame veile that wee may ſee into the
high things of God.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> A man that ſits in a darke houſe cannot ſee to doe
any thing, yet if one come and open a window or a caſement and ſo lets
in light, he may then ſee to doe whatſoever pleaſeth him; ſo we be here
as in a darke houſe, and the Holy Ghoſt opens as it were a window or a
caſement, and lets sin light to us; therefore it is ſaid, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. that <hi>the
Lord opened the heart of Lydia;</hi> and ſo <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. it is ſaid, <hi>then hee opened
their underſtanding:</hi> So the Holy Ghoſt it is that muſt open our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding;
for we may read and heare, but if the Holy Ghoſt doth not
open our hearts we ſhall be never the better for that we read or heare.</p>
               <p>The ſecond meanes is,<note place="margin">Secondly, by ſtrengthening our memory.</note> by <hi>cauſing us to remember the good things that hath
beene taught us;</hi> through corruption of nature we are ready to forget the
good things that wee have heard. The woman in the Goſpell had a
flux of blood, but we have a flux of memory to let ſlipthe a thing that is
good: to repaire which infirmity the Holy Ghoſt teacheth us how to
retaine and keepe them; ſo we ſee in this place Chriſt ſaith, that <hi>the holy
Ghoſt ſhall bring to our remembrance all things whatſoever hee hath taught us.</hi>
The old <hi>Romans</hi> had certaine men whom they called <hi>Amemores,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> that is,
remembrances; when they had any weighty matter to be done, one
put them in minde of it afore, there was ſuch a thing to be done; ſo the
Lord doth by the holy Ghoſt, he makes him our remembrancer to put
us in minde that there is ſuch and ſuch a thing to be done, for there is a
number of good things that wee forget, whereof the Holy Ghoſt puts
us in minde. There be a number of people complaine that they cannot
remember any thing their memory is ſo bad, but let him labour to get
the Holy Ghoſt and he will teach them to remember and help memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in a man. The Diſciples of Chriſt did not underſtand but forgot
ſome things that he had told them of: but when the Holy Ghoſt was
ſent to them hee brought it to their remembrance; as ſoone therefore
as he was riſen from the dead, it is ſaid his Diſciples <hi>remembred</hi> that hee
thus and thus ſaid unto them, if a man have the Holy Ghoſt, hee will
bring a thouſand things to our remembrance which we forget, it is an
opinion of ſome that if a man go to Church and learne nothing, he were
better be at home; for (ſay they) hee were as good tarry at home and
learne nothing as to goe to Church and carry away nothing. To this I
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:17958:261"/>
anſwer, doe not tarry at home but come ſtill though thou doe not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
them for the preſent nor remember them, labour to get the
Holy Ghoſt and he will make thee to underſtand them, and bring them
to thy remembrance though thou haſt forgotten them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>third benefit</hi> that wee have by the holy Ghoſt,<note place="margin">Thirdly, Holy Regiment and Government.</note> is <hi>holy regiment and
government;</hi> that he guides and governs the hearts of the faithfull: as a
man that dwelleth in a houſe will governe and guide the ſame, all ſhall
be ſubject to his will;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſo the Holy Ghoſt dwelleth in the hearts of the
faithfull, to governe, guide and to make them ſubject to his will: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 14. That <hi>the faithfull are led by the Spirit,</hi>
and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 143. 10. <hi>David</hi> prayeth, <hi>Lord let thy good Spirit lead me unto the
land of righteouſneſſe.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> The ſonnes of kings and princes though they ride
abroad and goe here and there, yet they have a Tutor and a governour
to goe with them that they doe nothing unſeemely or unfitting their
place, ſo the Lord doth though he ſends us here into the world, and lets
us goe up and downe, yet he ſends the Holy Ghoſt with us to bee our
monitor and Tutor that we ſhould not commit any thing unbeſeeming
us in our Chriſtian profeſſion. This is another benefit wee have by the
Holy Ghoſt, for if he did not guide us whither ſhould we runne? Now
by two ſpeciall actions the Holy Ghoſt doth governe us.</p>
               <p>The firſt is,<note place="margin">The Holy Ghoſt governesus two wayes. Firſt, by reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning evill.</note> 
                  <hi>by reſtraining and keeping of us backe from a number of ſinnes
that we ſhould elſe fall into;</hi> therefore when we are kept from any ſinne it
is the Spirit of God that doth it; ſo <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 17. ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>For
the fleſh luſteth againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit againſt the fleſh, and theſe are
contrary one to the other:</hi> inſomuch that wee cannot doe the ſame things
that wee would, ſo <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 7. <hi>Paul</hi> would have gone to <hi>Bithynia, and
the Spirit ſuffered him not:</hi> ſo then it is the Holy Ghoſt we ſee that keeps
and holds us back from ſinne. There is no Chriſtian but feeles this when
his corruption puts him on ſinne, it is the Holy Ghoſt that keepes us
backe and will not let us take our ſwing and ſway therein: what a
number of ſins ſhould wee fall into if the Holy Ghoſt ſhould not keepe
us? for we have the ſeeds and ſpawne of all ſinnes in us, therefore that
we are kept from the ſinnes and ſhames that others fall into, it is becauſe
the Holy Ghoſt keeps us from falling into them.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Secondly, by ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring us up to good.</note> 
                  <hi>by exciting and ſtirring of us up to good things,</hi> putting holy
motions and good thoughts into our minds, as <hi>Act.</hi> 7. it is ſaid that <hi>it
came into Moſes heart to goe and viſit his brethren: Moſes</hi> lived in <hi>Pharaohs</hi>
court, where he wanted not any thing, yet there was a thought came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his heart to goe and looke on the poore Church of God, and to pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
them; ſo when there is a motion comes into our minde to pittie our
poore brethren and to releeve them as occaſion ſhall be offered to doe
them good; it is the Holy Ghoſt that doth put it in us, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith
<hi>Galath.</hi> 4. 6. <hi>he hath ſent the Spirit of his Sonne into our hearts whereby wee
cry Abba, Father.</hi> Hence wee ſee it is the Spirit of God that ſtirres us up
to the duties of prayer and holineſſe.<note place="margin">The fourth Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit is, to give power to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>orme holy duties.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The fourth benefit is, <hi>To give us power and ability to performe Chriſtian
duties and ſervices,</hi> for the Spirit of God doth not onely open our hearts
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:17958:261"/>
to underſtand the Scripture, excite and ſtirre us up to good duties, but
doth alſo enable us to doe them; to repent of our ſinnes, to pray to God,
to love our brethren, to reſt and relye on God in the time of trouble. In
the ſtory of <hi>Sampſon,</hi> we ſee that he did ſhake himſelfe and did thinke to
have done great maters,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> yet for his life he could not becauſe his ſtrength
was gone: in like manner when wee ſee other men can pray, repent of
their ſins, when thou canſt not doe ſo, know it is the Holy Ghoſt that
doth inable thee; for there be a number of Chriſtian duties, that we are
no more able in the eſtate of nature to doe,<note place="margin">Impoſſible to a naturall man.</note> than a dead man can remove
a mountaine;<note place="margin">1</note> as when a man is truely humbled for ſinne and caſt downe,
that a naturall man ſhould looke up to God by the eyes of faith, to reſt
and to rely on him, for the ſaving of his ſoule; this hee is no more able
to doe than a dead man to remove a mountaine: ſo likewiſe for a man
to reſiſt a temptation agreeable to his nature,<note place="margin">2</note> he is no more able to doe
it, than a dead man to remoove a mountaine: againe, when a man is in
want and in need,<note place="margin">3</note> then to reſt and rely on God for the feeding of his
body, that as he hath truſted God with the ſaving of his ſoule, ſo hee
will rely on God for things needfull; a naturall man is no more able
to doe this than a dead man to remove a mountaine, but the Spirit of
God inables a man to doe that; for that which is impoſſible to nature
is made poſſible by the Spirit of God.</p>
               <p>The fift benefit is,<note place="margin">Fifthly, comfort in diſtreſſe.</note> 
                  <hi>to comfort in diſtreſſe;</hi> although a Man wants houſe
or land, and a number of outward comforts, yet if hee have the Holy
Ghoſt to comfort and aſſiſt him, hee neede not care for any thing elſe;
Therefore Chriſt ſaith to his Diſciples, <hi>I will ſend you a Comforter; in the
World ye ſhall have trouble, but he ſhall mitigate and aſſwage all your troubles:</hi>
So <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 31. it is ſaid, <hi>Then had the Churches reſt throughout all Iudea, Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
and Samaria, and were edified; walking in the feare of God, and in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of the Holy Ghoſt were multiplyed.</hi> Therefore, whatſoever our trouble
is, yet it is a great ſtay, that we ſhall have comfort in the Holy Ghoſt;
and not be driven to take up the complaint which <hi>David</hi> doth, in the
Perſon of Chriſt, <hi>I looked for ſome to have pittie on mee, but there was none;
and for comfort, but I found none:</hi> for though it be true of Chriſtians, that in
their trouble they looke for ſome to pitty and comfort them but they
finde none, yet nevertheleſſe in their extremity the Holy Ghoſt doth
comfort them; therefore if men want comfort in the time of trouble
what ſhall they doe? ſend for fidlers and merry company to comfort
them, as <hi>Saul</hi> did, and fall into relapſes? no, but wee muſt labour to get
the Holy Ghoſt to comfort us: for the comfort of the Holy Ghoſt goes
beyond all worldly comforts:</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">How the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the Holy Ghoſt ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

the ground of them is not good,</hi> wee may be taken from them and they
from us,<note place="margin">1</note> but the comfort of the Holy Ghoſt can never be taken from us,
<hi>becauſe it is grounded on Gods Love and favour,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">For <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  <hi>and hope of Heaven;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Divell and all the World ſhall never be able to take away this
comfort.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="512" facs="tcp:17958:262"/>
Secondly, <hi>becauſe all the comforts in this life be not pure and intire comforts,</hi>
but have alwayes ſome ſorrowes in them: as wee ſee <hi>Heſt.</hi> 5. when
<hi>Haman</hi> had all the glory that <hi>Ahaſhueroſh</hi> could afford him,<note place="margin">2</note> yet he was
not at quiet,<note place="margin">In regard of Puritie.</note> becauſe <hi>Mordecai</hi> ſate at the kings gate: the cup of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
here in this world, is a mixed cup, like to Chriſts cup, mingled with
wine and Myrrh,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> much bitterneſſe: ſo all our worldly comfort is mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with gall; But the comfort that we have by the Holy Ghoſt is pure
and intire, it comforts us in all the diſtreſſes that befall us; It made <hi>Paul</hi>
and <hi>Silas ſing in Priſon, Acts</hi> 16. It made the Apoſtles <hi>goe away rejoycing
that they had ſuffered rebuke for the Name of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>becauſe all worldly comfort failes and leaves us at the day of death;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In regard of Death.</note>
when the more comfort we have had by it, the more griefe it will bee
to part from it. Therefore Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. to the rich man, <hi>Thou
foole, this night ſhall thy ſoule be pulled away from thee:</hi> but the comfort of
the Holy Ghoſt is moſt beneficiall and refreſhing at the day of death,
becauſe then we draw neere to the accompliſhment of Gods promiſes:
as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 7. <hi>I have fought a good fight, and have finiſhed my courſe,
I have kept the faith, from henceforth is laid up for mee the Crowne of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,
which the righteous Iudge ſhall give at that day:</hi> hence we conclude
all worldly comfort is not comparale to it. And here I thinke there is
none, but will aſſent with me to pray to God to give us the Holy Ghoſt,
as <hi>David</hi> prayes <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. <hi>That God would lift up the light of his countenance
upon him,</hi> howſoever others deſire other things, let us pray to God,
though wee want many outward comforts, yet that wee may have the
holy Ghoſt to comfort us. Now there are three ſpeciall times that the
Holy Ghoſt doth comfort in.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. In trouble and affliction.</item>

               </list>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Holy Ghoſt doth comfort us in</hi> trouble and affliction three wayes:<note place="margin">1</note>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In affliction, by perſwading of Gods love.</note> by perſwading us that God is our Father, and that he will not leave us, but
will ſtand by us in the time of our trouble: <hi>as</hi> Pſal. 23. 4. David <hi>ſaith,</hi> Yea,
though I ſhould walke through the valley of the ſhadow of death, yet I will feare
no evill, for thou art with me: <hi>So</hi> Pſal. 27. The Lord is my light and my ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
whom ſhall I feare? The Lord is the ſtrength of my life, of whom ſhall I bee
afraid? <hi>this is one meanes whereby the Holy Ghoſt doth comfort;
therefore if a man have the holy Ghoſt he neede not care, becauſe that
will comfort and uphold him in all the trouble that doth befall him.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note>

<hi>All things ſhall worke to the good of them that love God.</hi> There be many things
that ſeeme to goe againſt Chriſtians, all which yet the Lord turnes to
their good: the <hi>Philiſtians</hi> could not reſolve <hi>Sampſons</hi> riddle, but every
Chriſtian can, as honey came out of the dead body of the Lion, ſo a

trouble and affliction,<note place="margin">By comfort that our trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles ſhall have an end.</note> by perſwading of us, that God will turne all to
our good.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, the holy Ghoſt doth comfort us by perſwading of us that</hi>
                  <pb n="513" facs="tcp:17958:262"/>
God will ſet an end to all our troubles: <hi>as it is ſaid,</hi> Pſal. 102. That God will

                  </gap> therefore I ſhall not much be moved. <hi>Now</hi>
three wayes the Holy Ghoſt giveth us comfort in affliction; <hi>Firſt,</hi> by perſwading
us that God will take it away; <hi>Secondly,</hi> that if he doth not take it away, he will
mitigate and aſſwage it,<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>as</hi> Pſal. 18. David <hi>ſaith,</hi> by my God, I have leaped over

                  <hi>although God did not take away the wall, or though hee doth

wall.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> that though he doth not mitigate or aſſwage it, that yet he will

                  <hi>as it is in the</hi> Pſalme, I cried unto

               <p>The ſecond time is,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>In the distreſſe of Conſcience;</hi> of all diſtreſſe there is

hath ſent his Spirit into thy heart to beare witneſſe unto thy ſpirit that
thou art the Childe of God.</p>

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2</note> by perſwading us that there is a ſeede of grace in our hearts; <hi>as</hi>

in all the faithfull, though they goe aſtray and wander, yet
they doe as the ſheepe, cry unto the ſhepheard, and are not at reſt till
they be brought home to God; So we ſee</hi> David <hi>did, in the</hi> Pſal. 119.
(<hi>ſaith he</hi>) I have gone astray like a loſt ſheepe, Lord ſeeke thy ſervant, for I have
not forgot thy Commandements.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The third ſpeciall time is,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3</note> at the day of death, when all comforts faile us,
<hi>then the holy Ghoſt comforts us,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">At the day of death, the Holy Ghoſt comforts.</note> by perſwading us that God is our Father,
and that we are going home to him, and are at peace with him. <hi>Thus</hi> Iohn 17.

unto the comming of the day of God,<note place="margin">Comfort.</note> 
                  <hi>So it ſhould be comfort to a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,

               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>The Holy Ghoſt doth comfort us by perſwading that Heaven is
opened for us,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Comfort.</note> 
                  <hi>and that the Angels are ready to receive us;</hi> and that the ending
of this life, is the beginning of a better. We read, <hi>Gen.</hi> 26. 6. when <hi>Iaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kob</hi>
                  <pb n="514" facs="tcp:17958:263"/>
was going to <hi>Padan Aram,</hi> he laid him downe to ſleepe upon a ſtone,
where he ſaw a viſion, a ladder reared up that reacht to Heaven, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
aſcending and deſcending thereupon, and Chriſt ready to receive
them at the head of the ladder: So <hi>Acts</hi> 7. <hi>Stephan</hi> at the time of death,
<hi>ſaw Heaven opened, and Chriſt ſtanding at the right hand of God,</hi> ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him: ſuch comfortable viſions ſhall the people of God have at
the time of death; at leaſt ſuch comforts as ſhall be fit to comfort them
in this.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>By perſwading us that although our bodies rot and conſume, yet one
day they ſhall riſe againe to glory and happineſſe:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Comfort.</note> ſo <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith, <hi>I know that my
Redeemer liveth, and that he ſhall ſtand the laſt on the Earth; and though after
my skin worms destroy my body, yet ſhall I ſee God with my eyes:</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> 11. 23.
Ieſus ſaith to <hi>Mortha, thy brother ſhall riſe againe:</hi> to whom <hi>Martha</hi> replies,
<hi>I know he ſhall riſe in the reſurrection at the laſt day.</hi> Therefore howſoever
our bodies rot and conſume in the Grave, yet one day they ſhall riſe to
glory and happineſſe. It is a good meditation of a learned man, at the
time of death, and of thy departure, thinke of all the good doctrines
that have beene taught thee of good Preachers, to comfort thy ſelfe
with them; remember that Ieſus Chriſt is the Lambe of God that was
crucified and killed for thy ſinnes, and is ready to receive thee; who
tooke order in his laſt Will and Teſtament for thee, as <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. <hi>Father</hi>
(ſaith he) <hi>I will that where I am, there they be alſo:</hi> and to the theefe on the
Croſſe, <hi>This day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe:</hi> So reſt thy ſelfe in this
hope, and goe thy way to thy Chriſt, goe home to <hi>Abraham, Iſaak,</hi> and
<hi>Iaakob,</hi> and to all the holy men departed, and ſuch as are behinde ſhall
follow after, where we ſhall all meete together to behold God in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and ſing praiſes to him world without end: So this comfort that we
have by the Holy Ghoſt, will ſtand by us, when all comfort will faile.</p>
               <p>The ſixth benefit we have by the Holy Ghoſt is,<note place="margin">6</note> 
                  <hi>abilitie and power to
performe any ſpeciall calling;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Benefit.</note> for there is no man that can performe any
ſpeciall calling till the holy Ghoſt hath enabled him: as 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. it is
ſaid, <hi>The Spirit of God came upon Saul, and made him fit for governement;</hi>
and <hi>Acts</hi> 2. the Spirit of God came downe upon the Apoſtles and made
them fit to preach to all Nations; ſo <hi>Exod.</hi> 38. 2. it is ſaid of <hi>Bezaleel,</hi> that
<hi>He was filled with the Spirit of God in wiſedome, understanding, knowledge, and
in all workemanſhip, to finde out curious workes in gold, ſilver, and in braſſe:</hi> So
there is no calling that a man can take in hand, that he is able to perform
till he be fitted for it by the holy Ghoſt. There is a common complaint
amongſt men in regard of their ſervants, and many diſorders, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of it is, becauſe men want the holy Ghoſt; for if men had the holy
ſpirit, he would make a ſupply of our wants and amend all diſorders.</p>
               <p>The generall Vſe that wee are to make of this doctrine is,<note place="margin">Vſe</note> that men
pray for this bleſſing of the holy Ghoſt; when <hi>Elias</hi> was taken into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
from <hi>Eliſha,</hi> ſaith <hi>Elias</hi> to him, <hi>What ſhall I doe for thee?</hi> unto whom
<hi>Eliſha</hi> ſaid,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> 
                  <hi>I pray thee that thy Spirit may be doubled upon me.</hi> And ſo Chriſt
going to Heaven ſaith, what ſhall I doe for thee? our requeſt muſt be,
that his Spirit may bee doubled upon us, to comfort us in any diſtreſſe,
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:17958:263"/>
but ſpecially in the great diſtreſſe of conſcience at the time of death,<note place="margin">SERM. LVIII.</note>
and that it may inable us to performe the ſpeciall calling that wee bee
now ſet to performe and live by.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving ſpoken <hi>of the benefits</hi> that wee have by the Holy
Ghoſt, in the next place wee are to conſider whether
we may loſe the Holy Ghoſt or the grace that is once
given us of God: worldly bleſſings a man may loſe,
he may loſe riches, favour of friends, his lands and
life, his skinne and teeth; he may loſe his riches (as
<hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith) that <hi>riches have wings like an Eagle;</hi> hee may loſe favour of
friends, as <hi>Iob,</hi> 5. 15. Chriſt ſaith to the rich man, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. <hi>This night
will I come and take away thy ſoule:</hi> and ſo of all other worldly bleſſings:
but if a man have once the Holy Ghoſt given him, hee ſhall never loſe
the ſame; therefore to have his comforts is a greater bleſſing than all
worldly bleſſings whatſoever; as <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I will pray the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and he will give you another Comforter;</hi> another manner of Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than I am; For I muſt leave the world and goe home to my Father,
I cannot tarry with you; but this Comforter ſhall tarry and abide with
you to end, and ſhall not leave you till you are brought home to
God; therefore above all bleſſings, let us deſire this bleſſing and pray
to God for it. Now for the better clearing of this, wee will lay downe
theſe three concluſions:</p>
               <p>The firſt concluſion is,<note place="margin">The firſt Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> that <hi>nature is ready to quench and to expell the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
as much as may be;</hi> I meane corrupt nature, as it is tainted and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with ſinne: and hereof we have two grounds:</p>
               <p>The firſt is;<note place="margin">The firſt Ground.</note> 
                  <hi>in that two contrary things comming together doe labour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
each other,</hi> as fire and water, the one being hot and the other cold,
doe make oppoſition;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſo the Spirit and our nature are two contraries,
flat oppoſites one to another, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. <hi>The fleſh luſteth
againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit againſt the fleſh, and theſe are contrary the one
to the other, ſo as yee cannot doe what yee would:</hi> ſo becauſe they bee flat op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſites
one againſt another; therefore they labour to deſtroy and ſeeke
the overthrow one of another as much as may be: ſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. we may
ſee how the Spirit and the fleſh buſtle one with another; for (ſaith hee)
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:17958:264"/>
                  <hi>I delight in the law of God concerning the inner man. But I ſee another law in
my members rebelling againſt the law of my minde, and leading mee captive un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the law of ſinne, which is in my members;</hi> here is the fleſh labouring to
ſubdue and weaken the Spirit.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ground is,<note place="margin">The ſecond Ground.</note> 
                  <hi>that nature ſeekes to returne and to recover nature as
much as may be;</hi> as it is the nature of a ſtone to lye below, in a low place;
therefore if ye take a ſtone and lay it on a ſhelfe it will abide as long as
the ſhelfe holds it,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> but take away the ſhelfe and the ſtone fals downe
againe, becauſe it is the nature of it to lye below; in like manner alſo it
is the nature of many fowles to live in the water; therefore as ſonne as
they be hatched almoſt, they will runne into the water: even ſo though
Grace reſtraine nature for a little time, yet it doth labour to returne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
as much as may be: therefore <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88. 11. <hi>David</hi> prayes, <hi>knit my
heart unto thy Law;</hi> ſo prone and apt was hee (though a man after Gods
owne heart) to bee carried away from God to corruption, and to ſlippe
from him, that hee prayes to God to uphold him: and <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts
Chriſtians in this place, that they doe not <hi>quench the Spirit:</hi> the Spirit
may be quenched, but take heed that you doe not <hi>quench it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now becauſe the Spirit is compared to fire,<note place="margin">The wayes to quench the Sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</note> therefore looke how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
wayes a man may quench fire, ſo many wayes a man may quench the
Spirit.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Firſt, by with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing the matter.</note> 
                  <hi>by with drawing the matter that ſhould nouriſh the fire:</hi> when men
doe not bring fewell to nouriſh the fire, the fire will quench and goe
out: therefore the Prieſts in the Law, were commanded to bring freſh
wood every morning and evening, <hi>Levit.</hi> 5. 12. ſo the Spirit of God
will quench in us, if we withdraw that which ſhould nouriſh it; if wee
doe not heare the Word preached, pray and read the Scripture, and
conferre of good things: for the Apoſtle joynes theſe two together,
<hi>quench not the Spirit, deſpiſe not propheſying,</hi> meaning when men deſpiſe
propheſying, they take the courſe to quench the Spirit and to decay it.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Secondly, by powring on wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> 
                  <hi>by powring on of cold water:</hi> this will quench and put out
the fire, ſo the contrary motions of the Spirit will quench the Spirit; for
every ſinne wee commit is as a bucket of water flung on the Spirit to
quench and to put it out. <hi>Iudg.</hi> 16. wee ſee that <hi>Sampſon</hi> through looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and wantonneſſe keeping company with <hi>Delilah,</hi> the Spirit of God
was decaied in him, and his ſtrength: for hee ſhooke himſelfe and
thought to have done as he did at other times, but could not: thus <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>
did quench the Spirit of God in him by his bad life; ſo our ſinnes
being contrary motions to the Spirit, doe quench the Spirit.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Thirdly, by ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering.</note> 
                  <hi>by ſmothering out the fire;</hi> for although a man doth not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
the matter that ſhould nouriſh the fire, or powre cold water on to
quench it;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> yet a man may quench fire by heaping on of earth and mold,
yea, even the bare weight and burthen of greene wood will ſmother
out the fire; after the ſame manner, though a man doth not withdraw
himſelfe from the uſe of good meanes, nor doth commit groſſe ſinnes;
yet overmuch care for the World and the things of this life, will
quench the Spirit of God; when a man ſpends all his time about his
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:17958:264"/>
worldly buſineſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and hath no time to ſerve God, this is a great meanes
to quench the ſpirit. Chriſt tels us, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 22. that <hi>the thornes choake
the good ſeede;</hi> that is, the thornes ſucke and draw away the heart of the
ground, that the good ſeede cannot thrive and proſper: ſo the cares for
the things of this life and about our worldly buſineſſe, doe ſucke away
the heart of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4</note> 
                  <hi>by negligence,</hi> for if we doe not ſtir up the fire, lay the brands
together and blow it,<note place="margin">Negligence.</note> it will quench and goe out, ſo if men be negligent
and doe not ſtirre up the graces of God that are in them, and lay as it
were the brands together and blow them, the Spirit of God wil quench
in them. Therefore the Apoſtle exhorts, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 6. <hi>To ſtirre up the gift
of God in him.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> 
                  <hi>Origen, Hom.</hi> 15. ſaith, if God ſhould kindle a fire to heat
thee, and it were like to goe out, wouldſt not thou lay the brands toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
ſtirre it up, and ſo nouriſh it; ſo God hath kindled a fire in our
hearts by his Spirit, therefore wee muſt not through negligence let it
dye and goe out, but ſtirre up the graces of God that are in us, that they
do not quench: theſe be the foure meanes that will quench the ſpirit:
therefore, corrupt nature is the greateſt enemy to the graces of God in
us that can be. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaith well, <hi>No man hath any hurt, but it is in
himſelfe;</hi> in this caſe all the hurt that the ſpirit of God hath in us, is
by our ſelves, by our earthlineſſe, and by neglecting of good things,
and for want of ſtirring up the graces of God that be in us.</p>
               <p>The ſecond concluſion is,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>That a man may have common graces of the
ſpirit,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Concluſion.</note> 
                  <hi>ſuch as are common to good and bad, to the Elect and reprobate, theſe a man
may loſe:</hi> as firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> a man may be inlightned and indued with Heavenly
knowledge, and talke wiſely of high points, and yet he may loſe this,
becauſe this is a common grace, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4. there were ſome that were
<hi>inlightned and had tasted of the good Word of God, and of the power of the
world to come,</hi> who nevertheleſſe may yet fall away.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> there may bee a feeling of good things, a man may have
a deſire to be ſaved, and to behold God in glory, as <hi>Balaam</hi> had <hi>Num<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 23.
a man may loſe theſe, becauſe they be common graces; therefore it is
a good obſervation of one, <hi>That the wicked may taſte of the Heavenly power,
and of the good Word of God, but theſe bee not the things they live by;</hi> as a
Cooke that dreſſes a dinner, hee may taſte of the meate, and licke his
fingers,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> but it is not that he liveth by, he liveth by ſomewhat elſe: ſo a
reprobate may taſte of the good Word of God, and have feeling of
good things, as quietneſſe of conſcience and other of Gods favours,
and yet nevertheleſſe he ſhall not be ſaved thereby, they ſhall not bee
able to bring him to life everlaſting.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, a man may have reſtraining grace, and be reſtrained from a
number of ſinnes, or a man may have the ſpirit of governement, as <hi>Saul</hi>
had, and yet hee may loſe it; as we ſee, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 14. <hi>The Spirit of God
departed from Saul;</hi> ſo a man may bee fitted for a calling, and diſcharge
it wiſely, and yet may loſe this, becauſe it is a common grace: for all
common graces a man may loſe.<note place="margin">3</note>
               </p>
               <p>The third concluſion is,<note place="margin">Concluſion.</note> 
                  <hi>That there be peculiar graces proper to Gods elect,
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:17958:265"/>
theſe ſhall never be loſt,</hi> as <hi>Regeneration, Sanctification,</hi> and <hi>Iustification;</hi> which
may comfort a Chriſtian, who though hee may loſe his wife and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
his goods and life,<note place="margin">Foure grounds that the Spirit once truely gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, is never fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally loſt.</note> yet if he hath the ſpirit of God, hee cannot loſe
that; and there is foure grounds for it:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The firſt is,</hi> the promiſe of God; <hi>as that</hi> Pſal. 89. 30, 31. <hi>ſaith God,</hi> But if
his children forſake my Law, and walke not in my judgements, if they breake my
Statutes and keepe not my commandements,<note place="margin">1</note> then will I viſite their tranſgreſſion
with the rod,<note place="margin">The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>romiſe of God.</note> and their iniquitie with ſtrokes; yet my loving kindneſſe will I not
take from him, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſecond is,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2</note> the Power of God; <hi>as</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 5. <hi>ſaith the Apoſtle of the</hi>
Faithfull,<note place="margin">The Power of God.</note> which are kept by the power of God through Faith to Salvation.</p>
               <p>The third is,<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>the Prayer of Chriſt; Iohn</hi> 17. 20. <hi>I pray not for theſe alone,
but for them alſo which ſhall beleeve in me through their Word:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chriſts Prayer.</note> ſo then this
prayer of Chriſt was not onely effectuall for <hi>Peter</hi> and for the reſt of the
Apoſtles, but also effectuall for all the Elect people of God.</p>
               <p>The fourth is,<note place="margin">4</note> the nature of the Spirit, which is alwayes as a <hi>ſeede re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
in them,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">From the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the ſeed.</note> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 9. ſo Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. <hi>that the water which he
ſhould give them, ſhould be a Well of water ſpringing up to Eternall life.</hi> All
theſe foure grounds doe confirme unto us, that if a Man hath received
the grace of God proper to the Elect, hee ſhall never loſe it totally nor
finally; and therefore this concluſion ſtands good, though a man may
loſe common graces, yet he ſhall not loſe them which are proper to the
Elect. Yet leſt any man ſhould preſume, let mee tell you firſt though
ſuch a one cannot loſe the ſpirit,<note place="margin">1</note> yet <hi>he may loſe the meaſure of the ſpirit,</hi>
and be brought to a low ebbe in himſelfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there may be a ſhrewd abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of this grace, as <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. Chriſt ſaith to the Church of <hi>Epheſus, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
from whence thou art fallen;</hi> why the Church was not fallen from
an eſtate of grace, but it was fallen from a great meaſure of grace to a
leſſer; from a great degree of it, from a great meaſure of Care, Love,
Faith, Repentance and Zeale: ſo a Chriſtian, though hee bee not quite
deprived of the Spirit, and have a totall loſſe thereof, yet may want of
the meaſure, may finde a great abatement of it in himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>A man may loſe the comfort of the Spirit,</hi> though he cannot
loſe the Spirit, yet he may bring himſelfe into a poore caſe by his ſins,
that he may have as little feeling of the ſpirit and comfort, as if hee had
no preſence of the Spirit;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> as a man may have joynts, but they may bee
ſo benumbed with cold, as a man cannot feele nor have uſe of them; ſo
a man may have the ſpirit, and yet may be ſo benumbed with ſinne, that
he may have no more feeling of the ſpirit, nor comfort, than if hee had
not the ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>A man may have the Spirit, and yet may loſe the working and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
thereof,</hi> he may be overruled by the fleſh; as a man may have life
in him in a dead ſound, and yet no operations; ſo a man may have the
Spirit,<note place="margin">Simile</note> and yet he may want the operations and workings of it: this is
the greateſt extremitie that a Chriſtian can be in.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4</note> 
                  <hi>Though a man may loſe the feeling of the Spirit, the comfort, ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
and workings thereof, yet it is but for a little time, hee cannot loſe the
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:17958:265"/>
ground or roote of the Spirit,</hi> In the 6. of <hi>Eſay,</hi> the Prophet tels us, that
though the trees ſeeme to be dead in the winter, and have no leaves not
fruit on them, yet they have in them <hi>Mackſelat,</hi> as it is in the Hebrew,
or <hi>Subſtantia</hi> as in the latine, (that is) that there is a certaine moiſture
or ſappe, that lies in the roote and preſerveth it, that it dieth not; ſo it
is in all the falls of Gods people,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> there is a certaine ſappe or moyſture
of grace, that lieth hid in the heart that preſerveth them, therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
a man may loſe the operations and feeling of the Spirit, yet it is
but for a little time, for the grace that lieth hid in the heart preſerveth
them.</p>
               <p>The Vſe is, that it is a ſweete comfort to a Chriſtian that if once
he hath the ſpirit of grace,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> the worke of regeneration, juſtification and
ſanctification wrought in him, he ſhall never loſe this: A man may loſe
all worldly friends and comforts, his skinne and teeth, yea life it ſelfe,
but if a man have the ſpirit, hee ſhall not loſe that: As <hi>Act.</hi> 20. Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
ſaith,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> when <hi>Eutichus</hi> fell out at the window, <hi>Trouble not your ſelves, for
there is life in him;</hi> ſo wee may ſay in all the falls of Gods people, trouble
not your ſelves, for there is life, there is the ſpirit of God in them.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, ſeeing a man may loſe the comfort of the ſpirit and the
feeling thereof,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> inſomuch that one may have as little comfort as a man
that is adjudged to Hell; therefore he muſt take heed that hee doe not
grieve the ſpirit, but labour to nouriſh it by the uſe of good meanes:
as <hi>Exod.</hi> 33. when the Lord was departed from the Children of Iſrael,
but a little while,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> no man would put on his beſt rayment, but wept and
mourned; ſo a Chriſtian, if the Lord takes away the comfortable fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of his ſpirit, and is departed from him, but a day or an hower, hee
cannot be merry till he feeles it againe, and therefore it is good to hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
the graces of the ſpirit, that want of them doe not cauſe him to
depart from them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Vſe 3.</note> ſeeing there are ſome graces that are proper to the elect and
reprobate, which a man may have and periſh: therefore every man
ſhould labour to bring himſelfe into ſuch eſtate of grace as hee ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
loſe, nor the devill and hell ſhall take away from him; it is a pitifull
thing that men doe not ſay to themſelves, indeed I have the grace of
Illumination, I have knowledge and reſtraining grace, I have the graces
that are proper to good and bad, to the reprobate and Elect; but what
is this to the comfort of a Chriſtian? I may periſh for all this, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
why doe I not labour for thoſe graces that are proper to the Elect
onely, which if hee have, hee hath aſſurance never to loſe them againe;
he may loſe his goods, friends, skinne and life, but hee cannot loſe the
Spirit: if a caſtle have three wals about it, and the men that are within
the firſt wall,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> be ſurpriſed, put to the ſword and maſſacred, they will la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to get within the ſecond wall that ſo they may bee preſerved: ſo
if a man bee come within the firſt wall that hee hath common graces,
where the devill may ſurpriſe him, to eſcape his danger hee will labour
to get within the ſecond wall, to get the graces that are peculiar to
Gods people, and then he ſhall be ſafe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="520" facs="tcp:17958:266"/>
The laſt point is, <hi>how wee may retaine and keepe the Spirit?</hi> we read <hi>Luk.</hi>
6. 40. when Chriſt had raiſed up the Maide to life, <hi>he commanded to give
her meate,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">How we may retaine the Holy Ghost.</note> thereby to teach us that when the life of nature, or the life of
grace bee begun, there muſt bee meanes uſed to nouriſh it; hence wee
inferre it muſt bee every mans care that if he have the Spirit, hee muſt
labour to nouriſh it. Now there bee five meanes whereby a man may
nouriſh the Spirit:</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Five meanes to nourish the Spirit. The firſt uſe of meanes.</note> 
                  <hi>by a diligent uſe of the good meanes,</hi> as preaching, the Sacraments,
prayer, reading the Scriptures, and conferring of good things; this is
a ſpeciall meanes to nouriſh the Spirit. It is a principle in nature, that
bodies are nouriſhed by the same things they were begun; ſo looke by
what meanes the Spirit comes into a man,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> by the ſame things it muſt be
nouriſhed. Now wee have heard that the Spirit of God comes into a
man by the preaching of the Word, prayer, repenting of our ſinnes;
ſo by the ſame meanes it is continued, therefore let men attend to the
uſe of good meanes, to heare the Word preached, receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
pray, read the Scriptures, and conferre of good things; which
duties are ſpeciall meanes to retaine the Spirit: but if men will not
heare the Word preached, pray, read the Scripture, nor meditate of
good things, but ſpend time idlely, no marvell though the Spirit decay
in them: for as a man may kill a tree although he want a Saw or an axe
to chop downe the top;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> by picking away the moulds from the roote,
ſo though a man lay no violent hands on the Spirit, yet if hee picke
away the moulds, take away the uſe of good meanes, the Spirit will
decay in him: therefore if men would retaine the Spirit, let them hold
them to the uſe of good meanes.</p>
               <p>The ſecond meanes to retaine and keepe the Spirit is, <hi>to take heed wee
doe not grieve the Spirit;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Secondly, not to grieve the Spirit.</note> as <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 30. <hi>Grieve not the Spirit, by the which ye
are ſealed unto the day of redemption;</hi> it is the Spirit that ſeales our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
unto us; all the hope we have in God, of heaven, and of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
it is from the Spirit, therefore let us take heede wee doe not grieve
the Spirit: there are some things in nature that are ready to put forth
themselves to man,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> but let them never so little offend them and they are
ready to pull in themſelves: as the eye of a man, a ſnaile, and ſhell-fiſh;
the eye of a man is ready to put forth to us, but if you offend it never
ſo little, it is ready to cloſe and ſhut up his light; the Spirit of God is of
this nature, it is ready to put forth it ſelfe to a man, but offend it never
ſo little, and it will cloſe againſt him; therefore we muſt take heed wee
doe not grieve the Spirit. And for your information I will ſhew you
two wayes how a man may grieve the Spirit:</p>
               <p>First,<note place="margin">The Spirit grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved two wayes. First, sinning against Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</note> 
                  <hi>when a man ſinnes againſt his Illumination and inlightning,</hi> when he
lyes, ſweares, commits uncleanneſſe, ſteales againſt conſcience, and
knowledge and againſt the firſt grace of God: other ſinnes grieve the
Spirit, but theſe in a ſpeciall manner, they doe as it were wound the
Spirit, and let out the life and bloud of it; ſo God complaines, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 8.
6. Sonne of man, ſcest thou not what they doe, even the great abominations, that
the houſe of Israel committeth here, to cauſe me to depart from my ſanctuary?
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:17958:266"/>
ſo the ſinnes we commit against God, eſpecially when we ſinne againſt
our inlightning,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> they cauſe the Spirit of God to depart from us: wee
ſee when poore Bees have gathered a great deale of hony into their
hive, a man may drive them out with ſmoke; ſo when the Spirit of
God is come into a man, and hath gathered a great deale of hony, hath
brought a great deale of comfort and joy to his ſoule; hee may drive
him out with his ſmoke as it were: therefore we muſt take heed we doe
not grieve him with our ſinnes.</p>
               <p>The ſecond way that a man may grieve the Spirit of God is,<note place="margin">Secondly, by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to his motions.</note> 
                  <hi>by not
being obedient to the motions of it,</hi> as <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 95. 10. ſaith the Lord, <hi>Forty
yeeres long was I grieved with this generation;</hi> how did they grieve him?
they would not heare the voyce of God, nor be obedient to the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of his Spirit: in like manner when men will not heare the voyce
of God, ſpeaking to them from day to day, nor obey the motions of
his Spirit, calling them to repent, to beleeve, to be charitable to their
neighbours, they doe grieve and offend the Spirit.</p>
               <p>The third meanes to retaine and keepe the Spirit is,<note place="margin">Thirdly, to marke the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves of the Spirit.</note> 
                  <hi>to marke the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves
of the Spirit;</hi> for the Spirit doth not remove all at one time but
by degrees, by little and little, as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 4. 18. 19. we ſee the glory
of God did not depart from the Temple all at once, but firſt from the
<hi>Cherub,</hi> over the doore, and then from the doore to the entring in of the
gate: ſo it is with the graces of God they doe not depart all at once,
but the degrees; firſt a man loſeth one grace and then another,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> even as
the leaves of a tree fal not al off together, but ſome to day and ſome the
next day, till all the leaves be gone; ſo it is with the graces of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;
therefore when a man findes the firſt remove of the Spirit, that
there is an abating of his zeale, his care, or of his love, it must bee his
wiſedome to lay hold of the Spirit, as <hi>Luke</hi> 24. when Chriſt had ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot
good things in the two Diſciples, hee makes a proffer to bee gone
from them; doe they let him goe? no, but they importune him and
deſire him to ſtay with them; ſo if the Spirit of God makes a proffer to
bee gone, wee muſt not let it goe, but lay hold on it and importune it
when we feele it about going. Thus <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 11. feeling
the Spirit of God, to remoove from him, in regard of the foule ſinne
he had committed; doth hee let the Spirit goe? no, but he prayes to
the Lord that hee would not take away his Spirit, and repents of his
ſinne; ſo when a Chriſtian hath given occaſion by his ſinnes, that the
ſpirit of God ſhould depart from him, hee muſt not let him goe, but
pray to God, that the Lord would not take his ſpirit from him; for if
a Chriſtian bee not carefull when hee feeles the ſpirit of God remove
from him, but lets it goe if it will, fearefull will the fall of that man be.
It is a rule in Phyſicke,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> if a man take it, if it doth not stirre the humour
the party will die: ſo when we take Gods Phyſicke, if it doth not stirre
the humour, nor we moved with it, we are in danger of dying; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we muſt marke the firſt removes of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>The fourth meanes to retaine the Spirit is,<note place="margin">Fourthly, to put the Spirit to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment.</note> 
                  <hi>to use and to imploy the spirit;</hi>
for if men will not uſe the ſpirit, &amp; excuſe it to the bettering of their life
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:17958:267"/>
and well ordering of their courſes, the Lord will take it away from
them: as <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. We ſee he that had but one Talent given him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he did not use and imploy it, the Lord takes it away from him: ſo
if the Lord give us his Spirit, and we doe not uſe and exerciſe it, he will
take it from us.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> If a man lend a Saw, or an Axe, and he that borrowed
it doth not uſe it, but lets it ly ruſting, if the owner ſee it ſo, he will take
it away; ſo when the Lord lends us his ſpirit, and we doe not uſe it, but
let it lie ruſting, if ſo that doth not ſtir us up to the duties of Prayer and
holineſſe, what may we looke for, but that God will take away his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit?</p>
               <p>The fifth meanes to retaine and keepe the ſpirit is,<note place="margin">5</note> 
                  <hi>that wee take heede
that we doe not overcharge and burthen the ſpirit;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Not to over bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the ſpirit with cares.</note> for if wee overcharge and
burthen it, this will drive it away: I ſhewed you the laſt day, that a
man may not onely quench fire with water, but he may alſo quench it
by heaping upon it a great deale of Earth and Mould, yea the very
weight and burthen of greene wood will ſmother and put out the fire;
ſo we may quench the ſpirit not onely with our ſinnes, which are like
cold water, but wee may quench it by overburthening it with weighty
worldly cares:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> wee ſee when a mans heart is drawne away with the
World, what a hard matter it is to draw him to the duties of Prayer
and Religion, he is ready to ſay, he can have no time for them: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
men muſt take heed they doe not overcharge and burthen the
Spirit with worldly cares:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> wee ſee a Shippe will not onely ſinke
with leaking in of water at a hole, but alſo if they overburthen the
Shippe; So if wee overburthen the Spirit with worldly cares,
they will drive away the Spirit. Theſe bee the five meanes by the
which wee maintaine and keepe the ſpirit, therefore as Chriſt ſaid to
his Disciples, <hi>Bleſſed are ye if ye doe theſe things;</hi> ſo ſay I to you: Now ye
know theſe things, bleſſed are ye if ye doe them. And becauſe the holy
Ghoſt is the greateſt comfort that a man hath;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> Therefore above all
things let a man labour to retaine and keepe him: If a man hath an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
trees in his Garden or Orchard, if there be one that is a tree of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
uſe to him, his wife and children, friends and neighbours, what
will he doe? He will be ſure to nouriſh his tree, and to lay freſh moulds
to the roote of it, whatſoever hee doth to the reſt: ſo the Holy Ghoſt
as a tree of Life, that hee, his wife, children and friends live by, though
a man have a number of other comforts, yet how carefull ſhould he be
to nouriſh this comfort? Thus at laſt wee have heard theſe profitable
queſtions, concerning the Holy Ghoſt, and I pray God wee may ſo live
in this life, as that we may live everlasſtingly in the life to come.</p>

a Chriſtian turnes: concerning our faith in God,
wee beleeve that there is one God in ſubstance,

us to beleeve there is a Church of God, becauſe it is a rich ſtore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe
of all his grace and goodneſſe, and his true Temple, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 10. <hi>Know ye not that your bodie is the Temple of the Holy Ghoſt,
which is in you, &amp;c? Augustine</hi> ſaith well, the right order of beleeving is

as <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Yee beleeve in God, beleeve alſo in me:</hi> marke the

                  </hi>
not in the Church, in Angell or Archangell, but in God onely: And an
ancient father ſaith, we beleeve <hi>there is an holy Church,</hi> but wee doe not
beleeve in the <hi>Holy Church:</hi> wee muſt beleeve in none but God, and the
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:17958:268"/>
reaſon is,<note place="margin">ART. IX.</note> becauſe the Church is not God, but the houſe of God. <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi>
ſaith, wee muſt beleeve <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> but wee muſt not beleeve in
<hi>Paul,</hi> nor in <hi>Peter,</hi> the reaſon is, becauſe it is a transferring of the honour
that is due to God, to the creature: and <hi>Chryſostome</hi> ſaith, it is one thing
to beleeve a Party, and it is another thing to beleeve in a partie; but it
is proper to the divinity to bee beleeved in: Hence wee ſee the light
is ſo cleere in this point as no man neede doubt of it: and <hi>Thomas
Aquinas,</hi> one of their owne Doctors ſaith, it is better for a man to
beleeve there is a Church, than for a man to beleeve in the Church,
wherein hee grounded himſelfe on <hi>Pope Leo,</hi> in whoſe power the
Church was to reſt themſelves. Since that time they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
this, and ſay that a man muſt beleeve in the Church, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
that there bee three ancient fathers, Saint <hi>Ierome, Epiphanius,</hi>
and <hi>Cyrill</hi> that takes it in the ſame ſenſe as they doe: As for one of theſe
which is Saint <hi>Ierome,</hi> there was a chiefe biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> that brings his
argument for us, and inferres that this particle <hi>in,</hi> is to bee remooved,
becauſe in his beſt workes we doe not ſo read it: Now for the two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
their credit is the leſſe, becauſe <hi>Arrius</hi> was the firſt that brought it
into his Creed, and <hi>Cyrill</hi> followes him; as for <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> though at firſt
he might be carried with the ſtreame of the times, yet afterwards hee
was overſwayed by a number of ancient fathers at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> who
expound and take it as we doe. Therefore it is out of queſtion, and
without controulment, that wee are not to beleeve in the Church, but
the right forme of beleeving is, <hi>to beleeve that God hath a Church,</hi> a holy
people, a holy company that he will bleſſe and ſave eternally.</p>

                  <note place="margin">What wee must beleeve of the Church.</note> there are three ſpeciall things we

                  <item>1. We beleeve that God hath a Church.</item>
                  <item>2. We beleeve it is a holy Church.</item>

               <p>First,<note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>that God hath a Church,</hi>

                  <hi>People and Family here in this world,</hi> his

them out: <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 1. that <hi>Faith is the evidence of things that
are not seene;</hi> therefore though we doe not alwayes ſee the Church of
God, yet by Faith, we muſt beleeve that God hath his people, family,
and his number of ſaved ones: for the ſame Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſhewes us in the
generall apoſtacie of the <hi>Iewes, Rom.</hi> 11. <hi>That there is a ſeede and a little
remnant left,</hi> this he reſolves us of, from an Oracle of God, that <hi>there
were ſeven thouſand left, thou had not bowed their knees to Baal,</hi> which were
hid and ſecret, therefore though wee cannot ſee or designe them out,
yee wee muſt beleeve that God hath his Church and company of holy
people,<note place="margin">Vse</note> and his number of ſaved ones.</p>
               <p>The Vſ;es are: firſt, to anſwere to a demand that the papiſts make:

continue to the end of the World; therefore although wee cannot ſee
nor deſigne it out, yet we beleeve there is a Church of God: as <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.
the Lord made two great lights, the one to rule the day, and the other
to rule the night; Now although wee cannot alwayes ſee theſe lights
(becauſe there is ſome clouds that doe cover them, or ſome thicke miſt)
yet faith doth aſſure us that thoſe lights be ſtill, ſo it is with the Church

things appertaining to the nature of the Church:</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>it is a company of holy People;</hi> for there is no body either myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
or naturall,<note place="margin">The Church a company.</note> but hath many members, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 5.
So the Church of God doth not conſiſt of one, but of many members:
It is true,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> it began in one: In <hi>Adam,</hi> but the Church of God is like a tree
that hath one roote, but ſpreadeth into many branches and boughes;
ſo the Church of God beganne in <hi>Adam</hi> as a roote, and from him ſprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
to all his poſterity that be elect and within the covenant of grace.
Thus <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. where <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>Goe tell the Church;</hi> the Papiſts change
the note and ſay, Goe tell the Pope: but the Pope is not the Church of
God, becauſe he is but one, for the Church of God is a company of
people that conſiſts of many members.<note place="margin">2</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">A company of called ones.</note> 
                  <hi>It is a company of people called;</hi> all the true members are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:17958:269"/>
to partake of the graces of Chriſt, they are called to faith, repentance,
and ſanct fication: therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in all his epiſtles termes the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
<hi>the Called of God,</hi> as <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 7. <hi>To all you that bee at Rome, beloved of God,
called to be the Saints,</hi> and 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 16. <hi>Brethren you see your calling;</hi> ſo 2 <hi>Tim.</hi>
1. 9. (ſaith he) <hi>who hath ſaved us, and called us with one holy calling.</hi> So then
all the true members are called; this is a ſpeciall note and marke of them.
The uſes are:</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> ſeeing that all the true members are called, therefore wee muſt
take heed we doe not deſpiſe this voyce and call of God, ſeeing he calls us
by the voyce of his Goſpell and Spirit, to bring us to ſalvation, and to
an eſtate of grace, that ſo we might be ſaved. <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 12. was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
out of his countrey, and from his kindred, and hee obeyed God, and
did follow him: why now God doth not call us out of our countrey, nor
from our kindred (we may enjoy them ſtill) but hee calls us out of ſin, out of
blindneſſe and ignorance; therefore doe not thou deſpiſe the Call of God
nor reſiſt it. We ſee <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. of the <hi>Laborers</hi> that were called into the
Vineyard, ſome were called in the firſt houre, ſome in the ſcond, and
ſome in the third,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> fourth, and laſt houre: marke (ſaith <hi>Augustine</hi>) hee that
was called in the firſt houre, did not put off till the ſecond houre; and he
that was called in the fourth houre, did not put it off till the laſt: ſo when
God calls us, we ſhould be ready to obey the call of God. As <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 19.
<hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of his Calling to king <hi>Agrippa,</hi> ſaith, <hi>Therefore O king, I was
not diſobedient unto the Heavenly viſion;</hi> ſo ſeeing God doth call us from
day to day by his Gospell, let us take heed wee doe not deſpiſe it, but bee
obedient to it.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> ſeeing all the true members are called, therefore every man
muſt labour to finde this holy calling in himſelfe, that hee hath beene
brought out of ſinnes to an eſtate of grace, and that hee is one of Gods
people. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> confeſſes of himſelfe, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 12, 13. <hi>I was a blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
and a persecutor, but Lord I thanke thee, thou didſt ſhew mercy to mee, I am
now called:</hi> ſo every man muſt labour to finde this calling in himſelfe; I
was ſuch and ſuch a one, I was a ſwearer and a drunkard, and a bad liver,
but now it is otherwiſe with mee; now I am Called, and have repented
for it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>The Church of God is a company of people called out of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
multitude of this World;</hi> for every man naturally is the childe of
wrath, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 3. ſaith he, <hi>Wee are by nature the Children of wrath as well as
others,</hi> and verſe 5. <hi>Even wee which were dead by ſinnes hath hee quickned;</hi> ſo
the people of God, are called out of the condemned multitude of this
world: as <hi>Lot</hi> was called out of <hi>Sodom,</hi> by the Angell, was haled and pulled
out, or elſe he would have periſhed in <hi>Sodom:</hi> ſo wee ſhould all periſh in
our ſinnes, with hundreds and thouſands in this World, but that it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
God to call a number out to be ſaved. The uſe is:</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> ſeeing the Church of God is called out of the condemned
multitude of this world to bee ſaved, therefore wee may ſee the heavy
eſtate every man ſtands in before he is called, that he is no better than
in a damnable and curſed eſtate, how ever hee may in time bee one of
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:17958:269"/>
Gods elect, beloved of God yet for the preſent eſtate he is one of the
condemned of the world: O that wee had our eyes open, that wee
might ſee the heavy eſtate we be in till we bee brought to faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
and to an eſtate of grace. We read 2 <hi>King.</hi> 6. 20. that <hi>Eliſha</hi>
did lead the <hi>Aramites,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> into the mid'ſt of <hi>Samaria,</hi> and then prayed to
the Lord to open their eyes, and preſently they ſaw they were in
the mid'ſt of their enemies; ſo if God ſhould open our eyes we ſhould
ſee that we were in the mid'ſt of hell, and in the clawes of the devils our
mortall enemies.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> ſeeing the people of God, are called out of the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
multitude of this world, whereas they might have periſhed eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
what cauſe have men to bee thankefull to God, that finde this in
themſelves? whereas they might have beene damned for ever, it hath
pleaſed God to call them to the eſtate of grace, to faith, to repentance,
that ſo they might be ſaved; therefore as <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> ſaith to <hi>David,</hi>
2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19. 28. <hi>When all my Fathers houſe were but as dead men before my
Lord the King, yet did'ſt thou ſet thy ſervant among them that did eate meate at
thy table:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſo we may ſay to God, I and my fathers houſe were but dead
men before thee, and yet notwithſtanding it hath pleaſed thee to bring
us to an eſtate of grace and to feed us in thine owne houſe, whereas we
might have periſhed with the world: therefore what cauſe have wee
to be thankefull to God for ſo great a mercy?</p>
               <p>The fourth thing that was obſerved in the parts of the Church is,<note place="margin">4</note>
                  <hi>that they are called out of the condemned multitude of the world to bleſſedneſſe
and happineſſe to bee ſaved by Chriſt:</hi> ſo Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in this place, <hi>And
the Lord added to the Church from day to day ſuch as ſhould be ſaved:</hi> there is
all the harme the Lord means us, to ſave and to bring us to bleſſedneſſe
and happineſſe: therefore every man muſt take heed hee doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe
this holy Calling when the Lord invites him to repentance, faith,
and to an eſtate of grace.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> We ſee <hi>Mark.</hi> 10. 9. when Christ cals the
blinde man he flung away his cloake, and got upon his legges and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
him; ſo it ſhould bee the care of every one, when Christ cals
him to fling away his ſinnes and corruptions, and make all haſt to follow
him; for if the blinde man did follow him for the curing of his body,
much more ſhould we for the curing of both ſoule and body.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> therefore let us take heed we doe not deſpiſſe this Call of God,
ſeeing all the harme he meanes us, is to ſave us.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> ſeeing Chriſt cals us to enjoy bleſſedneſſe and happineſſe,
and to live in communion with him, therefore there is no damned man
that can be a member of Chriſt: it is true indeed that the wicked may
live in the Church as bad humors be in the body, but they are no parts
of the body; the Scripture is cleere for it, as 1 <hi>Iob.</hi> 2. 19. <hi>they went out
from us but they were not of us; for if they had beene of us they would have
continued with us: but they went out that it might bee made manifest, that they
were not all of us:</hi> as if he had ſaid, if they had communion of grace and
of the Spirit with us, then they would have continued, but becauſe they
had not, therefore they went away, The Papiſts ſay that a damned man
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:17958:270"/>
may be a member of Chriſt: but wee ſee it otherwiſe <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 19. ſaith
the Apoſtle, <hi>and not holding the head, from which all the body by joynts and
bands having nouriſhment miniſtred and knit together increaſeth with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing
of God:</hi> and <hi>Austine</hi> ſaith, that there is no damned man can bee
a true member of Chriſt; becauſe; Chriſt is the Saviour of the body,
therefore let us labour to bee members of Chriſts body and then wee
ſhall be ſaved, but if we be not, then wee are like to periſh although wee
ſhould be the greateſt Princes in the world: but if we be true members
of Ieſus Chriſt, then we doe beleeve that one day we ſhall bee bleſſed
and happie whatſoever our eſtate be here; therefore if there bee but one
or two ſaved in a towne, let us labour to be one of them; if men ſhould
ſuffer Shipwrack and there ſhould bee a boat found that would hold no
more than tenne,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> every one would labour to be one of the tenne; ſo wee
all have ſuffered ſhipwracke by the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> in the ſea of this world;
now to ſave us the Lord hath given us a little boate, which is his Church,
that whoſoever can get into it ſhall be ſaved, therefore if there bee but two
in a country or one in a towne that is ſaved, wee muſt labour to bee one of
the number.</p>

owne ſelfe. Whence theſe conſiderations offered themſelves unto us:
first, <hi>What the Church of God is in his owne Nature,</hi> which wee did then

diſpatch: ſecondly,<note place="margin">SER. LX.</note> 
                  <hi>What bee the parts or the divers eſtates of the Church of
God here in this world;</hi> whereof wee are to ſpeake at this preſent: The
Church conſidered according to its parts is twofold:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The triumphant</item>

                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>The Church triumphant is that which is bleſſed and happy with
God in heaven; ſo called becauſe it is not in conflict and combate as we
be warring againſt ſinne, luſts, the devill and the world, but having over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
all, are now bleſſed in heaven. Hereof the Apoſtle ſpeakes, <hi>Heb.</hi>
12. 22. <hi>but yee are come to the mount Sion and to the Citty of the living God;
the Celesticall Ieruſalem; to the company of innumerable Angels, and to the
Congregation of the firſt borne, whoſe names are written in heaven, and to God
the Iudge of all, and to the Spirits of juſt men made perfect:</hi> ſo <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 20. (ſaith
he) <hi>For it pleaſed the Father that in him ſhould all fulneſſe dwell, and having

for it is firſt, <hi>againſt the Scripture;</hi> and ſecondly, <hi>against reaſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">The Saints are glorified now.</note> 
                  <hi>It is againſt the Scripture,</hi> as <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12. 7. <hi>Duſt returnes to duſt and
the Soule returnes to God that gave it:</hi> now this muſt needs be ſpoken of
the bleſſed preſence of God,<note place="margin">Reaſon 1.</note> that the ſoule goes to in regard of power,
for God was preſent with it before: ſo <hi>Luk.</hi> 23. 45. Chriſt ſaid to the
Theefe, <hi>This day thou ſhalt be with me in Paradiſe;</hi> marke (ſaith Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine)</hi>
Chriſt doth not delay the Theefe, but even from this woodden
croſſe he is tranſlated into his heavenly kingdome: ſo <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes
<hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 23. <hi>deſiring to be looſed and to be with Chriſt;</hi> and not onely ſpeakes
he this of himſelfe, but alſo of all the faithfull people of God, as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
5. 8. <hi>Nevertheleſſe we are bold and be willing rather to remove out of the body,
and to dwell with God:</hi> thus it is cleare by the Scripture, that the ſoules of
the beleeving and faithfull goe to heaven, immediately to glory. So
then the <hi>Greeke</hi> opinion is falſe, it cannot be denied but that ſome Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
ſeeme to looke this way,<note place="margin">Object.</note> as that <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. 6. when the evening
was come every one had his <hi>penny,</hi> they received their hire; ſo that <hi>Col.</hi>
3. 4. <hi>When Chriſt which is our life ſhall appeare, then ſhall ye alſo appeare with
him in glory:</hi> Now theſe Scriptures and the like are to be underſtood of
the glory of the body or else of the declaration of the glory,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> that ſoule
and body ſhall have at the day of judgement, at this preſent the ſoules
of the faithfull are in glory and the world ſees it not, but a the day of
judgement there ſhall be further declaration of it. So then wee ſee the
former opinion is falſe.</p>
               <p>Now it is not onely againſt Scriptures,<note place="margin">Reaſon. 2.</note> but <hi>againſt reaſon;</hi> and that

                  <hi>it is againſt naturall reaſon,</hi> becauſe <hi>all motions are without ceſſations
till they come to their proper place unleſſe they be hindred by ſome violence;</hi> as a
ſtone flung down a hill reſts not till it comes at the bottome unleſſe it be

they move unleſſe they be hindered: now there is nothing can
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:17958:271"/>
hinder them but ſinne, but when they are dead they have no ſinne, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they muſt needs goe to heaven: that they have no ſinne it is plaine
by the Scripture, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 7. <hi>for he that is dead is free from ſinne;</hi> and
<hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, wee live not without ſinne ſo long as wee bee here, but
when we be out of this life, then ſinne ceaſeth: to this the <hi>Schoolemen</hi>
agree, that all ſinne ceaſeth in a Chriſtian when he is dead. In the eſtate
of grace, there is no man without ſinne, but when this life is ended then
ſinne ceaſeth.<note place="margin">Object.</note> Now if any ſhall ſay that the decree of God is hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
enough.<note place="margin">Sol.</note> I anſwer, there is no ſuch decree ſet downe in the booke
of God: Secondly, it might ſeeme injuſtice in God to delay glory;
where there is not cauſe to keepe them from it, ſo the Greekes opinion
is againſt naturall reaſon.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Secondly, againſt ſanctified rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> 
                  <hi>it is against rectified or ſanctified reaſon,</hi> for the Lord is more
inclined to mercy than to judgement, as ſoone as the wicked are dead
their ſoules goe into hell: as <hi>Luke</hi> 16. the ſoule of the rich man as ſoone
as he was dead was carried into hell, while his brethren were alive, and
had <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Prophets</hi> to ſpeake to them: therefore it is agreeable
to juſtice that the ſoules of the juſt ſhould goe to heaven ſo ſoone, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he is inclined more to mercy than to judgement. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith,
the ſoule of a good man goeth to God when hee is dead to enjoy
bleſſedneſſe and happineſſe, and the ſoules of the wicked goe to hell:
therefore it is out of queſtion that the ſoules of the godly goe to heaven
before the judgement day?</p>

                  <hi>the Church Militant</hi> is that part of the Church, which is a

God hath a number of theſe incurſions and conflicts, and (as one ſaith)
that the devils follow them like a number of barking and bawling dogs,
and are never at reſt, therefore it is called the militant Church. To
this purpoſe 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 12. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts <hi>Timothie, to fight the good fight of
faith, laying hold of eternall life:</hi> and 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 3. <hi>Thou therefore ſuffer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction

<hi>Ahaſhueroſh</hi> had two houſes for his Maides; there was a houſe of ſweete
perfume,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> where they were kept for a ſeaſon, before they were brought to

and the Church triumphant, whereof this is the order; that firſt they muſt
live in the Church militant, being perfumed with the graces of his Spirit,
before they can come to live in the Church triumphant: therefore it muſt
be the care of every man ſo to carry himſelfe in the militant church, as that
be may come to live in the Church Triumphant. Thus much of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
now for the uſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> ſeeing the Church of God is Militant here in this world, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
wee muſt looke for no perfect peace here, although it pleaſeth God
ſometimes to give the Church reſt, as it is ſaid, <hi>Acts,</hi> 9. 31. <hi>That the

to trouble us. <hi>Augustine</hi> ſaith well, the life of a Chriſtian here in this

<hi>When this corruption ſhall put on incorruption, and when this mortall ſhall

cannot be at quiet while he lives here.</p>
               <p>There be ſome weake Chriſtians,<note place="margin">Weake Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans deceived.</note> who thinke that becauſe they have
many temptations, troubles and afflictions, that therefore they are no
members of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Object.</note> nor of the Church of God, for if they were, they think
they ſhould be at peace: but here the Divell proceeds againſt them with
falſe Logicke,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> for they ought rather thus to argue, becauſe we live in the
Militant Church, warring againſt ſinne, the World, and the Divell:
Therefore we muſt looke for no perfect peace here.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> ſeeing the Church of God is Militant, therefore every man
muſt ſtand upon his guard and watch, armed with Faith, Patience, and
with the graces of Gods Spirit: He muſt take unto him all the Armour of
God that is ſpoken of <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. that ſo he may be armed againſt the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Divell, the World, and his owne ſinnes and corruptions, he
muſt not be ſecure, but he muſt ſtand on his watch. We read, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.
25. <hi>Whilſt men ſlept the Divell came and did ſow tares,</hi> not when their bodies
ſlept, but when their care, indeavour, and zeale was aſleepe: ſo when men
bee ſecure, and ſtand not upon their watch and guard, then the Divell
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:17958:272"/>
comes to ſurpriſe them: therefore the watchfulneſſe and diligence of the
Divell, ſhould teach us to be watchfull and diligent. We finde 1 <hi>King.</hi> 3.
when the true mother of the childe was aſleepe,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> the falſe mother came and
ſtole away the live-childe, and laid a dead childe in the roome of it: ſo the
Divell will doe when men ſleepe in ſinne, hee will ſteale away the live-childe,
and lay a dead child in the roome of it, that is, he will ſteale away
our lively faith, hope, repentance, and will leave dead faith, and dead af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
in their roome: Therefore the watchfulneſſe of the Divell, muſt
make us watchfull to reſiſt him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Vſe 3.</note> ſeeing the Church of God is militant, it is cleare we cannot
eſcape without wounds and blowes in this life; therefore it muſt bee our
wiſedome, when we take any to labour to cure and heale them, that ſo
we doe not bleede to death with them: So <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 13. ſaith the Apoſtle,
<hi>And make ſtraight ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eppes unto your ſelfe leſt that which is halting be turned out
of the way, but let it rather be healed:</hi> and <hi>Revel.</hi> 3. 2. <hi>awake and ſtrengthen the
things which remaine that are ready to die:</hi> here wee ſee the Church had
wounds, but it muſt be the care of the Church to heale their wounds. It
is a fearefull thing that the Divell many times wounds a man in his care,
faith, patience, love or zeale, and yet they have no care to recover againe,
they doe not runne to prayer, to repent of their ſinnes, returne to God,
get faith, and come to the preaching of the Word, and to the Sacraments,
that ſo they might recover and be healed. We read 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 8. when <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horam
was wounded of the Aſſyrians,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> 
                  <hi>he returned into Iezreel to be healed of his
wounds;</hi> ſo when the Divell hath wounded us in our care, faith, or in our
zeale, it muſt be our wiſedome to returne to the Word and to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to be healed of them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Vſe 4.</note> though wee have a great deale of toyle and trouble here in
the Church militant, yet we may be comforted, becauſe it is the way and
the gate to the church triumphant: as <hi>Iohn</hi> 16. 2. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Verely, verely,
I ſay unto you, that ye ſhall weepe and lament, but the World ſhall rejoyce, and yee
ſhall have ſorrow, but your ſorrow ſhall be turned into joy.</hi> So <hi>Revel.</hi> 21. 4. ſaith
he, <hi>And God ſhall wipe away all teares from their eyes, and there ſhall be no more
death, neither ſorrow, neither crying, nor no more paine.</hi> So then although the
people of God have a number of troubles and temptations here, yet it
may comfort them, that one day they ſhall bee bleſſed in the Church tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant.
We ſee as long as a man is at Sea in the Ship,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> he is flung here
and there, and toſſed up and downe; and yet it is the Ship that muſt car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
himſafe to the Haven and Shore: ſo as long as wee live in the militant
Church, we cannot be at quiet, it is a place full of trouble; wee ſhall have
the world, the fleſh and the Divell, to vexe and trouble us; yet becauſe
the militant Church is the ſhip that muſt carry us to the ſhore, that is, to
Heaven; therefore it muſt bee our care ſo to live in the militant Church,
that we may be a member in the Church triumphant, that when we have
paſſed the glaſſie Sea of this world, wee may live in the bleſſed preſence of
Chriſt, and for ever ſing the ſong of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Lambe.</hi>

               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>this ſhewes ignorance in learning,</hi> the Church of God is but
one;<note place="margin">How the Church is one.</note> but how is it but one? It is one as a great line is one compoſed of a
number of ſmall lines; ſo ſaith <hi>Cyprian,</hi> conceive the Church of God to
be one, as a great line is one, yet compoſed of a number of ſmall lines,
and as a tree is one,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> which yet conſiſts of many branches; and as from one
fountaine comes many Rivers; and as <hi>Exod.</hi> 25. 37. God ſaid to <hi>Moſes, and

                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> Here were many lights, yet all theſe made but one
light which was compoſed of many: So the Church is but one. Thus
much of the doctrine, now for uſe.</p>
               <p>Seeing the militant Church of God conſiſts of diverſe parts,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> though
it be one in it ſelfe, therefore we ſhould pray for the peace of it, <hi>and wiſh
well to the members thereof,</hi> and be ready to releeve them if they ſtand in
neede; for there is but one Faith, and one Head that quickneth all:
therefore as one member is ready to helpe another, ſo wee ſhould bee
ready to miniſter to the neceſſities of other Churches; as <hi>Acts</hi> 11. 28.
there was a famine foretold by <hi>Agabus</hi> that ſhuld be all the world over,
which came to paſſe in <hi>Claudius Caesars</hi> time; then the Diſciples every
man according to his ability purpoſed to ſend ſuccour to the brethren
which dwelt in <hi>Iudea;</hi> ſo it is a laudible part of this Church of England
to ſend releefe to other Churches, and bee ready to miniſter to their
neceſſities. It is a good meditation that <hi>David</hi> hath 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. <hi>Behold, I
dwell in a houſe of Cedar, but the Arke of God remaineth within theſe Curtaines;</hi>
So it is good for a Chriſtian to thinke I dwell in a houſe of <hi>Cedar;</hi> I
dwell in a faire houſe, I ſtand in neede of nothing, I have meate and
drinke, and a number of other comforts, but the Arke of God remaines
amongſt the Curtaines; there be many of the people of God that want
reliefe and outward comforts; therefore I will releeve them according
as I am able.</p>
               <p>The next point is,<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>that the Church of God is in divers eſtates and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
here in this World:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The diverſe ſtates of the Church.</note> ſometimes a gathering, ſometimes a gathered and
a conſtituted Church: For the Church is like a houſe that is not a houſe,
by and by as ſoone as a man beginnes to build,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and hath got ſtones and
timber, but the ſtones muſt firſt be hewed, the timber ſquared, and then
ſet together; ſo men muſt bee gathered by the voyce of the Goſpell;
hewed, ſquared and made fit for the Church of God. Chriſt did gather
the Church of the Iewes, but he left the conſtitution of it to his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles;
as <hi>Eſay</hi> 2. 5. it is ſaid, <hi>The Law ſhall goe forth of Sion, and the Word of
God from Ieruſalem;</hi> ſo the Church of God beganne at Ieruſalem, there
he laid the beginning of the Church. Now the means by which Chriſt
gathereth it, is the preaching of the Goſpell, there is no man of his
owne accord will gather himſelfe into the Church: Beaſts and Birds
will gather into their neſts and holes, but Men will not gather into
the Church, it muſt bee a ſpeciall hand of God that muſt draw them:
As it is ſaid, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 11. <hi>He therefore gave ſome to be Apostles, ſome Prophets,
and ſome Evangelists, and ſome Pastors and Teachers, for the gathering toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:17958:274"/>
of the Saints, and for the work of the miniſtery, and for the edification of the
Body of Chaiſt, untill we all meete, &amp;c.</hi> So alſo <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. ſaith Chriſt, <hi>O
Ieruſalem, Ieruſalem, which killeſt the Prophets and ſtoneſt them that were ſent
unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy Children together, as a Hen
gathereth her Chickens under her wing, and yee would not?</hi> So then the
meanes by the which Chriſt gathereth and draweth men into the
Church, is by the preaching of the Goſpell? Therefore conſider with
thy ſelfe, where the preaching of the Goſpell is, there Chriſt hath a
people that he meanes to draw into the Church to ſave them; doe not
hang off therefore from the Lord, but be gathered and brought home:
Seeing Chriſt comes in the preaching of the Goſpell, to draw thee to
faith and to repentance, and to an eſtate of grace, doe not live in thy
ſinnes and uncleanneſſe, but be gathered and brought home to God. If
a thouſand men ſhould lye in a Dungeon,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and ſhould lye in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
as not one of them could long continue therein; if one ſhould
come and give them a key to come forth, O what flocking and throng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
would there be about the Doore to get out: ſo this is our ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e, wee
are all naturally in the Dungeon of the Divell (as it were) ſo that there
is not one of us, but muſt die if wee remaine therein, and not the death
of the body only, but alſo of the ſoule: now it hath pleaſed God to ſend
us the golden key of the Goſpell to open this Dungeon door, therefore
how ſhould wee labour to get out, to bee gathered and brought home
to God? Againe, as the Church of God is ſometimes a gathering, ſo
ſometimes it is diſperſed and ſcattered; as <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 4. when <hi>Paul</hi> made
havocke of the Church of God, entred into every houſe, and drew out
both men and women, and put them in priſon; it is ſaid, <hi>Therefore, they
were ſcattered abroad, and went to and fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> preaching the Goſpell.</hi> So wee read,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 37. <hi>They were ſtoned, they were howed aſunder, they were tempted, they
were ſlaine with the ſword, they wandred up and downe in Sheepes and in Goates
skinnes, being destitute and forſaken, whom the World was not worthy of, they
wandred in Wilderneſſes and Mountaines, and D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nnes and Caves of the Earth.</hi>
And nevertheleſſe though the Church ſomtimes be thus ſcattered, yet
it doth remaine a true Church ſtill;<note place="margin">Simile</note> As a Dog or a Woolfe comming
into a flocke of ſheepe, may ſcatter them this way and that way, they
are notwithſtanding a flocke ſtill, ſo though the Church of God bee
ſcattered in regard of perſecution, yet it is the Church of God ſtill.</p>
               <p>Sometimes in regard of Tyrants, and through the fury of the world
it is hidden from the eyes of men, that it cannot be diſcerned: So as it
was in <hi>Elias</hi> time, when <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ab and Iezabel had broken downe the Altars, ſlaine
the Prophets, and ſought to kill Elias:</hi> alſo <hi>Revel.</hi> 12. 14. when the Serpent
raged againſt the woman and ſought to devour her, it is ſaid, <hi>There was
given her two wings of a great Eagle, that ſhe might flie into the wilderneſſe into
her place, where ſhee is nouriſhed for a time and times and halfe a time from the
preſence of the Serpent:</hi> ſo it pleaſeth God many times to hide the Church
from the rage of the world. Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> ſaith, that the <hi>Arrians</hi> in his
time were ſo overſpread and ſet with malice againſt the Church of God
as it could hardly bee ſeene; and therefore wee neede not marvell and
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:17958:275"/>
wonder that there be ſo few of the people of God ſeen, for the Church
may be hidden for a time becauſe of Tyrants, and the rage of the world
they are faine to creepe into Caves, Dennes Vautes, and ſecret places;
neither is it any marvell, though writers have ſo little ſpoken of them,
and write of them as they have: For as ſo <hi>Eſay,</hi> 26. 20. the Lord ſaith,
<hi>Come my people, enter thereinto thy Chambers and ſhut thy Doores after thee,
hide thy ſelfe for a little ſeaſon untill my indignation paſſe over:</hi> So the Church
of God is hidden ſometimes from the rage of the world, as that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be deſcerned. The Uſes are:</p>
               <p>That ſeeing the Church of God is ſometimes hidden,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> and ſometimes
ſcattered: Therefore as ſoone as God giveth opportunitie, wee ſhould
gather together againe into one aſſembly and ſetled Church:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> We ſee
in a ſtorme, if a Navie ſuffer ſome Shipwracke, or be ſcattered as ſoone
as the ſtorme is over, they will gather together againe; ſo when a
ſtorme comes, that is, when perſecution and trouble comes, and ſo
ſcatters the Church, as ſoone as it is over, that God giveth opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
hee ſhould gather together againe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſeeing the Church of God is ſometimes a ſcattered
Church,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> and ſometimes hidden; therefore although wee be ſcattered
in our bodies, yet we ſhould be one in faith, the unitie of the Spirit, and
the acknowledging of the Sonne of God. Sometimes the Church of
God is viſible and conſtituted in the way and order of Chriſt, as were
theſe Churches we read of in this place, and divers others that be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of in the Scripture. This is a rich bleſſing, when the people of God
may meete and live in ſocietie together one with another, to call upon
God, to heare the Word, and to receive the Sacraments, for the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing
of faith and other graces of God in them; whereas the Lord
keepes <hi>open Schoole</hi> with us, where wee may learne his will and wayes,
and where we may go to the Fountaines of grace to refreſh our ſelves,
Therefore, it muſt bee our wiſedome to hold communion with the
Church of God, that we doe not ſeparate from it for every light mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
for toyes and trifles, <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 26. 8. <hi>O Lord, I have loved thy
habitation and thine houſe, the place where thine honour dwelleth;</hi> ſo alſo <hi>Pſal.</hi>
27. 4. <hi>One thing have I deſired of the Lord, that will I ſeeke after, even that I
may dwell in the Houſe of God all the dayes of my life, to behold the beauty of the
Lord, and to viſit his Holy Temple.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now what is the reaſon that it is ſo great a bleſſing? <hi>David</hi> could
not be reſolved hereof, in a number of perturbations, till hee went into
the houſe of God: as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 16, 17. he ſaith, <hi>I thought to have found it out
and it was too painefull for me, untill I went into the Sanctuarie of God, then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>understood
I their end:</hi> For betweene a ſcattered Church, and a gathered
Church, this is the difference, that the one being ſcattered ſtands by
their owne ſtrength, and the other gathered ſtands by the mutuall help
one of another: as <hi>Acts</hi> 27. when <hi>Paul</hi> was in the Ship in danger, and a
number of others with him, there were ſome that let downe the Boat
out of the Ship and would have ſtollen away, but <hi>Paul</hi> tells them, <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:17958:275"/>
ye abide in the ſhip ye are all like to periſh;</hi> ſo let us know that if wee doe
not hold communion with the Church we cannot be ſaved.</p>
               <p>Here wee are to obſerve two things:<note place="margin">Firſt, it is a mixed company.</note> Firſt, that <hi>this viſible Church is
a mixed company wherein is good and bad;</hi> and therefore it is compared to a
<hi>field</hi> wherein is wheate and tares, and to a <hi>floore</hi> wherein is chaffe and
corne, and to a <hi>flocke</hi> wherein is ſheepe and goates; and becauſe of this
mixture wee are not to account the Church of God to bee no Church
for a number of wicked men under the hope of eaſe and other priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
doe joyne with the Church in outward duties, but never partake of
the life of grace,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and are not true members no more than a woodden
legge is a true member of the body of a man; for though it may bee a
ſtay to the body, yet it doth not partake of the life that is in the head,
therefore when the body is in ſafety the woodden legge may be in the
fire; ſo it ſhall be with all the wicked men that joyne in outward duties
with the Church, and doe not partake of the life of grace with them,
they ſhall bee caſt into hell-fire when the true members ſhall goe into
heaven, therefore we muſt labour to bee true members of the Church,
and to feele a derivation of the life of grace from Chriſt, or elſe when
the true members be ſaved, we goe to perdition.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Secondly, it may be more pure at one time than another.</note> 
                  <hi>a viſible Church may bee in a more pure eſtate at ſome times than
it is at other times;</hi> even as a man that hath health and yet may catch a
cold, and diſeaſes may breed upon him, and may bee brought low; ſo a
conſtituted Church may loſe the former beauty and good beginnings:<note place="margin">Simile.</note>
corruption of doctrine, may creepe in, and yet the Church bee a true
Church ſtill: as were theſe ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia;</hi> wherein were
many corruptions crept, for the which they were reprooved; yea and
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> once was a pure Church, but now it is a denne of
devils.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> 
                  <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaith, ſuch a Church may bee compared to ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrifts,
that when they have ſpent their money and treaſure have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to brag of but their purſes and cheſts: ſo the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
having loſt all her purity, hath nothing to brag of but the name of a
Church; it hath loſt the nature of the Church, and retaines only the
name.</p>
               <p>Now here may a queſtion be moved,<note place="margin">When we may not Separate lawfully from the Church.</note> 
                  <hi>when a man ſhould make ſeparation
from the Church?</hi> Firſt, I anſwer, <hi>though there be corruption in manners, yet
we are not to ſeparate from it;</hi> this is plaine by Scripture, wee ſee the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of <hi>Iſrael</hi> when they were in the wilderneſſe murmured againſt
<hi>God</hi> and againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1</note> and committed many groſſe ſins, yet <hi>Moſes</hi> did not
ſeparate from them: ſo in Chriſts time there were many corruptions
amongſt the Iewes, and yet Chriſt did not ſeparate from them; ſo 1 <hi>Sam.</hi>
1. Wee ſee that <hi>Elkanah</hi> and his wife went up to the yeerely ſacrifices
when the Prieſts were wicked men, for they lay with the women that
did aſſemble at the doore of the Tabernacle, and yet they joyned with
them in the holy things of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>wee are not to ſeparate from the Church for ſome defects and
wants:</hi> for as a man may bee a true Chriſtian, a member of Chriſt, and
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:17958:276"/>
yet have many wants and defects; ſo a Church may bee a true Church
and yet have many wants and defects.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> we may not ſeparate though there may bee ſome <hi>corruption
in Doctrine in the worſhip and ſervice of God;</hi> we ſee that there was corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of doctrine in Chriſts time, for the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> had taught
falſe doctrine, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. and yet Chriſt did not ſeparate from them,
or his Diſciples, but hee wils them to heare them; ſo likewiſe in the
booke of <hi>Kings,</hi> the high places were not then taken away, and yet they
did not ſeparate from them.</p>
               <p>Now in two caſes we may ſeparate from them; firſt,<note place="margin">When we may ſeparate. Ans. 1. Affirm.</note> 
                  <hi>when the Doctrine
is corrupted in the fundamentall points;</hi> for there bee ſome points which
are the foundation of Religion; and when they are corrupted the
whole building muſt needs bee overturned; as an houſe may bee an
houſe though they take away the doores and windowes and ſome poſts,<note place="margin">Simile.</note>
but if they take away the foundation, then the houſe cannot ſtand, it
ceaſeth to be an houſe; ſo though religion be corrupted in ſome points,
yet it may bee ſo as the whole body may not bee ſubverted, but if it bee
corrupted in the foundation then it overturnes and will be deſtroyed, in
this caſe we are to ſeparate from it.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>we are to ſeperate when the worſhip and ſervice is corrupted in the
ſubſtance;</hi> as when a man cannot joyne with them with a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
ſo when the worſhip of God was brought to the high places, in
that <hi>Ieroboam</hi> had ſet up calves in <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel</hi> to worſhip, then we ſee
2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 11. 14. <hi>the Prieſts and Levites came to Iudah and Ieruſalem;</hi> in this
caſe wee are to ſeparate; and this is the reaſon why wee ſeparate from
the Church of Rome, having both erred in the foundation, and in the
ſubſtance of Gods Worſhip.</p>

of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The firſt digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Church.</note> or as <hi>Paul</hi> termes it, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. <hi>the houſe of God,</hi> becauſe of
all other places it is the ſpeciall place where God dwelleth by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of his grace: it is true indeed that God is preſent with his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in hell, and this world is full of the preſence of God in goodneſſe; as
it is <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 119. 64. <hi>The earth is full of thy goodneſſe,</hi> but his gracious
preſence of quickning grace is to this aſſembly; therefore becauſe God
dwelleth in a more eminent manner in this above all other aſſemblies, it
is called the houſe of God and the City of God. Now this City excels
all other cities in foure reſpects:</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">The Citie of excels others in foure reſpects.</note> 
                  <hi>all other cities were builded by men,</hi> as <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 17. it is ſaid that
<hi>Caine built a citie, and called it by the name of his Sonne Henoch:</hi> So alſo <hi>Gen.</hi>
10. 11. it is ſaid that <hi>Nimrod out of that land ſent forth Aſher, and builded
Niniveh and the citie Rehoboth:</hi> but this citie is builded and framed by God
himſelfe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. Chriſt ſaith to <hi>Peter, upon this rock will I build my
Church, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Ierem.</hi> 31. 4. ſaith God, <hi>againe I will build thee, and thou ſhalt
bee builded, O virgin Iſrael:</hi> All other cities are builded by men, but this
citie is builded by God, and hath its high originall from him: And
therefore wee may inferre becauſe God is the builder thereof, he will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
and keepe it; as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. <hi>that the gates of Hell ſhall not
prevaile against it;</hi> ſo <hi>Zech.</hi> 12. 3. it is said, <hi>and in that day will I make Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem
a burdenſome ſtone; all that burden themſelves with it ſhall be cut in peeces
though all the people of the earth were gathered together againſt it;</hi> as <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.
13. the <hi>Sodomites</hi> did ſeeke to breake the doore open upon <hi>Lot,</hi> but the
Lord ſtroke them with blindneſſe that they groped and could not finde
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:17958:277"/>
the doore; ſo it hath pleaſed God, to cover the Church though the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
thereof have ſought to breake in upon it, and to deſtroy it; yet the
Lord hath ſtrooke them with blindneſſe, that they could not finde the
meanes to doe it. Therefore this citie hath this dignitie and roialtie above
the reſt, becauſe other cities are builded by men; but this is builded by
God.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> they that live in other cities live in ſocities eſpecially to
preſerve and mainetaine their bodies,<note place="margin">This ſocietie is to preſerve ſoules eſpecially.</note> but in the Church of God in this
citie, they doe not ſo much live therein to mainetaine their bodies as their
ſoules. Againe, in other cities they live in ſocitie to ſtrengthen them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
againſt their enemies, to mainetaine their lands and livings: but in
this, which is the Church of God, they live together not ſo much to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
their bodies and their outward eſtate, but to mainetaine the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
graces of Gods Spirit, and their intereſt unto heaven; as <hi>Philip.</hi> 1.
27. ſaith <hi>Paul, Onely let your converſation bee as it becommeth the Goſpell of
Chriſt, that whether I come and ſee you or elſe bee abſent; I may beare of your
matters that yee continue in one Spirit and in one minde, fighting together in the
faith of the Goſpell:</hi> And 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 7. Hee exhorts married couples to live to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<hi>as heires of the grace of life:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> So in this citie they live together eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
to mainetaine faith and their comfort in God and their hope of
heaven; herein therefore in the ſecond place this citie excels all other
cities in the world.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>all the commodities of the country goe to the citie,</hi> if there bee any
thing better than other it is carried thither all to mainetaine a temporall
life:<note place="margin">All commodities goe thither for ſpirituall life.</note> but in this citie which is the Church of God, the Lord keepes pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
market where a man may buy (without money) the graces of the
Spirit: where hee may have faith, repentance and other graces needfull, as
<hi>Eſai.</hi> 55. 1. <hi>Hoe, every one that therſteth, come yee to the waters, and yee that have
no ſilver come buy and eate; come I ſay, and buy wine and milke without ſilver and
money;</hi> ſo <hi>Revel.</hi> 3. 18. <hi>I counſell you to buy of mee gold tried in the fire, that thee
mayeſt bee made rich:</hi> So then here in this citie the Lord keepes open
market of ſpirituall graces that a poore Chriſtian may furniſh himſelfe
with whatſoever grace hee ſtands in need of, and therefore it muſt bee our
wiſedome ſo to furniſh our ſelves as that wee bee not to ſeeke when wee
ſhould uſe them. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith well, in the citie thy houſe is furniſhed
with all good things, thoſe that bee rich amongſt you have their houſes
furniſhed with a great deale of plate and pillars of marble, and tapistrie
and other fine ornaments; but thou that art a Chriſtian, away with theſe,
they are but toyes and trifles in regard of ſpirituall graces, but the houſe
of God is furniſhed with ſpirituall graces, <hi>faith, repentance, pardon of ſinnes,</hi>
feeling of Gods favour, and all holy and ſanctified graces. In other cities
there be markets for the body, but in this citie the Lord keepes open
market, with ſpirituall graces to furniſh our ſoules: and therefore thirdly
herein this citie excels all other cities in the world.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4</note> in many other cities there be many other liberties and immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,
all theſe immunities are but to free them from toyle and tribute,<note place="margin">Here is ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall freedome.</note> but
the Church of God doth not thus free men; for <hi>Christ</hi> himſelfe payed
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:17958:277"/>
tribute, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17. 27. and <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 7. <hi>Give unto all men
therefore their dues, tribute to whom yee owe tribute, custome to whom cuſtome.</hi>
The Church of God doth not free men from taxes and tributes, due to
earthly powers and Potentates, but from the bondage of ſinne, from the
accuſations of an evill conſcience, from the Devill and from Hell. Thus
<hi>Iohn</hi> 8. 36. ſaith Chriſt, <hi>If the Sonne make you free, yee ſhall bee free indeed.</hi> And
<hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 26. saith the Apoſtle, <hi>But Ieruſalem which is above is free, which is the
mother of us all.</hi> A man may bee a citizen of a great citie and yet lye in
bondage to ſinne and the Devill; bee a ſlave to his luſts, and be troubled
with the accuſation of an evill conſcience. But if a man bee a citizen of
this citie, hee ſhall bee free from ſinne, the Devill, Hell, the accuſation of a
bad conſcience, and from his wild luſts; therefore in the fourth place
this citie excels all other cities in the world. The uſes are.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> ſeeing the citie of God excels all the cities of the world; therefore
wee ſhould account it a marvellous bleſſing that it pleaſeth God, to make
us citizens of this citie, as <hi>Ruth</hi> 2. 12. <hi>Boaz</hi> ſaid unto <hi>Ruth; the Lord recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
thy worke,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> 
                  <hi>and a full reward bee given unto thee of the God of Iſrael, under
whoſe wings thou art come to truſt:</hi> So happy is the man over whom the
Lord doth ſpread the wings of his love. Wee ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84. <hi>Davids</hi> affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
that hee <hi>had rather bee a doore keeper in the houſe of God, than to dwell in
the Tents of wicked men;</hi> hee had rather bee a meane man and a true
member of the Church, than to bee a great wicked man: Therefore wee
may bee ſure that it is a greater bleſſing to bee a poore man and a member
of the Church, than to bee a great rich man in the world, and no true
member of the Church.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> ſeeing the citie of God excels all the cities of the world,
therefore every man muſt have care to hold communion with it; and
take heed hee doe not ſuffer the Devill to draw him away from it, becauſe
God dwells there by the preſence of his Spirit: <hi>Peter</hi> could ſay to Chriſt,
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. 68. <hi>Master, to whom ſhall wee goe? thou haſt the words of eternall life;</hi>
heere is fulneſſe of joy, here is comfort to bee had; and therefore how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
others ſtart out, let us hold to it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Vſe 3.</note> ſeeing the citie of God excels all other cities, therefore it
muſt bee our care to live like ſuch citizens: Hath God made thee a citizen
of ſuch a citie, live then happy man, like ſuch a citizen, conforme thy
ſelfe to the lawes of it, and walke worthy of this heavenly citie. The au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> maketh the ſame uſe of it, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12. 22. <hi>But</hi> (ſaith hee)
<hi>yee are come unto the Mount Zion, and to the citie of the living God, &amp;c.</hi> And
therefore ſee that yee deſpiſe not him that ſpeaketh, for if they eſcaped
not which refuſed him that ſpake on earth; much more ſhall not wee
eſcape if wee turne away from him that ſpeaketh from heaven. You bee of
the citie of God, and therefore doe not you live like the vild men of the
world, in your ſinnes and corruptions, but live like Saints and citizens of
ſuch a citie, thus much of the <hi>firſt dignitie,</hi> that the Church is called the
citie of God, becauſe there is the preſence of God in grace.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Dignitie of the <hi>Church</hi> of God is,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>that it is called the body of
Christ,</hi> now there is a naturall body of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Dignitie of the Church.</note> which hath parts and liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:17958:278"/>
as our bodies have hands and feete, &amp;c. And there is a myſticall
body of Chriſt, which are the company of true beleevers which are made
one with Chriſt, by faith through the communion of the Spirit, which
myſticall body is more deare to Chriſt, than his naturall body, for hee gave
his naturall body to die for his myſticall body, and to redeeme it, the
Church is this myſticall body, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 27. <hi>now yee are the body of Chriſt
and members in particular;</hi> ſo <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1. 14. <hi>Now I rejoyce in my ſufferings, and
fulfill the reſt of the afflictions of Chriſt in my fleſh, for his bodies ſake which is the
Church:</hi> So then the Church of God is the bodie of Chriſt, whence ariſeth
divers conſequents.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>that hee is the onely head of the Church, and no other but hee:</hi> as <hi>Epheſ.</hi>
1. 22.<note place="margin">Conſequent.</note> ſaith the Apoſtle of Chriſt, <hi>And hath made all things ſubject under his
feete, and hath appointed him over all things to bee the head of the Church:</hi> ſo
<hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1. 18. <hi>hee is the head of the bodie of the Church;</hi> for as the head ruleth
the bodie:<note place="margin">That Chriſt is the head of the Church, onely three proofes.</note> ſo Chriſt rules his myſticall body. Now that Chriſt is the
onely head of the Church, it may bee ſeen in three things: Firſt, <hi>becauſe the
grace of God is moſt eminent in him,</hi> for as life is moſt eminent in the head,
ſo the graces of God are moſt eminent in him,<note place="margin">1</note> hee excells all men and
Angels,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> therfore the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1. 19. <hi>that it pleaſed the Father
that in him all fulneſſe ſhould dwell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>becauſe of the neere conjunction that is between the head and the
members,</hi> the naturall head may bee parted with a blow from the body,
but the Devill and all the damned cannot part Chriſt and his myſticall
body.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>in regard of ministration:</hi> for as the head doth communicate life
and motion unto the body, ſo Chriſt doth the life of grace and the Spirit;
So it is a Royaltie onely belonging to the head not to Archangell nor
Angell, therefore away with the Pope.</p>
               <p>The ſecond conſequent is,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>that ſeeing Chriſt is head of the Church therefore
as the head communicates life and motion into the body,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Conſequent.</note> 
                  <hi>ſo from Chriſt flowes
ſpirituall life and grace into the Church;</hi> there is never a true member but
Chriſt communicates life and grace unto him, therefore every true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
muſt feele a derivation of grace and ſpirituall life in him; every one
that would have true comfort muſt feele this, and to ſay as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth,
<hi>Galath.</hi> 2. 20. <hi>Thus I live, yet not I now, but Christ liveth in mee, and in that I
now live in the fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſh, I live by the faith of the Sonne of God, who hath loved mee
and given himſelfe for mee.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> Wee ſee if a man hath any member that
hangs dead and numb'd,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſo as no life flowes from the head to it, hee will
rubb and chafe it to bring heate and Spirits into it againe; ſo when wee ſee
our ſelves hang by as dead members, and that hardly any life of grace
flowes unto us, wee ſhould never bee at reſt, but uſe all the meanes wee can
to heare the word, pray, repent of our ſinnes, get faith in Chriſt; never to
bee at quiet till wee feele a derivation of the graces of Chriſt unto us.</p>
               <p>The third conſequent is,<note place="margin">3</note> that ſeeing Chriſt is the head of the Church
and the Church his body;<note place="margin">Conſequent.</note> Therefore <hi>hee will preſerve all the members of it;</hi>
There is never a little toe, finger or a bone in the body of Chriſt, that ſhall
periſh, but hee will preſerve them all: We ſee in nature that the head will
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:17958:278"/>
labour to preſerve the reſt of the members that they doe not periſh, much
more will Chriſt preſerve his myſticall body;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> Hence therefore is our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
that wee ſtand not by our own power, but by the power of Chriſt; and
the life that wee live in grace wee have not by the power of nature, but by
Chriſt; therefore hee will preſerve us and keepe us, as <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. 12. ſaith
Chriſt <hi>of thoſe that thou haſt given mee have I loſt none:</hi> Wee are all dead by
<hi>Adam,</hi> but we are made alive by Christ, so <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. 16. <hi>Chriſt</hi> is called the
<hi>roote</hi> and the generation of <hi>David.</hi> It is a Metaphor taken from herbes in
a garden,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> that although the ſtalke and the leafe die in the winter time, yet
they are preſerved in the roote, and when the ſpring time commeth they
will put forth againe; ſo though wee die in our ſelves yet wee are preſerved
in the roote which is Chriſt, although the ſtalke and the leafe die yet wee
are ſafe in the roote. The uſe is.</p>
               <p>Seeing that the Church is the body of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Vſe</note> therefore all injuries
and wrongs that are done unto the Church, Chriſt takes as if they were
done to himſelfe: not onely the injuries and wrongs that the world
puts on them, but alſo the diſgraces and ſhames that Chriſtians bring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
themſelves; therefore thou that art a Chriſtian, conſider with thy ſelfe
thou art a member of Chriſt, looke what diſgrace thou bringeſt on thy
ſelfe, thou bringeſt on Chriſt; as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 15. ſaith S. <hi>Paul, Know ye not that
your bodies are the members of Chriſt, ſhall I then take the members of Chriſt,
and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid:</hi> or ſhall wee abuſe
them to drunkenneſſe? looke what diſgrace we caſt on our ſelves, we
bring on Chriſt, becauſe we bee Chriſts Members. Therefore, <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome</hi>
ſaith well, O man by thy ſinne thou doſt not diſgrace thy owne
ſelfe, but another; and the ſhame doth not reſt on thy owne body, but
it reſts on another mans, that is, on the body of thy Lord and Maſter
Ieſus Chriſt. So <hi>Augustine</hi> ſaith, if thou have no care of thine owne
ſelfe, yet have care of Chriſt; and if thou care not for defiling of thine
owne body and diſgracing of it, yet take heede of defiling and diſgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
of the body of Chriſt; reſt not on thy ſelfe, but on Chriſt: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
how carefull ſhould we be, that we doe not defile our bodies.</p>

ſpeake of the third,<note place="margin">Dignitie of the Church.</note> which is this; <hi>That the Church is the Spouſe, and the
Bride of Chriſt,</hi> becauſe it hath pleaſed Chriſt to beſtow himſelfe on the
Church to marry and to adjoine himſelfe to it in the moſt neereſt bond
that may be; Man and Wife are not neerer tyed one to another by the
bonde of marriage, than Chriſt hath tied and bound himſelfe to her by
the bond of the Spirit: therefore the Church may well bee tearmed
the Spouſe and the bride of Chriſt: as <hi>Cantic.</hi> 5. 1. <hi>I am come into my garden
my Siſter, my Spouſe,</hi> ſo <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 29. <hi>He that hath the bride is a bridegrome, but
the friend of the bridegome which ſtandeth and heareth him rejoyceth, becauſe
of the bridegroomes voyce:</hi> So <hi>Revel.</hi> 21. 9. ſaith he, <hi>Come I will ſhew thee the
Bride, the Lambes wife.</hi> What a great comfort is this, that ſuch ſilly peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
as we be, ſhould be advanced to this honour: as 1 <hi>Sam,</hi> 25. 41. when
<hi>David</hi> sent to <hi>Abigall</hi> to take her to wife,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſaith ſhe, <hi>Let thy handmaid be
a ſervant to waſh the feete of thy ſervants of my Lord:</hi> ſo wee may ſay, what
Lord, wilt thou make mee thy Spouſe, and they Bride, it is honour and
glory enough for me to be a poore ſervant to waſh the feete of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
of thy ſervants. Now as many lines come from one Center, ſo
there may be many points deducted out of this point.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> ſeeing the Church is the Spouſe and the Bride of Chriſt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<hi>He loves the Church:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">He loves the Church. Three wayes.</note> the love betweene man and wife is great; but
the greateſt love is betweene Chriſt and his Church. as it is, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 24.
<hi>Therefore ſhall a man leave father and mother, and cleave to his wife;</hi> the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:17958:279"/>
bond in nature is betweene them,<note place="margin">SERM. XLIII.</note> and the greateſt bond in grace is
betweene Chriſt and the Church. It is ſaid, <hi>Eſay,</hi> 43. 4. <hi>Since thou waſt
precious in my ſight, thou haſt beene honourable, and I have loved thee; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
will I give Man for thee, and People for thy ſake.</hi> So <hi>Revel.</hi> 3. 9. <hi>I will make
them that they ſhall come and worſhip before thy feete, and to know that I have
loved thee.</hi> In my Text we ſee Chriſt hath not onely loved the Church,
but hath made declaration of his love: wee read <hi>Milac.</hi> 1. 2. that the
Lord ſaith to the people, <hi>I have loved you;</hi> and the people ſay to God,
<hi>Wherein haſt thou loved us?</hi> But thankes be to God, wee need not ſay ſo,
for Chriſt hath not onely loved us, but he hath made declaration of his
Love, that we may feele it and ſee it; If Chriſt ſhould have loved us,
and we ſhould not have knowne it, it had beene a great matter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But the
comfort is the greater, that hee makes declaration of his Love to us.
Now in three things Chriſt makes declaration of his Love to the
Church:</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> in that Chriſt hath ſpared no paines nor labour, nay hath given
his owne life and blood to redeeme it;<note place="margin">Signe of Love.</note> 
                  <hi>greater love than this could no man
ſhew, than to give his life for his friend;</hi> But Chriſt ſets out his love towards
us, <hi>ſeeing whilſt we were yet ſinners, He died for us:</hi> as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi>
5. 8. It was love, and a great love too, that made <hi>Iaakob</hi> ſerve ſeven
yeeres for a wife in <hi>Syria,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> which hee thought nothing: much more it
was love, and great love in Chriſt, that hee would be contented to bee
borne in a Stable, to bee laid in a Manger, to ſweat blood and water in
the garden, to die that accurſed death of the croſſe, and to bee laid in
the ground for us,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> all which Chriſt accounts as nothing; ſo we may be
ſaved and brought home to God. <hi>Eſay,</hi> 53. 11. it is ſaid, <hi>He ſhall ſee the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell
of his ſoule, and ſhall be ſatisfied,</hi> ſo we may be ſaved and brought home
to God, this will ſatisfie Chriſt, he will thinke all his paines as nothing.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> Chriſt hath made declaration of his Love, in that he doth
waſh away our ſins from day to day in his blood:<note place="margin">Signe of Love.</note> for whereas nothing in
this world can waſh away our ſins, but his blood, it hath pleaſed him to
dippe a handkerchiefe as it were in his blood, to wipe away our ſinnes;
this is another evidence that he loveth us: as <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. 5. it is ſaid, <hi>that
he hath loved us, and waſhed away our ſins in his blood:</hi> therefore whoſoever
doth not feele his ſoule and conſcience to be cleanſed, and the blood of
Chriſt to eate out the venome of his ſinne, Chriſt hath not declared
his love unto him as yet, in any comfortable manner.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> Chriſt declares his love to the Church, in that hee ſends
love tokens unto her,<note place="margin">Declaration of Love.</note> which are the gifts and graces of his Spirit. A lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
husband, if hee bee in a farre Countrie, will ſend love tokens to
his wife:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> there is never a meſſenger that comes, but he will ſend ſome
Iewell or peece of gold; ſo Chriſt doth to his Church ſend love tokens
from day to day: as <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 8. it is ſaid, <hi>When he aſcended up on high, he led
captivitie captive, and gave gifts unto men;</hi> ſo when he came at the higheſt
top of glory, hee did not forget his poore Church, but ſent gifts to it;
as <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 35. it is ſaid, <hi>Since then that he by the right hand of God hath beene
exalted, and hath received of his Father the Holy Ghoſt, hee hath ſhewed forth
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:17958:280"/>
this which you now ſee and heare.</hi> This is a plaine evidence that his heart is
upon us, and that he doth not onely love us, but makes declaration of
his love, that we may ſee and feele it from day to day: Hence we may
inferre, though Chriſtians bee deſpiſed in the eyes of the world and
not regarded, yet they be deare in the eyes of Chriſt, he regardeth and
loveth them.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> Wee ſee a good wife if her husband love her, ſhee cares
not who hates her; ſo her husband bee pleaſed, ſhee cares not who
is diſpleaſed: ſo it ſhould bee with a Chriſtian, if Chriſt love him hee
ſhould not care though the world hate him; ſo Chriſt be pleaſed, hee
need not care who be diſpleaſed with him.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> ſeeing the Church is the Spouſe and Body of Chriſt,
therefore he will richly indue the Church.<note place="margin">Deduction.</note> Wee ſee when a man mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth
with a woman, the marriage deeds be made, he gives her an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
in his lands,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and indowes her with his goods: ſo Chriſt doth indue
the Church with his righteouſneſſe, holineſſe, &amp; with his merits: Thus
<hi>Phil.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 9. <hi>Paul deſireth that he might be found in Chriſt,</hi> that is, not having
his owne righteouſneſſe which is of the law, but that which is through
faith in Chriſt: So alſo 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>But yee are of him in
Chriſt Ieſus, who of God is made unto us wiſedome, righteouſneſſe ſanctification
and redemption; that according as it is written, Hee that rejoyceth, let him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
in the Lord:</hi> this is another comfort to a Chriſtian, that though he
be poore in himſelfe, yet he ſhall be rich in Chriſt; If a poore Maid mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
with a rich Husband, though her father left her nothing nor never
a friend,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> yet she thinkes her ſelfe well provided for; ſo though we bee
poore in our ſelves, our father <hi>Adam</hi> having left us nothing but ſinne,
yet if we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> can marry with Chriſt, hee will richly indow us with all his
Graces.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> ſeeing the Church is the Spouſe and the Bride of Chriſt,
therefore hee will adorne it with all his graces:<note place="margin">Deduction.</note> It is ſaid <hi>Eſai.</hi> 61. 10. <hi>I will
greatly rejoice in the Lord, and my ſoule ſhall bee joyfull in my God, for he hath
cloathed mee with the garments of ſalvation, and covered mee with the Robe of
Righteouſneſſe, hee hath decked me as a Bridegroome, and as a Bride tireth her ſelf
with her Iewels:</hi> And to the ſame effect wee read <hi>Revel.</hi> 19. 8. <hi>unto her was
granted that ſhee ſhould bee arayed with pure fine linnen and ſhining, for the fine
linnen is the Righteouſneſſe of Saints;</hi> ſo then the Lord will not leave the
Church naked, but will beautifie and adorne it with his graces; therefore
wee muſt labour to feele this and ſee it; for if our conſcience ſhall tell us
that wee are naked not having one grace of his Spirit, then wee doe not
belong to him, for without this golden garment of Chriſts righteouſneſſe
wee ſhall not bee ſet at the <hi>right hand</hi> of Chriſt, as it is <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 9. but as
long as wee bee naked and have not this golden garment on; wee doe not
belong to Chriſt, for if wee did, hee would adorne and beautifie us with
all his graces in ſome meaſure.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4</note> ſeeing the Church is the bodie and ſpouſe of Chriſt, therefore
hee will diſcharge the Churches duties:<note place="margin">Deduction.</note> A woman that is in debt when
ſhe is maried to a man all her debts are devolved unto her Husband,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſhe
ſhall not anſwer the debt, but her husband becauſe ſhee is under his covert;
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:17958:280"/>
ſo, the Church ſhall not anſwer for her debts, but Chriſt ſhall, as 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.
24. it is ſaid. <hi>Who his own ſelfe bare our ſinnes in his own bodie on the tree:</hi> and
<hi>Rom</hi> 8. 3. (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>for that which was unpoſsible to the law in as much
as it was weake, becauſe of the fleſh, God ſending his owne Sonne in the ſimilitude
of ſinnefull fleſh and for ſinne, condemned ſinne in the fleſh;</hi> Therefore ſeeing
Chriſt hath diſcharged our debt and tooke it upon him, it is a comfort to
the Church, that they ſhall not answere for it: Hence wee may learne that
when the Divell ſhall impleade us for our ſinnes and debts, wee muſt not
deny the debt, and ſay it is not ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but anſwer him: wee bee not the parties
that are loiable to the Law: but hee muſt goe to our he band Chriſt, hee
hath taken our debt upon him, and will anſwere whatſoever can be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of us. To make this plaine, as wee reade 2 <hi>King</hi> 4. there was a poore
Widow that was impleaded for her debt, who comes to the Prophet and
tels him of it. Hee askes her what ſhee had left, ſhe replies that ſhee had
nothing left,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> but a little cruſe and a little oyle in it; where upon the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
bids her goe and borrow veſſels of her neighbours, then ſhut the
doores to her ſelfe; and powre into thoſe veſſels and fill them: which ſhe
did, and ſo payed her creditours and lived of the reſt. This is <hi>the Churches
caſe,</hi> the Divell impleade; her for debt and the Church hath nothing left
but as it were a little Pitcher, <hi>the body of Chriſt,</hi> and yet out of this there
hath runne out ſuch a deale of oyle as that it hath ſufficiently diſcharged
all the debt of the Church: and this is another comfort to her, that hee will
diſcharge all her debts.</p>
               <p>Fiftly,<note place="margin">5</note> ſeeing the Church is the body and the ſpouſe of Chriſt that one
day wee ſhall bee brought home unto him to live with him for ever;<note place="margin">Deduction.</note> as
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is ſaid, <hi>ſhee ſhall bee brought to the King in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ment of needle
worke;</hi> and in the next verſe, <hi>With gladneſſe and rejoicing ſhall they be brought,
they ſhall enter into the Kings Palace.</hi> Therefore this is a comfort to the
Church, that although ſhe cannot ſee him becauſe ſhe lives here on earth,
and Chriſt in Heaven, yet there will be a time when ſhee ſhall live for ever
with him in glorie and happineſſe: It was Chriſts requeſt, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. 24.
<hi>Father, I will that thoſe which thou haſt given mee, bee with mee even where I
am, that they may behold my glorie, which thou haſt given mee;</hi> it was one of
Chriſt laſt ſuits to his father, that we ſhould be brought home unto him.
This is another comfort to the Church, that one day they ſhall enjoy
Chriſt and live with him for ever in glory, howſoever they may have a
great deale of trouble and affliction here; as <hi>Revel.</hi> 19. 6, 7. <hi>there was a great
voyce (like a clap of Thunder) ſaying, Halleluiah, for our Lord God Almighty
hath raigned, let us bee glad and rejoice and give glorie to him for the mariage
of the Lambe is come; and his Wife hath made her ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lfe ready.</hi> All harts ſhould
bee filled with joy for this, and all ſoules ſhould bee repleniſhed with gl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
for that one day the marriage ſhall bee ſolemnized when wee ſhall
bee brought home unto him to live with him for ever.</p>
               <p>Laſtly,<note place="margin">6</note> ſeeing the Church is the Bride and the Spouſe of Chriſt
therefore he will not bee aſhamed of us;<note place="margin">Deduction.</note> no good man will be aſhamed
of his wife (though ſhe be but meane) in any place, nor before any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
no more will Chriſt be aſhamed of us,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> but will confeſſe us before
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:17958:281"/>
God, though we be but meane: as <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 11. <hi>For both he that ſanctifieth,
and they which are ſanctified are all of one; wherefore hee is not aſhamed to call
them brethren:</hi> ſaying, <hi>I will declare thy Name unto my brethren, in the midſt
of the Church will I ſing praiſes unto thee:</hi> And againe, <hi>behold here am I, and
the children that thou haſt given me:</hi> ſo <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 8. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall confeſſe me
before men, him ſhall the Sonne of Man confeſſe before God and his Angels.</hi> As
<hi>Ioſeph</hi> confeſſed his father and brethren before <hi>Pharoah,</hi> and was not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
of them; ſo will Chriſt one day acknowledge his Brethren the
Elect of God: this is another comfort, that Chriſt will not be aſhamed
of us howſoever wee are not reſpected and regarded here, yet one day
we ſhall be highly promoted: Chriſt will ſay to us, <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my
Father, receive the Kingdome prepared for you, before the beginning of the
World.</hi> Therefore, beloved brethren, ſequeſter your thoughts from
things preſent, and think on the things to come; think upon this joyfull
meeting of Chriſt and all the holy people of God; conſider how great
will our comfort be at that time: therefore love <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> be carefull
to paſſe your time here in holineſſe and feare, labour to repent of your
ſinnes, and to get faith in Chriſt, that yee may finde favour with God
at that time.</p>
               <p>Now there is another thing that I would commend unto you in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the time: That ſeeing Chriſt is ſuch a comfortable Husband to
us,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> let us take heed we doe not diſpleaſe him: we ſee a good wife will
be loth to diſpleaſe her husband at any time, if ſhe hath given him any
occaſion of offence, ſhe will not be at reſt till ſhe be reconciled, and her
husband pacified and pleaſed with her: ſo ſeeing it is manifeſt at this
preſent, by evident tokens, that our loving Husband is diſpleaſed by
taking away the comforts of the Earth; for what a thing is it, that wee
ſhould live on the Earth, and yet not ſee the fruits of it comfortably,
but be ſtrangers from it, in regard of the multitude of our ſinnes? there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I ſay, ſeeing we ſee him diſpleaſed with us, let us not be at reſt till
we be reconciled unto him, let us repent us of our ſinnes, pray unto him
and never give over till he be pacified and pleaſed with us.</p>

rich Iewell and Treaſure that Chriſt hath left his people,<note place="margin">The Letter of the Scripture.</note> therefore
it hath beene the care of the Church the Spouſe, to preſerve and keepe
the Scripture, as the chiefeſt Iewell and Treaſure left of her husband
Chriſt: we ſee in experience, if a man leave a Iewell or ſome other trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
with his wife when he goes into a farre countrie ſhe will be carefull
to keepe it till he come home againe,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſhee will locke it up or lay it in
ſome Boxe or Cheſt; ſo becauſe the Scripture is a rich Iewell left unto
the Church by her Husband Chriſt, therefore, there can be no doubt
but the Church was carefull at all times to preſerve and keepe it? to
this purpoſe <hi>Exod.</hi> 25. 16. <hi>The Lord commanded Moſes to make an Arke
of Shittim wood to put the Tables of the Covenant in:</hi> (that is, the written
Law of God) and why ſhould they put it into an <hi>Arke,</hi> or Cheſt of <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar?</hi>
But becauſe it is the durableſt wood, which will not rot, to teach
us that the Lord would have the Scriptures preſerved; therefore S. <hi>Paul</hi>
ſaith <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 4. That <hi>the Lord hath of truſt committed the Oracles of Truth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Iewes, which were the Church of God:</hi> ſo that it is the dutie of the
Church to preſerve and keepe them: None hath done it but the
Church, which hath not failed in any point: If a tender mother ſhould
have a ſpring that ſhe and her Children live by to drinke of,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> how care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
would ſhe be to kepe it from all annoyances: ſo becauſe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is as a Spring that the Church lives by, and drinkes of, ſhe and her
children: Therefore there can be no queſtion but that the Church hath
beene carefull to keepe it from all annoyances. It hath beene an opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Papiſts, that the Scripture was corrupted by the Iewes in the
Originall Text: but if this opinion were true, it were enough to bring
in <hi>Atheiſme</hi> and all prophanenes, for no body can deny, but if that the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the Scripture were corrupted in the Originall, then that which
is tranſlated cannot be right. Here then to confute this opinion of the
Papiſts which is enough to bring in flat Atheiſme and ſuperſtition, I
will ſhew you divers arguments and reaſons to proove that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
hath not beene corrupted, which becauſe it is a point of learning,
and a high one; therefore as God when he gave the Law to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
came downe upon the Mount as low as might bee,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> to deliver it to
them: ſo I will come downe as low as I can to make it plaine to your
Capacities who heare me.</p>
               <p>The firſt, <hi>Is drawne by compariſon from a King;</hi> There is no <hi>King</hi>
                  <pb n="551" facs="tcp:17958:282"/>
that would ſuffer his Statute lawes to be corrupted in the fundimentall
Points, and his publike Records if hee could helpe it; but <hi>God</hi> is our
<hi>King,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1</note> and the Scripture is the Statute-Law of <hi>God</hi> and his publike Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
whereby he makes his Will knowne to Men,<note place="margin">Reaſon, prooving the letter of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>he Scripture hath beene kept un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupted.</note> and governes them,
and therefore can we thinke that the Lord will ſuffer any to corrupt it,
ſeeing he hath Power in his hand to help it, unleſſe we thinke that God
hath leſſe care, than an earthly king would have of his lawes. <hi>Ioſephus</hi>
reports, and alſo <hi>Euſebius</hi> of a certaine Poet that tooke upon him to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
a Holy ſentence to a wrong end, who was ſtricken with blindneſſe
till he made confeſſion of his fault: And of another that tooke a peece
of Scripture to make a jeſt of it, who was taken with a phreneticall
madneſſe, and hardly ever recovered againe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now therefore if God doe puniſh thoſe that do prophane the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
then how much more will he puniſh them that doe corrupt it, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God hath ſet this ſeale to it. This God makes good,</hi> Revel. 22. 18.
For I testifie unto every man that heareth the words of the propheſie of this book,
If any Man ſhall adde to theſe things, God ſhall adde to him the plagues that
are written in this booke, and if any Man ſhall take away from the words of the
booke of this Propheſie, God ſhall take away his part out of the Booke of Life:
<hi>therefore, who durſt meddle to corrupt it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond reaſon <hi>is drawen from the Promiſe of Chriſt in Matth.</hi> 5. 18.<note place="margin">Reaſon 2.</note>
                  <hi>For verily I ſay unto you till Heaven and Earth periſh, one jot or one title of the
Law ſhall not eſcape till all things be fulfilled;</hi> now by the <hi>law,</hi> he meanes the
written Law of God: here we have the promiſe of Chriſt, that as long
as Heaven and Earth indures, there is not one jot or title of the Law
that ſhall be corrupted.</p>
               <p>The third <hi>is taken from the continuall practiſe of the Prophets,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Reaſon 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Apostles,
and of Chriſt himſelfe:</hi> that ſtill ſend the People of God to the Scriptures
as the moſt ſincere Iudges, as <hi>Eſay</hi> 8. 20. <hi>To the Law and to the Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
if they ſpeake not according to this word, it is becauſe there is no light in
them:</hi> ſo 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 19. <hi>We have alſo a moſt ſure word of the Prophets, to the
which ye doe well that ye take heede, as unto a light that ſhineth in a darke place,
&amp;c.</hi> and Chriſt, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 39. ſaith, <hi>Search the Scriptures, for in them you
thinke to have Eternall Life; they are they which testifie of me:</hi> So wee ſee
that Chriſt, the Prophets and Apoſtles call us to the Scriptures, as to the
ſincereſt Iudge. Now if the ſcriptures had beene corrupted and depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
they would not have ſent us to them; for there is no man that will
ſend his ſervant to ſea,<note place="margin">Simile</note> but hee will tell him the danger of it, and of the
Shelves, Rockes and Sands, and where they be, that ſo hee may avoyde
them: ſo if the Scriptures had beene corrupted, Chriſt, the Prophets
and the Apoſtles would not have ſent us to the Scriptures, but would
have told us where the Rockes and Shelves, and where the dangers
had beene, nay if Chriſt had knowne the Scriptures had beene corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
he would have made it knowne; or if he had ſeene that in time to
come they would have beene: therefore this practiſe of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
and Apoſtles, in ſending them to the Scriptures, ſhewes that they
were not corrupted nor depraved.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="552" facs="tcp:17958:283"/>
The fourth reaſon, <hi>is drawne from the circumſtance of time;</hi> which
both Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doe approve of,<note place="margin">Reaſon 4.</note> that if the Scriptures
were corrupted by the <hi>Iewes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1</note> it was either before Chriſts time, or ſoone
after his time,<note place="margin">Argument.</note> if it had beene corrupted before his time, as hee did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proove
other corruptions, hee would have reprooved this alſo, but he
did not reproove this, and therefore it was not corrupted before his
time; againe, it was not after his time, for as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, the Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
Church indured but a while after his time, and then it did diffuſe it
ſelfe into all the world; then though the <hi>Iewes</hi> might have corrupted the
bookes that were in their owne hands, yet they could not corrupt all
the bookes that were in ſo many ſundry hands ſcattered all the world
over; and therefore it was impoſſible for the Iewes to corrupt any <hi>Philo</hi>
and <hi>Ioſephus</hi> report that the <hi>Iewes</hi> lived two thouſand yeeres under the
Law, when there was not one word corrupted; nay, they ſay that the
the Iewes would ſuffer a hundred deaths before they would have cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
any one word. So then this reaſon ſtands good, that it was not
corrupted before Chriſts time nor after his time, and therefore it is not
corrupted in the Originall.</p>
               <p>The fifth reaſon <hi>is taken from the Iudgement of the learned:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Reaſon 5.</note> ſaith Saint
<hi>Ierome,</hi> if wee make any doubt of any queſtion in our Bibles, we ſtraight
runne to bee reſolved of it in the <hi>Originall tongue;</hi> if it bee in the <hi>new</hi>
Teſtament we goe to the <hi>Greeke,</hi> if it be in the <hi>Old</hi> Teſtament we goe to
the <hi>Hebrew;</hi> likewiſe Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith; if any man make any doubt
or queſtion of this or that in the Scripture, by and by wee goe to the
Hebrew Bible to cleere our controverſie, as to the <hi>Canon law.</hi> Hence
we conclude by theſe reaſons that the Church hath preſerved the letter
of the Scripture without any corruption. Whereof we ſhould make
that uſe that <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth,<note place="margin">Vſe</note> 2 <hi>Cor</hi> 6. 1. <hi>Wee as workers together with him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
you alſo that you receive not the grace of God in vaine:</hi> ſo then it is a
grace and a great grace, that the Lord hath preſerved the Scripture
without any corruption in the Hebrew text: therefore I beſeech you
that you would not receive this grace of God in vaine, but labour to
grow in knowledge and to nouriſh thy faith, to increaſe the graces of
his Spirit to the weakening of thy ſinnes and corruptions.</p>
               <p>Now here may a queſtion be made,<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> indeed the Lord hath preſerved
the Scripture in the Originall tongue without any corruption, but in the
Latine and other tongues they have beene corrupted, and therefore
what is this to us, we cannot underſtand Hebrew? Againe, there was
a Popiſh prieſts who ſaid, that wee have no faith, becauſe wee have not
the Word of God, for faith is grounded on the Word of God; but
the Word of God (ſaith he) was written in Hebrew and in Greeke,
which tranſlated into an other tongue, is not the Word of God; how
then ſhall we in this caſe know it to be the Word of God?</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> that the Lord doth by us, as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> did by his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
<hi>Gen.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> 42. 12. firſt, hee ſpake unto them by an interpreter and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
by his owne mouth; ſo the Lord doth ſpeake unto us by the
mouth of his ſervants, and afterwards by his owne: as we know the king
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:17958:283"/>
makes a proclamation of his will to his ſubjects in Engliſh, which when
it commeth into Wales where they cannot underſtand it, by one of the
kings ſubjects is taken and tranſlated into Welch,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> wherein it differeth
not a haire from the other; ſo it pleaſed God to proclaime his will to
his ſervants in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and the <hi>Greeke</hi> tongue at firſt, after which they
were tranſlated into all tongues by his ſervants; ſo that there is not a
haire difference betweene them in ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>I, but how ſhall wee know they bee rightly tranſlated? Hereto I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
firſt, out of <hi>Chryſostome,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Quest.</note> that we need not doubt but whatſoever is
needfull to ſalvation is ſet downe plainely and cleerely in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
and <hi>Auguſtine</hi> adds,<note place="margin">Anſ. The firſt proofe of true Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> that all thoſe places in the Scriptures which
ſpeake of Faith and good manners bee plaine and eaſie; therefore in
plaine and eaſie places the interpreters could not be deceived.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">The ſecond proofe of true Tranſlation.</note> a man may know it is the Word of God in our tongue by
the ſame meanes they may know it in Hebrew; and that is, by the puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
ſincerity, majeſtie, and the power thereof to worke on the ſoules and
conſciences of men. Therefore when a Chriſtian ſhall feele and ſee the
power of it worke on mens conſciences and ſoules with the ſame puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and majeſty, they may ſafely ſay, It is God ſpeakes and not man; <hi>It
is the voyce of my welbeloved that ſpeaketh,</hi> as it is in the <hi>Canticles:</hi> if one
put pretious water into a glaſſe,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and after put it into an earthen veſſell,
by the taſte and vertue of it he may know it to be the ſame water that it
was in the glaſſe; ſo we may know the Word of God which is in <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi>
and <hi>Greeke,</hi> to be the ſame in our tongue by the <hi>vertue, purity, ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
and <hi>power</hi> thereof; therefore the Popiſh prieſts opinion is but a tricke
of wit and ſcant that.</p>
               <p>I, but there are ſome differences in the tranſlations. I anſwer, firſt,<note place="margin">Object. Sol.</note> they
differ not in ſenſe, but in words and termes; for the Scripture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
ſuch high wiſedome as no one man is able to expreſſe it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the divers tranſlators goe as neere as they can to expreſſe it,<note place="margin">1</note> ſome
in one thing, and ſome in an other; and all to make knowne the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of God to us, ſo that it cannot be denied, but that the difference
of tranſlations is a great helpe to expound the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I anſwer, that where there is any difference it is not in the
ſubſtance or any materiall point,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> but it is in genealogies and yeares, and
where any doe finde theſe differences they may bee ſatisfied in it by the
helpe of their paſtours and teachers; to inſtance a few:<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 1. 11.
in the ordinary Bibles there is next unto <hi>Ioſias, Iakim:</hi> which in the new
tranſlation is left out, now if any man would know which of theſe are
the better; let him looke into the 17. verſ. where hee may ſee that all
the Generations from <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>David</hi> are <hi>fourteene,</hi> all betweene
<hi>David</hi> and the <hi>captivitie fourteene,</hi> and from the <hi>captivitie</hi> to Chriſts time
are fourteene; now looke into your ordinary Bibles where are fifteene
generations betweene <hi>David</hi> and the <hi>captivitie,</hi> therefore the new tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
is the better: ſo <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. 19. in the ordinary Bibles it is thus
read, <hi>And I know that the king of Egypt will not let you goe but by ſtrong
hand;</hi> the new tranſlation hath it; <hi>And the king of Egypt will not let you
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:17958:284"/>
goe, no not by a ſtrong hand:</hi> now how may a man know which is the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?
I anſwer, hee may know it although he have no other helpe than
his owne; let him looke into <hi>Exod.</hi> 6. 1. there the Lord ſaith to <hi>Moſes,
now ſhalt thou ſee what I will doe to Pharoah, for by a ſtrong hand ſhall be let them
goe:</hi> ſo herein the ordinary Bibles are the better: from theſe wee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre,
a wiſe Chriſtian may helpe himſelfe by the helpe of his miniſter,
in any doubt about the difference of texts of Scripture: and to ſhut up
all in a word it is plaine and manifeſt by theſe premiſes that the true
Church throughout all ages hath preſerved the letter and text of the
Scripture from all annoiances, taint of corruption, or the leaſt ſoile that
may bee. The uſe hereof is:</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> ſeeing it hath beene the care of the Church in all times to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the letter of Scriptures, therefore it muſt be every mans care to
read it, be acquainted with it, and to meditate therein, ſo to profit by it;
as <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 39. Chriſt counſels us; <hi>Search the Scriptures, for in them yee
thinke to have eternall life, they are they which teſtifie of me:</hi> ſo 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15.
<hi>Timothie</hi> was commended for that <hi>he had knowne the Scriptures of a Childe,
which were able to make him wiſe unto ſalvation;</hi> in like manner wee muſt
know the Scriptures and be acquainted with them to make us truely
wiſe. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith well to this purpoſe that the two teſtaments are
the two breaſts of the Church that every Chriſtian man muſt ſucke, to
draw ſpirituall nouriſhment from,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> that he may live eternally by it; and
another learned man ſaith, that the holy Scripture is an Epiſtle ſent
from the Creator to the creature: if an earthly king ſhould ſend us a
letter, what would we let it lye by us, would we not beſtow ſome time
to read, meditate of it and bee acquainted with it, to know what were
the kings will with us? ſo (ſaith he) the holy Scripture is the letter and
Epiſtle of Almighty God; let us labour to bee acquainted with it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow
ſome time to read it, and meditate therein; another learned man
ſaith, <hi>Now the Paradiſe of God is in this world;</hi> the bookes of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are the <hi>trees of Life,</hi> whereof no man is forbidden to eate, therefore
it muſt be our care to heare the Scriptures read, and to reade them our
ſelves, meditate in them, and tell the good things that wee learne from
thence one to another.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> ſeeing it hath beene the care of the Church to preſerve the
Scripture, it muſt bee our care not onely to reade and to meditate in it,
but alſo to beleeve it, and to put it in practice: as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 124. <hi>David</hi> did:
where hee ſaith, <hi>by the words of thy lips I kept mee from the pathes of the cruell
man;</hi> and againe <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 11. <hi>I have hid thy promiſe in my heart, that I might
not ſinne againſt thee:</hi> See wee muſt learne by the Scriptures to put it in
practice, to ſanctifie us in our wayes, to keep us from ſinning againſt God,
and to direct us in all the things wee take in hand; this fruit and benefit
wee muſt draw out from it: ſaith Chriſt to the Iewes, <hi>I will not accuſe you, but
there is one will accuſe you, even Moſes, in whom yee trust.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> How ſhall <hi>Moſes</hi>
accuſe them? not in his perſon, but by his Bookes and Doctrine, for that
they did not beleeve nor practiſe, but neglect the things that were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
to them therein; ſo <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhall accuſe them, and draw ſuch a
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:17958:284"/>
fearefull bill againſt them, as they ſhall not bee able to anſwer, ſo wee that
bee your Paſtours and teachers wee doe not accuſe you, but <hi>Moſes, Paul</hi> and
<hi>Peter</hi> doth accuſe you, and will write ſuch a fearefull bill of indictment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
you as you ſhall not bee able to anſwere: Therefore labour yee to
repent of your ſinnes, to make conſcience of your wayes, to put in practice
the good things that have beene taught you, that ſo there bee not framed a
fearfull bill of indictment againſt you, which yee ſhall not bee able to
anſwer: eſpecially remember it, at this time to make uſe of it, ſeeing yee ſee
by evident tokens that God is diſpleaſed with us, doe not thinke that time
will weare it out, but ſearch into your hearts and into your lives to ſee
what is amiſſe, repent of your ſinnes, and turne to God that he may turne
away this fearefull judgment, that is come upon this land: Oh my good
brethren, let us not paſſe away theſe things and make no accompt of them,
but let us labour to put them in practiſe, ſeeing wee know them, leſt there
bee ſuch a fearefull bill of indictment framed againſt us, as wee ſhall not be

Secondly, in preſerving the <hi>Canon</hi> of the

Books. Thirdly, in preſerving the <hi>Authoritie</hi> of the

is, that <hi>the Church hath preſerved the true Canon of the

                  <note place="margin">What Canonicall Scripture is.</note> that is, the true number of the Canonicall Bookes without

God, wee muſt not goe by aime and gheſſe, but by rule. Wee muſt hold us

peace ſhall bee upon them and mercy, and upon the Iſrael of God:</hi> And <hi>Exod.</hi> 25.
40. ſaith the Lord to <hi>Moſes, Looke therefore that thou make all after the pattern
that was ſhewed thee in the mount:</hi> There the Lord had given <hi>Moſes</hi> a paterne.
Such a charge as this comes to every Chriſtian concerning all his actions;
ſee that thou doeſt it according to the paterne which the Lord hath leſt
thee in the Scriptures, to bee a rule of faith and good life, and to build up
thy ſoule and conſcience in the aſſurance of thy ſalvation and hope of an
heavenly life: Therefore it hath beene the care of the Church to preſerve
the true number of the Canonicall Bookes intire: <hi>Paul</hi> tells us <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 15.
<hi>Though it bee but a mans Teſtament, when it is confirmed, yet no man abrogates
it, nor addes any thing thereto,</hi> therefore ſeeing the Scripture is the beſt will
and Teſtament of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> there is no man that ſhould adde or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
any thing from it. Now in the New Teſtament all is Canonicall:
It was the wiſedome of the firſt Chriſtians not to ſuffer any thing to goe
hand in hand with the word of God, leſt the Lord ſhould take up that
complaint againſt them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 43. 8. <hi>Albeit they ſet up their threſholds by
my threſholds, and their poſts by my poſts, and the wall between me and them, &amp;c.</hi>
In the new Teſtament all is Canonicall, but in the old, there are nine

<hi>Macchabees,</hi> with ſome fragments of <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>Hester;</hi> as for the ſecond
Booke of <hi>Eſdras,</hi> it is very fabulous, as <hi>S. Ierome</hi> doth affirme; And <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi>
confeſſeth, where hee ſaith, <hi>S. Ambroſe</hi> himſelfe doth foure times
alleage it, and yet it is not Canonicall, becauſe no councell tooke it to
be ſo, and it was not wrote in <hi>Hebrew:</hi> In the ſixt Chapter thereof there are
two monſters ſpoken of that Sea and Land could not hold Now this is a
fabulous thing and a very dreame, therefore (ſaith hee) I wonder what
came into his minde? ſo a certaine <hi>Pope</hi> ſaith, for ſo much as it was found
written in the <hi>Greeke</hi> and not in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> which was the tongue that the
Scripture was wrote in, wee hold it to bee <hi>Apocrypha:</hi> Therefore now if
any man ſhall demand, are there ſome Bookes <hi>Canonicall,</hi> and ſome
<hi>Apocrypha?</hi> I anſwer, that is called <hi>Canonicall,</hi> which was written by the
choſen Penmen of the Holy Ghoſt, and hath ſufficient authoritie in it ſelfe
to confirme our faith, and to perſwade us that God is well pleaſed in the
performance of thoſe things which are required in it; ſaith <hi>Augustine,</hi> if were
finde any hard place, wee are not to blame it, and to ſay it is not true; but
wee muſt ſay the fault is in the Printer, or in the interpreter, or it is becauſe
I doe not underſtand it.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>the Apocrypha</hi> Bookes are ſuch as were written by men, not ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired
though they were learned men, and ſuch as were indued with the
Spirit of God, yet a man is not bound to beleeve them any further than
they have warrant from the Canonicall Scripture. <hi>S. Ierome</hi> ſaith, though
they were good men that wrote them, yet they bee not of weight ſufficient
to confirme any Point of Doctrine no further than they have authoritie
from the Scriptures: And <hi>Damaſcen</hi> ſaith, that they were good Bookes
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:17958:285"/>
but yet they were not put into the <hi>Arke</hi> of God, and kept as the Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall
Scripture was, now here is the difference between them, the Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall
Scripture is the very word of God, &amp;c. The <hi>Apocrypha</hi> though there
bee good things in it, yet in it there is ſome taſte of humane frailtie.</p>
               <p>Now if any man ſhall aske why did not the Church receive this as the
Canonicall Scriptures? I anſwer, there is good cauſe why they did not
receive it; which hath foure grounds for it.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Why the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crypha was not equally recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into the Church; foure grounds.</note> 
                  <hi>becauſe the Iewes which were the Church and people of God did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it:</hi> S. Paul ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. <hi>that to the Iewes were committed in trust the
Oracles of God,</hi> but they did not receive theſe Bookes, therefore they were
not the Oracles of God. But how ſhall wee know that they did not receive
them as the Scripture. I anſwer: Firſt, becauſe <hi>Ioſephus</hi> which was a <hi>Iew,</hi>
tells us in his booke againſt <hi>Appianus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1</note> that the <hi>Iewes</hi> had two and twentie
bookes which were written from God by Holy men inſpired by the Holy
Ghoſt,<note place="margin">The Iewes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them not.</note> ſaying, that other bookes there bee which bee not of the like autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
becauſe they were written ſince the ſucceſſion of the Prophets. And
<hi>S. Ierome</hi> ſaith, that as the <hi>Iewes</hi> had two and twentie letters, ſo they had
two and twentie bookes that they admitted of; and of no other booke
beſides into the Canon of the Scripture: This is ſo cleare that <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
himſelfe confeſſeth it.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ground is this,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>they which did write the Apocrypha, were not the
Penmen of the Scripture.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Apocrypha writers were not Penmen of the Scriptures.</note> Wee ſee in the ſpeech <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 27. where <hi>Abraham</hi>
is brought in ſaying to <hi>Dives,</hi> they have <hi>Moſes &amp; the Prophets, let them heare
them,</hi> ſo <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets were the Penmen of the Scripture: But
the Apocrypha was not written by the Prophets:<note place="margin">1</note> Firſt, becauſe they were
not written in <hi>Hebrew;</hi> which was the tongue that they wrote in; againe,
they would not ſpeake and write in an unknowne tongue to the people,
becauſe they would not bring that curſe upon them which is ſpoken of
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 21. <hi>In the Law it is written, with men of other tongues and other lips
will I ſpeake to this people, and yet for all that will they not heare mee, ſaith the
Lord.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2</note> Secondly, becauſe the Succeſſion of the Prophets were ceaſed at
that time when theſe bookes were written (as <hi>Ioſephus</hi> ſaith,) for they were
written in the time of the <hi>Macchabees:</hi> and <hi>David</hi> tells us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 74. 9. (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecying
of the deſtruction of the Church and true Religion which was
in the time of the <hi>Macchabees) wee ſee not our ſignes, there is no more any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
neither is there among us any that knoweth how long.</hi> Therefore ſeeing it
was not writ in the tongue that the Prophets wrote in, but in <hi>Greeke;</hi> and
they were written ſince the Prophets, therefore the Prophets were not
the Penmen of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The third ground is,</hi> that they bee not in the number of the witneſſes that
Chriſt will ſtand to,<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>for theſe bee Chriſts witneſſes,</hi> Luk. 24. 27. <hi>where it
is ſaid,</hi> and hee began at Moſes and all the Prophets,<note place="margin">They bee not of the witneſſes Chriſt will ſtand to.</note> and interpreted to them in
all the Scriptures the things concerning himſelfe: <hi>ſo</hi> verſe 24. and hee ſaid unto
them, theſe are the words which I ſpake unto you whileſt I was with you, that all
things must bee fulfilled which was written of me in the Law of Moſes and in the
Prophets and in the Pſalmes. Auguſtine <hi>faith well, that the</hi> Iewes <hi>doe not
accompt of any bookes ſave of</hi> Moſes, <hi>the</hi> Prophets, <hi>and of the</hi> Pſalmes, <hi>to the</hi>
                  <pb n="558" facs="tcp:17958:286"/>
which our Lord Ieſus gave witneſſe; and <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaith, that the <hi>Iewes</hi>
did divide the Scriptures into three parts, the <hi>Law,</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and
the <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> they bee the witneſſes that Chriſt ſtands to. But theſe Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crypha
Bookes are not within this number: therefore the Apocrypha is
not received equally as the Scriptures are of the Church.</p>
               <p>The fourth is,<note place="margin">4</note> 
                  <hi>Becauſe the Bookes themſelves bewray that they bee of man, and
not of God:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The wants and imperfections of the Bookes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray ſo much.</note> as <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 4. <hi>Let God bee true and every man a lyar;</hi>
but theſe Bookes there is none of them but have ſome taſte of humane
f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ailty in it, as <hi>Tobit</hi> 5. there an Angell is made to lye; but the elect An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells
are pure and Holy, and cannot lye. Now for the Booke of <hi>Iudith,</hi> that
is a ſtorie deviſed for the Credit of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> for there was never ſuch a
King as is there ſpoken of, amongſt the <hi>Iewes,</hi> nor ſuch a high Prieſt, nor ſo
long a time of tranquillitie and peace for ſo many yeeres together; as is
ſpoken of, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. 7, 8. And for <hi>Eccleſiaſticus Chap.</hi> 24. 12. there the eternall
wiſedome is ſaid to bee a creature: Therefore hereby it may appeare, that
although there bee ſome good things in them, yet they raſt of the veſſell of
earth, whence they came, and ſhew that they came not from heaven as the
Canonicall did, therefore the Church had good reaſon and ground not
to receive theſe Bookes as the Scripture, and alſo to preſerve the true
<hi>Canon</hi> of the Scripture without addition or ſubtraction; and indeed it is
well when the two Testaments may meet together without parting, that
their lippes may kiſſe each other, to joine <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Law</hi> and the
<hi>Goſpell</hi> together, ſeeing that the laſt words of the Old Teſtament ends
with a <hi>Curſe;</hi> and the New beginneth with a bleſſing, <hi>this is the generation
of Ieſus Chriſt the Sonne</hi> of <hi>David</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Abraham.</hi> The uſes are.</p>
               <p>Seeing it hath beene the care of the Church to preſerve the true rule
and Canon of the Scripture without addition or diſtraction,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> wee ſhould
bleſſe God and bee thankfull that hee hath not left us without a rule in ſo
many worldly diſtractions, where Kingdome is ſet againſt Kingdome, one
learned man againſt another, in ſuch varietie of opinions, yet hee hath not
left us without a guide to direct both our lives and conſciences in the
right way, if wee will obey it; as it is <hi>Eſai.</hi> 8. 29. <hi>To the Law and to the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
if they ſpeake not according to this word, it is becauſe there is no light in
them;</hi> ſo <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 39. ſaith Chriſt, <hi>ſearch the Scriptures, for in them yee thinke to
have eternall life, and they are they which testifie of mee;</hi> to the ſame purpoſe
alſo 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 19. (ſaith hee) <hi>Wee have alſo a moſt ſure word of the Prophets, to
the which yee doe well that yee take heed as unto a light that shineth in a darke
place, &amp;c.</hi> Therefore we ſee that God hath given us a rule to direct us by in
the time of diſtraction and danger: If one ſhould have a long jorney to
goe,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and one should put into his hand a glaſſe that would ſhew him every
ſtep hee ſhould take, that hee might not ſtep one ſtep awry, how thankfull
would this man bee? ſuch a glaſſe is the Scripture, for wee have a long
journey to goe from earth to Heaven; wherefore the Lord hath put this
glaſſe into our hands; that is, hee hath given us the Scripture to ſhew us
every ſtep which wee ſhould take, that if wee ſet but one foot awry wee
may ſee it. Therefore how thankfull ſhould wee bee to God for it; <hi>Act.</hi>
17. 11. when <hi>Paul</hi> had preached the word there being oppoſition amongſt
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:17958:286"/>
them, they got to the Bible and ſearched out the truth of the matter
whether it were ſo or no, whereupon it is ſaid, <hi>many of them beleeved.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> So
when the learned men and preachers have oppoſitions there being diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and diverſities of opinions amongſt them, the Lord hath given us a
rule; Wee muſt to the Scriptures: Therefore thankes bee to God, hee hath
not left us to erre and wander, but hath given us a direction to guide us:
<hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſaith well, concerning this point, if there bee any diſtraction or
oppoſition about this thing or that thing, let Chriſt bee the Iudge, for hee
ſpeaketh in the Scripture; therefore this is an excellent bleſſing (which we
are to bee thankfull for) that God hath given us a Rule to walke by.</p>
               <p>The ſecond uſe is,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> ſeeing God hath given us a rule to walk by, therefore
no man can excuſe himſelfe and ſay, I would have done it if I had knowen
it, or if ſome body had told it mee, or if I had a rule to goe by: Now
there is no man can excuſe himſelfe and ſay hee hath not a Rule, for God
hath left him one in his word, which makes all unexcuſable, as <hi>Iohn</hi> 15.
22. Chriſt ſpeakes:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> 
                  <hi>If I had not come and ſpoken to them, they ſhould not have
had ſinne, but now their ſinne abideth;</hi> ſo if God had not left us a rule and
a direction to guide our ſelves by in the Bible, wee ſhould have had no
ſinne; but becauſe God hath given us ſuch a rule to walke by, therefore if
wee walke not according to it wee have no cloake for our ſinne.</p>
               <p>Seeing God hath left us a rule to walke by?<note place="margin">Vſe 3.</note> 
                  <hi>It muſt bee our wiſedome to
make uſe of this rule in</hi> our thoughts, ſpeeches and actions. Wee ſee a man
is much the better that hath a rule to worke by,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> for hee will stick it at his
backe, worke by aime and not by gheſſe; ſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 33. ſaith <hi>David,
Teach mee O Lord the way of thy ſtatutes, and I will keepe it to the end:</hi> As if hee
ſhould ſay, let mee but know thy will, and I am contented to doe it. If
once wee know Gods will, wee muſt direct all our ſpeeches, and actions
to bee ruled by it: It is a great infamy to any man to come into an order,
and not to hold him to his order,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> as to bee a Soldier or a Scholler, but
much more to bee a Chriſtian, and yet not to humble ones ſelf to the rules
of Chriſtianitie, how juſt ſhall our condemnation bee; the Rule of Gods
Word teacheth a man to bee temperate and not to bee overtaken with
surfeting and drunkenneſſe, to bee mercifull, to deale conſcionably in our
wayes, and not to miſpend our time; to repent of our ſinnes, and therefore
when men will not hold them to their rule, to live temperatly, walk holily
and to make conſcience of their wayes; to deale truly and juſtly with men,
to take heede they doe not miſpend their time, to repent them of their
ſinnes, if they doe not theſe things they are fallen from their rule, and
ſhamed in that they hold not to it. <hi>Augustin</hi> ſaith, there bee a number of
things that ſeeme to bee ſtraight, but bring them to the rule, and then wee
may ſee their obliquities; ſo there bee a number of things that ſeeme to be
ſtraight and good, but lay them to the Rule, bring them to the Scriptures,
and to the Law of God, then wee may ſee a number of obliquities in them,
and how ſhort they come of the Rule; as 1 <hi>King.</hi> 17. when <hi>Elias</hi> applied
himſelfe to the Childs dead bodie, his face to the Childs, and his hands to
the Childs hands;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> then did appeare the diſſimilitude between them, and
how ſhort the Child came of him: So when we ſhall compare our actions
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:17958:287"/>
with the Law of God, then wee ſhall ſee the diſſimilitude and diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions
betweene them; and when wee ſee how ſhort we come of it,
it muſt be our care to mend it, and to walke by rule.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Ow the Church is called the <hi>ground and the Pillar
of truth</hi> hath beene in part declared already, for
firſt, it hath preſerved the <hi>letter</hi> of the Scripture;
ſecondly, the <hi>Canon</hi> of the Scripture, that is, the
number of the holy bookes; thirdly, the <hi>authority</hi>
of the Scripture, of which I am now to ſpeake. I
ſay not that the Church giveth authority to the
Scripture, but I ſay it doth preſerve the authoritie
of the Scripture, for if the Church ſhould give authority to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
then, the authority of the Church were greater than the authority
of the Scripture: the Papiſts ſay that the Scripture is not authenticall
but by the authority of the Church; and another ſaith, to ſpeake abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
the Church is of more authority, becauſe it giveth authority to
the Scripture: this is the doctrine of the Papiſts, but the Scripture hath
not his authority from the Church, but from God; ſo Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,
2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>For the whole Scripture is given by inſpiration from God, and is
profitable to teach, to improve, to correct, inſtruct, &amp;c.</hi> ſo 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 25. <hi>for
the prophecies came not in the old time by the will of man, but holy men ſpake as
they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> therefore becauſe the Scripture is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by inſpiration from God it hath its authority from God: unleſſe
we thinke it cannot be the word of God, unleſſe men allow of it, ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
favourable unto God; that unleſſe God pleaſe men they will give
no authority to his word, therefore the Scripture hath ſufficient autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
from God without any teſtimonie from men, becauſe it is the
Word of God.</p>
               <p>Now here comes a queſtion which the Papiſts make; How ſhall we
know the Scripture,<note place="margin">Queſt. Sol.</note> but by the authoritie of the Church? I anſwere,
becauſe we may know it by infallible arguments, and can prove it to
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:17958:287"/>
bee the Scripture. The teſtimony of the Church in this regard is, to
ſhew and declare that it came from God, he is the Author of it, it hath
the Authority from God, not from the Church: the Church onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
and makes it knowne to her Children by infallible teſtimonies,
that it is given by inſpiration from God. As a poore man who carrieth
letters from the king,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> can give no authoritie to it, but if any man make
doubt whether it came from the king or no, he can ſhew the kings hand
and ſeale to it, and make it knowne to bee ſo by divers teſtimonies; ſo
the Church can give to authoritie to the Scripture, but if any man
make doubt whether it bee the Scripture or no, the true Church can
make it knowne by divers arguments that it came from God?<note place="margin">Seven Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</note> and this
is the office of the Church. Now <hi>there bee ſeven evidences, whereby wee
may prove that the Scriptures came from God, the Author of them.</hi>

               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>The puritie of it;</hi> ſo Spirituall and full of holy Matter, of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
Iuſtice,<note place="margin">The Puritie of it.</note> Sanctitie; forbidding vice, commending Vertue, voide
of all Corruption, and ſo farre remooved from the heart of Man, as

ſaith, <hi>What Nation is ſo great that hath ordinances and lawes ſo righteous,
as this law that I have ſet before you;</hi> So <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 19. <hi>The Law of the Lord
is an undefiled Law:</hi> Hence we inferre the puritie thereof doth declare
that it came from God. It is ſo Holy and Divine as no wit of Man could
deviſe the like, all other lawes which have beene made by man in time,
have beene diſcovered, and their corruptions approved; even <hi>Lycur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi>
his Law, which was thought to bee the beſt: All other Bookes
which have beene deviſed by the wit of Man have their corruptions.
Amongſt the Philoſophers no Roſe but had his prickle; no truth, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſome mixture of falſehood; but this Booke of the Scripture, the
longer it is in the World, the more it is diſcovered, the more the puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and holineſſe of it doth appeare: therefore this is an evidence that
it came from God.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> we may know the Scripture is from God, by the majeſty
of it;<note place="margin">By the maieſtie of it.</note> that in ſo plaine words and termes ſuch high wiſedome is contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
therein, and ſo tranſcending the Nature and wit of Man, as no wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of man was ever like unto it: As the officers of the high Prieſts ſaid
of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> 
                  <hi>Iohn</hi> 7. 46. <hi>Never man ſpake like this Man:</hi> ſo we may ſay of the
Scriptures, never did any Booke ſpeake like this Booke: If all mens
wits were laid together, they were not able to gather together one
leafe like it; all other bookes of other writers, with two or three times
reading them over, wee may draw them dry, even the Bookes of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosthenes,
Plato</hi> and <hi>Aristotle;</hi> But if we ſhould live a thouſand yeeres
to read the Scriptures, yet ſtill wee ſhould have one new thing or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>This doth ſhew that all Mens wits have a bottome, but the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
hath none: therefore we may ſay of other bookes, that they bee as
a little gold among a great deale of earth,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> but we may ſay of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
as of the Pearle, that there is a great deale of Treaſure compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
in a little roome.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="562" facs="tcp:17958:288"/>
Thirdly, <hi>by the Power of it:</hi> for there is nothing in this world that the
nature of Man can leſſe digeſt at this day than the Scripture:<note place="margin">3</note> Men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
abide to read the Scriptures,<note place="margin">By the Power of it.</note> and yet notwithſtanding wee ſee of
what power it is, to worke on the ſoule and conſcience of Men, it clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
with them and makes them ſee their ſinnes to repent for them, and
brings them home to God: as <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 12. ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>For the Word
of God is lively and mighty in operation, and sharper than a two-edged ſword,
and entreth through even to the dividing aſunder of ſoule and ſpirit, and of
the joynes and marrow, and is a diſcerner of the thoughts and the intents of the
heart:</hi> Now this power of the Word ſhewes it is from God. Againe,
when a Mans Conſcience is on the racke, there is nothing but God can
releeve him, therefore this is an evidence that it is of God: becauſe it
is of power as well to convert, as alſo to comfort a Man when his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
is on the racke.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4</note> 
                  <hi>By innumerable prophecies and predictions therein that have been
foretold and come to paſſe in the times appointed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
                  <note place="margin">By the Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of it.</note> as <hi>Eſay.</hi> 41. 22. (ſaith God)
<hi>Let them bring forth, and ſhew us what ſhall happen: let them ſhew the
former things what they be, that we may conſider them, and know the latter end
of them, or declare us things for to come. Shew the things that are to come here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
that wee may know that ye are Gods: yea, doe good or doe evill, that wee
may be diſmayed, and behold it together.</hi> So none but God can tell future
things that are meerely contingent: A man may foretell future things
that depend on naturall cauſes, but to foretell things that are meerely
contingent, none can doe but God. But the Scriptures have foretold
divers things which have come to paſſe in the times appointed, and
were meerely contingent, therefore the ſcripture is from God. As <hi>Gen.</hi>
49. 10. there <hi>Iaakob</hi> foretold of Chriſts comming in the fleſh; (ſaith he)
<hi>The Scepter ſhall not depart from Iudah, nor a Lawgiver from betweene his feete,
till Shiloh come:</hi> this was very unlike that ever it ſhould bee, and yet the
governement continued in the Tribe of <hi>Iuda</hi> till <hi>Herod</hi> came (who killed
the <hi>San<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>edrin</hi>) in whoſe dayes Chriſt was borne; ſo likewiſe <hi>David</hi>
prophecied, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72. 8. that <hi>the Goſpell ſhould goe through the World, and
all Nations ſhould yeeld obedience to it:</hi> This hath beene performed,
and ſo of all the prophecies foretold they ſhould come to paſſe in the
time appointed. We ſee the <hi>Iewes</hi> killed the Prophets, and when they
had laid them in the duſt, yet they reverenced the writings and kept
them ſafe; what was the reaſon of it? they ſay, that that which they
ſpake was true, and that came to paſſe: therefore though they could
not abide the Prophets but killed them, yet they regarded their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
and reverenced them.</p>
               <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5</note> 
                  <hi>by the ſincerity of the Writers,</hi> that therein have not concealed
their owne faults:<note place="margin">Evidence, by the ſinceritie of it.</note> If Men muſt write of themſelves, they will bee ſure
to write the beſt, and not the worſt: But thoſe holy Writers have not
ſpared their owne faults; <hi>Moſes</hi> writes of his own faults when he ſtrucke
the Rocke, and tels us that this was the cauſe why hee could not enter
into the land of promiſe: and <hi>David</hi> writes the 51. <hi>Pſalme,</hi> which is a
<hi>Pſalme</hi> of repentance, (bewailing that horrible ſinne which he commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:17958:288"/>
with <hi>Bathſheba</hi>) and hath left it to all ſucceeding ages: nay, there be
ſome of them that no man could have ever knowne their faults, if them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
had not diſcloſed them, as the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> in his third Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<hi>I went</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>but it was in the bitterneſſe and indignation of my ſpirit;</hi>
this ſhewes it came from God. Naturally, men labour to cover their
owne faults, to hide them, and ſpeake well of themſelves, to gaine cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit:
but the Spirit of God takes away all from man, and giveth it to
God. Therefore becauſe theſe holy writers take away all from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and give the honour to God, this doth ſhew it came from God.
It is a prettie conſideration of a Heathen Man,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> Hee brings a Man and a
Lion reaſoning which was the ſtrongest; whether the Lion or the
Man; the one ſaid the Lion, and the other the Man; who brings the
Lion to a picture, where the Man was tearing and rending the Lion; ſo
(ſaith he) Man is the ſtrongest: Nay (ſaith the Lion) the reaſon hereof
is, becauſe Man made the picture himſelfe; for, ſaid he, if the Lion had
made the picture, then he would have made the Lion tearing the Man,
for every Man will be favourable to himſelfe. In like manner (to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
this) if Man had made the Scripture, he would have ſet up his own
glory, but becauſe they take away all their own glory, and give it God,
it is an evidence that it is of God.</p>

                  <hi>By the wonderfull conſent of thoſe which were the writers of it:</hi>
both in regard of the <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>manner.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Evidence, the conſent of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</note> Firſt, for the <hi>matter,</hi> that it was

conſented in one thing:<note place="margin">In the matter.</note> what doth this ſhew us but that they were all
guided by one God, in this wonderfull conſent? Therefore, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
came from God.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> in regard of the <hi>manner</hi> they agree; for <hi>Amos</hi> being but a
ſhepheard,<note place="margin">Manner.</note> and taken from following the ſheepe, yet writes as Divine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Holily, and Excellently, as <hi>Eſay</hi> that was of the Kings ſeede and
brought up at the Court; for hee writes againſt the ſinnes that were
then uſed at the Court, eſpecially againſt pride; as we may ſee, <hi>Amos</hi> 3.
ſo likewiſe <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> were poore fiſhermen and unlearned, and yet
they write as Divinely, Heavenly and Excellently, as <hi>Paul</hi> did, that
was brought up at the feete of <hi>Gamaliel.</hi> Let any man ſhew mee any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reaſon why <hi>Amos</hi> that was but a ſhepheard did write as Holily
and Divinely, as <hi>Eſay</hi> that was brought up at the kings Court, and why
<hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> which were but poore fiſhermen ſhould write as Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and excellently, as <hi>Paul</hi> that was brought up at the feet of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi>
and I will yeeld to him, but I thinke there can bee no other reaſon than
this, that the ſame GOD that did aſſiſt the one, did aſſiſt the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Seventhly,<note place="margin">7</note> 
                  <hi>by naturall reaſon,</hi> for reaſon teacheth us that God muſt be
worſhipped;<note place="margin">Evidence, by Naturall Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> then every Mans heart telleth him, that he muſt not bee
worſhipped as we will, but as he will; for the ſervant muſt not preſcribe
the Maſter, but the Maſter the ſervant; but God hath not preſcribed
his worſhip in any place, but in the Scriptures: therefore this reaſon
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:17958:289"/>
ſtands good, <hi>That the Scripture is not the word of Man,</hi> but the Word of
God. The Uſes are:</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> ſeeing the Scriptures are the word of God, therefore there is
nothing more certaine and ſure in this world than the ſaith of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an;
all arts and ſciences are grounded on truth, that is, the truth of the
creature which wee call created truth, but the faith of a Chriſtian is
grounded on an uncreated truth, for there is no compariſon betweene
created and uncreated truth, therefore there is nothing more certaine
and ſure in this world than the faith of a Chriſtian; as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 4, 5. ſaith
the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> neither ſtood my words and preaching <hi>in the inticing
ſpeeches of mans wiſedome, but in plaine evidence of the Spirit and of power,
that your faith ſhould not bee in the wiſedome of men, but in the power of God;</hi>
ſo the faith of a Chriſtian is moſt ſure, ſenſe and reaſon may deceive, but
faith cannot, becauſe it is grounded on an uncreated truth; therefore
in holy reverence (as one ſaith) we may ſay, Lord, Lord, if we be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in the hope of glory and in the hope of life everlaſting, thou haſt
deceived us: if we have but the word of a man we will build reſt and
relye on it,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> but we have a word and warrant from God, and yet we doe
not reſt and relye on that, through corruption of mans heart and his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
although the word of God is an uncreated truth and the other a
created.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> ſeeing the Scripture is the Word of God, therefore it is
the higheſt Iudge where all queſtions and controverſies may bee deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded:
the Prince and his letters are all one in law,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſo God and his Word
is all one; therefore becauſe the Scripture is the Word of God, it is the
higheſt Iudge. <hi>Aquinas</hi> ſaith, whoſoever bringeth a letter from one it
is as if he brought the party; ſo when we bring Gods Word for a thing,
it is as if wee ſhould bring God, becauſe it is the voyce of God, who is
the higheſt Iudge of all; therefore although a kingdome and a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
ſhould command us to doe ſuch and ſuch things, if the Word of
God condemne it, we muſt not doe it. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. When the devill came
to the Woman to tempt her to eate of the forbidden fruite, ſaith ſhee,
<hi>God hath ſaid wee ſhall not eate of it;</hi> ſo a Chriſtian ſhould doe when hee
meets with temptations and is tempted to ſinnes, he muſt ſay, God hath
ſaid, I muſt not lye, deceive, prophane the Sabboth, be drunken; I muſt
not miſſpend my time, because God hath forbidden it therefore I muſt
not doe it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Vſe 3.</note> ſeeing the Scripture is the Word of God, wee muſt take
heed wee doe not neglect it: becauſe it comes from God, and is the
voyce of God that ſaith, feare God, love your brethren, live in charity
one with another, walke holily and chriſtianly, repent of your ſinnes;
therefore we muſt reſpect the voyce of God: as it is, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. <hi>he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that deſpiſeth theſe things: deſpiſeth not man but God:</hi> therefore ſeeing
God hath ſaid, <hi>Pray continually, in all things give thankes;</hi> wee muſt take
heed wee doe not deſpiſe the Word of God.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Vſe 4.</note> ſeeing the Scripture is the Word of God, therefore this
will direct us in the dangerous paſſages of this world, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. (ſaith
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:17958:289"/>
                  <hi>David) thy Word is a lanthorne unto my feet and a light unto my path;</hi> ſo
<hi>Matth.</hi> 2.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> when the Wiſemen went to ſeeke Chriſt there was a ſtarre
appeared unto them, which they followed till it brought them to the
houſe whereas Chriſt was; ſuch a ſtarre is the Bible, the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
if wee follow it, it will not leave us till it bring us to Chriſt: Saint
<hi>Baſil</hi> ſaith, it is the manner of Marriners when they bee at Sea, to direct
themſelves in their voyage ſafe home,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> by caſting their eyes up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
in the day looking to the Sunne; and in the night, to ſome bright
ſtarre; ſo muſt thou doe if thou wilt goe ſafe to heaven, looke to the
Word of God and hold to it, that it may be a direction to thee, let not
thine eyes ſlumber nor ſleepe, but follow on till thou come to a joyfull
beholding of God in Chriſt, and all the holy Angels and people of God
where we ſhall live for ever and ever.</p>
               <p>We have already ſpoken of foure points wherein the dignitie of the
Church conſiſts firſt, that it is called the <hi>City of God;</hi> ſecondly, that
it is called the <hi>body of Chriſt;</hi> thirdly, that it is called the <hi>Spouſe of Chriſt;</hi>
fourthly,<note place="margin">Fifth dignitie of the Church. There is no ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation out of it</note> that it is called the <hi>ground and Pillar of truth.</hi> Fifthly, that it is
like to <hi>Noahs Arke, that there is no ſalvation without it;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> for as in the old
world all periſhed that were not gathered into <hi>Noahs</hi> Arke, their wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
Towers, caſtles and goods could not ſave them; ſo all that are not
gathered into the Church they ſhall periſh, it is not their wiſdome, nor
wealth that can ſave them, for the Church is the <hi>Arke</hi> of God, there is
no ſalvation but in Sion, that is in the Church of God: therefore the
holy Scripture ſaith in this place, of thoſe God had a purpoſe to ſave,
<hi>he added to the Church from day to day:</hi> ſo <hi>Ephe.</hi> 5. 23. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that
<hi>Chriſt is the Saviour of his body,</hi> now the Church is the body of Chriſt,
therefore there are none ſaved but the Church, that is none but they
which are joyned to Chriſt, and become members of him, as <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 2. 18,
19.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> there wee ſee a covenant was made betweene <hi>Rahab</hi> and the Spies,
that ſhe ſhould hang a red threed, or a cord out of the window at their
comming, ſo all that were within the houſe ſhould be ſaved, but if they
were out of the houſe, though they were her owne kindred yet they
ſhould periſh, their bloud ſhould be upon their owne heads; ſuch a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
God hath made with us, that if we will get into the houſe where
the red threed, the cord hangs, out of the bloud of Chriſt, we ſhall bee
ſaved, but all that be without this houſe are like to periſh, their bloud
ſhall be upon their owne heads.<note place="margin">Foure reaſons why thereis no ſalvation out of the Church.</note> Now there are foure reaſons why there
is no Salvation but in the true Church of God.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>because there onely the heavenly light ſhineth:</hi> the Church is the
<hi>Goſhen</hi> of God,<note place="margin">Reaſon 1.</note> where the heavenly light ſhineth when all the world
over lye in Aeygptian darkneſſe, as wee ſee in the Scriptures: therefore
becauſe the heavenly light ſhineth in the Church,<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 5. 19. Col. 1. 15. 1 Pet. 2. 9.</note> there is no ſalvation
without it; ſo <hi>Eſai.</hi> 59. 10. (it is ſaid,) <hi>Wee grope for the wall like the blind,
as one without eyes,</hi> who ſtumbles in the noone dayes as in the twilight,
wanting the light,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> they daſh here, and there, they grope for the wall and
cannot finde it, ſo all that be out of the Church of God, want this ſame
heavenly light, to ſhine unto them, they daſh here and there, grope for
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:17958:290"/>
the wall, loſe themſelves, and ſhall never be able to finde the way to heaven,
therefore becauſe the light of God ſhineth in the Church onely, there is
no ſalvation without it.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>becauſe wee can have no Communion with Christ, unleſſe wee have
Communion with the members of Chriſt:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Reaſon.</note> for as it is in the naturall, ſo it is in
the myſticall body of Chriſt, in the naturall body wee cannot have
Communion with the head, unleſſe we have Communion with the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
for my hand cannot have Communion with my head unleſſe it bee
joyned to my arme;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſo wee cannot have Communion with Chriſt, unleſſe
wee have had Communion with his members, which is the true Church
of God: therefore there is no ſalvation without it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Reaſon 3.</note> 
                  <hi>becauſe no where elſe wee can looke for a bleſſing but in the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the faithfull,</hi> and ſocietie of the godly. It is true indeed (as <hi>David</hi>
ſaith) that the earth is full of the goodneſſe of God, but the ſpeciall bleſſing
of God reſteth onely in the ſocietie of the faithfull; as <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 24. ſaith
God, <hi>In all places where I ſhall put the remembrance of my name, I will come to
thee and bleſſe thee:</hi> ſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 113. 3. it is ſaid of the Church, <hi>For there the
Lord appointed bleſſing and life for evermore.</hi> Now the mountaines of <hi>Sion</hi>
are figure of the true Church of God; ſo the bleſſing of <hi>Sion</hi> is no where
but in the Communion of the true Church; as <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. wee ſee a number
of Lame men ſicke &amp; diſeaſed, lay at the poole ſide, waiting when the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell
of God ſhould come down and ſtir the waters, becauſe whoſoever
could get in after the waters were ſtir'd was healed, what diſeaſe ſoever he
had; ſo becauſe in the ſocietie of the faithfull, there is not one onely Angell
that deſcended, but God himſelfe comes down by his grace and holy
Spirit, to bleſſe us, and to make his word profitable to us, therefore here
we are to waite and to attend for this ſpeciall bleſſing of God.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Reaſon 4.</note> 
                  <hi>becauſe Chriſt raigneth onely in the Church of God,</hi> all the reſt of
the world is under the power of the Divell and ſinne; ſo <hi>Mich.</hi> 4. 7. it is
ſaid, <hi>there the Lord ſhall raigne over them in mount Sion, for ever and ever;</hi> as
alſo <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 33. <hi>and hee ſhall raigne over the houſe of Iacob for ever, and of his
Kingdome there ſhall bee no end;</hi> that is, of the <hi>Militant Church:</hi> therefore
becauſe Chriſt raigneth in the Church of God, the Divell taking all the
reſt as his own, this is the fourth reaſon why there is no ſalvation without
the Church: Thus much for the Doctrine. The uſes are:</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> ſeeing there is no ſalvation but in the true Church of Chriſt,
therefore wee ſhould bee thankfull to God, that hee hath made us mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of it, for wee might elſe have periſhed in ignorance and blindneſſe:
this hath beene the practice of Gods Children in former ages; for <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.
27. It was all the bleſſing that <hi>Noah</hi> gave to his Sonne <hi>Iapheth</hi> for his
goodneſſe in covering of the nakedneſſe of his Father, (ſaith hee) <hi>God
perſwade Iapheth to dwell in the Tents of Shem;</hi> and <hi>Ioſeph</hi> become a great man
in the Kingdome of <hi>Pharoah</hi> might have made his Sonnes great men alſo,
but hee had more care to adopt them into the true Church of God, and
to have Gods bleſſing powred out upon them, than to make them great
men in the Kingdome of <hi>Pharoah;</hi> as wee may reade <hi>Gen.</hi> 43. 13. in like
manner <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12. 24. it is ſaid, <hi>that Moſes by faith (when hee was come to age)
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:17958:290"/>
refuſed to bee called the Sonne of Pharoahs daughter, and choſe rather to ſuffer
adverſitie with the People of God;</hi> whatſoever <hi>Moſes</hi> did when hee was a
Childe, yet when hee comes to diſcretion hee refuſed to bee called the
Sonne of <hi>Pharoahs</hi> Daughter, and had ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>her live in the Communion of
the faithfull, than bee called in the princely honours of the unfaithfull:
Therefore ſeeing it is ſuch a great bleſſing to live in the ſocietie of the
faithfull,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> wee ought to bee thankfull to God that hee hath brought us out
of the belly of Poperie, as <hi>Ionas</hi> was delivered out of the belly of the whale.
It is a pittifull thing to ſee a number of men live in the Church of God,
who doe not partake of the power of it, they live in the Church as fiſhes in
the Sea which although they breed live and dye in the Sea,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> yet never taſte
of the ſaltneſſe of it; ſo there bee a number of men that are bred in the
Church, live and dye in it, yet never taſt of the power of it in their ſoules
and conſciences, nor partake of the holy graces of it. Therefore hath God
brought thee to the Communion of the Church? Labour to partake of
the bleſſings and graces of it, to grow in the feare of God, in the love of
our brethren, in obedience to his commandements, in care to pleaſe him,
in faith, in repentance, in knowledge, in zeale of his glorie, and ſo our
comfort ſhall bee great at the day of judgement; but if thou doe not grow
in theſe things, great ſhall thy terrour bee at that time.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> ſeeing there is no ſalvation but in the true Church of God,
therefore we ſhould hold communion with it, and not ſuffer our ſelves to
bee drawne from the ſocietie of it; as <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 68. When many ſlipped
away, <hi>Peter</hi> himſelfe could ſay,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> when Chriſt ſaid to him, <hi>Will you all goe?</hi>
saith hee, <hi>Maſter, whither ſhall wee goe? thou hast the words of eternall life:</hi> ſo
when wee ſee others to goe out of the ſocietie of the Church and to bee
drawne away, let us ſay, whither ſhall wee goe? here are the words of
eternall life, here are the meanes to get <hi>Faith</hi> and repentance here are the
meanes of ſalvation &amp; life everlaſting. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 9. When there was a queſtion
made whether Iesus was of God or no; the blind man anſwers, (as if hee
ſhould ſay) is it not a ſtrange thing that ye aske me whether he be of God
or no, and yet yee have ſeene the power of God in his perſon; for wee read
there theſe words, <hi>whether hee bee a ſinner or no I cannot tell, but one thing I
know that I was bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nd and now I ſee:</hi> ſo men muſt bee wiſe to anſwer tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
when ſome ſhall ſay to them, your Miniſters are not the miniſters of
Chriſt, there is a fault in their Ordinations: Wee muſt anſwer againe, I
know not whether there bee any fault in their Ordination or no; but this I
know that once I was a ſwearer, a bad perſon, and a vile liver, indeed I once
lived in blindneſſe and ignorance, but by their miniſtery now I am come
to ſee my ſinnes, bee humbled for them, and to lay hold on Ieſus Chriſt:
Therefore whatſoever thou thinke my beleefe is they bee the miniſters of
Chriſt. Hiſtorians report that there is a certaine beaſt called an <hi>Hyena</hi>
like a Wolfe, that comes to the ſhepheards houſe, and there mones and
bewayles himſelfe, and if hee heares any body named, hee calls them out
of doores,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and then falls on them and makes a prey of them, ſo a number of
ſuch <hi>Hyena's</hi> there bee in the world, who come and mone and bewayle
themſelves, when they heare their names, they call them out of the doores,
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:17958:291"/>
that is, out of the Church; then they fall upon them and make a prey on
them: Therefore wee ſhould bee wiſe to hold the Communion of the
Church.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Vſe 3.</note> ſeeing there is no ſalvation but in the true Church of God,
therefore the ſentence of excommunication is the fearfulleſt ſentence that
is, other ſentences condemnes us in our bodies, goods, or our libertie,
but this declares us to bee of the Communion of the ungodly; by other
ſentences wee are committed to the Iayle, but by this cenſure we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to Sathan; as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 5. ſaith hee, <hi>when yee bee gathered together and
my Spirit, with the power of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, that ſuch an one bee delivered
unto Sathan for the deſtruction of the fleſh:</hi> Therefore this ſentence is the
fearfulleſt that can paſſe on a man. But here I will ſpeake my conſcience, it
is a pittifull thing that ſuch a cenſure ſhould bee uſed for every light and
pettie matter; there is never a ſurgeon that dare cut off the leaſt finger of
the King though it were diſeaſed, but would uſe all meanes that might be
before hee did it,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſo there is never a poore Chriſtian but is as deare to God
as a King or the greateſt Potentate that is; and therefore what great
caution ſhould there bee uſed, before this cenſure of excommunication be
pronounced againſt any man, but wee have now cauſe to thanke God that
it is not ſo common amongſt us as it hath been. There is alſo another fault
amongſt us, that a poore man many times ſtands excommunicated three
or foure yeers together; indeed there may bee a fault in the poore man to
ſtand ſo long, but let us take heed it bee not for want of our helpe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as wee are ready to contribute to the neceſſities of their bodies, ſo we
ſhould bee to contribute to them in this caſe.</p>
               <p>But here may a Chriſtian demand,<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> whether were a man beſt to give
money or to ſtand excommunicated ſtill? this queſtion I will anſwer by
another queſtion; what if a man fall into the hands of Theeves, were hee
better to loſe his money or his life?<note place="margin">Anſ.</note> I anſwer hee were better to loſe his
money, becauſe his life is the greater, even ſo a man were better to loſe
his money than the meanes of grace,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> which is the greater. Another may
here object and ſay,<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> I, but how if a man cannot bee abſolved without hee
ſhould ſinne againſt God and offend his conſcience? To this I anſwer, that
if the caſe be ſo that he cannot be abſolved but he muſt ſinne againſt God,<note place="margin">Anſ.</note>
then hee were better loſe the Communion of men which is the leſſer, than
the Communion of God which is the greater; as <hi>Iohn</hi> 9. wee ſee the blind
man whom the Phariſees had caſt out Chriſt meets with, and ſaid unto
him, <hi>doest thou beleeve in the Sonne of God?</hi> as if hee ſhould ſay, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
this cenſure thy cauſe is good, thou art a bleſſed man: in like
maner although the cenſure of excommunication hath paſſed upon thee,
if thou beleeveſt in the Sonne of God, thy caſe is good, this may comfort
Chriſtians. Lawyers have a ſaying that <hi>unjuſt Lawes binde no man;</hi> and
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith, that there is a double Communion, an externall and an
internall Communion; the externall Communion of the Church of God
is in the word preached, prayer, and in Sacraments; the internall is in the
graces of the Spirit, Faith, love and other graces: Now a man may bee caſt
out from the externall Communion, the word and Sacraments, (as when
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:17958:291"/>
a man is put into priſon or baniſhed) and yet may have the internall
Communion with the Church; a man may be cut off from his brethren in
regard of outward ſocietie, but hee can not bee cut off from Chriſt.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> And
theſe bee the uſes wee are to make of this point.</p>
               <p>Now that wee have ſpoken of the <hi>Nature of the Church,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2</note> in the next

which ye are:</hi> Therefore ſeeing the Church of God is an aſſembly of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
People, accordingly as it is Holy, wee (the Members thereof) muſt
labour to be Holy.</p>
               <p>Now the Holineſſe of the Church is oppoſed unto three things that
ſeemeth to take away Holineſſe from it:<note place="margin">3</note> Firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <note place="margin">Things ſeeming to oppugne the Holineſſe of the Church.</note> the judgement of the
world; for it thinkes that of all ſocieties they are the vileſt and the
worſt; they thinke them to be but a company of diſſemblers and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites
that profeſſe the Word, but deny the Power of it: but we that
are Chriſtians beleeve that the Church of God is Holy, though the
World thinke them a company of diſſemblers. <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Psal.</hi> 13.
<hi>Yet God is good to Iſrael, even to the pure in heart:</hi> and in the 14. of <hi>Deut.</hi> 2.
we read, <hi>For thou art an Holy People to the Lord thy God, and the Lord hath
choſen thee to be a precious people to him:</hi> Therefore howſoever the World
condemnes them, yet wee beleeve that God hath a Holy company of
People in the World.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing that ſeemeth to take away Holineſſe from the
Church is,<note place="margin">2</note> that it is a united company of good and bad together: for I
have ſhewed you that the Church of God is like to a Flocke, wherein
are Sheepe and Goates; a Floore wherein is Corne and Chaffe; a Field
wherein are Tares and Wheate;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and yet theſe bad perſons are no true
Members of the Church, but like bad humours in the body. Againe,
the Faith of a Chriſtian oppoſeth and doth beleeve that there is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of Holy People, and that the wicked that live amongſt them, doe
not defile the Holy things of God; for it is <hi>Pauls</hi> rule, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 26.
<hi>Let a Man therefore examine himſelfe, &amp;c.</hi> whereupon ſaith <hi>Augustine,</hi>
Marke, thou that art a good Man, thou mayeſt eat and drinke with
comfort, if thou doe examine thy ſelfe: and againe, he that eateth and
drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh his owne damnation: not ſo
to thee that art a good Man; but to the wicked, that came like ſwine
without any preparation at all.</p>
               <p>The third thing that ſeemes to take away holineſſe from the Church
is the remainders of ſinne and corruption;<note place="margin">3</note> for there is no Man in the
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:17958:292"/>
eſtate of Grace, but hath complained of this. So <hi>David Pſal.</hi> 40. 12.
<hi>My ſinnes hath taken ſuch hold on me, that I am not able to looke up;</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi>
complayneth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. <hi>The good thing that I would doe, that doe I not, but
what I hate, that doe I, &amp;c.</hi> ſo in the beſt eſtate there is ſome remainders
of ſinne: Therefore, although the World and the Divell ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
them, yet we beleeve the Church of God is Holy.</p>

Firſt, we beleeve the Church of GOD is <hi>Holy:</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
that it is <hi>Catholike,</hi> agreable to that part of our
Chriſtian profeſſion. Now the Church of God is holy
foure manner of wayes:</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Foure wayes the Church is Holy.</note> 
                  <hi>In regard of the Holineſſe of their Faith,</hi> or by the Holineſſe of
their Faith.<note place="margin">1</note> All other ſocieties are fouly ſpotted and tainted with er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
againſt the foundation, but this remaines unſpotted in the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation:
therefore the Church is Holy, becauſe their Faith is Holy. So
<hi>Iude</hi> 20. <hi>But ye beloved, edifying your ſelves in your moſt holy Faith, keepe your
ſelves in the Love of God:</hi> So <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 6. ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Give not that
which is holy to Dogges.</hi> It cannot be denyed but that there may bee er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
in the true Church; for as they bee ſubject to all other ſinnes, ſo
are they to the ſinne of ignorance: as <hi>Levit.</hi> 4. 3. there was a ſacrifice
appointed for the <hi>Ignorance of the Prieſts and People;</hi> and <hi>Habakuk</hi> 3.
the <hi>Prophet</hi> intitles, <hi>a prayer for the Ignorances:</hi> Therefore the Church
may bee ignorant of ſome things, as the Church of Ieruſalem was.
<hi>Acts</hi> 11. 10. The Church was ignorant of the calling of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> till
they were informed by <hi>Peter;</hi> and in <hi>Cyprians</hi> time there was rebaptiſing
held in the true Church: So in <hi>Augustines</hi> time it was held as a thing
needfull to ſalvation for Children to receive the Lords Supper contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> rule, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>Let a Man examine himſelfe;</hi> therefore it
is out of queſtion their may be errors in the true Church.</p>
               <p>But the difference is twofold:<note place="margin">How the true Church may erre two waies.</note> Firſt, that <hi>they doe not erre in the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
their errours doe not ſtrike at the heart, and let out the life-blood

Holy in the foundation.<note place="margin">Simile.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>Though it fall into errour, it is ſo aſsisted by the Power of grace
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:17958:292"/>
as it doth not reſt till it recover againe;</hi> as mud being throwne into a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
reſts not till it workes it out and ſettles againe; ſo though the
Church fall into errour, it is ſo aſſiſted by the power of grace,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> as that it
recovers againe; as <hi>Iohn.</hi> 16. 11. ſaith Chriſt, <hi>When hee is come, that is the
Spirit, He ſhall lead you into all Truth,</hi> that is, poſſeſſe them with all truth,
and lead them in all Truth: <hi>Peter</hi> himſelfe did not know all, for he was
ignorant of the calling of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> till he ſaw the viſion: And then it
was revealed unto him; ſo though the Church of God be ignorant for
ſome time, it ſhall not ſo continue, but the Holy Ghoſt will lead it into
all truth.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>with the holineſſe of their Faith, they muſt joyne holineſſe of life:</hi> as
2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5. ſaith he, moreover, <hi>joyne with your Faith vertue, and with vertue
knowledge, and with knowledge temperance, &amp;c.</hi> with ſaith, there muſt be joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
good life: as of 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 19. ſaith S. <hi>Paul,</hi> of ſome <hi>having faith and a
good conſcience which ſome have put away, and as concerning faith hath made
Shipwracke;</hi> they were not wiſe enough to joyne to the holines of their
faith holines of life, but caſt away a good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science, made no conſcience
of known duties, and ſo made ſhipwracke of all the pretious graces that
they had imbarked. In the 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 10. it is ſaid, <hi>Becauſe they received not
the love of Truth that they might be ſaved, therefore did God ſend them ſtrong
deluſions that they ſhould beleeve lies:</hi> Therefore if men will not receive
the love of the truth, that they may be ſaved, it is juſt with God to ſend
them ſtrong deluſions to beleeve lyes: therefore it muſt bee our care
that with holineſſe of our faith we joyne a Holy life.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Church is holy by the imputation of Chriſts righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,
as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2</note> 1. 30. it is ſaid, <hi>Chriſt is made to us of God the Father wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
righteouſneſſe, ſanctification and redemption:</hi> ſo Chriſt is not onely
our juſtification, but our ſanctification, for his holineſſe is imputed to
us. In the Law as wee may ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 16. In the firſt fruits all the reſt
was ſanctified, though they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>re not brought into the Temple nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented<note place="margin">Simile.</note>
before God, yet by th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> firſt fruites the reſt was made Holy, by
a certaine power, to the eate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and uſers of them; ſo becauſe Chriſt is
the firſt fruits that was offered to God in all the puritie that might bee,
therefore the Church of God is made holy by relation from him. To
this the Schoolemen agree, for ſaith <hi>Aquinas,</hi> every imperfect thing
preſuppoſeth ſome certaine thing that is perfect, that it might be helpt:
all our holineſſe is unperfect in our ſelves, therefore it muſt bee made
perfect by the holineſſe of Chriſt. In all accuſations of the Divell, and
conflicts of our conſciences, wee ſhould come to God and ſay; Lord,
though I am a ſinner, uncleane, and have infinite wants in my ſelfe, yet
in my Head Chriſt, I am ſanctified and made Holy; ſo that whatſoever
I want in my ſelfe, it is made good in him. We ſee chryſtall, though it
have no light nor luſtre in it ſelfe,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> yet ſet it in the Sunne, and it recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
the Sunne beames: ſo although we have no light nor manner of
luſtre in our ſelves, yet if we be brought to Chriſt, wee receive all the
graces of Chriſt: therefore in the <hi>Revelation</hi> the Church is ſaid to bee
apparelled with the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="572" facs="tcp:17958:293"/>
Thirdly, <hi>the Church is holy by inherent holineſſe:</hi> becauſe there is never
a true member of the Church but doth labour to be holy, though they
be incumbred with a number of ſinnes: Therefore <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>holy brethren,</hi> and <hi>Eſay</hi> 65. 12. It is ſaid of them, <hi>and they ſhall call them
the holy People, the redeemed of the Lord:</hi> for it is the care of every true
member to be holy though they be troubled with many incumbrances,
weakneſſes and ſinnes: Therefore whoſoever thou art, that art not
holy at all, for wee cannot obtaine to bee perfectly holy in the eſtate
of corruption, labour to bee holy in ſome meaſure, uſe the meanes,
and have care to rid and remove thy ſinnes; for otherwiſe thou art no
true member of the holy Church. A man may live in the Church till
his fleſh rot, or his eyes fall out of his head, and yet be no true member
of the Church, no more than a wodden legge is a true part of a Mans
body,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> which though it moove and goe with the body, yet may be laid
in the fire when the body is in ſafety, becauſe it is not joyned to it, to
draw life and motion from it; in like manner a man may live in the
Church, and bee no true member thereof, becauſe hee is not joyned to
Chriſt; nor can approve himſelfe to his owne conſcience, or to the
conſcience of others; therefore as it is the care of every true member to
be holy, ſo it muſt be the care of us that are in the Church.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4</note> the Church is holy, <hi>becauſe there be the meanes of holineſſe:</hi> It is
not ſo holy, as <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> ſaid <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. 3. to <hi>Moses</hi> and
<hi>Aaron, ye take too much upon you ſeeing all the congregation is holy:</hi> Thus to
have no neede of Magiſtracie and Miniſterie, were a dangerous errour
for any to thinke: for the Church hath neede of all the meanes of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe,
though there be ſome beginnings of it, yet they have neede of
<hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> of Magiſtracie and Miniſtery; as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77. 20. it is ſaid,
that <hi>The Lord led the People of Iſrael, like Sheepe by the hand of Moſes and Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron;</hi>
the Lord led them with great tenderneſſe and reſpect; hee led
them like ſheepe, but it was by the hand of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> as long as
the Church is in her Pilgrimage, it hath ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>de of all meanes of holineſſe
to guide and direct her to Heaven: in the Church are the Springs of
life and ſalvation, there are the Scriptures and the meanes of holineſſe,
all other companies and ſocieties have not the like.<note place="margin">Object.</note> The Papiſts ſay,
that they have more meanes of holineſſe than we, by their Faſting, Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimages,
Caſtigations and ſuch like trumperies, but I would have
them to conſider what Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in the 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8. <hi>Bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ily exerciſes
profit little;</hi> marke, ſaith a good man, hee doth not ſay they profit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but they profit little when they want the maine, (as <hi>Augustine</hi>
ſaith) they runne apace, and the more ſpeede they make, the further off
they be from Heaven.</p>
               <p>Now the Papiſts faile in too maine things:<note place="margin">Defects of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Holineſſe.</note> firſt, in the <hi>true ground;</hi>
ſecondly, <hi>in the true meanes of holineſſe:</hi> First, <hi>in the true ground,</hi> for before
our workes be accepted,<note place="margin">1</note> our perſons muſt be in favour; for our works
cannot pleaſe God till our perſons pleaſe him:<note place="margin">Failing.</note> as <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>But the Lord
had reſpect unto Abel, and to his ſacrifice:</hi> Some thinke to pleaſe God with
their good deeds, and never seeke to have their perſons accepted by
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:17958:293"/>
the meanes of Chriſt, and therefore they faile in the ground.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>they faile in the true meanes,</hi> for righteouſneſſe and holineſſe
come by union with Chriſt,<note place="margin">2</note> being ingrafted and planted into Chriſt by
a true faith, that the life that they live, they may live in the Sonne of
God;<note place="margin">Failing.</note> and ſo Chriſt derives his holineſſe to them: but if they bee not
united and knit to him, they doe not live in him. Wherein they may
be compared to a Man that takes a Siens,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and bindes it to the barke of a
tree, then waters it, and beſtowes great paines about it; nevertheleſſe
it withers, becauſe it is not ingrafted into the tree; ſo becauſe they be
not planted into Chriſt to draw holineſſe from him, therefore though
they take great paines, yet all comes to nothing: ſo that they faile in the
right ground and true meanes of holineſſe.</p>
               <p>Now becauſe the true meanes of holineſſe is in the true Church,
therefore it muſt bee every Mans wiſedome to take his beſt advantage
by the uſe of good means to profit by it.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> We ſee the little Bees though
they keepe their hives in a wet day, yet when a ſtorme comes, they will
get up ſo much the ſooner, and be the more painefull; in like manner if
we be hindred by foule weather or by ſickneſſe, when God offers us
occaſion, we ſhould be ſo much the more painefull and diligent, becauſe
the true meanes of holineſſe is in the Church. Here let us apply to our
ſelves.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> ſeeing then the Church of God is Holy, therefore it muſt bee
every mans care to be holy, for if there be any diſproportion or diſſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude
in any of the members, it makes a deformitie in the body, as if
one hand bee long, and another ſhort; one hand white, and another
blacke; one cheeke red and another pale; one eye cleare, and another
thicke:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſo when one member is holy, and another prophane; when
ſome make conſcience of their wayes, and other live in groſſe ſinnes,
this makes a deformed body; therefore it muſt be the care of every one
as the Church is holy, ſo to bee holy. Wee ſee the wilde beaſts that
were ſavage and cruell before they came into <hi>Noahs</hi> Arke,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> when they
were there, they laid aſide their ferocitie and wildneſſe, and became
tame and gentle: ſo though we were called beaſts before we came into
the Church of God, yet now when we be once in the ſame, we ſhould
leave all our wildneſſe and prophaneneſſe,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and labour to be holy. We
know what was <hi>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s</hi> ſpeech to <hi>Ainmon, ſuch a thing as this ought not
to be done in Iſrael:</hi> ſo when we are tempted to any ſinne or uncleanneſſe,
we ſhould ſay likewiſe, ſuch a thing as this ought not to be done in the
Communion of the Church, nor by any member thereof.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> ſeeing the Church is holy, wee muſt take heede that wee
doe not diſgrace or defile it that are the members of it, for the ſhame,
diſgrace and blot doth not reſt on our ſelves, but on the Church: as
in <hi>Iohn</hi> we ſee when the buyers and ſellers had polluted the Temple,
Chriſt makes a whip and whips them out; now if Chriſt was thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed
with them that defiled the materiall Temple, much more will
he be with thoſe that defile the ſpirituall Temple: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
reproves the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> in theſe words, <hi>It is reported
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:17958:294"/>
that there is fornication amongst you, ſuch as is not ſo much as named amongſt
the Heathen:</hi> whereupon ſaith <hi>Chryſostome,</hi> Marke, he doth not ſay, ſuch an
one and ſuch an one hath committed fornication, but it is reported com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly,
that you have done it, you that bee profeſſours and religious; and
therefore you have diſgraced the Church of God by your ſinnes and
brought a blot on it, you (I ſay) that bee the members of it, becauſe the
Church of God is holy and you bee unholy.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, ſeeing the Church of God is holy, wee muſt take heed, we doe
not meddle with it to annoy it, and to hurt it: It is the charge that God
gives, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105. 15. <hi>Touch not mine anointed and doe my Prophets no harme;</hi> ſo
<hi>Zech.</hi> 2. 8. God ſayes, <hi>hee that toucheth you, toucheth the apple of mine eye,</hi> and
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 9. ſaith <hi>S. Paul, For I am the leaſt of the Apostles, which am not meet to
bee called an Apoſtle, becauſe I perſecuted the Church of God:</hi> and <hi>Senacherib</hi>
though he overcame many countries and Kingdomes yet when hee came
to beſiege <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> the Angell of the Lord deſtroyed his Hoaſt, ſo that he
was compelled to goe home with ſhame; So <hi>Revel.</hi> 20. 9. when <hi>Gog</hi> and
<hi>Magog,</hi> went to compaſſe the Tents of the Saints and the beloved citie,
it is ſaid, <hi>fire came downe from Heaven and devoured them,</hi> therefore men
muſt take heed how they meddle with the Church to annoy or hurt it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Vſe 4.</note> ſeeing the Church of God is holy, it muſt bee our care to
keep it ſo, and to rid it of drunkards, whoremaſters and uncleane perſons:
ſo wee ſee, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 13. ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Put away from amongst you that
wicked man;</hi> it muſt bee the care of the Church, to rid out them that bee
evill:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> (<hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaith) if a man ſhould have a fountaine committed to
him to keep for a King, would hee let Hogges and beaſts deſcend into it,
with their feete to mud and puddle the water? ſo ſaith hee, thou that art a
miniſter, God hath committed a fountaine to thee to keep, not a fountaine
of water but a fountaine full of life and Spirit and the bloud of Chriſt,
therefore it muſt bee thy care to keepe the fountaine pure, and not to let
every beaſt come in to defile the ſame; ſeeing the Church of God is holy,
it muſt bee thy care to keepe it holy, and that no man doth defile the holy
things of God. Thus much for the firſt propertie.</p>
               <p>The ſecond propertie is,<note place="margin">2</note> that <hi>the Church of God is Catholike,</hi> that is, it is
generally diffuſed and ſpread all the world over:<note place="margin">Propertie of the Church.</note> This word <hi>Catholike</hi> is
not found in all the Bible, yet as long as the ſenſe is there we may retaine
and keepe it, ſeeing it is not againſt any point of our Chriſtian profeſſion.
As for the ſignification of it, the word is the ſame both in Latine and
Greeke, and ſignifieth <hi>generall:</hi> whence wee inferre, the Church of God
ſeemeth to take his name from our Lord <hi>Ieſus</hi> himſelfe, where hee ſaith
<hi>Act.</hi> 1. 8. <hi>And yee ſhall bee witneſſes unto mee both in Ieruſalem and in all Iudea,
and in Samaria and unto the uttermoſt part of the earth.</hi> Here the obſervation
may bee this; that if wee finde new words, as long as the ſenſe is not new,
nor the Doctrine, wee may receive them, but if both the words, and the
ſenſe and Doctrine bee new, that is, if it bee not found in the Scripture,
then they are to bee rejected and refuſed; therefore becauſe tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation
is a new word, and the Doctrine is new, the ſenſe not being to be
found in the Scripture we are to reject it; for before the <hi>Lateran</hi> Councell
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:17958:294"/>
there was no ſuch thing heard of, which brought in both the word and
Doctrine, and made that a point of faith which before was never dreamt
of. Now the Church is ſaid to bee Catholike in three regards:</p>
               <list>

tied to one certaine place, countrie or Kingdome, but God himſelfe hath
inlarged and ſpread it over all the world farre and neere: there was a time
when it did belong to the <hi>Iewes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1</note> and to thoſe that did joine with them, but
now. Chriſt hath broken downe the <hi>partition wall,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Of place.</note> and hath laid all the
world common; now hee hath enlarged the Church, and ſpread it all the
world over. This is that <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeakes of, <hi>Of a truth</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>I perceive
that God is no accepter of perſons, but in every nation hee that feareth him and
worketh righteouſneſſe is accepted of him:</hi> ſo Chriſt <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. ſaith, <hi>That many
ſhall come from the eaſt and from the weſt, and ſhall ſit down with Abraham,
Iſaak &amp; Iacob in the Kingdome of God:</hi> ſo <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 13, 14. <hi>but now in Chriſt Ieſus
yee which were once a farre off are made members, by the bloud of Chriſt; for he is
our peace which hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
between us:</hi> and it is ſaid <hi>Revel.</hi> 7. 9. <hi>And after theſe things I beheld, and
l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e a great multitude of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues ſtood
before the throne, and before the lambe, cloathed with long Robes, and palmes
in their hands.</hi> So then it is plaine by the Scriptures that the Church is
Catholike in regard of place, and is not abridged to no one countrey or
Kingdome, but is ſpread all the world over. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith well, We are
not to thinke it was enough for Chriſt to ſhed out his moſt precious
bloud, for one countrey or Kingdome, but it was to win the whole world
to himſelfe: and againe hee ſaith, By that which Chriſt gave for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
of man, they may perceive the great price and payment, which
was his death and bloudſhed, a thing of ſo great value or price, that it was
not for any one country or Kingdome, but for all: and therefore it is called
the Catholike Church.</p>
               <p>The uſe is firſt,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> ſeeing that the Church is Catholike or univerſall, and
conſiſts of all countries and Kingdomes, therefore we ſhould bee thankfull
to God, that hath reſerved us till this time, for wee might have beene born
when the light of the Goſpell ſhined onely amongſt the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and then
wee might have periſhed in unbeleefe; therefore thankes bee unto God in
that hee hath brought us forth in a time when the Goſpell is preached.
And ſeeing it hath pleaſed God to doe ſo, let us bee wiſe to lay hold on the
good meanes that is layd before us, come out of our ſinnes and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that ſo wee may bee ſaved from them: if fiſh in a pond ſhould bee
nigh poiſoned with ſtinking mud and water,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and one ſhould come and cut
a ſluce through into freſh water, what would they doe but goe out into
the freſh water? This is our caſe, wee are like to fiſh in a pond that bee
poiſoned in the mud and ſtinking water of our ſinnes and corruptions,
therefore ſeeing it hath pleaſed God to cut a ſluce and trench through,
and to open the boſome of the true Church to us, where the freſh water is,
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:17958:295"/>
(the waters of life and ſalvation) it muſt bee our wiſedome to come out of
our ſinnes and to lay hold of the good meanes that are ſet before us.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> ſeeing the Church of God is Catholike, wherein there is the
meanes of grace, therefore it muſt be our conſideration to apply our ſelves
to lay hold on it in our life time while wee live heere: It is <hi>S. Pauls</hi> exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 5. <hi>I beſeech you brethren that you receive not the graces of God
in vaine:</hi> It is a great mercie that God doth offer in the true Church,
where the meanes of grace are uſed, preaching, prayer, the uſe of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
therefore let us apply our ſelves to lay hold on it and to get good
by it. You your ſelves know that if earthly Paradiſe were to bee recovered,
and the Cherubins with the ſhaking ſword removed,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſo that wee might
goe in without any danger, would you lye down and ſleepe, would you
idle out the time? no; I dare bee bold to ſay that you would flye to the
trees, gather of the fruit and eate of them, eſpecially of the tree of life,
that you might live for ever. This is the grace that God doth offer to us,
(for <hi>the militant Church is the Paradiſe of God</hi> where there are trees of all
ſorts;) therefore what ſhould wee doe, not lye down in the duſt and idle
out the time, but apply our ſelves to eate of the fruit, eſpecially of the tree
of life, to feed on Chriſt by faith, to draw out all his graces that ſo wee may
live for ever.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> the Church of God is Catholike <hi>in regard of the perſons;</hi> for it
includeth all ſorts of perſons,<note place="margin">Of Perſons.</note> rich and poore, high and low, noble and
ignoble, wiſe and fooliſh, bond and free, and excludeth none. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
ſaith <hi>S. Paul, Gal.</hi> 3. 28. <hi>There is neither Iew nor Grecian, there is neither
bond nor free, there is neither male nor female, for ye are all one in Chriſt Ieſus:</hi>
and <hi>S. Peter Act.</hi> 10. ſaith, <hi>I ſaw a viſion of all ſorts of birds and beaſts, and there
came a voice too, that bad him kill &amp; eate;</hi> by which viſion he did underſtand
that God had then ſanctified all ſorts of men in the bloud of Chriſt; there
was a time when divers men were excluded from the Congregation of
the Lord, as <hi>Num.</hi> 22. the <hi>Ammonites</hi> &amp; the <hi>Moabites,</hi> becauſe they did not
meete the people of the Lord with bread and water; but now it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
God to take in all ſorts of men, ſo that no man is excluded unleſſe hee
will exclude himſelfe; as it is ſaid, <hi>Eſai.</hi> 65. 25. <hi>That the Wolfe and the Lambe
ſhall feed together, and the Lion ſhall eate ſtraw like the Bullock, and to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
duſt ſhall bee his meat;</hi> the ſenſe is, that in the time of the Goſpell the
Lord will alter the naughtineſſe of mens hearts and bring them to joine
in holy ſweet communion one with another, but if they would not attend
him, but deſire rather to live in their ſinnes ſtill, than they ſhould live in
Gods curſe, the Serpent ſhall eate duſt; hence wee are taught ſeeing God
doth exclude no man, wee muſt take heede wee doe not exclude our
ſelves. If a man comes to a Kings Court in meane apparell and have no
good attendance,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> he can have ſmall hope of acceſſe to the King: oh but let
him come to Gods court, though hee come never ſo meanely and baſely
apparelled, if hee bee well attended with faith and the graces of his Spirit,
then he ſhall have acceſſe into the preſence Chamber of Almightie God,
therefore ſeeing no man is excluded doe not thou exclude thy ſelfe: If a
gift, grant or pardon ſhould come from the King to certaine perſons that
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:17958:295"/>
would claime it; there is no man that would exclude himſelfe, and ſay it
doth not belong to mee: but every man would labour to have his part in
it: ſo the Lord hath given a gift and a grant to beſtow pardon of ſinnes,
the love and favour of God,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> heaven and happineſſe to all that will repent
and beleeve in Chriſt: Therefore no man muſt exclude himſelfe and ſay,
it doth not belong to mee, but labour to have his part in it. Thus the
Church is Catholike in regard of the perſons.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> the Church of God is Catholike <hi>in regard of time;</hi> for it hath
beene in all ages and ſo ſhall continue to the end of the world;<note place="margin">In Regard of Time.</note> it began in
<hi>Adams</hi> time, and ſhall continue to the laſt man that ſhall live, it hath bin
in all times and it ſhall continue ſo long as the world doth laſt. For this
world was made for the good of the Church, therefore God lets it ſtand for
their ſakes, and as ſoone as the people of God be gathered home then this
world ſhall have an end; as the Prophet <hi>David</hi> hath it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 48. <hi>O God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to thy Name, ſo is thy praiſe unto the worlds end:</hi> ſo alſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. <hi>thy ſeed
will I eſtabliſh for ever, and ſet up thy Throne from generation to generation;</hi> and
<hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 44. it is ſaid, <hi>And in the dayes of thoſe Kings ſhall the God of Heaven ſet
up a Kingdome that ſhall not be deſtroyed, a Kingdome that ſhall not bee given to
another, but that ſhall breake and destroy all thoſe Kingdomes, and it ſhall ſtand for
ever.</hi> Here wee may ſee the honour that God brings us to, to bee of that
Communion and fellowſhip that all the Saints are of, to bee of that
Church that <hi>Adam, Abel, Henoch, Noah, Abraham, Moſes,</hi> and all the
reſt of the <hi>Patriarchs, Prophets, Apostles,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe were of, and
all the holy men that have lived; as <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 11. ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
yee are no more ſtrangers nor forrenners, but citizens with the Saints, and
of the houſehold of God, and are builded upon the foundation of the Apoſtles and
Prophets, Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe being the chiefe corner ſtone,</hi> ſo <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 17. <hi>Saint
Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>for yee are not come to the mount that might bee touched, &amp;c. but yee
are come to the mount Sion and to the citie of the living God, the celestiall Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,
and to the company of innumerable Angels, and to the congregation of the
first borne whoſe names are written in Heaven and to God the Iudge of all men,
and to the Spirits of just and perfect men:</hi> So then wee ſee that this is the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
that God hath brought us to, to bee of the ſame Church and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
that the Prophets, Apoſtles, holy men, and Chriſt himſelfe were of.</p>
               <p>Therefore (to apply it) firſt,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> let us not loſe the graces of God, like a
ſlight huſwife that keepes the emptie caſke, and boxe, and loſeth the
Iewell; but let us labour to partake of the ſame graces with them,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſeeing
wee are of the ſame Church that they bee of.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> ſeeing the Church hath beene in all times paſt and ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
to the worlds end, therefore it may bee our comfort in all the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
that doe befall it, when wee ſee men conſpire againſt, and labour to
deſtroy it, yet notwithſtanding all that they can doe, it ſhall ſtand and
continue to the worlds end. It hath bin in all times and it ſhall continue
for ever; as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 48. 8. <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>As wee have heard, ſo have wee ſeene in the
citie of the Lord of Hoſts, in the citie of our God, God will eſtabliſh it for ever;</hi>
Therefore ſeeing hee hath eſtabliſhed the Church, it ſhall ſtand though
all the world were ſet againſt it. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith well, The enemies of the
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:17958:296"/>
Church though they come and gather themſelves together to deſtroy
and roote it out; yet this is the comfort, Chriſt will keepe it, hee hath
a ſword to defend it, he will tye up the devill and ſhut up hell, that they
ſhall not trouble the Church; therefore though wee doe not ſee the
Church viſbile, it not being patent and openly ſeene, but ſometime
hidden, as it was in the time of <hi>Elias</hi> from the fury of the world, yee we
muſt beleeve that the Church of God is Catholike or Univerſall, that
it hath beene in all times, and it ſhall continue to the worlds end.</p>
               <p>Now the Papiſts adde ſomewhat unto this Article,<note place="margin">Object.</note> and ſay, that wee
muſt beleeve in the Catholike Romiſh Church, but this is firſt abſurd <hi>in
Religion:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Anſ. 1.</note> and ſecondly, abſurd <hi>in Reaſon:</hi> it is abſurd <hi>in Religion,</hi> becauſe
the Romiſh Church muſt fall in the time of Antichriſt (as the Scripture
ſheweth) and as the Papiſts themſelves ſay; but the true Catholike
Church, that ſhall ever continue; therefore it is abſurd in religion to
beleeve in the Catholike Romiſh Church.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Anſ. 2.</note> it is abſurd <hi>in Reaſon;</hi> becauſe that <hi>Rome</hi> when it was at the
beſt, could but be a part of the Church, and a part cannot bee the whole
Church (as Scholars know) therefore it is abſurd <hi>in Reaſon.</hi> But they ſay
that the name of Catholike doth properly belong to them: to this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
as Chriſt did to ſome that lived in the Church;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> 
                  <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. 4. that
ſaid, <hi>they were Iewes,</hi> but ſaith Chriſt, <hi>they are the Synagogue of Sathan:</hi> ſo
I may ſay of them, though they terme themſelves to be true Catholikes,
yet they be but a conſpiracie againſt Chriſt. Now by three reaſons I
will prove that they cannot be true Catholikes.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Three Reaſons proving that Papiſts cannot be the true Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes.</note> becauſe alwayes the true Catholikes have taught that divine
worſhip is to be given to God onely and to no creature elſe, as Chriſt
ſaith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. to the devill, <hi>thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God and him
onely ſhalt thou ſerve;</hi> ſo likewiſe <hi>Revel.</hi> 22. <hi>Iohn</hi> fell downe to worſhip the
Angell,<note place="margin">1</note> but the Angell ſaid unto him, <hi>See that in no wiſe thou doſt it, for I
am thy fellow ſervant;</hi> and Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> ſaith, that we Chriſtians doe not
worſhip any creature, neither Angell nor Archangell, but God onely:
now becauſe they teach that we ſhould worſhip ſtockes and ſtones, and
the workes of mens hands, therefore they are no true Catholikes.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> becauſe true Catholikes teach that there is but one Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
between God and man, and that is Chriſt only; according to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
<hi>For there is but one God and one Mediator betweene God and man,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>the man
Chriſt Ieſus;</hi> ſo <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 15. ſaith he, <hi>Let us therefore by him offer the Sacrifice of
praiſe alwayes to God:</hi> ſo <hi>Origen</hi> alſo, we Chriſtians offer up all our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to God by the meanes of Chriſt: but the Papiſts teach that there
are a number of Mediators and that we may pray to the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi>
to <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> therefore they are no true Catholikes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> becauſe the true Catholike Church hath taught for ſixteene
hundred yeeres together, that men ſhould not equivocate, ſhould not
ſpeake one thing and thinke another, but ſhould ſpeake the truth from
their hearts: as <hi>Ephe.</hi> 4. 25. ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Wherefore caſt off lying, and
ſpeake the Truth every man to his neighbour:</hi> ſo <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 15. <hi>Hee that ſpeaketh
he truth in his heart, is one of them that ſhall inhabite Gods holy hill:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:17958:296"/>
we cannot ſay one thing and meane another, for the oath is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to him that taketh the oath, and not according to the minde of
him that ſweareth: but the Papiſts teach that a man may equivocate,
ſweare one thing and meane another, and therefore they are not true
Catholikes.</p>
               <p>Now the uſe of this is,<note place="margin">Vſe</note> ſeeing in this world is the true Catholike
Church and the meanes of Grace, let it be our wiſedome to lay hold on
the good meanes that is ſet before us, before wee remove hence. I
have ſhewed you heretofore if a man ſhould ſend his ſervant into the
Indies with a ſhip to fill with gold,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and there might have it, but fils it
with rubbiſh, ſtones and gravell; when this ſervant comes home, hee
may looke for a cold welcome home, ſo the Lord hath ſent us into this
world (as it were into the Indies with a ſhip,) with our ſoules and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and into the Church of God, there we may have gold to fill our
ſhippes with, that is, the graces of his Spirit, therefore if wee ſhall fill
our ſhippes with rubbiſh, gravell or dirt, that is, with ſinnes and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
we may looke for a cold welcome home, for in the Church of
God there are the ſprings and fountaines of grace, therefore why doe
wee not apply our selves to fill ſhippes with the pureſt gold; to get
faith, repentance, prayer and all the graces of the Spirit, that ſo we may
have comfort at our returne to God?</p>

               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Two Reaſons why God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds worldly things from his Children.</note>

               <p>Secondly, it is not unprofitable for a man to conſider what great bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings

bleſſings and benefits may provoke them to come home to God, and to
have communion with the people of God, that ſo they may have their
parts in theſe bleſſings and benefits; as <hi>Heſt.</hi> 3. 17. We may ſee that <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the land became Iewes, for the feare of the Iewes fell upon them.</hi> But what
is the feare of an earthly King to the feare of God? and what are the

God beſtowes on his people? therefore if ſuch a ſmall matter provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked

               <p>Now there be two ſorts of bleſſings given unto the Church,<note place="margin">2</note> ſome

to the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to bring them to the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and to
put them in poſſeſſion of it; but firſt they were a long while led in the
wilderneſſe: when <hi>Moſes</hi> ſent ſpies into the land, which did bring home
unto them of the fruite thereof,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> to taſte of it; as it is <hi>Numb.</hi> 12. 18. that
ſo they might have comfortable hope that one day they ſhould enjoy
it: even ſo it pleaſed God in the wilderneſſe of this world to give us a
taſte of Heaven and Glory, and of the Life, to come, that wee might
long after the full poſſeſſion of Heaven and happineſſe: therefore wee
may admire at the kindneſſe of God, who giveth us ſomewhat in hand
preſent, ſo that all our happineſſe is not laid up in hope; as <hi>Tertullian</hi>
ſaith, the Lord hath given us a pawne and pledge, that one day hee will
render the whole to us. Now of the bleſſings that God doth beſtow
on his People in this life;</p>
               <p>The firſt <hi>is the communion of Saints;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The firſt bleſſing God beſtowes on his people in this life, is the Communion of Saints.</note> for wee doe beleeve that there is
a bleſſed and holy Communion of Saints in this world, and that there
is no communion like it. There be divers communions in this world,
there is a communion of theeves, ſpoken of <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 14. <hi>Caſt in thy lot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
us, we will all have one purſe.</hi> So there is alſo <hi>a communion of darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi>
as <hi>Eſay,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Communions of the wicked.</note> 5. 12. ſay they, <hi>Come I will bring joy, and wee will fill our ſelves
with ſtrong drinke,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>and to morrow ſhall be as this day, and much more abundant:</hi>
ſo likewiſe there is <hi>a communion of the enemies of God:</hi> as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 1. <hi>Why
doe the Heathen rage and the People murmur in vaine,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>the kings of the Earth
band themſelves together,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>and the Princes of the Earth are aſſembled againſt the
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:17958:298"/>
Lord, and againſt his Chriſt:</hi> ſo wee ſee that there be divers communions
in this world, but fearefull and heavy ſhall the end of all theſe be; for as
they have had communion together in ſinne; ſo ſhall they have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
in paines and torments. So as you heard out of the Parable,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 13. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>The tares ſhall be bound together in bundles,</hi> that is,
all the wicked, ſuch as hinder the growth of the corne. <hi>Augustine</hi>
thus expounds that part of the Parable, where Chriſt ſaith, <hi>The tares
ſhall be bound together in bundles;</hi> that is, every kinde of ſinner ſhall bee
bound up together; the Adulterers together, the Theeves together,
the Drunkards together, and perjured perſons together; they ſhall be
bound together in bundles for the further increaſe of their torments:
for as many ſtrawes or ſtickes being bound together in a bundle,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſerve
to ſet one another on fire and to increaſe the flame; ſo the number of
the wicked being bound together ſhall increaſe one anothers torment
and griefe: ſo that it ſhall not be (as the World ſaith) <hi>the more the merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi>
but the more the greater torment; fearefull and heavie ſhall the end
of all ſuch Communions be: therefore let us labour to have Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with the Saints, in Faith, Repentance, the graces of the Spirit;
and then we ſhall have Communion with the Saints in glory. As <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.
Chriſt ſaith, that <hi>They ſhall come from the Eaſt and from the Weſt, and ſhall
ſit downe with Abraham and Iſaak and Iaakob in the Kingdome of God.</hi> So
<hi>Gen.</hi> 25. it is ſaid that <hi>Abraham when he died, was gathered to his people: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
was a holy and a faithfull man, and therefore when he died, hee
was gathered to his people, that is, to ſuch as he was, to holy and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
people: ſo likewiſe in the ſame Chapter, <hi>Iſmael</hi> when he died, was
gathered to his People, he was a bad man, and was gathered to ſuch as
himſelfe was; for looke of what communion a man is, to the ſame hee
ſhall be gathered: If thou art an adulterer thou ſhalt bee gathered to
ſuch; if a Theefe, to Theeves; if a Drunkard, to Drunkards; if a Swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,
to Swearers: for looke what communion thou art of, to the ſame
thou ſhalt be gathered: Therefore if thou wouldſt not then have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with ſuch as theeves bee, &amp;c. have no fellowſhip with them in
their ſinnes; but labour to have communion with the Saints in Faith
and Repentance, and in the graces of the Spirit in this life, and then thou
ſhalt be gather'd to ſuch, and enjoy with them glory in the life to come.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now</hi> the communion of Saints conſists in three things:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That we have Communion with God.</item>
                  <item>2. That we have Communion with Chriſt.</item>
                  <item>3. That we have Communion one with another.</item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1</note> we have Communion with God; <hi>whereas before we were ſtrangers
by nature,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Communion with God.</note> 
                  <hi>and had not to doe with God: nay, there was none that
could bring us into favor with him but by Chriſt: ſo S.</hi> Iohn <hi>ſaith in this
place, and it is ſaid,</hi> Eph. 2. 13. But now in Chriſt Ieſus ye which were once afarre
off, are made neere by the blood of Chriſt: <hi>ſo alſo</hi> Heb. 12. 23. <hi>ſaith the Apoſtle,</hi>
But now ye are come to Mount Sion, and to the Citie of the living God, the celesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Ieruſalem, and to the company of innumerable Angels, and to the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the firſt borne whoſe names are in Heaven, and to God the Iudge of all.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="583" facs="tcp:17958:298"/>
This communion is the comfortableſt communion that is in this
world, therefore above all things let us be thankefull to God for it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
other communions of this world, though the beſt, are not fit to
compare with this: for to have communion with kings, princes and
great men in the world, with Angels, Archangels and Saints, and not
to have communion with God, all this were nothing; becauſe <hi>In his
preſence is fulneſſe of joy,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> 
                  <hi>and at his right hand pleaſures for evermore.</hi> We ſee
holy <hi>Ruth</hi> was contented to forſake her Countrie and kindred, and to
live a poore life, to have communion and fellowſhip with the People
of God; ſo much more we ſhould be contented to leave our ſinnes and
corruptions, and to endure ſome hardſhip to have communion with
God; as <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 84. had rather be a meane man in the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Saints, than to live in great eſtate without it: the <hi>Queene of Sheba</hi>
pronounced them happy and bleſſed that did ſtand in the preſence of
<hi>Salomon,</hi> but how bleſſed and happy may they be pronounced that ſtand
in the preſence of God, and have communion with him; therefore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all things labour to have communion with God by his Spirit, and
doe not deprive thy ſelfe thereof by thy ſinnes, but nouriſh it in your
ſelves by all good meanes.</p>
               <p>Now this communion that we have with God ſtands in two things;<note place="margin">Our Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God ſtands in two things.</note>
firſt, <hi>He communicates to us his Wiſedome, Power, Iustice, Mercy, and Glory:</hi>
ſo that there is not a drop or dramme of goodneſſe in God, but it is for
the good of his ſervants and people; as his <hi>Power</hi> to defend them; his
<hi>Wiſedome</hi> to direct them;<note place="margin">1</note> his <hi>Mercie</hi> to ſave them; and his <hi>Glory</hi> to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
to them: ſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23. <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Lord is my Shepheard, I ſhall
not want;</hi> and elſewhere, <hi>The Lord is my light and my ſalvation, the Lord is
the ſtrength of my ſalvation,</hi> whom ſhall I feare, the Lord is the ſtrength
of my life, of whom ſhall I be afraid? ſo <hi>Hannah</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. <hi>Hee hath
raiſed up the poore out of the duſt, and lifted up the begger out of the Dunghill, to
ſet them among Princes, and to make them inherit the ſeate of glory: for the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
of the earth are the Lords, and he hath ſet the World on them:</hi> ſo then the
People of God have Communion with him, in that hee communicates
all good things to them.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing wherein our communion with God ſtands is,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>that
we may communicate all our griefes, ſorrowes, troubles, wants and neceſsities un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, and lay them downe in his lappe:</hi> therefore in all our wants, ſorrowes
and griefes, let us goe to God and he will eaſe and releeve us: as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. 4. <hi>I ſought the Lord and he heard me, yea, he delivered mee
out of all my feare:</hi> ſo we are exhorted 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 7. <hi>Caſt all your care on him,
for hee careth for you.</hi> And therefore doſt thou want food to feed thy
body, or clothes? ſeeke to God, he will releeve thee: doſt thou finde
troubles,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> art grieved? goe to God, he will eaſe thee: when a man hath
any griefe or trouble in his minde, it is an eaſe to him if he have a truſtie
friend to breake his minde to; and many times there is ſomewhat that
troubles a man that he dares not tell his friend, leſt hee ſhould upbraid
him with it, or caſt it in his teeth: and againe, a man may make his mind
knowne to his friend, who cannot eaſe him nor ſupply his wants; but
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:17958:299"/>
if we communicate our griefes to God, hee will not caſt us in the teeth
with them, but will eaſe us, and ſupply all our wants, and he is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
able, but willing alſo to helpe us in what thing ſoever wee ſtand in
need of; therefore it is a bleſſed thing to have communion with God,
in that a man may communicate all his griefes, ſorrowes and wants to
him. Wee ſee that <hi>Adam</hi> had communion with God, but when hee
had ſinned againſt him he loſt it, and hid himſelfe from God: therefore
when we have communion with God, let us take heed that we doe not
ſinne againſt him, and loſe our Communion with him; but if wee bee
overtaken, let us labour to repent, and ſo recover our ſelves againe:
this is the firſt part of our Communion.</p>
               <p>The ſecond part of our Communion <hi>is with Chriſt;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2</note> and indeed wee
can have no communion with God,<note place="margin">Communion with Chriſt.</note> but it muſt be by meanes of Chriſt;
for we are all ſinners and great offenders, ſo that wee are become ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to God, and there is no way to reconcile us, but by a Mediator;
that is, by <hi>Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Philoſophers ſay, that <hi>things that be in extremes can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be brought together but by ſome middle matter;</hi> ſo God and ſinnefull Man
are two extremes, whom none but Chriſt could bring together. <hi>Iaakob</hi>
ſaw in a viſion a Ladder that reacht from Earth to Heaven; this Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
(Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> tells us) that brought Heaven and Earth together,<note place="margin">Ioh. 1. vlt.</note> is
Chriſt; ſo all our communion with God is by meanes of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now in our communion with Chriſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chriſt communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates foure things to us.</note> there are ſome things that Chriſt
communicat's to us, and there are ſome things that we communicate to him. Foure
things Chriſt communicates to us:</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>Himſelfe;</hi> not his Spirit and his graces onely, but Himſelfe alſo:
therefore ſeeing that Chriſt giveth Himſelfe,<note place="margin">Himſelfe.</note> let us be ready to receive
him, for this is the greateſt bleſſing that can bee given us: as <hi>Eſay,</hi> 9. 6.
<hi>For unto us a Childe is borne,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Queſt.</note> 
                  <hi>and unto us a Sonne is given:</hi> But ſome man
may aske by what meanes is Chriſt given? I anſwere, by our willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in receiving him offered in the preaching of the Word,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> and in the
uſe of the Sacraments. Even as a father that meanes to give his childe
houſe and land,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> the father is willing to give it, and the childe to receive
it; in both there is a mutuall agreement: ſo God for his part is willing
to give us Chriſt, if we be willing to receive him; and by this mutuall
agreement, Chriſt becomes ours; and then we may ſay, I thanke God
Chriſt is mine, even as ſure as the meat I eat, or the Coate I put on my
backe, or any lands or livings my father hath left me.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>the right of his death and merit;</hi> ſo that whatſoever is due to
Chriſt in regard of the right of his death and merit wee may claime at
Gods hand:<note place="margin">The right of his death and merit</note> the favour of God, the pardon of our ſins, and the glory of
Heaven is due to us in regard of the merit of his death, as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>By
his ſtripes we are healed:</hi> ſo a Chriſtian may be bold to ſay, Chriſt is mine,
and his death mine, his life is mine, and his croſſe mine, and his paines
mine to my eternall comfort: therfore in the troubles of conſcience, and
accuſations of the Divell, we may goe to God and tender before him
the death and merits of Chriſt: if we ſhould tender our owne righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,
this would ſhame and diſgrace us: If a man ſhould be impriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:17958:299"/>
for a debt, which was payed by a ſuretie, if he could finde the ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
he would bring him to the Iudge, and ſay, here is the Man that did
diſcharge my debt;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> here are the empty bagges that the money came
out of that paid my creditor; ſurely any Iudge would acquit that Man:
ſo when the Devill ſhall implead us for our ſinnes, we may goe to God
and ſhew him Chriſt, and we may quiet and ſtay our ſelves here, ſaying,
This is he that hath paid my debt, here is the emptie purſe, here are the
empty veines that the blood came out of, and then without all doubt
God will acquit us: Therefore we muſt tender the merits of Chriſt to
God, ſpread them before him, and ſtand to them. To this purpoſe ſaith
<hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> Chriſt hath taken away the hand-writing which was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
us, and hath given us another bill, bond, or new writing, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we may claime Chriſt:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> He hath not done by us as the unjuſt <hi>Steward</hi>
did by abatement, but hee having quite wiped out all, hath given us a
new bill, and hath made God a debtor to us.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>the power of our ſpirituall life;</hi> We indeed are able by nature to
move and ſtirre,<note place="margin">Power of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall life.</note> and to do the duties of our calling, to buy and ſell, &amp;c.
but are not able to ſtir a foote to Heaven to looke after that, nor move
towards it, till Chriſt communicates a ſpirituall life unto us. So 1 <hi>Iohn</hi>
5. 12. ſaith he, <hi>He that hath the Sonne hath life, and he that hath not the Sonne
hath not life;</hi> as 2 <hi>King.</hi> 12. 21. the dead Souldier was not able to move
or ſtir, till being laid in the Sepulchre of <hi>Eliſha,</hi> he touched his loynes,
and then he revived and ſtood upon his feete: ſo we are dead by nature,
and not able to move or ſtirre a foote in the wayes of God, till we touch
the Body of Chriſt by Faith, then we revive and ſtand up, life comes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us againe.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4</note> 
                  <hi>the dignitie of his owne estate,</hi> for by nature Chriſt is the Son
of God,<note place="margin">The dignitie of his owne estate.</note> and he makes us the Sonnes and Daughters of God by Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Grace, and drawes us into the ſame dignitie and honour with
him to be called the Sonnes of God. But it is a harder matter for us to
be made the Sonnes of God, than for Chriſt to bee made the Sonne of
Man.</p>
               <p>Now as Chriſt communicates ſomething to us;<note place="margin">2</note> ſo wee ſomething
to him:<note place="margin">Wee communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to Chriſt three things.</note> 
                  <hi>We communicate to him three things:</hi> firſt, <hi>our Nature;</hi> ſecondly,
<hi>our ſinnes;</hi> thirdly, <hi>our troubles and afflictions.</hi> Here wee ſee what an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
wee make with Chriſt; Hee communicates to us himſelfe, the
right of his death, merit and ſpirituall life, and the dignitie of his owne
State; and we communicate to him our nature, our ſinnes, and troubles.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> wee communicate to him <hi>our Nature,</hi> and that not in the beſt
eſtate,<note place="margin">Our Nature.</note> when it was in integrity, but ſince it was diſgraced, and ſubject
to ſickneſſes, diſeaſes and troubles; this is the change wee make with
Chriſt: like <hi>Hiram</hi> and <hi>Salomon; Hiram</hi> gave to <hi>Salomon</hi> gold and ſilver,
and Firre trees, and what the heart of the King could deſire; and <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
gave to him a few dirty Cities.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> In like manner Chriſt giveth to us
what our heart can deſire, his owne ſelfe, the right of his death, merit
and ſpirituall life, the dignitie of his owne eſtate, and we give him a few
dirty cloathes, our bad nature diſgraced with ſinne, ſubject to troubles
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:17958:300"/>
and afflictions: If wee would have communicated any thing, it ſhould
have beene of the beſt, becauſe <hi>He is God bleſſed for ever, Amen;</hi> it ſhould
have beene when our nature had beene in the beſt eſtate: but we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
to him our ſinnes and troubles; therefore wee ſhould admire
Chriſts love and goodneſſe to us, that will accept of this exchange.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> we have communicated a worſe thing than this, <hi>our ſins:</hi> as
1 <hi>Pet. 2. 14.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Our ſinnes.</note> 
                  <hi>who his own ſelfe bare our ſins in his body on the tree, &amp;c.</hi> all the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
ſhall carry their owne ſins on their backe to Hell with them, but the
ſinnes of the godly, are laid on the backe of Chriſt, he bare them; the
cruell Souldiers laid the Croſſe on Chriſt, and made him to beare it,
but we laid a greater burthen than that on him, the burthen of our ſins;
for the weight of the croſſe is nothing to the weight of our ſinnes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> we communicate to Chriſt <hi>our troubles and dangers;</hi> as <hi>Eſay,</hi>
63. 9.<note place="margin">Our troubles and dangers.</note> 
                  <hi>In all their troubles he was troubled:</hi> and <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 24. <hi>Now I rejoyce in my
ſufferings for you, and fulfill the reſt of the ſufferings of Chriſt in my fleſh for his
bodies ſake:</hi> ſo Chriſt ſuffereth ſtill in his members by compaſſion and
fellow feeling. And theſe be the goodly things that we communicate
to Chriſt, nothing but our nature and ſins, our troubles and dangers; as
I told you a little before out of 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 9. 11.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> there was an exchange be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
king <hi>Salomon</hi> and <hi>Hiram,</hi> he gave <hi>Salomon</hi> gold, ſilver, Firre trees
and Cedar trees, and all that the heart of the king could wiſh; and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>
gave <hi>Hiram</hi> twentie dirty cities in the land of <hi>Galile:</hi> but it is a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
exchange that Chriſt makes with us, for he giveth all that the heart
of a Chriſtian can wiſh; his wiſedome, righteouſneſſe, himſelfe, his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
and death, a ſpirituall life and the ſame dignitie and honour with
him; but we againe repay him with our nature ſins and dangers: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hence let us learn to admire this great kindneſſe and love of Chriſt
to us that will be content therewith.</p>
               <p>Now as the Saints have communion with God and with Chriſt,<note place="margin">The Saints com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion one with another.</note> ſo
have they communion with one another by meanes of love: as <hi>Exod.</hi>
25.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> We ſee the golden <hi>Cherubim</hi> did ſo looke towards the <hi>Arke,</hi> and
<hi>the Mercy ſeat,</hi> as that they looked one towards another: So wee muſt
looke to God, and to Chriſt by the eye of faith, as we muſt have one eye
alſo to one another by love. This ſocietie is comfortable, for <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 18.
God ſaith, <hi>It is not good that man ſhould be alone:</hi> therefore if it were a good
thing for man to have communion and ſocietie in the life of nature,
much better is it in the life of grace. We ſee in a houſe, the poſts that
are compact together are a great ſtay againſt the winde and weather;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſo
the Communion and ſocietie of the Saints one with another, is a great
ſtay and ſtrength againſt the temptations of the Divell. It is a good
ſaying that <hi>Chryſostome</hi> hath; Naturally a Man hath but one head to
adviſe him, one tongue to ſpeake for him, two eyes to foreſee dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
two hands to worke with, and two feete to goe with: now (ſaith
he) if a man had this skill and cunning that hee could make that head a
thouſand heads to adviſe him, that tongue a thouſand tongues to ſpeak
for him, his eyes a thouſand eyes to foreſee dangers, his hands a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
hands to helpe him, and his feete a thouſand feete to goe for him,
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:17958:300"/>
hee would hardly be circumvented by any policies: Therefore, it is a
good thing to labour to have communion with the Saints, and to bee
gathered into it. Now the Communion of Saints one with another
ſtands in three things:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Of the living with the living.</item>
                  <item>2. Of the living with the dead.</item>
                  <item>3. Of the Dead with the Dead.</item>

               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">The communion of Saints with the living ſtands in five things.</note> 
                  <hi>the communion of the living with the living;</hi> which ſtands in five
things: firſt, <hi>in communion of affection,</hi> for they love and deſire the good
one of another, and wiſh well one to another, they rejoyce for the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
and grieve for the troubles and dangers that befall one another:<note place="margin">1</note>
they wiſh wel to thoſe that be a thouſand miles off them,<note place="margin">Communion of affection.</note> and love them
they never ſaw. To this purpoſe <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 3. <hi>All my delight
it with the Saints that be on the earth;</hi> ſo <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2. 1. ſaith Saint <hi>Paul, For I
would ye knew what great fighting I have for your ſakes, and for them of La<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicea,
and for as many as have not ſeene my perſon in the fleſh?</hi> We ſee in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that if one member ſuffers, all the reſt ſuffer; ſo ſaith Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 26. Therefore if the Communion of nature worke ſuch affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
in one member towards another, much more there ſhould be the
ſame affection amongſt the members of Chriſt in the Communion of
grace: <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1. 24. it is ſaid, <hi>when the beaſts went, the wheeles went; and
when the beaſts were lifted up,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> 
                  <hi>the wheeles were lifted up;</hi> the reaſon whereof
is there given, becauſe the ſpirit of the beaſt was in the wheeles: ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the ſame ſpirit that is in one Chriſtian; is in another, therefore
there is the like affections to procure the good of one another as much
as may be. Now I doe not ſay they be all of one judgement, for there
is diverſitie of judgements; but they be of like affection and good will
one towards another, there is difference of judgement: as <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 5.
<hi>This man esteemes one day above another, and another man accounts every day
alike:</hi> ſo verſe 2. <hi>One beleeveth that hee may eate of all things, and another
which is weeke eateth hearbs:</hi> ſo wee may ſee that there is difference in
judgement amongſt them; but this I may be bold to ſay, though there
be difference in judgement, yet there is unitie of affection: ſo that they
deſire the good, and wiſh well one to another. It is <hi>Pauls</hi> rule, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.
5. <hi>Let every man be fully perſwaded in his owne minde;</hi> and elſe where hee
ſaith, <hi>Let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded, and if any be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
minded, God ſhall reveale the ſame things unto him. Aquinas</hi> ſaith that
<hi>the effect of charitie is not concord in judgement, but in mens wils and affections,
that wiſh well one to another;</hi> as divers Phyſitians be ſent for to a ſicke per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
ſome of them thinke that the beſt way to cure the party,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> is to take
away all the corrupt blood at once; others thinke that it is better not
to take it away all at one time, but by a little and little: now here is
difference in judgement, but yet unitie in will and affection, in that all
of them intend the good of the ſicke party: ſo it is in the ſins and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
of the Church; ſome thinke that it is beſt to take away all the
ſinnes and corruptions of the Church at one time, but the ſober minded
thinke that it is beſt taken away by little and little: here is a difference
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:17958:301"/>
of judgement, but unitie of will and affection all intend the good of the
Church: Therefore when men for every little matter and diverſitie of
judgement ſhall part brotherly love, wee may ſuſpect that they doe not
belong to the Communion of Saints.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>in communicating of their gifts and graces one to another:</hi> as
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 10.<note place="margin">Communitie of Graces.</note> 
                  <hi>Let every man as hee hath received the gift, miniſter the ſame one to
another, as good diſpoſers of the manifold grace of God;</hi> ſo then ſuch are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted
as bee the people of God to bee ready to communicate good
things one to another: ſo <hi>Matth.</hi> 2. when Chriſt was riſen and had appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to <hi>Mary,</hi> ſhee could not hold, but ſhee telleth it to the Diſciples; ſo alſo
<hi>Iohn</hi> 20. when the Diſciples had ſeene Chriſt, they could not hold, but as
ſoone as they ſaw <hi>Thomas,</hi> ſay they, Oh, <hi>Wee have ſeene the Lord:</hi> in like
manner when wee have any good thing made knowne to us, wee ſhould
not hold it to our ſelves,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> but make it knowne to our friends and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
Wee ſee in nature, if a Bird find but a worme, ſhee will carry it to
her young ones and make them partakers of it; ſo when wee have got any
good thing wee ſhould carry it home to our wife and children, and make
them partakers of it; as <hi>Luk.</hi> 5. the Diſciples were partakers in fiſhing, and
there was a compact and league between them, that what one did get in
fiſhing it ſhould tend to the common good of that whole ſocietie,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſo
whatſoever wee get out of the preaching of the word, it ſhould goe to the
common good of thoſe that wee are over: a man ſhould not keepe it to
himſelfe, but impart it to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon good of his friends &amp; acquaintance,
or wife and children;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> as in the law the ſhelled fiſhes were uncleane, becauſe
though the meat was good yet a man had much adoe to come by it; ſo
when men have good things and are not ready to impart and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
to one another they bee ſo far uncleane men.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>in ſpirituall Sacrifices;</hi> the Saints bee free men, and yet they bee
every bodies ſervants as far as their ability ſerveth;<note place="margin">In ſpirituall Sacrifices.</note> as <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 5. 13. ſaith hee,
<hi>by love ſerve one another.</hi> Wee have heard out of <hi>Exodus</hi> that if one houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
were too little for the eating of the <hi>Paſchall Lambe</hi> they ſhould joine
with another houſe;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſo if wee bee not fit for Prayer and conference and
other holy duties, wee ſhould deſire the helpe of our brethren that have
better graces than our ſelves. Now theſe ſpirituall Sacrifices that wee owe
to the Saints, ſtand in foure things:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. In Exhortation.</item>
                  <item>2. In Admonition and good Counſell.</item>
                  <item>3. In Conſolation.</item>
                  <item>4. In Mutuall Prayer.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>In exhortation:</hi> for the People of God muſt exhort one another to
feare God,<note place="margin">Exhortation.</note> and to make conſcience of every holy dutie commanded; as
<hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 13. ſaith <hi>S. Paul, Exhort one another dayly whileſt it is called to day, &amp;c.</hi>
ſo <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 24. <hi>Let us exhort one another to provoke one another to love and
good works.</hi> So it is not enough for a man to bring himſelfe on in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
but he muſt ſtirre up the care of other; as <hi>Zech.</hi> 4. 2. the Prophet ſaw
<hi>a viſion of a golden Candleſtick with a boule on the top of it, and ſeven Lampes
thereon, with ſeven Pipes to the Lampes, which were on the top thereof, and two
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:17958:301"/>
O live trees right over it to drop down fatneſſe to nouriſh the lights with;</hi> ſo every
Chriſtian is a ſhining Lampe, and wee muſt bee as Olive trees to drop
down fatneſſe or oyle into the heart of our brother,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> to nouriſh the light of
God that is in him, therefore it is woefull thing, to ſee that men doe neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
this dutie, that they doe not exhort one another and yet meet many
times in the weeke and on the Sabboth day, and paſſe away the time with
a deale of idle talke and let this dutie ſlip; ſo that they cannot ſay as the
Diſciples ſaid, did not our hearts burne when wee talked with ſuch a
man?</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>Admonition and good counſell when they bee fallen,</hi> ſo to recover
and reſtore them againe,<note place="margin">Admonition.</note> as <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. (ſaith S. <hi>Paul) Brethren, if any man bee
fallen by any occaſion into any fault, yee which are ſpirituall reſtore ſuch a one with
the Spirit of meekneſſe, conſidering thy ſelfe, leſt thou alſo bee tempted;</hi> The word
in the originall is a metaphor taken from a Surgeon,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> that is to ſet a joint,
who uſeth it with great tenderneſſe to bring it to his right place; ſo wee
muſt doe when wee ſee our brethren fallen into any fault, uſe them gently
to reſtore them againe, and wee muſt labour to recover them with the
Spirit of meekneſſe conſidering leſt wee alſo bee tempted. It is not the
manner of the world to doe ſo, but they make table-talke of it, and ſpeak
to the diſgrace of others; but wee must conſider that wee our ſelves may
bee overtaken, and therefore as wee would have others to deale in meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and love with us (when we are fallen) ſo we muſt doe to our brethren.
We ſee in a ſhipwrack that thoſe that eſcape and get to the ſhore firſt,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> get
up to the top of a high tower, mountaine or rocke, and hang out lights
and Lanthornes, that ſo they may direct the reſt of their company to the
ſame harbour: So wee muſt doe when we have ſuffered ſhipwrack in our
conſciences and are recovered againe, wee muſt hang out as it were lights
and lanthornes, adviſe and admoniſh others and give them good counſell,
that ſo wee may bring them to the ſame harbour, that wee are arrived at.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>wee owe to our brethren Chriſtian conſolation and mutuall comfort,</hi>
becauſe that ordinarily the croſſe doth follow them and accompany the
people of God,<note place="margin">Conſolation.</note> for if a man be a ſincere Profeſſour of the Goſpell through
the malice of the Devill and the furie of the world, alwayes the croſſe doth
accompany him, and therefore the brethren had need to comfort them, as
1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 18. ſaith <hi>S. Paul, Wherefore comfort your ſelves with theſe words:</hi> and
<hi>Prov.</hi> 31. 6. it is ſaid, <hi>Give yee ſtrong drinke unto him that is ready to periſh, and
wine unto him that hath griefe of heart:</hi> As in a ſick family where they are
given to fainting they have bottles of <hi>Aquavitae</hi> and <hi>Roſaſolis</hi> to refreſh and
comfort them;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſo the Church of God is a ſick family, and therefore muſt
have bottles of <hi>Aquavitae</hi> and <hi>Roſaſolis</hi> to comfort and to cheare them; that
is, wee muſt have comfortable words to cheare and refreſh them: but wee
ſee <hi>Iob</hi> 6. 14. Hee complaines of this (ſaith hee,) <hi>Hee that is in miſerie ought
to bee comforted of his neighbours, but men have forſaken the feare of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie:</hi>
ſo <hi>David</hi> complaines, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69. 20. <hi>Reproch hath broken my heart and
I am full of heavineſſe, and I looked for ſome to have pitie on mee, but there was
none, and to comfort mee, but I found none.</hi> Therefore wee muſt take heede
that this bee not laid againſt us at the day of judgement.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="590" facs="tcp:17958:302"/>
Fourthly, <hi>Mutuall Prayer,</hi> to pray for one another, as <hi>Iames</hi> 5. 16. it is
ſaid,<note place="margin">4</note> 
                  <hi>Pray one for another;</hi> ſo that the Prayers of the Saints are for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
good of the whole bodie of them:<note place="margin">Mutuall Prayer.</note> this is a great comfort to be one
of the people of God, in the time of danger and temptation; for one
cannot bee the leaſt member of the Communion of Saints, but he ſhall
have his part and portion in all the Prayers of the Saints. Wee ſee in
one <hi>Countrie</hi> there are divers ſhippes goe to the Sea, ſome traffique in
one thing and ſome in another, ſome for gold and ſilver, ſome for other
commodities, but all ſuch as they bring home is for the common good
of the whole countrie: So the Prayers of the Saints are like unto a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of ſhips that goe to Sea, ſome of whom make requeſt for this thing,
and ſome for that; but whatſoever they bring home, all tends to the
common good of all the bodie.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Fourthly, the Saints Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication in Riches.</note> the Communion of the Saints conſiſts <hi>in Communicating
of Riches and goods to one another: Gal.</hi> 6. 10. it is ſaid, <hi>while you have time doe
good to all, eſpecially to the houſhold of faith:</hi> ſo <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13. 16. <hi>To doe good and
distribute forget not, for with ſuch ſacrifices God is well pleaſed:</hi> ſo alſo 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.
7. <hi>Therefore as you abound in every thing in faith, and utterance, &amp; knowledge,
and in all diligence, and in your love towards us, ſee that yee abound in this grace
alſo.</hi> There is no one dutie that men come more ſhort in than in this,
men are contented to pray, and adviſe others, but this they ſticke at,
they cannot bee contented to communicate of their goods to them; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can they abide to part with any of their Riches, this they ſtick at:
But <hi>Matth.</hi> 2. 11. wee ſee the wiſe men came to worſhip Chriſt, <hi>and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to him gifts, gold, frankincenſe and myrrhe:</hi> They did not onely
worſhip him, but did alſo impart to him of their treasure and goods.
It is the manner of the world that they can bee contented to worſhip
Chriſt, but they will not let any thing come from them to refreſh the
Saints; they will not part with any of their goods to them. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>
ſaith well, It is not meet that in a Chriſtian commonwealth, one ſhould
ſurfet and another ſtarve, that one ſhould live in plentie and another in
want; for wee have all one maſter and are redeemed with one bloud, we
came into the world all after one ſort, and ſhall all inherite one King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of glorie; therefore wee ſhould not thinke it much to make our
brethren partakers of our Riches and goods: and againe, (ſpeaking out
of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68. ſaith hee,) men lay up for their Children, and their children
keepe it for their Children; but what haſt thou laid up for Chriſt? if
thou wilt not give him thy whole eſtate yet let him have a Childs por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<hi>Matth.</hi> 21.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> wee ſee when Chriſt came riding to <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> on an
Aſſe, ſome ſtrewed garments in the way, ſome cut down boughs and
branches; ſo doe thou if thou bee not able to ſtrew thy garments in the
way, that is, to take the poore members of Chriſt and feed them, yet cut
down branches at leaſt; that is, ſpeake comfortable words to them and
pray for them; and then at the laſt day how comfortable will it bee to
thee that Chriſt ſhall ſay in the ſight of men and Angels; Here is the
man that hath fed mee, cloathed mee, &amp;c. Therefore wee ſhould love
this part of the Communion of the Saints.</p>

Chriſtian faith (though the words bee few,) there
may (if it be well handled) runne out a great deale
of good matter. We ſhewed the laſt day that as the

the living:</hi> Secondly, <hi>Of the living with the dead:</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Of the dead with
the dead:</hi> Now the Communion of the living with the living conſiſts in
five things, which I will not now repeat, but goe on where wee left;
which was to excite and ſtirre men up to the putting in practice of the
dutie of Communicating to our brethren in things of our temporall
eſtate: and to that end I will now inſist on theſe three things follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That there ought to bee ſuch a Communion of our goods and riches.</item>

               </list>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> there is ſuch a dutie to bee performed; <hi>as</hi> Deut.<note place="margin">1</note> 15. 11. <hi>the Lord ſaith,</hi>
becauſe there ſhall bee ever ſome poore in the land,<note place="margin">That there ought to bee a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in goods.</note> therefore I command thee,
ſaying, Thou ſhalt open thy hand wide to thy brother, to the needy and to the poore
<hi>of the land; ſo</hi> Eccl. 11. 1. <hi>ſaith hee,</hi> Caſt thy bread upon the waters, for after
many dayes thou ſhalt finde it: Give a portion to ſeven, and alſo to eight, for thou
knoweſt not what evill ſhall bee upon the earth: If the clouds bee full they will
powre forth Raine, &amp;c. <hi>ſo</hi> Gal. 6. 11. while wee have time, doe good unto all
men,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> eſpecially to the houſhold of faith. <hi>We ſee in Nature that the hand re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
not meat into it ſelfe, but puts it to the mouth, the mouth to the

                  <note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>now if there bee any ſuch Communion in the parts of nature,
much more ſhould it bee in the myſticall body of Chriſt.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The bounds and Limits of this Communion of goods.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>what the True bounds and Limits are?</hi> herein wee will ſhew
you firſt:</p>
               <list>
                  <pb n="592" facs="tcp:17958:303"/>
                  <item>1. The Exceſſe.</item>
                  <item>2. The Defect thereof.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The <hi>Exceſſe</hi> is, to give too much; the <hi>Defect</hi> is, to give too little, ſo
both bee faultie; the <hi>Exceſſe</hi> is, rare, and few there bee that offend that
way.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Exceſſe</hi> is;<note place="margin">1</note> when men give away all, and leave nothing to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to maintaine wife and children with,<note place="margin">The Exceſſe of giving.</note> according as the <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tistes</hi>
teach, who ground themſelves on <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 32. where it is ſaid, <hi>And
the multitude of them that beleeved were of one heart and of one ſoule, neither any
of them ſaid, that any thing that hee poſſeſſed was his own, but they had all things
common.</hi> To whom I anſwer firſt, that the Communion that is here
ſpoken of, is a communion of love onely, as <hi>Phil.</hi> 16. all things were
common by love; and yet, <hi>Paul</hi> would not diſpoſe of his ſervant without
his leave; ſo <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 4. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith to <hi>Ananias, Whileſt it remained in your
hands appertained it not to thee, and after it was ſold was it not in thine owne
power?</hi> So this was a Communion of love. Secondly, the Church of
God at that time was in extremity and in one place, ſo that there is not
the ſame meaſure to bee uſed in the time of the peace and inlargement
of the Church, as is in the time of want and extremitie: Therefore when
the Church was in extremitie and want they did well to ſell their por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and to impart them to the common good of all; but in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement
of the Church, <hi>Paul</hi> ſheweth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 1. <hi>Every first-day of the
weeke, let every one of you lay by him in ſtore as God hath proſpered him, &amp;c.</hi>
And the Diſciples did not contribute all their goods to the Saints;
therefore in the Communion of Riches and goods, there may bee an
<hi>Exceſſe.</hi> The Papiſts teach alſo the ſame, that wee ought to give all
to the poore and to leave our ſelves nothing, and ſay, this is an eſtate
of perfection: But I demand of them, if a thorne ſhould bee a fruit tree,
that ſhould bee common whereby the poore might bee releeved by it,
whether were it better to cut downe the tree and impart it all,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> or to let
it ſtand to let them have the fruit of it to releeve them from time to
time? I doe not doubt but every man that hath diſcretion will ſay it is
better that the tree ſhould ſtand ſtll and the poore bee releeved by
little and little, than to cut it downe and give away all at once; ſo it is
better for a man to retaine his wealth and to releeve his poore brethren
by little and little continually, than to give away all at one time &amp; none
at another: ſo <hi>Aquinas</hi> ſaith, It is not the part of a liberall man to give all
away from himſelfe at once to releeive the poore, but to retaine the
greateſt part to himſelfe, to play the good husband with it, that he may
bee giving continually.<note place="margin">Object.</note> But the Papiſts <hi>Object,</hi> and ſay, that Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the Rich man to goe ſell all that hee had, and to give to the
poore.<note place="margin">Anſ.</note> To this I anſwer, that that commandement or precept was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall
to that man onely in a ſpeciall ſervice: as <hi>Iohn</hi> 15. Chriſt told
<hi>Peter</hi> that <hi>unleſſe hee did waſh him, hee could have no part in him;</hi> why was it
ſuch a great matter to have Chriſt to waſh one. I anſwer, it was a great
matter if hee ſhould have deſpiſed or contemned it, hee might have juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
periſhed,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> becauſe it was a perſonall precept to him onely; ſo becauſe
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:17958:303"/>
this precept to the rich man was a perſonall precept, it was his ſinne that
hee did it not.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Another kinde of Exceſſe.</note> 
                  <hi>It is an exceſſe to give above a mans ability,</hi> ſo <hi>Act.</hi> 11. 18. where
there was a famine throughout the world foretold by <hi>Agabus;</hi> which
came to paſſe in <hi>Claudius Caeſars</hi> dayes, then <hi>the Diſciples every man accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his abilitie purpoſed to ſend ſuccor to the brethren that dwelt in Iudea:</hi> So
there muſt bee a rule, and bounds uſed that wee ſhould not give above
our abilitie: as I ſaid even now out of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. where the Apoſtle
ſaith, <hi>ſo doe yee alſo every first day of the weeke, let every one put aſide by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
and lay up as God ſhall proſper him;</hi> therefore when men bee ſo ready
to helpe others, as that they undoe themſelves, this is not the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of Saints but a Communion of fooles. Therefore every man muſt
give according to his abilitie; as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12. 5. it is ſaid, <hi>A good man is mercifull
and lendeth, and will meaſure his affaires by judgement;</hi> that is, he will ſo helpe
others as that hee will not undoe himſelfe, but that which hee doth
hee will doe in diſcretion. The Schoolemen have a ſaying, charitie is
eſpecially to give to ones ſelfe firſt, and then to ſhew it to others: A
good man in doing of charitable duties, ought to doe ſo much good as
that he doe not undoe himſelfe; therefore if any doe ſo give to others,
as that they leave nothing to maintaine their wives and children, and
ſuch as belong to him; theſe men want diſcretion: for it is <hi>S. Pauls</hi>
Rule in the 1 <hi>Timoth.</hi> 5. <hi>Hee that provides not for his owne,</hi> (namely for his
houſhold) <hi>denieth the faith and is worſe than an infidell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now as there may be an <hi>Exceſſe</hi> in giving,<note place="margin">2</note> ſo there are <hi>Defects,</hi> as when
men give too little:<note place="margin">The Defects of giving.</note> This is that ſinne which is common in all places, to
ſinne in the <hi>Defect;</hi> not onely in it is the ſinne of the common people, but
alſo of Chriſtians; therefore men muſt ſo deale with them that bee in
need and want as they deſire that other men ſhould doe to them in the
like caſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> men ſinne in the <hi>Defect,</hi> when they will part with nothing let
the occaſion and need of the partie be what it will bee.<note place="margin">Defect.</note> Little doe theſe
men know what <hi>S. Iames</hi> ſaith, <hi>Iudgement mercileſſe ſhall bee to him that
ſheweth no mercie;</hi> and <hi>Act.</hi> 8. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith to <hi>Simon Magus, thou and thy money
periſh;</hi> whereupon ſaith <hi>Gregorie,</hi> It had beene well with him if nothing
but his mony had periſhed; but there commeth an extent againſt all, he
and his money periſheth. So if men will not part with their mony upon
good occaſions, let the need and the want bee what it will they and
their money are like to periſh. Wee ſee in the Goſpell, the man that had
a talent given him and did not uſe it well, there came an extent; firſt,
upon the talent, which was taken away, and then upon the perſon; <hi>take
away</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>the unprofitable ſervant, &amp;c.</hi> ſo when men doe not
uſe their wealth and money well, there will one day come an extent
againſt their wealth and money; and then againſt themſelves. Therefore
as Chriſt hath ſhewed mercie to us, ſo wee ſhould bee ready to ſhew
mercie to one another in the time of need and extremitie.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> men ſinne in defect, <hi>when they have but one meaſure of giving
whatſoever the occaſion,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Defect.</note> the time or the man is: the contrary practiſe
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:17958:304"/>
whereof we ſee <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 25. where it is ſaid, <hi>They ſold their poſſeſsions, and
brought the money, and laid it downe at the Apoſtles feete, and diſtribution was
made unto every man according as he had neede;</hi> ſo the more neede a man
hath, the more we muſt give; and the leſſe neede, the leſſe we may give.
In the Law the Lord commanded, <hi>Numb.</hi> 15. 5. that in their ſacrifices
they ſhould offer the ſeventh part of a hin of wine for a Lambe, and for
a Ramme the third part of a hin of wine, and for a Bullocke halfe a hin
of wine; In which was a myſtery included to teach us a moderation
in the giving; that where wee ſee moſt neede, we ſhould give more;
where leaſt, we ſhould give leſſe. Therefore when men upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
have but one ſtint to give, they ſinne in the <hi>defect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> ſome men are contented to give, but they take ſuch excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
againſt the perſon,<note place="margin">Defect.</note> that it is a rare man that ſhall make way into his
purſe; yet it ſhould not bee ſo, for in extremitie wee muſt not looke to
the man, but to the neede and want that the man is in: as <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. 29.
Chriſt ſhewed us whom we ſhould releeve, by declaring a Parable of a
man that went downe to <hi>Iericho,</hi> and fell among theeves, who robbed
him of his rayment, wounded him, and departed, leaving him halfe
dead: and there came by a <hi>Prieſt</hi> that ſame way, who when he ſaw him
paſſed by: likewiſe alſo a <hi>Levite,</hi> when he came neere to the place went
and looked on him, and paſſed by on the other ſide: at laſt a certaine
<hi>Samaritan</hi> as he jorneyed,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> came neere, and when he ſaw him, had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
on him, went to him, bound up his wounds, and powred in oyle
and wine in them: the application Chriſt makes to the man, <hi>goe thou and
doe ſo likewiſe:</hi> ſo if wee ſee a man in want and neede, there is matter for
thy charitie to worke on: as <hi>Eſay</hi> 22. it is ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed are they that ſow on
all waters,</hi> that take every occaſion to doe good; whatſoever the perſon
be, yet we muſt ſhew compaſſion in the time of neede. Chriſtian cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
is compared to ſeede ſowne in two ſorts of ground, <hi>in the boſome of
the poore,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> and <hi>in the hand of God:</hi> Now it may periſh in the firſt ground, in
the boſome of the poore: men may be unthankefull and unkinde to us,
but it cannot periſh in the hands of God, but ſhall bring forth a plentifull
increaſe: Therefore doe not thou looke to the boſome of the poore,
thence to have encreaſe, but to the hands of God. There is a queſtion
amongſt the Schoolemen,<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> whether a man were beſt to give to a good
man that is in ſome want,<note place="margin">Anſ.</note> or to a bad and a wicked man that is in extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie?
To this I anſwere, that if the caſe be alike, we are bound rather
to give to a good, than a bad man; but if the wicked man bee in greater
extremitie and neede, then we ſhould give to the bad man rather; as
when a man hath a ſicke childe,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> if one come and tell him that hee hath
a ſheepe like to be drowned, whereupon he leaveth the childe and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to ſave the ſheepe, becauſe the preſent neede required it, yet there
can be no queſtion but that the man loveth his Childe better than the
ſheepe; ſo though wee bee bound to love a good man beſt, yet when
there is ſuch a difference in the neceſſitie, he is bound rather to releeve
a bad than a good man.<note place="margin">5</note>
                  <note place="margin">Bearing with one another.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The fifth thing in the <hi>Communion of the Saints is the mutuall bearing one
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:17958:304"/>
with another in their weakneſſes and infirmities;</hi> ſeeing all the People of
God are ſubject to weakneſſe and infirmitie, being partly fleſh and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſpirit; the fleſh many times having the better of the ſpirit. As wine
and water being put into a glaſſe,<note place="margin">How the fleſh may overcome the Spirit.</note> the water taketh away the good taſte
of the wine; ſo the fleſh taketh away the good taſte of the ſpirit, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that many times the beſt men have many frailties and weakneſſes;<note place="margin">Simile.</note>
therefore there muſt be a mutuall bearing one with another, which is
that which holds together Chriſtian communion: as <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 1. Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>We which are ſtrong ought to beare with the infirmities of the weake;</hi>
and in this place, <hi>beare ye one anothers burthen, and ſo fulfill the Law of Chriſt;</hi>
againe ſaith he, <hi>Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, even as
God for Chriſts ſake forgave you:</hi> ſo then there muſt be a mutuall forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
one of another; as we would have others to beare with our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and infirmities, ſo wee ſhould beare one with another; for if wee
doe not, we cannot hold communion one with another, which is out
of want of true love: We ſee a mother will beare with the frowardneſſe
of her childe,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> though it crie and be diſquiet all the night, yet ſhe ſings
and dances it, and in the morning ſmiles on it, and is as good friends
with it as ſhe was before; the reaſon whereof is, becauſe ſhe loveth her
childe: ſo if there were true love amongſt us, the husband would beare
with the weakeneſſe of the wife, and the wife with the weakeneſſe of
the husband; the Parents with the Children, and the Children with
the Parents, and one good neighbour and friend with another; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
men want true love therefore they cannot digeſt the leaſt matter
that is.</p>
               <p>Now this mutuall bearing one with another conſiſts in three things:<note place="margin">In three things Chriſtians muſt beare with one another.</note>
Firſt, <hi>they be ready to hide and conceale the faults one of another;</hi> they will
not blaze them abroad and make table-talke of them, but they will hide
them;<note place="margin">1</note> and if there bee but one grace or vertue in them, that they will
take notice of,<note place="margin">They hide infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.</note> but their infirmities they conceale: contrariwiſe is the
practiſe of the world, if they ſee a great many graces and vertues, and
but one infirmitie and weakeneſſe in one, they will conceale all his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
and take notice of that weakneſſe and infirmitie, being like to the
flie,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> that paſſeth over all the whole parts of a man, and lights on the
ſore place chiefly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>if they cannot hide and cover them, they will be ready to
excuſe them;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">When they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not cover, they excuſe them.</note> 
                  <hi>as</hi> Acts 3. 17. Peter <hi>told the</hi> Iewes <hi>that they had killed the
Lord of Life:</hi> And now brethren (<hi>ſaith he</hi>) ye did it of ignorance as did your
fathers; <hi>ſo</hi> Ioſeph, Gen. 45. 5. <hi>ſaith he,</hi> I am Ioſeph your brother, whom you ſold
into Egypt; now therefore be not ſad and grieved in your ſelves that yee ſold mee
thither, for God did ſend me before for your preſervation.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>when the fault is ſo great that they cannot excuſe it, and ſo open
and manifeſt as that they cannot hide it,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">They can endure the partie, when the fault is open and unexcuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> 
                  <hi>yet ſtill they can indure them, wiſh well
to them, and pray for them.</hi> As 1 <hi>King.</hi> 12. 23. when the people had ſinned
againſt God in asking a king, and had caſt off <hi>Samuel,</hi> and rejected him;
ſaith he, <hi>God forbid that I ſhould ſinne againſt God? and ceaſe praying for you;
but I will ſhew you the good and right way:</hi> I will not faile in dutie to you,
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:17958:305"/>
though you faile to me. This is a rare example, that when wee cannot
excuſe the matter, nor hide it; that yet we can pray for the party.</p>
               <p>The uſe is,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> ſeeing the communion and ſocietie of the Saints is ſuch a
great helpe to further us to Heaven, and to comfort us here in this
world, let it bee our wiſedome to nouriſh this holy communion one
with another, and to ſtrengthen one another in our faith, repentance,
and holy graces, as alſo to nouriſh holy meetings, for the further inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
one of another. But theſe Chriſtian communions are now much
decayed; wee have ſeene what meetings in many townes there hath
beene in former time to confer and pray one with another, and to ſpeak
of good things; doe Chriſtians thinke there is no neede of helpe this
way, can they goe to Heaven without the helpe one of another? The
ſtrength of <hi>Sampſon</hi> lay in his haire, which when <hi>Dalilah</hi> had cut, hee
became as another man:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſo a great part of the ſtrength of a Chriſtian
lieth in Chriſtian communion, and in the uſe of good meanes, from
which if the world can intice thee, and cut off theſe good helps and
meanes, thy ſtrength will decay, and thou ſhalt become as another man;
therefore it muſt bee our wiſedome to nouriſh this holy communion.
There is another communion now adayes that hath eaten out and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verrun
this, to wit, the communion of good fellowes that meete toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to ſwill, ſwagger, drinke, carouſe, miſpend their time, abuſe the
good creatures, and diſhonor God; but there is as great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
theſe two communions, as betweene light and darkneſſe; and
therefore it is a pittifull thing, that on this day in which men ſhould
get knowledge, faith and repentance, and bee the better for it all the
weeke after, they come to ſwill, ſwagger and miſpend their pretious
time, which I truſt all good men that hope to enjoy the communion of
Saints, will ſhun, deteſt and abhominate.</p>
               <p>Now the Papiſts do further inlarge this point,<note place="margin">Object.</note> and ſay, that <hi>the Saints
may communicate their merits one to another:</hi> for they ſay that the Saints
can merit enough for themſelves, and give the overplus to their friends;
this is a monſtrous opinion, and yet the doctrine of that Church, which
by three reaſons I will diſproove.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Anſ. Three Reaſons that no man can merit for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> 
                  <hi>becauſe no man can merit for himſelfe;</hi> ſo if hee cannot merit for
himſelfe, he cannot merit for another: and no man can merit for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
becauſe merit is a worke that is not due, ſeeing all that we can doe
to God,<note place="margin">Reaſon 1.</note> is but our duty. Now all the ſervice that we doe to God is but
our dutie, for it is ſaid, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 5. <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all
thy heart, and with all thy ſoule, and with all thy might;</hi> ſo then when we have
done all we can, we doe but our duty: ſo alſo Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17. 10.
<hi>when ye have done all you can, ſay, We are but unprofitable ſervants;</hi> therefore
if no man can merit for himſelfe, then much leſſe can hee merit for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Reaſon 2.</note> 
                  <hi>No man can merit for another, but he muſt he his Saviour;</hi> but
no man can be a Saviour but Chriſt onely, according as the Angell told
<hi>Mary, Matth.</hi> 1. 21. <hi>And then ſhalt bring forth a Sonne, and ſhalt call his name
Ieſus, for he ſhall ſave his people from their ſinnes.</hi> Now there is no man can
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:17958:305"/>
be a Saviour, unleſſe he can give grace, but no man can give grace, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
he firſt take away the bar and ſtop that hindreth grace. As a River
being ſtopped cannot runne, unleſſe the ſtop that did hinder it be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:
ſo it is in grace; now that which is the bar and ſtop that hindreth
grace, is the guilt of ſinne: but no man can take away the guilt of ſinne,
but it is Chriſt onely <hi>that muſt ſave his people from their ſinnes,</hi> as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell
ſaid: therefore if no man can take away the guilt of ſinne, no man
can give grace; if hee cannot give grace, he cannot be a Saviour; if hee
cannot be a Saviour, he cannot merit for any man.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Reaſon 3.</note> 
                  <hi>all that the People of God can doe is little enough for themſelves;</hi>
and if it be little enough for themſelves, then they have no overplus for
others: that they have little enough for themſelves, it may appeare by
the ſpeech of the wiſe Virgins to the fooliſh: <hi>Matth.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>And the fooliſh
ſaid to the wiſe, Give us of your oyle, for our lampes are out: But the wiſe anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,</hi>
ſaying, <hi>Not ſo, leſt there be not enough for us:</hi> Saint <hi>Hilary</hi> in that place
ſaith, Get oyle in your lampes, for no man can be helped by the good
deeds of another: therefore, if good men have little enough for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
then they can have no overplus for others. Moreover, it is a
ſtrange thing that the ſame men deny the imputation of Chriſts righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe;
for they ſay, that Chriſts righteouſneſſe cannot be imputed
to us; and yet they hold that the righteouſneſſe of the Saints may bee
communicated; ſo then they attribute more to the Saints, than unto
Chriſt. Would any man thinke that a man of judgement, diſcretion
and knowledge, ſhould fall upon ſuch rockes and ſands? but no marvel,
for when men will not beleeve the truth, then God gives them up to
ſtrange deluſions to beleeve lies. Now though the Saints doe not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
their merits one unto another; yet thankes bee to God they
doe communicate their graces and gifts one to another; they do exhort,
admoniſh and pray for one another.</p>
               <p>The uſe of this is,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> firſt, that ſeeing there is a communion of Saints,
therefore it muſt be our care to uphold good things, to incourage one
another, and to quicken them in the life of Ieſus. We ſee what commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
there is amongſt the drunkards of our age to ſwill and ſwagger;
how much more ſhould Chriſtians have communion together, to
ſtrengthen and helpe one another to Heaven? Therefore wee ſhould
doe as poore people doe, lay all the ends together to nouriſh the little
ſparkes that be in us.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſeeing that there is a Communion of Saints, therefore we
muſt deſire to appertaine to that body and ſocietie, that ſo wee may
partake of thoſe Roiall Privileges with them: naturally a man hath but
one head to adviſe him and give him counſell,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> one tongue to ſpeake for
him, two eyes to forſee dangers, two hands to releeve him in any
neede, and two feete to goe for him, but by the Communion of Saints,
a man hath ten thouſand heads to adviſe him, and give him counſell; ten
thouſand eyes to forſee dangers; ten thouſand tongues to ſpeake for
him; therefore it muſt bee every mans care to repent him of his ſinnes,
to remove them, and to get faith in Chriſt, that hee may appertaine to
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:17958:306"/>
them. Wee ſee in a great citie there bee divers companies, and ſome
there bee that have greater Priviledges than other, whereof men deſire
chiefly to bee free; ſo in the ſpirituall citie the inviſible Church there
bee many immunities and privileges above other companies, which
Gods deare children ſhould labour to enjoy and have ſocietie and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip
therein.</p>
               <p>Wee are now come to the ſecond thing,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>The Communion of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
with the dead,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Communion of the living with the dead.</note> which conſiſts chiefly in two things; firſt, <hi>That the
Saints departed wiſh well to thoſe that be living, &amp; deſire their conſummation in
glorie;</hi> for it is the nature of charitie to wiſh well to others. Now in the
Saints it is not diminiſhed but increaſed; as <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 12.
<hi>For wee know but in part, and wee prophecie but in part, but when that which is
perfect is come, then that which is in part ſhall be aboliſhed.</hi> So then in generall,
they wiſh well to us; indeed they doe not know our particular eſtate, as
<hi>Iob</hi> 14. 21. <hi>thou changeſt his face and ſendest him away, and hee knowes not if his
ſonnes ſhall be honorable, neither ſhall bee underſtand any thing concerning them,
whether they bee of low degree:</hi> and so <hi>Eſai.</hi> 63. 16. <hi>Doubtleſſe thou art our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
though Abraham he ignorant of us, and Israel know us not, yet thou O Lord,
art our Father and our Redeemer;</hi> hence it is manifeſt, that though the Saints
departed know not our particular wants, yet in generall they wiſh well
unto us, and dſire that wee may come to the ſame glorie that they
enjoy, and may arrive at the ſame Haven of Happineſſe, and doe alſo
looke every day for us, till the finall conſummation ſhall come: this is
comfortable to conſider, that the whole bodie of the Saints in Heaven
wiſh well unto us, and looke every day when wee ſhall come to them;
as men in a Shipwracke when ſome bee ſcaped &amp; gotten to the ſhore,
they remaine longing and looking,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> when the reſt of their company ſhall
arrive; ſo the Godly having eſcaped Shipwracke in this world, ſtand
upon the ſhore of their own happineſſe, and every day looke when the
reſt of their brethren ſhall arrive at the ſame place with them; therefore
why ſhould holy people be afraid to die? though they loſe their earthly
friends, yet they ſhall goe to all the Saints departed, to ſuch as wiſh well
to them, and looke every day for them, they ſhall goe to <hi>Abraham, Isaak</hi>
and <hi>Iaakob,</hi> and to all the holy men departed: this is the firſt thing that
the living with the dead have Communion in.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> the living and the dead have Communion <hi>in the ſame hope,
faith and love, converſing with them in Heaven,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Wee have the ſame faith and hope and love.</note> even with <hi>Abraham, Isaak</hi>
and <hi>Iaakob,</hi> and all the holy people and Saints: ſo <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſaith; <hi>Now
therefore yee are no more strangers and forreners but citizens with the Saints and
of the houſhold of God:</hi> and <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 22. <hi>but yee are come to the mount Sion and
to the citie of the living God the celestiall Ieruſalem, and to the Company of Innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
Angels, and to the congregation of the first borne, which are written in
Heaven, and to God the Iudge of all, and to the Spirits of just and perfect men.</hi>
This is the honour of a true Chriſtian, that hee ſhall not onely have
Communion with weake and fraile men (ſuch as wee bee) but also with
Angells and Archangells and all the Saints departed, conversing with
them in their faith, hope and love: Wee ſee in a great houſe there bee
<pb n="599" facs="tcp:17958:306"/>
many Roomes and lodgings, there bee ſome that lodge in the upper,
ſome in the lower Roomes, and yet they bee all one houſe and familie,
and appertaine to one Lord and maſter, many times they all meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and when they bee parted, there is but a floore or a loft between
them; ſo the Church of God is a great houſe wherein there bee many
lodgings, ſome lodge in the upper Roome, that is in Heaven; and ſome
in the lower, the earth, and yet they have but one Lord and Maſter, and
bee all of one familie; there is but a floore as it were between them,
and that is, <hi>the veile of this fleſh,</hi> which ſhall be taken away one day, &amp; they
ſhall come together one day. They that are in the upper Roome ſhall
come down into this lower, to receive their bodies; and they which are
in this lower, ſhall goe up into the upper Roome to receive their glorie
and immortalitie. The People of God in old time dwelled in Tents, the
husband had his Tent, and the wife had hers, as wee ſee <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. that
<hi>Abraham</hi> had his Tent by himſelfe, and <hi>Sara</hi> had her Tent, and yet
there was Communion between them, they met ſometimes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed
together, and when they were aſunder, there was but a thinne
canvaſe or cloath between them: ſo the Saints departed, live in one
place a-part by themſelves, and the living Saints by themſelves, and yet
there is a neere conjunction between them, becauſe they all meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the adoration of the true God; when they are aſunder there
being as it were but a thinne cloth between them, the veile of this fleſh.
Therefore little doe men know what they doe deprive themſelves of
by their ſinnes, for they doe not onely loſe Communion with weake
and fraile men (such as wee bee) but with Angells and Archangells and
all the Saints departed and bleſſed People of Heaven above. Therefore
pittie the madneſſe and folly of men, to deprive themſelves of ſo great
a bleſſing.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> the <hi>Communion of the dead with the dead,</hi> consisting in two
things: Firſt,<note place="margin">The Communion of the Dead with the Dead in two things.</note> 
                  <hi>in deſire that they may be buried, &amp; lye together in the grave, that
they may riſe together in glorie and happineſſe.</hi> We ſee <hi>Gen.</hi> 23. that <hi>Abraham</hi>
might have buried <hi>Sarah</hi> when ſhee was dead in the beſt of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchers
of the Heathen people;<note place="margin">1</note> but hee bought a peece of ground of
them to burie her in.<note place="margin">Of in regard their bodies.</note> And <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 29. <hi>Iacob</hi> gave a charge to his Sonnes
concerning the place of his buriall, ſaying, <hi>I am gathered unto my people,
bury mee with my Fathers in the cave, that is, in the fields of Ephron the Hittite;
in the cave, that is, in the field of Machpelah beſides Mamre in the Land of
Canaan; which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite, for a
poſſeſſion to burie in: there they layd Abraham and Sarah, and there they buried
Iſaak and Rebecca his wife, and there I buried Leah;</hi> and let mee lye amongſt
Gods Saints: ſo 1. <hi>King.</hi> 30. 31. the old Prophet ſaid, <hi>When I am dead bury
mee alſo in the Sepulcher wherein the man of God is buried, lay my bones by his
bones, and my body by his body, &amp;c.</hi> So it is the deſire of the Saints to lye
together in the grave; to have their aſhes mingled together, and their
duſt never ſeparated, that ſo they may riſe to eternall glorie together.
Some thinke it is no matter where a man is buried when hee is dead,
and indeed all is one in regard of ſalvation; but a man would bee loth
<pb n="600" facs="tcp:17958:307"/>
to rise with whoremaſters, drunkards, theeves and villaines; therefore
hee would hee loth to lye amongſt them.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>In that they ſhall meete together in the communion of the myſticall
body of Chriſt:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> for as in a circumference there are many points and lines,
all which come to one center; ſo there be many bodies of the Saints
ſcattered and ſevered, ſome in the land, ſome in another, ſome in the
Sea, concavities and hollow places of the Earth, yet all theſe ſhall meet
at the Center in the body of Chriſt: for howſoever the body may bee
ſundered by death from the ſoule for a time, yet ſoule and body cannot
be ſundred from Chriſt.<note place="margin">Object.</note> Some thinke that the dead bodies of the Saints
doe truely belong to Chriſt, and are under the care of God, becauſe
Chriſt ſaith, that <hi>God is the God of Abraham, Iſaak</hi> and <hi>Iaakob;</hi> but they
doe not thinke that they have communion with Chriſt when they bee
dead, becauſe they have communion with Chriſt by meanes of the
Spirit onely: but to this I anſwere,<note place="margin">Anſ. 1.</note> that the dead bodies bee not onely
members with Chriſt, but they have communion with him; for looke
how it was with the materiall body of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> when the ſoule and body
was ſundred by death, yet it was alwayes united to the Godhead: ſo
the faithfull people though they bee dead, yet are united to Christ.
Againe,<note place="margin">Anſ. 2.</note> I answere, that all communion wee have, is by the Spirit of
Chriſt; for our dead bodies doe communicate by his Spirit; not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to all the effects of it, but ſome, namely that hee doth preſerve and
keepe their duſt, and one day will raiſe and quicken them againe to live
in glory and happineſſe: ſo Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 11. <hi>But if the ſpirit of
him that raiſed up Ieſus from the dead dwelleth in you, hee that raiſed up Chriſt
from the dead, ſhall alſo quicken your mortall bodies, becauſe his Spirit dwelleth
in you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> the dead have communion one with another <hi>in regard of
their ſoules;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">They have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their ſoules.</note> for all the ſoules of the Saints when they leave this world,
ſhall bee gathered to the Saints that be departed: ſo <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 15. ſaith
God, <hi>But thou ſhalt goe to thy fathers in peace, and ſhalt be buried in a good old
age.</hi> Now it could not bee meant of the bodies of his fathers, for they
were buried in another Countrie; nor could it be meant of the ſoules
of his fathers, (for they were idolaters) but it was meant of the fathers
of his faith, to ſuch as he was, to holy and good men: for looke what
a man is, to the ſame he ſhal be gathered to; and ſuch as a man converſeth
with, whileſt he liveth here on the earth, unto ſuch he ſhall bee gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in the life to come. Therefore, (to ſhut up all) if thou wouldeſt not
be gathered to whoremaſters, drunkards, murtherers, theeves, villains,
and ſuch like, doe not converſe with them, nor partake with them in
their ſinnes; but if thou have repented of thy ſinnes, got faith in Chriſt
and made conſcience of thy wayes, converſing with good men, then
thou ſhalt bee gathered to <hi>Abraham, Iſaak and Iaakob,</hi> and all the holy
men: therefore every man muſt ſo live in this life, as that hee may live
for ever in the life to come.</p>

of Chriſt, hee is none of his:</hi> Now the meanes to
come by it is by the Word and Sacraments,
which be the conduits and channels to convey the Spirit into us; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
wee muſt apply our ſelves to the hearing of the Word preached,

                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> 
                  <hi>but Chriſt liveth in me.</hi> If a man
take Phyſicke, the next queſtion that uſeth to bee asked, is, what doth
the Phyſicke worke? for if it doth not, it is very dangerous to him that
taketh it; and if he mend not ſpeedily after it, and gather ſtrength, they
doe ſuſpect the man to bee but a dead man; even ſo the Word and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
are Gods Phyſicke, which when we have received, the next
thing that wee ſhould enquire into, is, whether they worke upon us or
no? if they doe not ſtirre our bad humors (as it were) and bee a meanes
to remove our ſinnes, and to get ſtrength againſt them, that we may be
quickned in our ſoules with holy graces, if wee doe not mend (I ſay)
upon it, our eſtate is full of danger: Therefore it muſt bee our care to
profit by the uſe theſe good meanes, that we may feele the Power of
Chriſt in us, to kill ſinne, and to quicken up all the graces that are in us;
for the more wee increaſe in communion with Chriſt, the leſſe wee
ſhall have communion with our ſinnes. To explaine this to you, give
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:17958:308"/>
me leave to uſe a familiar ſimilitude;<note place="margin">ART. X.</note> A certaine man there was that had
a foule yard, who got gravell and ſtones to mend it, yet ſtill his yard
was foule;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> then having a little ſpring in it, he opens that and turnes the
ſtreame through his yard, which carried away all the rubbiſh, filth, and
dirt; ſo when wee feele and ſee our hearts to bee uncleane, the way to
mend them is not to put gravell &amp; ſtones upon them, but there is a little
ſpring of the blood of Chriſt, which we muſt labor to turne into them;
and this will bee ſure to carry all the filth, rubbiſh and corruption that
is in us: Againe,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> thoſe that make opticke glaſſes, they ſay can gather all
the Sunne beames ſo together, as by reflecting them on a ſhip, they can
ſet it on fire; in like manner if we can gather all the gratious beames of
the graces of Chriſt into our hearts, though it doe not burne the ſhip,
yet it will burne up all our ſinnes and corruptions: therefore it muſt be
our care by the uſe of good meanes to nouriſh this holy Communion,
that we have with Chriſt by the Spirit.</p>
               <p>Now as we have communion with Chriſt, ſo alſo with his Members
by love; I ſhewed that there is a threefold Communion: of the living
with the living; of the living with the dead; and of the dead with the
dead: which was twofold, in their bodies and ſoules.</p>
               <p>But of this ſufficiently before: for of the ſeverall Communions of
Saints one with another, I have at divers times ſpoken; my intention at
this preſent is onely to proſecute ſuch neceſſary conſequences as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon this Doctrine: which, alſo I doe reduce chiefly to theſe three
heads: Firſt, <hi>That the ſoule of man dieth not;</hi> againſt <hi>Atheiſts:</hi> Secondly,
<hi>That the ſoule ſleepeth not with the Body;</hi> againſt <hi>Anabaptiſts:</hi> Thirdly, <hi>That
the ſoule goeth not to Purgatorie;</hi> againſt <hi>Papiſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of theſe in Order;<note place="margin">1</note> and firſt,<note place="margin">That the ſoule dieth not.</note> 
                  <hi>That the ſoule of a man dieth not;</hi> againſt the
<hi>Atheists</hi> of this time, who ſay that the ſoule dieth together with the
body: indeed it were well with them, that their ſoules might die with
their bodies, as a beaſt dieth, for it goeth but to the ground and there is
an end of them, but their ſoules (I meane <hi>Atheiſts</hi>) ſhall goe into paines
and torments. Now becauſe this is a weightie point, and of ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
I will prove it to you firſt, <hi>by the Scripture</hi> and ſecondly, <hi>by
Reaſon:</hi> by the Scripture for your ſakes, for they care not for the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
and by Reaſon for their ſakes, becauſe they may bee left without
excuſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>by the Scriptures;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Proofe by the Scripture.</note> 
                  <hi>Eccl.</hi> 12. 7. <hi>Then ſhall the duſt returne to the earth,
and the Spirit to God that gave it;</hi> likewiſe Chriſt ſaith to the theefe, <hi>This
day ſhalt thou bee with mee in Paradiſe, Luk.</hi> 23. Now this could not bee
ſpoken of his bodie, for that was in the hands of the Souldiers to burie;
therefore it was ſpoken in regard of his ſoule.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>by Reaſons,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">By Reason.</note> which are chiefly three: Firſt, <hi>That which is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,
is corrupted by the contrarie of it;</hi> but there is nothing contrarie to
the ſoule but ſinne; as 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 11. <hi>S. Peter</hi> exhorts the brethren, <hi>Dearly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,
I beſeech your as Pilgrims &amp; ſtrangers abſtaine from fleſhly lusts that fight
againſt the ſoule:</hi> Now ſinne is not contrarie to the ſubstance of the ſoule,
but to the puritie &amp; ſanctitie thereof; therefore though ſinne deſtroy the
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:17958:308"/>
puritie of the ſoule, it cannot deſtroy the ſubtance of the ſoule; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
the ſoule still liveth.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Reaſon 2.</note> 
                  <hi>That if the ſoule may doe any action in the body, that depends not
of the body without the helpe of it, then it may ſubſiſt without the body:</hi> which
wee may eaſily perceive aſwell by demonſtration out of the rules of
Philoſophy, as by evident notes and markes proceeding from the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of our ſoule within our ſelves, as the ſeverall operations of the
intellectuall faculties, that doe not depend at all on the body: even ſo it
is in exiſting; but the ſoule may doe ſome action in the body that doth
not depend on it, as the judgement, and the will; therefore it may exiſt
without the body.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Reaſon 3.</note> 
                  <hi>a thing that corrupteth muſt corrupt to ſomething or to nothing:</hi> If
they ſay it doth corrupt to ſome thing, then it will diſſolve to the ſame
thing that it was made of,<note place="margin">1</note> but it was not made of the foure Elements,
for then it would bee ſome thing; nor of the temper of the Elements, for
then it ſhould bee compounded; but all Divines hold, that the ſoule is
not a compound thing, but a thing undividable; therefore the ſoule
doth not corrupt to ſomething.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And it doth not corrupt to nothing;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2</note> for, <hi>of nothing nothing can bee made
by the power of nature;</hi> but by his owne power God is able to make
ſomething of nothing. So this opinion is falſe; therefore if the <hi>Atheiſts</hi>
cannot tell us what becommeth of the ſoule, and whether it dieth or
not; Gods word can tell, that the ſoule doth not dye, but that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall.</p>
               <p>The Use is,<note place="margin">Vſe</note> ſeeing the ſoule liveth when it is out of the body, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all our care muſt be for the ſalvation of our ſoules; whatſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth
of our bodies, our care muſt bee for our ſoules; yet wee ſee
what a-doe there is about the body, all our care is for to cloath and feed
it, and yet that ſhall come to the duſt for a while, and the ſoule ſhall live
for ever in glorie or in paine; therefore our chiefeſt care muſt bee for
that. Wee ſee the theefe on the croſſe makes his Requeſt to Chriſt,
that hee would <hi>remember him when hee comes in his Kingdome,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> all his care
was for the ſaving of his ſoule; hee doth not pray Chriſt to pull the
nayles and the ſplinters out of his hands and feete, to aſſwage and miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
his bodily paines, but all his care is for ſaving of his ſoule; in like
manner when wee come to die our requeſt muſt bee, that God would
ſave our ſoules whatſoever becommeth of the body: I did ſhew you the
other day that if a houſe were burnt downe, and the men in it ſhould
eſcape;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> wee uſe to ſay, thankes bee to God for it; ſo though our bodies
goe to the duſt, yet prayſe God that our ſoules goe to heaven, into
eternall joy and glorie.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing that I will demonſtrate is,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>that the ſoule doth not
sleepe in the body when it is dead;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">That the ſoule ſleepe not in the body.</note> this is againſt the is <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> who ſay
that the ſoule ſleepes in the body, when it is in the grave: but I know no
ground for this opinion; for whereas Chriſt ſayes <hi>Iohn</hi> 11. <hi>our friend
Lazarus ſleepeth, &amp;c.</hi> that cannot bee meant of the ſoule, but of the death
of the body; ſo <hi>Matth.</hi> 27. it is ſaid, <hi>that the Saints that ſlept aroſe:</hi> ſo then
<pb n="604" facs="tcp:17958:309"/>
they have no Scripture for their opinion, but againſt them.</p>
               <p>Now wee will ſee what <hi>Reaſon</hi> wee have againſt them: Firſt,<note place="margin">Reaſons against it.</note> ſee what
is the cauſe of ſleeping, for it is by reaſon of certaine vapours that ariſe
from the bottome of the ſtomack,<note place="margin">Cauſe of ſleepe.</note> and aſcend into the head where they
binde the ſenſes: Now this cauſe is not in the ſoule, and therefore that
cannot ſleepe.<note place="margin">2</note> Againe, if the ſoule ſhould ſleepe, it muſt ſleepe in the
body; for caſt out of the body it cannot ſleepe, becauſe as long as the
ſoule is in the body there is life in a man, as <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 9. of
<hi>Eutichus; Trouble not your ſelves</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>for there is life in him;</hi> when he
fell out of the window,<note place="margin">Object.</note> and every one thought hee had beene dead. If
they ſay that <hi>the ſoule ſleepes out of the body,</hi> it muſt ſleepe in Heaven or in
Hell,<note place="margin">Anſ.</note> or in this world, or in the grave: It can not ſleepe in Heaven, for
there is joy, nor in Hell for there is paine, nor in this world, for there is
labour and paine, nor in the grave, for there is corruption; therefore
away with this ſleepy opinion. Now there is another kinde of ſleepe
of the ſoule in the body, which <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. <hi>Awake thou
that ſleepest and ſtand up from the dead, and, Chriſt ſhall give thee life:</hi> therefore
it is good for men to awake while they bee here out of this ſleepe of
ſinne, leſt they bee fearefully awaked, at the dreadfull day of judgement
with this fearefull ſentence, <hi>Goe ye curſed into Hell fire prepared for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
and his Angells.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third thing that I will demonſtrate unto you is,<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>That the ſoules doe
not goe to a middle place,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">That the ſoules doe not goe to a middle place.</note> 
                  <hi>as the Papiſts ſay:</hi> if men have done well then they
goe to Heaven preſently, but if they have committed great faults then
they reſt in a middle place: The Scriptures ſhew otherwiſe <hi>Eccle.</hi> 12. it is
ſaid, <hi>that duſt goeth to the earth and the ſoule to God that gave it:</hi> and Chriſt
ſaid to the theefe, <hi>This day thou ſhalt bee with mee in Paradise: Origen</hi> ſaith
that that which Chriſt ſpake to the theefe on the Croſſe, hee ſpake to all
his people; that when they died, their ſoules goe preſently to joy: and
<hi>S. Paul</hi> ſhewes the ſame where hee ſaith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 7. <hi>Therefore wee are bold
and love rather to remove out of the body, and to dwell with God.</hi> Hence then
wee ſee it plaine in the Scripture, that ſo ſoone as a man dieth his ſoule
goeth home to God, to glorie and happineſſe if hee bee a true beleever.
Therefore ſeeing the ſoule doth not die, neither with the body as the
<hi>Atheiſts</hi> ſay, nor ſleepe in the body, as the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> ſay, nor reſt in a
middle place as the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſay it is a certaine truth that the ſoules of the
Godly are gathered preſently after death into the Kingdome of Heaven.
O then what a joyfull meeting will that be when my ſoule and thy ſoule
and all the ſoules of Gods Children ſhall bee gathered to <hi>Angels</hi> and
<hi>Archangels,</hi> to the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> and <hi>Prophets;</hi> to <hi>Abraham, Iſaak</hi> and <hi>Iaakob,</hi>
and all the Holy men of God that are departed in the faith of Chriſt;
therfore above all things (my brethren) labour to have Communion with
the Saints here in the Kingdome of Grace that thou mayeſt have Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with them in the Kingdome of glorie; for if it bee a ſweet thing to
have Communion with the Saints here in this life, much more it is a
ſweet and joyfull thing to have Communion with them in the Kingdome
of glorie.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="605" facs="tcp:17958:309"/>
Now there are foure things in this life that hinder and allay the

ſaid, <hi>that Lots ſoule was vexed every day with the uncleane converſation of the
Sodomites</hi> dwelling amongſt them, and yet they did not hurt with their
hands. If one man ſhould set up a number of goodly lights,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and one
ſhould come and make a ſmoke in the roome, it would dimme the
lights; ſo the Lord hath ſet up a number of Saints to ſhine as lights in
this World, and the Divell he thruſts in a number of vile and wicked
men to make a ſmoke to dampe their light, which although they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
quite quench, yet they much dimme: this doth hinder and allay
the ſweete and comfortable communion that the Saints ſhould have
one with another. Now in the Kingdome of Heaven there ſhall be no
ſuch matter: as <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 41. It is ſaid that Chriſt will <hi>thruſt out of his
kingdome all things that offend:</hi> ſo there ſhall not bee a wicked man left to
hurt nor offend them: ſo <hi>Eſay</hi> 11. 9. it is ſaid, <hi>They ſhall not hurt nor deſtroy
in all my holy mountaine:</hi> and likewiſe <hi>Revel.</hi> 21. 27. it is ſaid, <hi>And there
ſhall enter into it no uncleane thing, neither whoſoever worketh abomination, or
telleth lies:</hi> againe, <hi>Revel</hi> 22. 15. ſaith he, <hi>For without ſhall be dogges, inchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
whoremongers, murtherers, Idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh
lies:</hi> So all the wicked ſhall be excluded and ſhut out of the kingdome
of God, there ſhall be no body to hurt the Saints nor to grieve and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
them; O how comfortable will the communion of Saints bee in
Heaven?</p>

Secondly, <hi>Imperfectio bonorum,</hi> the <hi>imperfection of good men;</hi> for they
be not perfectly sanctified in this world,<note place="margin">2</note> they are regenerated but in
part;<note place="margin">The imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of good men.</note> partly fleſh, and partly ſpirit: ſo by reaſon hereof there bee many
jarres and brangles that doe ariſe amongſt them; as <hi>Gregory</hi> ſaith out
of <hi>Psal.</hi> 10. that many times friends have much adoe to agree: for wee
ſee <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> were both ſanctified and holy men, and yet there
was a jarre betweene them, they were glad to be parted, <hi>Gen.</hi> 13. 8. ſo
<hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> wee both good and holy men, and yet they were ſo
at oddes one with another, that they parted company. <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 39. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcen</hi>
obſerveth,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> that as there is no roſe (ſince the fall of Man) but hath
his prickles; ſo there is no man, even the beſt that is, but hath ſome
thing or other in him, that is diſtaſtefull: but in Heaven all theſe infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
ſhall be taken away, and then there will bee infinite matter of
comfort. As <hi>Gen.</hi> 21. 10. yee ſee that there was a jarre betweene <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
and <hi>Sarah,</hi> about the bondwoman and her childe, who when ſhee
was caſt out, all was at peace: ſo many times there is contention and
ſtrife betweene Chriſtians, all being about the bondwoman and her
Childe; that is, the reliques and remainders of corruptions in the fleſh,
but when they ſhall be taken from us, then wee ſhall have ſweet agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
therefore if the communion of Saints be comfortable here, how
much more comfortable will it be in Heaven?</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>distantia locorum,</hi> that they live in <hi>remote places</hi> one from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother;
and yet there is a providence of God in it,<note place="margin">The diſtance of Place.</note> 
                  <hi>For the People of God
are ſaid to be the ſalt of the Earth:</hi> Salt muſt not be laid all in one place,
but it is ſprinkled and ſcattered in every place to make meat ſeaſonable
and ſavoury,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> that is, unto many; ſo the Godly, doe not live all in one
Towne, Countrie, and Place, but are ſcattered and ſprinkled all the
world over to ſeaſon the hearts of their brethren, and their ſoules; to
make them ſavoury unto God: ſo becauſe they be thus ſcattered and
hindered one from another, this doth hinder and allay the ſweet and
comfortable communion that they ſhould have one of another. It is
ſaid, <hi>Iudges</hi> 5. 16. <hi>For the diviſions of Reuben were great thoughts of heart;</hi> for
<hi>Reuben</hi> was placed on the other ſide <hi>of Iordan,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſo that they could not get
mutuall helpe from them, becauſe there was a River betweene them;
In like manner because there is a <hi>Iordan,</hi> betweene the People of God
in this World; ſome living in one Countrie, and ſome in another, ſo
that they cannot lend their mutuall helpe one to another; this maketh
great thoughts of heart, and allayeth the comfort that they might have
one of another: but at the day of death they ſhall all goe into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of God, and live in one place. As <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. Chriſt ſhewes that
<hi>they ſhall come from the Eaſt, and from the Weſt, and ſhall ſit downe with Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
Iſaak, and Iaakob, in the Kingdome of God.</hi> Wee ſee how comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
it is when a few Chriſtians are met together to conferre, pray, and
ſing <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> who notwithſtanding have their weakneſſe and frailties:
and if it be ſo comfortable here,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> what will it be when all the People of
God ſhall meete together in Heaven. If one ſee an infinite number of
godly Diamonds ſhinning, ſcattered here and there, and they bee all
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:17958:310"/>
brought into one roome, what a light and luſtre would there bee? So
the People of God are as a company of ſhinning Pearles or Diamonds,
that are ſeated here in this world, but one day when all they are gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
together and brought into Heaven, then what a wonderfull glory
and ſhining will there be?</p>
               <p>Fourthly;<note place="margin">4</note> 
                  <hi>Angustia amorum, the narrowneſſe of their love:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Narrowneſſe of their Love.</note> for the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God are bound to love as brethren, and to tender the good one
of another. Now there is ſuch a narrowneſſe in our love, that we have
much adoe to love our friends, much leſſe all the Saints; for there be a
number of Saints that we know not, neither doe wee love all we know,
as we ſhould doe; but at the day of death when wee ſhall all meete to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in Heaven, then our love ſhall be inlarged, and we ſhall love the
whole <hi>Iſrael of God,</hi> no brother loveth his brother ſo dearely as we ſhall
love one another; yea, though we never ſaw them before, nor heard of
them; then conſider how great will our comfort be at that day, when
we ſhall part from this world, and live together in Heaven?</p>
               <p>Now beſides all theſe, there is a double communion wee have with
the Saints:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. A communion with them in Grace.</item>
                  <item>2. A communion with them in Glorie.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Therefore it muſt be every mans care to labour to appertaine to the
communion of ſaints in grace, that ſo they may come to have co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion
with them in the kingdome of glory. Indeed all men deſire to appertain
to the communion of ſaints in glory, to go to the kingdome of Heaven;
like <hi>Balaam</hi> that deſired to die the death of the righteous, to be in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and happineſſe with the People of God, but cared not to live godlily
here: But if ever wee expect to have communion with the Saints here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
in the kingdome of Glory, wee muſt bee ſure to have communion
with them here in the kingdome of Grace. And therefore let us labour
to repent us of our ſinnes, to get faith in Chriſt, to walke before God in
newneſſe and holineſſe of life, and then after this life, we ſhall live in all
bleſſedneſſe in the kingdome of Heaven for ever.</p>

<hi>Matth.</hi> 1. the Angell ſaid to <hi>Mary, and thou ſhalt call his Name Ieſus, for
he ſhall ſave his People from their ſinnes:</hi> ſo then it is cleare by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that the pardon of ſinnes is one of the greateſt bleſſings that God
giveth in this life. It is a great bleſſing indeed to have food and rayment,
with things fit and needfull for this life: but the pardon of our ſinnes
is a greater bleſſing than that, for take any man abounding in all
theſe things, riches, goods, honours and credit, yet if he want the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
of his ſinnes, he is a miſerable man, and ſtands in a wofull conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
for he ſtands not on cleare grounds. The priſoners in the Tower
are in a worſe eſtate and condition,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> than the pooreſt waterbearer is; for
though he have all good diet, attendance, fine roomes, and a ſoft bed
to lie on; yet in his owne ſenſe he is miſerable, becauſe he lookes every
day for his arraignment, when ſentence ſhall be given againſt him; ſo if
a man flow in all the wealth and deliciouſneſſe the world can afford,
and yet be unreconciled to God, and hath not repented his ſinnes, he is
<pb n="609" facs="tcp:17958:311"/>
in a worſe condition and eſtate,<note place="margin">SERM. LXXI.</note> than the pooreſt of Gods Saints, though
they have but bread and water, becauſe that every day hee may looke
when hee ſhall have the finall ſentence pronounced againſt him, to the
wofull confuſion of him for evermore. When every thing goes well
with us, it is an hard matter for us to ſee the pardon of our ſinnes to bee
one of the greateſt bleſſings; but if the Lord ſhould open our eyes, to
ſee our ſinnes, and to feele the burthen of them a little, being touched
in conſcience for them; then if the world were ſet on the one hand,
and the pardon of our ſinnes on the other, we would chooſe the pardon
of our ſinnes before all this world.</p>
               <p>The uſe hereof ſhall be,<note place="margin">Vſe.</note> ſeeing the pardon of ſinnes is one of the greateſt
bleſſings that God giveth in this world, therfore though God give us food
and raiment, things needfull and neceſſarie for this life, yet we ſhould not
be at reſt, till we finde the pardon and forgiveneſſe of our ſinnes; moſt men
now a-dayes labour for theſe outward things &amp; never ſeeke for the pardon
of ſinnes, but every one ſhould checke himſelfe and ſay, I have laboured a
long time for theſe outward things, for a little bread and cloath, yet the
time is to come that ever I ſought for the pardon of my ſinnes, the greateſt
bleſſing of all. <hi>Exod.</hi> 8. 8. wee read how <hi>Pharoah</hi> came to <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi>
ſaying, <hi>Pray yee unto the Lord that hee may take away the frogges from mee:</hi>
Hee deſired not him to pray to take away his ſinnes,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> which was the cauſe
of them; Iuſt the ſame is the caſe of the men of this world, they cry out,
take away this judgement, this ſickneſſe, this lameneſſe, take away this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertie,
but never pray to God to take away their ſinnes, which are the cauſe
thereof. <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. God made to <hi>Abraham</hi> great and large promiſes, who
replies to God,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> 
                  <hi>Lord, what is all this ſeeing I goe childleſſe?</hi> ſo, when God hath

yet he ſhould ſay unto God, Lord what is all this ſeeing I want the pardon
of my ſinnes? therefore above all things, Lord forgive mee my ſinnes,
and pardon them.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing is,<note place="margin">2</note> that, <hi>pardon of ſinnes appertaineth to this life onely:</hi>
for there are two ſorts of bleſſings;<note place="margin">Pardon of ſinne is onely for this life.</note> ſome that appertaine to this life, some
to the world to come; thoſe that appertaine to this life are: Firſt, <hi>The
Communion of Saints:</hi> Secondly, <hi>The forgiveneſſe of ſinnes.</hi> Here a man muſt
ſeek it, for ſo Chriſt ſhewes, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. <hi>agree with thine adverſarie whileſt thou
art in the way.</hi> Now <hi>Augustine</hi> ſaith, that the time of life is the way to the
judgement barre; and therefore while wee are in the way wee muſt labour
to ſeeke peace with God and the pardon of our ſinnes; <hi>leſt our adverſarie
accuſe us to the Iudge, and the Iudge deliver us to the jaylour, and the jaylour
cast us into priſon, whence wee ſhall not come out untill wee have payed the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
farthing:</hi> And <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 9. 10. <hi>All that thy hand findeth to doe,
doe it with all thy power, for there is neither worke, invention, nor knowledge in
the grave whither thou goeſt.</hi> So <hi>S. Cyprian</hi> ſaith, when a man is once out of
this world, all opportunitie of doing good, is gone: So <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> here
in this world one muſt finde the pardon of his ſinnes, in the world to come
it will bee too late to finde it: And ſo <hi>Augustine,</hi> there is a twofold Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
<hi>a fruitfull Repentance;</hi> which is in this life; and <hi>penall</hi> or <hi>unfruitfull
<pb n="610" facs="tcp:17958:312"/>
Repentance</hi> in the life to come; ſo the wicked in Hell, may repent them of
their ſinnes; the whoremonger of his whroedome, ſwearers of their ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and the drunkard of his drunkenneſſe: but this kind of Repentance
is unfruitfull, becauſe they have no good by it, but it ſerveth to increaſe
their further torment. But the fruitfull Repentance is in this life onely;
therefore we are taught hereby to make it our wisedome to lay hold on the
good time that God giveth us to repent us of our ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nes, to bee reconciled
unto him and ſeeke favour at his hands; for if we bee once dead and layd
in the grave, all opportimitie of doing good, is taken away If a man ſends
his ſervant to the market to buy ſuch things as they ſtand in need of,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> when
the market bell rings hee muſt apply himſelfe to buy the things that hee
comes for, whileſt the market laſts; for if the market bee once over, the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie
for that time is loſt: ſo the time of life is the market of the ſoule,
whileſt this laſteth, a man may have any ſanctified Grace, hee may faith,
Repentance, favour with God, and pardon for his ſinnes; but if hee tarrie
till the market bee done, and this life ended, hee cannot have faith, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
nor any ſanctified grace; nor one drop of Gods favour though hee
would give a world for it. Therefore let us bee exhorted to lay hold on the
good time that God giveth us.</p>
               <p>Now for the further inlargement of this wee are to conſider two

               </p>

                  <item>2. That there is no way to finde releaſe, but by the forgiveneſſe of
them.</item>
                  <item>3. That there is forgiveneſſe of ſinnes if men will ſeeke it.</item>
                  <item>4. There is forgiveneſſe of ſinnes without limitation of Number, bee
they never ſo many: or Quality, bee they never ſo great.</item>
                  <item>5. That God onely forgiveth ſinnes.</item>
                  <item>6. That God doth not abſolutely forgive, but it is upon condition, if
men repent them of their ſinnes.</item>
               </list>
               <p>First,<note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>Wee beleeve that all men bee ſinners both in the estate of nature, and in
the eſtate of grace,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">That all men bee ſinners.</note> for in our Chriſtian faith wee beleeve the forgiveneſſe of
ſinnes; now there can be no forgivenſſe where there is no ſinne; and Chriſt
teacheth us to pray daily for the forgiveneſſe of our ſinnes, to ſhew, that
the pardon of them is as needfull as our daily bread; even in our beſt
eſtate, <hi>Iob.</hi> 9. 3. it is ſaid, <hi>If hee will contend with him, hee cannot anſwer him
one of a thouſand;</hi> and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 143. 13. <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>enter not into judgement with
thy ſervant O Lord; for in thy ſight no fleſh is juſtified:</hi> ſo <hi>Salomon</hi> ſhewes,
1 <hi>King.</hi> 8. 4. <hi>That there is no man that ſinneth not;</hi> and <hi>Iames</hi> 3. 2. it is ſaid, <hi>In
<pb n="611" facs="tcp:17958:312"/>
many things wee ſinne all:</hi> ſo alſo 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. <hi>ult. If wee ſay wee have no ſinne, wee
deceive our ſelves and there is no truth in us.</hi> Hence then it is plaine by the
Scriptures that all men are ſinners both in the eſtate of nature and in the
eſtate of grace. And it is plaine by <hi>Reaſon</hi> alſo, for, <hi>look where the puniſhments
of ſinne bee, there is ſinne;</hi> for by order of divine Iuſtice where there is ſinne
there is the puniſhment of it. Now all men have in ſome meaſure taſted
of the puniſhments of ſinne, ſome in one kinde, ſome in another; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there is ſinne in all men. Wee ſee in experience, that if the Bayliffes
be buſie about a man,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and they arreſt him and ſtrain him in his goods, they
will ſay, ſurely this man is in debt, hee is but in a poore eſtate; ſo when the
Lords Bayliffes bee left about a man, that is, when the judgements and
puniſhments of God diſtraine us in our goods, and arreſt us, wee may
ſay, ſurely wee are in the Lords debt, our eſtate is but meane and poore.</p>
               <p>The uſe is,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> ſeeing all men bee ſinners both in the eſtate of Nature and
grace; therefore every man muſt labour for the forgiveneſſe of his ſinnes.
Wee ſee that <hi>David</hi> when he came to the ſight of his ſinnes, by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Nathan,</hi> he was not at reſt till hee had repented of them: ſo when we
are brought to the ſight of our ſinnes by any occaſion, we ſhould not be
at reſt till we have repented of them. If a man hath committed ſuch an
offence againſt the king that he is in danger of death, hee cannot bee at
reſt till he hath gotten a pardon from the king ſealed;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> which when hee
hath, hee layeth it up in his cheſt, and looketh on it many times to his
comfort; ſo when wee have ſinned againſt God, and are in danger of
death, let us not be at reſt till wee have got a pardon from God, ſealed
with the blood of Chriſt, which a man muſt lay up in his heart and look
on it at all times for his comfort.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>there is no way to finde releaſe of our ſinnes, but by forgiveneſſe;</hi>
therefore,<note place="margin">No way to have releaſe, but by forgiveneſſe of ſinnes.</note> when we have ſinned againſt God, there is nothing that can
releaſe us, neither <hi>Angell</hi> nor <hi>Archangell,</hi> but it muſt be by forgiveneſſe:
our caſe is like the ſervants, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 24. that ought a thouſand talents,
a great deale, and had nothing to pay it withall; ſo wee have a great
deale to pay unto the Lord,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and have not one halfepenny to pay him
with: we have nothing, and therefore, we are never able to ſatisfie for
it, neither is there any other way to releaſe us, but by forgiveneſſe.
The Church of Rome ſaith, that a man may ſatisfie God for many of
his owne ſinnes,<note place="margin">Object.</note> and that according to juſtice, and needeth not at all
forgiveneſſe.<note place="margin">Anſ.</note> But this is contrary to the doctrine of their owne ſchoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and Reaſon is againſt it.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Reaſons againſt Mans ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> 
                  <hi>every man that doth ſatisfie for any thing muſt doe as much good to the

                  <hi>no man can diſcharge one debt by paying another debt:</hi> But all
we doe is due debt to the Lord; for as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>When yee have done
all that ye can,</hi> ſay that <hi>We are unprofitable ſervants;</hi> therefore becauſe all
<pb n="612" facs="tcp:17958:313"/>
that we doe is due debt unto the Lord, therefore we cannot ſatisfie for
any ſinne.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Reaſon. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>ſinne hindreth the vertue of ſatisfaction;</hi> for if a man be a ſinner
he can doe nothing that is pleaſing and acceptable to God; and if a man
cannot pleaſe God, he cannot ſatisfie for any ſinne: but there is no acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
we doe, but we ſinne in it; therefore we cannot ſatisfie God for our
ſinnes. This is cleare by the Scriptures, and therefore their doctrine of
the Church of Rome is not to be beleeved. For we muſt acknowledge
when wee have ſinned, that there is no way to ſatisfie God, but by free
pardon and forgiveneſſe.</p>
               <p>But how is it free pardon and forgiveneſſe? I answer,<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> 
                  <hi>It is free in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of us:</hi> It is due in regard of Chriſt, for it coſt him three and thirty
yeeres travell in this world,<note place="margin">Anſ.</note> it coſt him his life and his blood; many
ſtreames of pure blood iſſued from him, to obtaine a pardon from God
for us. O that we could conſider this great goodneſſe of God! It is
true indeede that wee have pardon and forgiveneſſe free to us, but it is
due to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Let the uſe be,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> firſt to exhort us to take heed how wee ſinne againſt
God: If a man had a curious glaſſe, and it ſhould fall and get a cracek,
which no man in the world ſave one, could make whole againe, who
would not be hired for any thing in this world to mend all that ſhold
breake,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> though he did ſome few out of his love and good will, how af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
would a man be to let it fall? ſuch a curious glaſſe is the ſoule of
man, that if it fall, if it ſinne againſt God, it will catch a cracke, and then
there is not one in all the world that can make it, or repaire it againe,
but God onely, and he will not be hired to doe it, for ſilver or gold, or
for any thing in this world, but all hee doth is out of his love and of
meere mercy and good will to ſome few; therefore how ſhould men
take heede that they do not fall into ſinnes and corruptions, ſo to crake
their ſoules and deface them.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> ſeeing there is no way to have releaſe and pardon for our
ſinnes, but by forgiveneſſe, therefore we muſt labor to keepe God our
friend, and to take heed that wee doe not offend nor grieve him with
our ſinnes. If our life ſhould depend upon any man in ſuch ſort, as that
he might take it away at his pleaſure,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> how carefull would wee bee to
pleaſe him? we would not ſpeake a word, nor doe any thing that ſhould
offend him; the ſalvation of our ſoules depends on the Will of God,
to ſave or condemne us, it is his mercy to ſave us, and his juſtice to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
us; therefore we ſhould bee carefull to keepe God our friend,
howſoever the world doe little regard it now; yet when we ſhall come
before him, every man would bee glad at that time to have him his
friend, when he ſhall bee our Iudge, and then wee ſhall ſtand or fall, all
according to his ſentence.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>we beleeve there is forgiveneſſe of ſinnes, if men will ſeeke it:</hi> It
is true indeed,<note place="margin">That forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſinnes, is to bee had, if ſought for.</note> that all mens ſinnes are not pardoned, yet wee beleeve
if men will ſeeke forgiveneſſe, they may have it. So <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi>
32. 5. <hi>I confeſſed my ſinnes, and thou forgaveſt the puniſhment of them;</hi> ſo
<pb n="613" facs="tcp:17958:313"/>
                  <hi>Eſay</hi> 55. 7. <hi>Let the wicked forſake his waies, and the unrighteous his owne
imaginations, and returne unto the Lord, and hee will have mercie upon them,
and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.</hi> So alſo <hi>Micah</hi> 7. ſaith the
Prophet, <hi>Who is a God like unto thee, that takeſt away iniquitie, and paſſeth by
the tranſgreſſion of the remnant of his Heritage, &amp;c.</hi> So then it is cleare by the
Scripture, there is forgiveneſſe of ſins if men will ſeeke it. The uſes are.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> ſeeing there is forgiveneſſe of ſinnes if men ſeeke it, therefore
it muſt be our wiſedome to ſeeke it, and not reſt till wee have found it;
as <hi>Eſay</hi> 55. 6. (ſaith he) <hi>Seeke ye the Lord while he may be found, call yee upon
him while he is neere,</hi> and the Lord will have mercy and forgive: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
doe not live in thy ſinnes, for then thou ſhalt periſh, but ſeeke unto
God, and then they ſhall bee forgiven thee. If a man bee in danger of
the kings writ,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> if he be wiſe, he will labour to compound the matter as
ſoone as may be; ſo if wee are in Gods danger, and ſtand not in cleere
termes, Gods writs comming out againſt us from day to day, if we be
wiſe, we will ſeeke to God to compound the matter ſo ſoone as may be;
as 1 <hi>King</hi> 20. 31. when <hi>Benhadad</hi> was ſhut up, his ſervants ſaid unto him,
<hi>We have heard that the kings of Iſrael are mercifull kings,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> 
                  <hi>wee pray thee l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t us
put ſackecloth about our loynes and ropes about our neckes, and goe unto the king
of Iſrael, it may be he will ſave thy life;</hi> in like manner when we heare that
God is mercifull and ready to forgive, why doe wee not ſeeke to him,
and humble our ſelves, that ſo wee may finde mercy and favour with
God.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> ſeeing there is forgiveneſſe of ſinnes, if men will ſeeke it,
therefore we muſt take heed we fall not into the ſame ſinne againe; the
Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>There is mercy with thee O Lord, that thou mayeſt bee
feared;</hi> it is a ſtrong concluſion that <hi>David</hi> gathereth, becauſe God is
mercifull, therefore <hi>David</hi> is loth to offend God, and affraid to do evill,
hee hath found ſuch mercie and goodneſſe at his hands; but the world
frameth another concluſion cleane contrary to this, becauſe the Lord
is mercifull, therefore they will ſinne the more. Bleſſed therefore are
the People of God, who the more mercifull God is, and the more hee
loveth them, the more they labour to pleaſe him, and are affraid to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
him. If a man did lie in priſon many a cold winter, and a friend
ſhould come to him and knocke off his fetters,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> open the Priſon doore
for him, and let him out, and if any ſhould lay hold on him after that to
carry him to the Priſon againe, O how would he crie out, and be affraid
to come there any more? So wee were locked up here in the priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe
of ſinne, and have beene a long time, the Lord hath knocked off
our bolts and fetters, unlocked the priſon doore, and let us out; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if ſinne ſhould lay hold on us, to carry us backe againe, O how
ſhould we cry out for mercy and favour at Gods hands, and be grieved
that we have offended ſo good a God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Vſe 3.</note> ſeeing that there is forgiveneſſe of ſinnes if wee ſeeke it;
therefore as God is ready to forgive us, ſo we ſhould bee to forgive one
another the injuries and wrongs that are done us: This is Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition,
<hi>Col.</hi> 3. 15. (ſaith he) <hi>Forgiving one another, if any man have a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell
<pb n="614" facs="tcp:17958:314"/>
to another, even as God forgave you,</hi> ſo doe ye; <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. wee read
that there was one that ought a thouſand talents, whoſe maſter forgave
him, but his fellow owing him but an hundred pence, <hi>He tooke him by the
throat, and ſaid to him, Pay me that which thou oweſt me: to whom he ſaid, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe
thine anger towards me, and I will pay thee all; yet hee would not, but caſt
him into priſon: but when his master heard of it, hee was wroth with him, and
caſt him into priſon alſo.</hi> Now there is no man offends us ſo much as wee
doe God; therefore as God is ready to forgive us, ſo we ſhould bee to
forgive one another.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4</note> 
                  <hi>We beleeve there is forgiveneſſe of ſinnes without limitation</hi> of
the number,<note place="margin">That there is forgiveneſſe of ſinnes without limitation.</note> or greatneſſe of them; ſo that let the number bee never
ſo many, or never ſo great, if we can repent of them, they ſhall bee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given
us. So 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. 5. <hi>Theſe things I write unto you that yee ſinne not, but
if any man ſinne, wee have an advocate with the Father Ieſus Chriſt the juſt:</hi>
therefore let our ſins be what they will, if we can repent of them, God
will forgive them without limitation of the number or the greatneſſe
of them. There is but one ſinne only that ſhall not be forgiven, the ſinne
againſt the Holy Ghoſt, which is ſpoken of <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 31. <hi>Every ſinne
and blaſphemy ſhall bee forgiven unto men, but the blaſphemie againſt the Holy
Ghoſt ſhall not be forgiven unto them.</hi> So 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 16. ſaith he, <hi>there is a ſin
unto death, I doe not ſay that thou ſhalt pray for it:</hi> and <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 6. it is ſaid, <hi>If a
man hath taſted of the Word of God, and of the powers of the world to come, if
he fall away, it is impoſsible he ſhould be renewed againe by repentance.</hi> Now the
reaſon why the Lord will not pardon it is, not becauſe his mercie can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
reach it (for his mercy is infinite) but becauſe there is a defect in
men that they cannot repent of it; for this ſinne is againſt all the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of grace in them, therefore they cannot relent for it nor repent:
ſo the defect is not in God but in men, for if it were poſſible that men
could repent this ſinne, God would forgive it.</p>
               <p>The uſe of this is, ſeeing God will forgive our ſinnes, though they
be in number never ſo many,<note place="margin">Vſe.</note> and in meaſure never ſo great, if we repent
truely; therefore we ſhould repent and humble our ſelves before God
that he may forgive us. We ſee that <hi>David</hi> had committed two groſſe
and great ſinnes, yet he ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. <hi>I ſaid, I will confeſſe againſt my ſelfe
my owne wickedneſſe, and thou forgaveſt the puniſhment of them:</hi> and Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> was a great ſinner, who faith of himſelfe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 9. <hi>I am not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to be called an Apoſtle, becauſe I perſecuted the Church of God;</hi> and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi>
1. 13. (ſaith he) <hi>I was a blaſphemer, a perſecuter and an oppreſſor, but I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
to mercy, &amp;c.</hi> Therefore let no man deſpaire, though his ſinnes bee
never ſo many or ſo great, if they can repent, they ſhall finde mercy at
Gods hands: <hi>Augustine</hi> ſaith well upon <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81. (ſpeaking of the Iewes,
how that they killed and crucified Chriſt, and yet many of them were
ſaved;) this (ſaith he) is left for an example for us, that no man ſhould
deſpaire, though his ſins were never ſo great and ſo many, yet if he can
repent of them God will forgive them: for if the greateſt ſinnes were
forgiven that were committed in this world which was the killing of
Chriſt, then doe not doubt but the Lord will forgive thee thy ſinnes, if
<pb n="615" facs="tcp:17958:314"/>
thou canſt repent of them. This is the condition (as we ſhall heare more
hereafter) if we will repent our ſinnes, God will forgive them; but if
we will not accept of this condition, but ſtill live in them from day to
day, and nouriſh and keepe them in our boſomes, then doe not marvell
though God will not forgive us.</p>
               <p>The fifth thing is,<note place="margin">5</note> 
                  <hi>That none but God can forgive ſinnes,</hi> hee that raiſes
up our bodies at the day of judgement,<note place="margin">That none but God can forgive ſinnes.</note> and giveth everlaſting life, hee
it is that muſt forgive us our ſinnes; and therefore they are placed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the Articles of our Chriſtian faith: wee doe beleeve that God
will forgive us our ſinnes here, that hee will raiſe our bodies at the laſt
day, and give us life everlaſting; ſo it is God onely that muſt forgive us
our ſinnes: this is cleere both by the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and by <hi>Reaſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, by <hi>Scriptures;</hi> as <hi>Eſay</hi> 43. 25. <hi>I am he that putteth away thine iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
for mine owne ſake, and will remember thy ſinnes no more;</hi> ſo <hi>Ieremiah</hi> 31.
34. <hi>And they ſhall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his
brother,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Know ye the Lords; for they ſhall all know me from the leaſt of
them to the greateſt of them, ſaith the Lord; for I will forgive their iniquities,
and will remember their ſinnes no more:</hi> and 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 13. <hi>Nathan</hi> ſaith to
<hi>David, the Lord alſo hath put away thy ſinnes, thou ſhalt not die. David Pſal.</hi>
32. ſaith, <hi>I confeſſed my ſinnes and thou forgav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſt me the puniſhment of them:</hi>
ſo there can be no queſtion about this, but that it is God only that doth
forgive ſinnes. This was a knowne truth amongſt the Phariſes as wee
ſee <hi>Luke</hi> 5. for ſay they, <hi>None but God can forgive ſinnes.</hi> A learned man
ſpeaking of this place ſaith, that the ground was good that none but
God can forgive, but they failed in their application, for they tooke
Chriſt to be but a bare man: And it is <hi>Augustines</hi> aſſertion, The <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts</hi>
ſay, that men may forgive ſinnes, but, ſaith he, in this they are worſe
than the Phariſes, for they ſay none but God can forgive ſinnes.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Reaſon 1.</note> 
                  <hi>by Reaſon;</hi> and that firſt, <hi>Becauſe ſinne is an infinite offence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">That none but God can forgive ſinnes.</note> 
                  <hi>therefore it muſt be an infinite power that muſt take it away;</hi> for as
the Schoolemen ſay, <hi>The thing that worketh muſt be of greater power and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
than the thing that is wrought upon,</hi> but all the power that is in man is
finite, and hath his bounds and limits, therefore no man is able to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
ſinne. For as a pecke cannot hold a thouſand buſhels, ſo man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
finite cannot have infinite power;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and threfore no man is able to
take away ſinne, but God onely.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Reaſon 2.</note> it is cleare from the doctrine of their owne Schoolemen,
who ſay, <hi>that no man can take away ſin, unleſſe he be able to infuſe grace:</hi> ſo <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinas</hi>
faith, that there is no forgiveneſſe of ſins, but there muſt be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
infuſion of grace; but there is no man that can infuſe grace into any;
therefore there is no man that can take away ſin: or we may frame a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
thus, <hi>He that juſtifieth a man, he only it is that can forgive ſins; but there is
none but God that can juſtifie a man, therefore none but God can forgive ſinnes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Reaſon 3.</note> 
                  <hi>He that takes away the puniſhment of ſinne, Hee it is that muſt
take away ſinne;</hi> as Chriſt promiſed to the man ſicke of the Palſey,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 9. 6. for when Chriſt forgave him his ſinnes, hee forgave him
the puniſhment of them also; for ſaith hee unto him, <hi>Take up thy bed
<pb n="616" facs="tcp:17958:315"/>
and walke:</hi> this he giveth him as a token, that his ſinnes are pardoned; ſo
if a man can take away the puniſhment of ſinne with a word, and ſay to
a blinde man, receive thy ſight, to a lame man, goe, then a man may
pardon ſinnes; but there is no man that can take away the puniſhment
of ſinne, therefore he cannot take away ſinnes: <hi>For if Man cannot take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the effect which is the leſſer, he cannot take away the cauſe which is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:</hi>
hence then it is manifeſt that none but God can take away ſinne.</p>
               <p>Some <hi>object,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Object.</note> if there is none but God that can forgive ſinnes, why
then doth S. <hi>Paul</hi> exhort <hi>to forgive one another their ſinnes? Col.</hi> 3. 13. To
this I anſwer, <hi>that in every ſin of injustice there are two parties offended, God
and Man;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Anſ.</note> now man may forgive his part, but it is God only that muſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
his part. <hi>Levit.</hi> 6. 5, 6. it is ſaid, <hi>Whatſoever one hath ſworn falſely, he ſhall
even reſtore it in the principall, and ſhall adde the fifth part more thereto, and
give it unto him unto whom it appertaineth the ſame day he offreth for his treſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes:
Alſo he ſhall bring unto the Lord a Ramme without blemiſh out of the flocke,
in thy eſtimation worth two ſheckles, for a treſpaſſe offering to the Prieſt:</hi> Hence
I inferre, it is not enough to make ſatisfaction to man, but when we have
done with him, then wee muſt make our peace with God alſo.</p>
               <p>Againe,<note place="margin">Object.</note> it is <hi>Objected</hi> the Miniſters may forgive ſinnes in the Goſpell;
As <hi>Iohn</hi> 20. 23. ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Whoſoever ſinnes ye retaine are retained:</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere,
there is two courts that ſinne hath to deale in,<note place="margin">Anſ.</note> 
                  <hi>In foro mundi,</hi> the
Court of this World, and <hi>In foro Coeli,</hi> the Court of heaven: In the
Court of this World the Miniſter may forgive, and one Man may for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
another; but in the Court of Heaven, there is none but God that
can forgive our ſinnes.<note place="margin">Anſ. 2.</note> Moreover there is <hi>the power of remiſsion,</hi> and <hi>the
miniſtery of remiſsion:</hi> the power of remiſſion that belongs to God, for
none but he hath power to forgive; but the miniſtery of remiſſion, that
belongs to the Miniſter, hee may pronounce the forgiveneſſe of ſinnes.
As we ſee <hi>Levit.</hi> 13. In the cleanſing of the Lepers, it was God onely
that made them cleare, the Prieſt did but pronounce them cleane: So
then this point is cleare, that it is none but God that can forgive ſinnes.</p>
               <p>For uſe,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> firſt let us conſider what a grievous thing ſinne is, that none
but God can forgive and free us from it.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> We ſee how affraid men bee
to breake a legge or arme or to hurt themſelves becauſe they would
not fall into the Chirurgions hand, and yet many of them can ſet a joynt
and helpe us againe; but when a man hath ſinned, there is none in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
nor in Earth, that can helpe him, but onely God: therefore wee
ſhould be affraid to ſinne againſt Him. Wee ſee in nature that there are
ſome diſeasſes that are hard to cure;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> as the Stone, the Gout, the Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gury
and many others; notwithſtanding, the great difficulty of curing
it, yet there be ſome that can cure these; but when a man hath ſinned
againſt God, he hath done that that no man in the world can cure, but
God onely: therefore how affraid ſhould we be to commit ſinne?</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> ſeeing there is none but God can forgive ſinnes, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
when we have ſinned, wee ſhould caſt our eyes from this World
and worldly friends, and ſeeke to God for the pardon of them: Great
men may doe us ſome good when wee bee well, and our friends may
<pb n="617" facs="tcp:17958:315"/>
comfort us when wee be ſicke, but when our conſciences are dejected
for ſinne, there is none but God can give us comfort. A man may looke
upon his gold and ſilver, his goods and his lands, as a ſicke man lookes
on his meate, not taking delight in any thing,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> becauſe he lookes for the
judgement and ſentence of God to paſſe upon him; this whole world
cannot releaſe him nor give him comfort, but it muſt be God that muſt
doe it: therefore we muſt ſeeke to him for the pardon of our ſinnes, for
howſoever a man doth not feele his ſinnes in the time of ſecuritie and
peace, yet when his ſinnes ſhall come upon him and accuſe him, then he
ſhall feele them, then is the time that they ſhall ſtand in need of God:
as <hi>Iudges</hi> 10. 14. the Lord ſaith to the people, <hi>Goe and crie unto your gods
which ye have choſen, let them free you in the time of your trouble:</hi> ſo the Lord
will ſay to us in the time of our diſtresse (if we deſpiſe him in the time
of our health and peace) Goe and crie to the Gods that ye have ſerved,<note place="margin">Simile.</note>
and ſee if they can helpe you in the time of your neede; goe to your
pleaſur's and profits, and ſee if they can help you; we ſee that ſuch a time
will come that we ſhall ſtand in neede of his helpe: therefore let us
ſeeke for it in time, while we may have it. Wee ſay at this time, wee
have neede of raine, but can your Kings and Queenes give it? can your
Princes and Nobles? no, none can doe it but God: therefore we muſt
have recourſe to him for it,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and ſeeke it at his hands. If a man dwell by
the Sea ſide, where there is a great banke betweene him and the Sea,
the Shippes paſſe by and all the commodities, none whereof can bee
brought unto him, but if he can digge downe the banke and cut a ſluce
through into the Sea, then hee may bring the commodities home to
himſelfe; ſo we dwell by an infinite Sea of Gods goodneſſe, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a great banke between us and that, which is a banke of ſinne; ſo
that all the commodities, goodneſſe and mercie of God paſſeth by us,
therefore wee muſt digge downe this banke of ſinne and make a ſluce
through by prayer and repentance, ſo to draw Gods goodneſſe and
mercy home to our ſelves; and ſeeing there is none but God can forgive
us our ſinnes, let us keepe God our friend, and if wee have at any time
offended him, let us not be at reſt till we have ſought his favour againe,
and feele the comfort of the pardon and forgiveneſſe of our ſinnes.</p>
               <p>Sixthly,<note place="margin">6</note> 
                  <hi>God doth not abſolutely forgive men their ſinnes without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
but it is upon condition, if they will repent:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gods pardon is conditionally, if men repent.</note> It is such a condition, that
we cannot have pardon of our ſinnes without it; It is <hi>not the cauſe</hi> of it,
but <hi>it is a neceſſary condition,</hi> whereby wee are made fit and capable of
Heaven and Heavenly things: theſe two goe together, repentance and
forgiveneſſe of ſinnes; these Chriſt hath conveyed together here in
this Scripture that I read unto you, <hi>that repentance and remiſſion of ſinnes
ſhould be preached in his Name:</hi> ſo <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 15. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>Amend your lives
therefore and turne, that your ſinnes may be put away:</hi> If wee will repent of
them, renounce them, and labour to get ſtrength againſt them, then
God will forgive them; but if we will not repent of them nor renounce
them, but live in them and nouriſh them in our boſomes, then wee can
looke for no forgiveneſſe: there are thouſands that doe deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="618" facs="tcp:17958:316"/>
ſelves this way, who thinke that forgiveneſſe of ſinnes is abſolute,
though they doe nothing but live as they liſt, yet God will forgive
them; but we are to know it is conditionall, if we doe repent of them.
And therefore let all men take heed that they doe not deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in this. Thus much of the <hi>generall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now we come to the <hi>particular;</hi> for we are not to reſt in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,<note place="margin">Of particular forgiveneſſe of ſinnes.</note>
to be perſwaded that there is forgiveneſſe of ſinnes, but wee muſt
beleeve in particular that my ſinnes are pardoned; for what confeſſion
is it for a man to beleeve there is forgiveneſſe of ſinnes in generall, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
he be able to ſay, I doe beleeve that my ſinnes are pardoned. This
is that Chriſt ſaith in the Goſpell to the poore man, <hi>Bee of good comfort,
thy ſinnes are forgiven thee:</hi> in like manner if a man know that his ſinnes
are pardoned, here is matter of comfort; as 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 13. <hi>Nathan</hi> ſaith
to <hi>David, The Lord hath put away thy ſinnes, and thou ſhalt not die;</hi> ſo <hi>Pſal.</hi>
32. 7. <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>I ſaid, I will confeſſe my ſinnes unto the Lord, and thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaveſt
the puniſhment of mine iniquitie:</hi> ſo <hi>Ananias</hi> ſaith to <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 22.
16. <hi>Ariſe and be baptized, and waſh away thy ſinnes in calling upon his Name.</hi>
Therefore a man muſt not reſt in the generall, but he muſt bring it home
to himſelfe, and bee perſwaded that his ſinnes are forgiven him. It is
the doctrine of the Church of Rome, to beleeve that there is pardon
and forgiveneſſe of ſinnes in generall, but not in particular; but in this
their faith is no better than the faith of Divels; for they doe beleeve
that there is a God and Chriſt, and that there is forgiveneſſe of ſins, but
they doe not beleeve that their ſins are pardoned. Now the faith of a
Chriſtian muſt goe beyond the faith of Divels, and apply it to his owne
conſcience and heart, being perſwaded that his ſinnes are pardoned: a
man is not ſo to beleeve that his ſins are pardoned in any eſtate whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
as when he is an infidell, before a man is brought home to God and
hath repented of his ſins; but when hee is brought home to God, and in
the ſtate of grace, by holy praier and repentance for his ſinnes, when hee
hath beene humbled and caſt down in the ſenſe and feeling of them, and
grieved that he hath offended God, then a man may be perſwaded of it.</p>
               <p>But here a great queſtion may bee mooved,<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> how a man may know
that his ſinnes are pardoned, ſeeing it is not an act of ours, but it is in the
heart and minde of God.<note place="margin">Anſ.</note> I anſwer, that the worke of Creation was an
act in the heart and minde of God,<note place="margin">Generall.</note> and not in Man; yet it was made
knowne to us <hi>by his workes,</hi> and <hi>by the effect of it:</hi> ſo though forgiveneſſe
of ſinnes is an act in the heart and minde of God, yet a man may know
it by the comfortable effects that doth follow it,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſo that a man may have
unfallible teſtimonies that his ſinnes are forgiven him.</p>
               <p>Now there are foure meanes whereby a man may know that his ſins
are pardoned.<note place="margin">In Particular. Foure wayes to know our ſinnes are pardoned.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, to conſider whether ever we have been caſt down and humbled
in the ſenſe and feeling of them,<note place="margin">Firſt, if humbled for them.</note> &amp; if we have repented of them, and bin
grieved and diſpleaſed with our ſelves, not ſo much for the puniſhment
that hath fallen on them, as that we have grieved and offended God by
them; if we can finde this in our ſelves this is a ſure teſtimonie to us that
<pb n="619" facs="tcp:17958:316"/>
our ſinnes are pardoned, and that the Lord ſaith to us (as he ſaid to the
lame man) <hi>Matth.</hi> 9. <hi>Sonne, be of good comfort, thy ſinnes be forgiven thee:</hi>
Wee ſee the woman that was a great ſinner, <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 37. comming to
Chriſt, fell downe at his feete, wept and waſhed his feet with her tears,
and did wipe them with the haire of her head, to whom Chriſt ſaid,
<hi>thy ſinnes are forgiven thee;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſo although we be great ſinners, yet if we can
fall downe at the feete of Chriſt and weepe, becauſe we have ſinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
God, who hath beene ſo good and gratious unto us, then the
Lord will ſay to us, as hee ſaid to the woman, Thy ſinnes are forgiven
thee.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> to conſider with our ſelves, whether ever we have prayed
unto the Lord for the forgiveneſſe of them:<note place="margin">If prayed hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily for forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> if we have cried unto God,
and beſought him to pardon and to paſſe by them; if thou canſt finde
this, then doubt not but thy ſinnes are pardoned: As <hi>Marke</hi> 11. 22.
Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Whatſoever ye deſire when ye pray, beleeve that ye ſhall have it and
it ſhall be done unto you:</hi> and 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 5. <hi>This is the aſſurance that wee have in
him, that if we aske any thing according to his Will he heareth us:</hi> therefore,
if we have prayed unto God, and ſought unto him for the pardon of
them, let us not doubt, but bee perſwaded that our ſinnes are forgiven
us. As <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. the ſervant that was indebted to his maſter, and had
nothing to pay, his maſter forgave him all becauſe he prayed him; ſo if
we can pray unto the Lord and ſeeke unto him for the forgiveneſſe, the
Lord will forgive us; but if we have never ſought unto him, nor pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for the forgiveneſſe of them, then wee cannot bee aſſured of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe
of them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> to conſider with himſelfe whether hee hath got grace and
ſtrength to reſiſt it;<note place="margin">Whether wee have got ſtrength againſt them.</note> for the Lord dealeth with us, as hee did with the
lame man, when he had forgiven him his ſinnes, in token of it, hee bids
him take up his bed and walke; and withall he giveth ſtrength to carry
his bed: ſo if the Lord have pardoned our ſinnes, and forgiven them,<note place="margin">Simile.</note>
he will give us ſtrength to carry our bed home; as a good man ſaith, he
will give us ſtrength to carry our bodies in a holy courſe to Heaven; he
will give us ſtrength and grace to reſiſt our ſinnes: Therefore if we doe
not finde ſtrength and grace to reſiſt ſinne, but live in it and like it, then
we may doubt whether wee have pardon of them or no? Some man
will here object and ſay,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> if a man have committed Treaſon againſt the
the king, and bee caſt into the Gaole,<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> how ſhall a man know whether
his friend hath got a pardon for him or no? I anſwer, If the Iaylor come
and unlocke the priſon doore,<note place="margin">Anſ.</note> knocke off his chaines and fetters, and let
him out, then he is ſure his pardon is procured; but if he lie ſtill in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
then it is likely there is no pardon: ſo when wee have ſinned and
committed treaſon againſt God, and he caſt us into the priſon houſe of
ſinne, how ſhall a man know whether hee hath a pardon procured for
him or no? I anſwer, If a man ſee that the chaines and fetters of ſinne
are taken off, and the Priſon doore opened, that is, if a man findes that
he hath got ſtrength and power againſt his corruptions, and can ſhake
them off, he may aſſure himſelfe that his ſinnes are pardoned; but if he
<pb n="620" facs="tcp:17958:317"/>
lies in his ſinnes, and ſtill his corruptions bee ſtrong upon him, neither
hath he got power and ſtrength againſt them, nor made God his friend,
then as yet his ſinnes are not pardoned.</p>
               <p>The fourth meanes whereby wee may know that our ſinnes are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
is,<note place="margin">4</note> to conſide with ones ſelfe if his heart hath beene ſet at peace
by the uſe of good meanes,<note place="margin">If wee have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Spirit.</note> whereas before hee hath beene troubled in
conſcience for his ſinnes; if he hath repented of them and prayed unto
God for the pardon of them; if his heart hath beene ſet at peace in the
uſe of theſe meanes, hee may aſſure himſelfe that his ſinnes are pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
this is <hi>Pauls</hi> Reaſon, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1. <hi>Then being juſtified by faith, wee have
peace towards God through our Lord Ieſus Chriſt;</hi> therefore if a man can finde
peace in his conſcience upon the uſe of good meanes this is an evidence
that his ſinnes are pardoned. If a man be run in debt and danger,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and the
kings writs be out againſt him, the Bayliffes lying in every buſh to take,
arreſt, and carry him into priſon, ſo that he cannot be at reſt nor quiet for
them: now if this partie hath a friend to go to London to compound the
matter and to agree it; the queſtion is how a man ſhall know whether his
friend hath compoſed the matter or no? I anſwer, if the Bailiffes be gone
home againe, and the man at reſt and quiet againe, by this hee may bee
ſure that his friend hath compoſed and agreed the matter. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
when we are runne in the Briers of debt and danger, and heare that
Gods writs are out againſt us, the judgements of God lying in every
buſh (as it were like Bayliffes) to arreſt us and carry us to priſon; if we
can ſend a friend to compoſe the matter, and agree it; that is, if we can
ſend our prayers up to Heaven, to compoſe the matter with God; if
upon this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> one finde his conſcience to bee ſet at peace, and the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God to ceaſe and be removed from him, this is a comfortable
evidence that his ſinnes are pardoned: therefore although a man may
bee a ſinner, yet if a man can repent of them, and finde by comfortable
effects that his ſinnes are pardoned, hee ſhall have comfort both in life
and death; and when he hath lived here a few dayes in this world, ſhall
goe home to God, to live with <hi>Abraham, Iſaak</hi> and <hi>Iaakob,</hi> in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Heaven.</p>

time of Forgiveneſſe of ſinnes, but upon further
meditation, there is ſomething more that I muſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
unto you, which is, To know <hi>what that comfort is,
that a Chriſtian man may have,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Queſt.</note> 
                  <hi>when hee beleeves his ſins
are pardoned,</hi> and that he is acquitted and diſcharged
for them before the judgement ſeat of God.<note place="margin">Anſ.</note> I anſwer,
that the comfort is exceeding great: Firſt, becauſe if a man knowes by
infallible evidence that his ſinnes are pardoned,<note place="margin">Three comfortts of forgiveneſſe of ſinnes.</note> 
                  <hi>then he knowes he ſhall bee
ſaved, and death ſhall be as no death to him;</hi> and that after this life hee ſhall
goe into Heaven to glory and happineſſe.<note place="margin">1</note> Seeing nothing can hinder
a man from Heaven but ſinne;<note place="margin">Knowledge of Salvation.</note> as it is <hi>Revel.</hi> 21. <hi>ult. And there ſhall enter
in no uncleane thing:</hi> Therefore if we know that our ſinnes are pardoned,
we may be comforted; for as ſoone as we leave this world, we ſhall goe
to God. As <hi>Luke</hi> 23. as ſoone as the good Theefe had obtained pardon
for his ſinnes, the next thing that Chriſt ſaith to him, is, <hi>This day ſhalt
thou be with me in Paradiſe;</hi> and therefore if we know that our ſinnes are
pardoned, then we know wee ſhall be ſaved; and wee ſhall goe into the
Kingdome of Heaven.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> if our ſinnes bee pardoned, then <hi>wee know that all that God
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

troubles and afflictions here in this life, he puts into our hands as it were
ſecretly a peece of ſugar, that is, an aſſurance that all the troubles and
afflictions of this life are ſent in love to us, and that they ſhall not hurt

                  <pb n="622" facs="tcp:17958:318"/>
Thirdly,<note place="margin">ART. XI.</note> 
                  <hi>Then we know that as God hath taken away our ſinne, hee will take
away the taile which followes it,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3</note> that is, <hi>the puniſhment of ſinne:</hi> for the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
of ſinne followeth the act of it,<note place="margin">That with the pardon of ſinne the puniſhment of them is remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</note> as the ſhadow doth the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
for if we would remove the ſhadow, wee muſt remove the body:
ſo God when he doth remove the body of ſinne, then the ſhadow muſt
needs follow it. We read <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. that when they brought a lame man
to Chriſt, the firſt thing that he ſaith to him is, <hi>Sonne, thy ſinnes are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given
thee;</hi> after which the next words are, <hi>Take up thy bed and walke:</hi> So
when the Lord takes away our ſinnes, he will take away the puniſhment
of ſinne. Therefore in all the croſſes and troubles that befall us, we are
not to deale with the ſhadow, but with the body of ſinne; if we remove
that, we may be ſure the ſhadow will be removed. Theſe be the three
comforts that a man may have by the knowledge of forgiveneſſe of his
ſinnes; therefore it is a good thing for a man to know in particular that
his ſinnes are forgiven.</p>
               <p>Now wee come to ſpeake of the other two bleſſings and benefits
which the Lord doth give and grant to the Church in the life to come:<note place="margin">2</note>
and the one is,<note place="margin">Benefit of the Life to come.</note> 
                  <hi>The raiſing of our bodies at the laſt day;</hi> the other, <hi>Life
everlaſting:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Body.</note> and theſe two bleſſings he hath reſerved till the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
cloſing up and making an end of all with them; yet not a finall
end, for they ſhall have no end becauſe the Lord will beſtow eternall
happineſſe on them; ſo that that day (though it be a dolefull day to
others) yet it ſhall be a joyfull day to the Church of God, and a day that
they have many a day looked for and deſired.</p>
               <p>Now in handling of it we are firſt to conſider, <hi>The order of Gods diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution</hi>
that he giveth us,<note place="margin">The Order that God takes in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving us bleſſings.</note> Firſt, the benefits and bleſſings of this life, and
then thoſe of eternall life. Hence we are inſtructed that <hi>that which is the
order of Gods diſtribution, muſt be the order in our intention;</hi> for wee muſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor
to have communion with the ſaints here in this life, and to have our
ſinnes pardoned, and then the Lord will raiſe up our bodies at the laſt
day, and give us life everlaſting: but on the contrary if wee have not
communion with the Saints in this life, and have not our ſinnes pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
we can never looke that God will raiſe up our bodies at the day of
Iudgement, and give us life everlaſting. Therefore, beloved brethren,
be exhorted to labour to have communion with the Saints here in this
World, with the forgiveneſſe of ſinnes, and then God will raiſe up our
bodies at the day of judgement, and give us life everlaſting. As <hi>Revel.</hi>
20. 6. it is ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed and holy is he that hath his part in the firſt Reſurrection,
for on ſuch the ſecond death ſhall have no power:</hi> Hee is a bleſſed man that
riſeth out of his ſinnes and his corruptions in this life, on ſuch a one the
ſecond death ſhall have no power.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> If a man make a bargaine, and giveth
ſomewhat in hand, ſome earneſt, then he expecteth the performance of
covenants about the bargaine; but if he hath no earneſt given him, then
he lookes for no bargaine: ſo the Lord hath made a bargaine with us to
give us Heaven and happineſſe, after which if hee hath given us earneſt
(ſomewhat in hand in this life) that is, the communion of Saints, and
the forgiveneſſe of ſinnes; now then wee may looke to have our bodies
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:17958:318"/>
raiſed and to have life everlaſting. We may expect the reſt, but if wee
have no earneſt in hand in this life, that wee have not our parts in the
Communion of Saints, nor the forgiveneſſe of ſinnes, then when wee
come to die, we cannot looke for the bleſſings in the life to come.</p>
               <p>Moreover,<note place="margin">1</note> in this Article we are to conſider divers particulars. Firſt,
<hi>We beleeve that although we ſhall be laid into the grave and diſſolved into duſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Wee beleeve to riſe againe.</note>
                  <hi>yet that one day we ſhall riſe againe by the power of Chriſt:</hi> this is the property
of a Chriſtians faith. The Heathen doe beleeve that they ſhall all dye
and bee diſſolved to duſt, but not that they ſhall riſe againe: now this
point of the Reſurrection is cleare by <hi>Scripture,</hi> and <hi>by Reaſon:</hi> Firſt, we
will prove it by <hi>Scripture,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1</note> as <hi>Eſay</hi> 26. 19.<note place="margin">Proofe by the Scriptures.</note> 
                  <hi>Thy dead men ſhall live, even with
my Body ſhall they riſe;</hi> that is, when I riſe all the dead ſhall riſe: ſo <hi>Dan.</hi>
12. 2. and many of them that ſlept in the duſt ſhall awake, ſome to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
life, and ſome to ſhame and perpetuall contempt: ſo alſo <hi>Paul
Acts</hi> 24. 15. ſaith, <hi>And have hope towards God, that the Reſurrection of the dead
which they themſelves looke for, ſhall be both of the juſt and unjuſt:</hi> and ſo <hi>Revel.</hi>
20. 12. ſaith he, <hi>I ſaw the dead both great and ſmall ſtand before God:</hi> ſo then
it is cleare by Scripture, ſeeing all other things are come to paſſe which
the Scripture hath foretold: then wee may bee ſure that this ſhall come
to paſſe alſo, in the time that God hath appointed. Now the Reaſons
to proove that there is a Reſurrection,<note place="margin">Reaſons proving the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> are five in number:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. From the Power of God.</item>
                  <item>2. From the Iuſtice of God.</item>
                  <item>3. From the Mercie of God.</item>
                  <item>4. From the End of Chriſts comming.</item>
                  <item>5. From the Reſurrection of Chriſt.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>From the Power of God;</hi> for (as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith) it ſeemes a harder
matter for God to make a man being nothing,<note place="margin">From the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of God.</note> out of the duſt of the
Earth, than to raiſe and repaire him out of the duſt being ſomething;
and no queſtion but that the Power of God is able to raiſe the dead at
the reſurrection; as our Saviour reaſoneth againſt the Phariſes, <hi>Matth.</hi>
22. 29. ſaith he, <hi>Ye erre not knowing the Scripture nor the power of God, &amp;c.</hi>
as who ſhould ſay, the Lord hath Power to raiſe the dead.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Reaſon is drawne from the <hi>Iustice of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2</note> for it is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to Iuſtice, that thoſe that bee partakers in good and evill actions,<note place="margin">It is cleare alſo from the Iuſtice of God.</note>
ſhould be alſo partakers in rewards and puniſhments; but the bodies of
men are partners in good and evill actions with the ſoule; therefore the
Lord will raiſe up the bodies of men to reward them that have done
well, and puniſh them that have done evill. <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith well, <hi>Wee
muſt not thinke that God is unjuſt or ſlothfull:</hi> Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> we may not thinke that
God is unjuſt, that he will reward the ſoule, and deſtroy the body; and
that he will puniſh the ſoule and not the body: therefore hee will raiſe
up mens bodies to reward them that have done well, and to puniſh the
evill.<note place="margin">2</note> Againe, ſecondly, we muſt not thinke that God is ſlothfull, that
he will not put himſelfe to that paines, to raiſe up the dead bodies of
men, to puniſh them for their ſinnes and offences; therefore hee will
raiſe our bodies to puniſh or reward them with our ſoules.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="624" facs="tcp:17958:319"/>
Thirdly, <hi>From the Mercie of God:</hi> for mercy extends as much as may
be to all,<note place="margin">3</note> and this mercy is in men, that if they could, they would raiſe
all the dead bodies of their friends;<note place="margin">From the mercy of God.</note> but the mercy of God is infinitely
greater than the mercy that is in men, whoſe mercie extends in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
to all the bodies and ſoules of men: therefore hee will raiſe them
and doe all the good he can to them he loveth; as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Matth.</hi>
22. He is the God of <hi>Abraham, Iſaak</hi> and <hi>Iaakob, Hee is not the God of the
dead, but of the living:</hi> So he will raiſe their bodies, or elſe he were God
but to one part of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but his mercy extends to both parts: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he will raiſe the bodies of dead men.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4</note> 
                  <hi>From the end of Chriſts comming,</hi> which was to diſſolve the
workes of the Divell;<note place="margin">From the end of Chriſts comming</note> as it is ſaid, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 8. <hi>For this purpoſe appeared the
Sonne of God, that he might diſſolve the workes of the Divell:</hi> for the Divell
firſt brought in ſinne, and ſinne brought death; this was his end: for he
brought in ſinne to bring death upon us. And therefore becauſe hee
aimed at this, Chriſt came to diſſolve this great worke of the Divell
which is not done, except there be a reſurrection of the body: therefore
the dead ſhall riſe againe.</p>
               <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5</note> 
                  <hi>From the Reſurrection of Chriſt;</hi> for hee did not riſe like a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Perſon,<note place="margin">From the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Chriſt.</note> as <hi>the Widdowes Sonne</hi> did, and as <hi>Lazarus;</hi> but <hi>He roſe as the
publike Head of the Church.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>That Hee was the firſt fruits of
them that ſlept:</hi> ſo in the riſing of Chriſt, all the People of God did vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
riſe; that which went before in the Head, ſhall follow in the
Members (as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith;) and <hi>Cyril</hi> ſaith well that Chriſt entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Heaven by the narrow paſſage of his ſufferings and death, to make a
wide paſſage for us into Heaven: ſo in Chriſts riſing, we riſe.</p>
               <p>I,<note place="margin">Object.</note> but ſome ſay, <hi>It was an eaſie matter for Chriſt to riſe, becauſe He was God:</hi>
I anſwer,<note place="margin">Anſ.</note> it was a hard matter for Chriſt to riſe againe after he was laid
into the grave; I do not meane it was hard becauſe they had laid a great
ſtone upon Him (as the woman ſaid) <hi>Who ſhall rowle away this ſtone?</hi> but
it was hard in regard of another thing; for when any man is laid into
the Grave, he hath but his owne ſinnes to keepe him downe, but Chriſt
had the ſinnes of all the Elect People of God upon Him: Therefore it
was a harder matter for Chriſt to riſe, than for a private man, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding,
for all this Chriſt did riſe againe: Therefore doe thou
never doubt but that He will raiſe thee againe; onely our care muſt bee
to have Communion with Chriſt in his life and death, to live as He li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
to die and to lie in the Grave with Him, even to lay our bodies as
neere His as may be, with deſire to make our bodies as it were a pillow
for Him: and then when He riſeth, we ſhall riſe with Him to glory and
happineſſe. But if we doe not live the life of Chriſt, and die with Him,
and lie in the Grave with Him, and make our bodies a pillow for Him;
then Chriſt ſhall riſe, and raiſe us to torments. It were well with the
wicked if it might be ſo, that they ſhould never riſe againe, but Chriſt
ſhall raiſe them againe not as a Head, but as a terrible and fearefull
Iudge; and ſhall ſend them into endleſſe torments. For when a man
hath lived a thouſand yeeres in it, hee is as new to beginne as ever hee
<pb n="625" facs="tcp:17958:319"/>
was; therefore doe thou labour to have communion with Chriſt in his
life and death, that ſo thou mayeſt riſe and goe into glory with him.</p>
               <p>Now there are divers objections that the Atheiſts make againſt this
Article to be anſwered:</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> they ſay, <hi>How is it poſsible that men that have lien rotting in the
Grave a thouſand yeeres together,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Obiection of the Atheists.</note> 
                  <hi>ſhould riſe againe?</hi> I anſwer, <hi>Though it bee
above reaſon, it is not againſt reaſon;</hi> for we ſee that the flies that bee dead
all the Winter time,<note place="margin">Anſ.</note> when the Summer commeth, with the heat of the
Sunne they revive againe:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> if this may bee done by the power of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
much more is the power of God able to raiſe dead men that
have lien dead in the Grave many thouſand yeeres together.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Object. 2.</note> ſay they, <hi>It is impoſsible for men to riſe againe, becauſe their duſt
is mingled one with another, and with the duſt of other Creatures:</hi> as let one
come into the Churchyard, and the duſt is ſo mingled one with another
that a man cannot ſay, this is the duſt of my father, or of my mother;
for (to make it plaine) take a pint of milke, and a pint of water, and put
them into the Sea, there they remaine in their ſubſtance, but are ſo
mingled together, as that they cannot be parted one with another: ſo
ſay they it is with dead men, whoſe duſt is ſo mingled one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as it is impoſſible to ſunder them. To this I anſwer, that although
it is impoſſible for man to doe it,<note place="margin">Anſ.</note> yet (as God ſaith) <hi>All things are poſsible
to God;</hi> it is an eaſie matter to him to give to every man his duſt againe,
and to ſunder them one from another: As a man that hath a handfull of
divers ſeeds in his hand,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> can take one ſeede from another; ſo the Lord
is able to take one duſt from another, and give unto every man that
which belongeth to him. I have heard there bee ſome men that have
this cunning and skill,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> that they can draw out of an Hearbe the foure
Elements, <hi>Fire, Ayre, Earth</hi> and <hi>Water;</hi> if this cunning and skill be in man
to draw this out of an Hearbe, and to ſunder the foure Elements, much
more is God able to ſunder every mans duſt, and to bring them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
againe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Object. 3.</note> the Atheiſts object and ſay, <hi>no man may eate the fleſh of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
man, for then the mans fleſh is become one with the other mans fleſh, and then
if the one riſe the other cannot.</hi> To this I anſwer, that it is true indeed, but
yet he was a perfect man before he ate him,<note place="margin">Anſ.</note> for it is a truth in Divinitie,
that every man ſhall riſe againe with his own fleſh; but, <hi>a man ſhall not riſe
with every thing that was once a part of him;</hi> as if a man have a tooth bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
out, and another come in the Roome of it, hee ſhall not riſe with
both theſe; ſo likewiſe a man hath a peece of fleſh ſtricken off with a<note place="margin">Simile.</note>
ſword in place, whereof new fleſh comes, hee ſhall not riſe with all this,
but hee ſhall with ſo much as ſhall make him a perfect man; ſo one man
eats another mans fleſh, and it becomes one with his; yet he ſhall not riſe
with that fleſh, but with aſmuch as ſhall make him a perfect man againe.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Object. 4.</note> they bring Scripture againſt us, <hi>that fleſh and bloud cannot
enter into the kingdome of heaven.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Anſ.</note> I anſwer, the meaning is not that the
ſubſtance of fleſh and bloud ſhall enter into the kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
but that <hi>fleſh as it is corrupted and ſinnefull, cloathed with infirmities, and
<pb n="626" facs="tcp:17958:320"/>
ſubject to mortality and death,</hi> ſhall not enter into heaven; ſo <hi>Paul</hi> takes it
<hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>Foraſmuch then as the Children are partakers of fleſh and bloud, hee
alſo himſelfe likewiſe tooke part with them, that he might deſtroy through death
him that had the power of death, &amp;c.</hi> therefore the meaning is, that fleſh
and bloud in this tranſitory eſtate, (ſubject to infirmity) ſhall not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into the kingdome of God; thus wee ſee that notwithſtanding all
the objections of the Atheiſts this Article ſtands good, <hi>the dead ſhall riſe
againe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The uſe is, ſeeing the dead ſhall riſe againe, therefore though we dye
as others doe,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> are laid into the grave and diſſolved to duſt, yet <hi>wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
that wee ſhall riſe againe.</hi> This is the worſt that the world can doe to
us, to take away life, yet when they have done ſo, we ſhall have it againe,
that muſt comfort us in all our troubles and diſtreſſes, which did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<hi>Iob</hi> in his diſtreſſes and troubles, <hi>Iob</hi> 12. <hi>For I am ſure that my Redeemer
liveth, and he ſhall ſtand the laſt upon this Earth, and though after my skinne
wormes deſtroy my body, yet ſhall I ſee God in my fleſh, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>David</hi> did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
himſelfe thus, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 16. <hi>Wherefore my heart is glad and tongue rejoyceth,
and my fleſh alſo resteth in hope, for thou wilt not leave my ſoule in the grave,
neither wilt thou let thy holy one to ſee corruption;</hi> ſo Chriſt ſaith to his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 20. 19. <hi>The Sonne of man ſhall bee delivered unto the chiefe
Prieſts, and unto the Scribes, and they ſhall condemne him to death, and deliver
him to the Gentiles to ſcourge and to crucifie him, but the third day hee ſhall riſe
againe.</hi> Now that which was <hi>Iobs, Davids</hi> and Chriſts comfort muſt bee
ours in all the troubles and diſtreſſes that befall us: it was a comfort to
old <hi>Iaakob, Gen.</hi> 46. 3. that the Lord ſaid unto him, <hi>Feare not to goe downe
into Egypt, &amp;c.</hi> ſo the Lord ſaith to his people, feare not to goe into the
ground,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> into the dennes of death; for I will raiſe you up againe: death
dealeth no otherwiſe with us, than <hi>David</hi> did by <hi>Saul</hi> (when hee was
aſleepe) he tooke away his ſpeare and water-pot, and when hee was to
awake he reſtored it againe: ſo death takes away our ſpeare, our water-pot,
our ſtrength, and when we doe awake at the day of Iudgement hee
will give it us againe.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> ſeeing the dead ſhall riſe againe, this therefore muſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
us in regard of our dead friends that bee departed, that although
death hath ſundred them for a time, yet they ſhall all meete together
againe: ſo wee ſee here in this place <hi>Martha</hi> ſaith to Chriſt, <hi>I know
that my brother ſhall riſe in the reſurrection:</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.
14. <hi>Them that ſleepe in Ieſus will God bring with him.</hi> Againe, the Apoſtle
ſaith in the ſame Chapter, <hi>Comfort your ſelves with theſe words. Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome</hi>
ſaith, if a man take a long journey, his wife and his children doe
not weepe and take on,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> becauſe they know hee will come againe to
them; ſo (ſaith he) a man that dieth in Chriſt, takes but a long journey,
and therefore wee ſhould not weepe and take on for our dead friends,
becauſe they know that wee ſhall meet againe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, ſeeing that the dead ſhall riſe againe, this muſt make us care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to ſpend our time well while wee live here:<note place="margin">Vſe 3.</note> if there were an utter
deſtruction of nature that a man died as a beaſt, then a man might live as
<pb n="627" facs="tcp:17958:320"/>
he liſt;<note place="margin">SERMON LXXIII.</note> but becauſe wee ſhall riſe againe with theſe bodies, wherewith
wee have ſinned and offended God; therefore wee ſhould bee carefull
to paſſe our time here in holineſſe before God. This was the uſe that
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> makes of it, <hi>Act.</hi> 24. 16. ſaith hee, <hi>And have hope toward God
that the reſurrection of the dead (which they themſelves looke for) ſhall be both of
the juſt and unjuſt: and herein I endeavour my ſelfe to have a cleere conſcience
towards God and towards man;</hi> therefore let us labour to ſpend our time
well and in the feare of God, that ſo we may then ſtand with comfort
before God. We read <hi>Ioh.</hi> 21. 7. <hi>When Simon Peter heard it was the Lord,
he girded his coate unto him (for he was naked) and caſt himſelfe into the Sea;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note>
One would have thought that rather he ſhould have put off his garment
and have laid it aſide, but <hi>Peter</hi> had this conſideration that (when hee
came on the other ſide) he ſhould ſtand before his maſter, therefore he
girded himſelfe that hee might ſtand ſeemely and comely before him:
ſo ſeeing when wee have paſſed the glaſſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſea of this world, wee are to
ſtand before God, therefore we are to have this conſideration that wee
gird our ſelves and make every thing ready that we may come ſeemely
and holily before God at the laſt day. To this purpoſe it is a good medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
that Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> hath, O my body (ſaith he) doe not hinder thy
reconcilement with thy God, bee not a meanes to hinder thy owne
peace, be contented alwayes to labour with thy ſoule and to obey the
motions of it, be ready to aſſiſt it in any Chriſtian duties; and then ſay
unto thy ſoule when it is ready to depart from thee, and to goe to God
(which is thy gueſt) as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> ſaid to the <hi>Butler; Make mention of mee to
Pharaoh;</hi> ſo remember me to God, for I obey thy good motions, I joyne
with thee in holy duties, and then when thy ſoule is come home to
God, it will ſay, O my Lord, I had a poore body which led me in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
duties, and was ready to obey thy good motions, O my Lord, I
pray thee remember this poore body of mine, and then what will bee
the iſſue? ſurely that which is ſet downe <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 145. 19. <hi>Hee will fulfill
the deſire of them that feare him, he will alſo heare their cry and will ſave them;</hi>
therefore let us labour to paſſe our time in holineſſe and feare before
God in this life, that wee may come to peace and happineſſe at the laſt
day.</p>
               <p>The ſecond point is,<note place="margin">Secondly, we ſhall riſe again<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> with the ſame bodies.</note> that wee beleeve that we ſhall riſe againe at the
laſt day with the ſame bodies, as <hi>Iob</hi> 19. 25. <hi>I know that my redeemer li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth,
and he ſhall ſtand the laſt on the earth, and though after this life wormes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
this body, yet ſhall I ſee God with my fleſh:</hi> ſo <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. to the ſame dead
and dry bones life came, ſinnewes and fleſh grew on them. But ſome
will ſay, that is a parable; I anſwer, the Prophet uſeth not this parable
for nothing, but it is to ſhew that that which falleth ſhall riſe againe; ſo
<hi>Revel.</hi> 20. 12. <hi>I ſaw the dead both great and ſmall ſtand before God: Tertulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
ſaith, the ſame body ſhall riſe againe by the new reſurrection; for
the reſurrection is not of another body, but of the ſame that falleth;
ſo it is not a new Creation but a raiſing up that which is fallen: Saint <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi>
ſaith, it cannot ſtand with equity and right that one body ſhould
ſinne, and another bee puniſhed; neither will a juſt Iudge let one body
<pb n="628" facs="tcp:17958:321"/>
obtaine the victory and ſhed his bloud, another crowned for it, but the
ſame body that ſinned ſhall be puniſhed; the ſame that hath gotten the
victory, ſhal have the Crowne; the ſame body ſhall riſe againe. In the
Reſurrection of Chriſt, the ſame body that was wounded did riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine:
He could (if it had pleaſed him) have healed his wounds in three
dayes, ſeeing that he could heale all diſeaſes and ſickneſſes with a word
or a touch of his finger; but he let them alone, to confirme his Diſciples
that it was the ſame body that was crucified: therefore <hi>Luk.</hi> 28. When
his Diſciples thought that he had beene a Spirit, hee bids them handle
and feele him, for a Spirit hath not fleſh and bones; and therefore the
ſame body that died, did riſe againe: ſo it ſhall be with us, for that which
is true in the Head, is alſo true in the Members.</p>
               <p>Here ſome few objections ſhall be refelled,<note place="margin">Object. 1.</note> and then we will proceed;
that 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 44. the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>It is ſowne a naturall body, it is raiſed a
ſpirituall body;</hi> therefore it is not the ſame body that was laid downe.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, that <hi>it is not ſpirituall in regard of ſubstance,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Anſ. 1.</note> but it is
a Spirituall body, <hi>in regard of estate and condition</hi> that they bee in: for a
naturall life is maintained and upheld by the uſe of meat, drinke, ſleepe,
Phiſicke and reſt, but then our bodies ſhalbe upheld by the Power of
God without the uſe of theſe meanes; our bodies now are heavie, but
then our ſoules ſhall fill them full of agilitie and nimbleneſſe to move
upwards and downwards; ſo it is a Spirituall body, not in regard of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
but in regard of qualitie and operation.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Object. 2.</note> (ſay they) <hi>If the ſame bodies riſe then they riſe with a number of
needleſſe parts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> for what ſhall a man need teeth ſeeing they ſhall eate no
meate, and what ſhall they need a ſtomacke, ſeeing there is no concocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or digeſtion, and what ſhall a man need bowels, ſeeing there is no
redundance to fill them.<note place="margin">Anſ. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſhall anſwer this; (ſaith he) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the teeth they bee needfull, for a man hath two uſes of them,
they ſerve to eate with, and they are to helpe our ſpeech; therefore
though we have no need of teeth in regard of eating, yet we ſhall have
need of them to ſpeake with, for in Heaven we ſhall praiſe God and ſing
the ſong of <hi>Moſes</hi> and of the <hi>Lambe;</hi> ſo then all our teeth are needfull.
Now for the other parts of the body, they are (ſaith hee) for ſight and
comelineſſe; for though there be no need of the ſtomacke to concoct,
or of bowels (becauſe there is no redundance) yet theſe ſhall bee as or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments
to the body to adorne and beautifie it: for even in this life
there are ſome things which a man hath that are not needfull, as a mans
beard, it is not a needfull thing, for a man might live without it, hee
might ſpeake without it, yet nature hath given us it for an ornament
and comelineſſe: So likewiſe a woman ſhee hath breaſts neceſſarily for
to nouriſh and feede her child therewithall, but why a man ſhould have
the like, that ſeeing he hath no uſe or need of them, we ſee no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
but they are for an ornament and to beautifie the body: In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
though we ſhall not neede after this life a ſtomacke to concoct, nor
bowels to receive and diſperſe, yet they ſhall bee for ornament to our
bodies.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="629" facs="tcp:17958:321"/>
Thirdly, (ſay they) the ſame bodies doe not riſe, becauſe <hi>they be heavy
and ponderous bodies;</hi> for how ſhall heavie and ponderous bodies ſtay
above the Clouds, in the pure Heaven,<note place="margin">Object. 1.</note> which is more pure and thin
than the Ayre. To this I anſwer, that if a man may fill a great veſſell of
lead and make it ſwim above water by drawing the Ayre into it,<note place="margin">Anſ.</note> why
then may not God draw his Spirit into us, and fill us therewith,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
our heavie bodies abide above the Clouds, as well as a man can
make a veſſell of lead to ſwimme above the water?</p>
               <p>Secondly, I anſwer, that <hi>every thing abides in his owne proper place at
Gods appointment:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2</note> As the Clouds which are heavie and full of wet
would fall downe to the ground, if God had not appointed the Ayre to
bee the proper place for them; ſo likewiſe the water would bee above
the land, but that the Sea is the place that God hath appointed for the
water: ſo it is Gods aſſignement that makes the proper place of a thing:
And therefore becauſe Heaven is the proper place of a glorified bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
as the Earth of a mortall body, therefore I ſay our bodies ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
here till the day of judgement in this Earth; and then when our
bodies are made glorified bodies, they ſhall abide in the Heavens: As
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 115. 16. <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Heavens, even the Heavens are the Lords, but
He hath given the Earth to the Sonnes of Men:</hi> ſo then the proper place of
our mortall bodies is the Earth, but when our bodies are glorified, then
they ſhall be as naturally in Heaven, and live and abide there as they doe
now on the Earth. The uſes are three:</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> ſeeing wee ſhall riſe with the ſame bodies, therefore wee muſt
be carefull to keepe them well, that they may bee pure and unſpotted
without ſinne. It is <hi>Pauls</hi> concluſion, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 18. <hi>Flie fornication, every
ſinne that a man doth is without the body, but hee that commits fornication ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
againſt the body:</hi> ſo becauſe we ſhall riſe againe, let us flie every ſin
and corruption, and keepe our bodies unſpotted; that ſo wee may bee
preſented pure and holy before him at that day: for what a ſhame will
it be to ſtand before God in judgement when wee have wronged God
by our ſinnes, grieved and offended him, and when our heavenly Iudge
ſhall ſay unto us, Are not theſe the eyes that yee have let in luſt with,
and looked after vanitie? Are not theſe the tongues that yee have told
ſo many lies with? Are not theſe the mouthes that yee have ſworne
and blaſphemed my Name with? Are not theſe the hands yee have
wrought wickedneſſe with? Are not theſe the feete that have carried
you to ſinne and vanitie, to places of diſorder, and then how ſhall wee
be able to anſwer the Lord? Therefore beloved how carefull ſhould
we be to live well, to keepe our bodies unſpotted, that wee may have
comfortat that day. We ſee 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36. 8. when <hi>Iehoiakim</hi> was dead,<note place="margin">Simile.</note>
there was found the characters, markes and prints of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>orcery, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
he could beare it out (becauſe he was a King) and ſmother up
the matter and keepe it cloſe, yet when hee was dead, there was the
markes and prints of his forcery found on his body; ſo howſoever ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
may hide their ſins and beare them out while they live, yet when
they be dead, there ſhall be found the markes and prints and Characters
<pb n="630" facs="tcp:17958:322"/>
of their foule ſinnes that they have committed: therefore let us keepe
our bodies pure and unſpotted that wee may have comfort at that day.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> ſeeing the ſame bodies which wee lay downe ſhall riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
therefore we ſhould depoſe and lay them downe well at the day
of death, and make a holy cloſe of our lives to die in Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
that ſo we may goe to God. If a man put off his garment, and
meanes to put it on againe,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> he will not rend it off his backe and teare it,
but will put it off tenderly and lay it up ſafe, that ſo it may doe him ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
againe, and grace him before his friends; ſo ſeeing our bodies are
as garments for our ſoules (when we put them off) let us labor to depoſe
and lay them downe well at the day of death, to die in Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
that our bodies may grace us and do us credit at the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
before God. To this purpoſe 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 14. ſaith Saint <hi>Peter, I thinke
it meete as long as I am in this Tabernacle to ſtir you up by putting you in minde,
ſeeing I know that the time is at hand that I muſt lay downe this my Tabernacle
even as our Lord Ieſus Chriſt hath ſhewed me;</hi> ſo alſo S. <hi>Paul</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. ſaith, <hi>for
we know that if this earthly houſe of our Tabernacle be diſſolved, we have a buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
given us of God, &amp;c.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> There is great difference betweene a ſouldier
deſtroying of an houſe, and one that diſſolves a houſe; he that deſtroyes
an houſe, will pull downe the timber and ſtones, and careth not where
he flings them, nor what becommeth of them, becauſe he doth not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to uſe them againe: But a man that diſſolves an houſe, he will take
it downe peece by peece in parts with great care and diligence, and will
lay it up ſafe, becauſe he meanes to build with it againe; ſo becauſe wee
know that our bodies ſhall riſe againe at the laſt day, therefore we muſt
not deſtroy our bodies, but labour to repoſe them and lay them downe
well at the day of death.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Vſe 3.</note> ſeeing the ſame body ſhall riſe againe that we have here in
this world, and the ſame that we lay downe at the day of death; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
here this great queſtion may be anſwered,<note place="margin">Quest.</note> 
                  <hi>whether we may know one
another at the day of judgement?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Of knowing one another at the Reſurrection.</note> This queſtion need be no queſtion, ſeeing
we ſhall riſe againe with the ſame bodies that we lye downe with here;
therefore ſurely wee ſhall know one another in Heaven: and wee have
reaſons to confirme us in it.</p>
               <p>First,<note place="margin">Reaſon 1.</note> 
                  <hi>becauſe our knowledge ſhall be more perfect at that time than ever Adams
was in the time of innocencie;</hi> for if <hi>Adam</hi> did know his wife as ſoone as ſhe
was brought him, though hee never ſaw her before, therefore much
more wee ſhall know one another ſeeing our knowledge ſhall bee more
perfect, and we ſhall riſe with the ſame bodies that wee lived with here.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Reaſon 2.</note> 
                  <hi>On the Mount his Diſciples had but a taſte of the Heavenly glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi>
and yet <hi>Peter</hi> knew <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> although they were dead many
thouſand yeeres before; if hee knew them when hee had but a taſte of
glory, much more we ſhall know one another when wee ſhall have ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of glory.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Reaſon 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Our happineſſe ſhall bee greatly increaſed by meanes of the mutuall
ſocietie one with another: Matth.</hi> 8. 11. <hi>But I ſay unto you, that many ſhall come
from the Eaſt, and from the Weſt, and ſhall ſit downe with Abraham, Iſaak and
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:17958:322"/>
Iaakob in the Kingdome of God:</hi> therefore ſeeing our happineſſe ſhall bee
greatly increaſed then by mutuall ſocietie, wee are not to thinke that
we ſhall goe to a ſtrange people where we know no body; but wee ſhall
goe to our godly friends and acquaintance, and to ſuch as we know.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Reaſon 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Wee ſhall heare the inditement of the wicked at the day of Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi>
there we ſhall here them arraigned and condemned for their vile
facts; <hi>Cain,</hi> for killing of <hi>Abel; Pharaoh,</hi> for oppreſſing the <hi>Iſraelites; Iudas,</hi>
for betraying of his Maſter; <hi>Nero,</hi> for killing of Chriſtians: when we
heare them indited and condemned, we ſhall know them. And as wee
ſhall know the wicked, ſo we ſhall know the Godly too, when they
ſhall be rewarded; which me thinkes may bee a motive to quicken us in
our care to live holily and Chriſtianly here in this World, ſeeing wee
goe not to a ſtrange Countrie or people, but to our friends and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and to ſuch as know us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3</note> The Time when we ſhall riſe, <hi>that is,</hi> at the day of judgement, <hi>then
and never till then: ſo</hi> Martha <hi>sayes in this place;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Time when we ſhall riſe.</note> I know my Brother ſhall
riſe againe in the Reſurrection at the last day; <hi>ſo alſo S.</hi> Paul <hi>ſaith,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 51.
We ſhall not all ſleepe but we ſhall all be changed in a moment, in the twinkling of
an eye at the laſt Trumpet; for the Trumpet ſhall blow, and the dead ſhall bee
raiſed up: <hi>ſo then wee ſhall riſe at the laſt judgement, and never till that
time. Now there are foure reaſons of this delaying:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First,<note place="margin">Foure Reaſons why the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection is delaid.</note> 
                  <hi>Becauſe there might be a proportion betweene Chriſt and his members:</hi>
for, Chriſt when he was dead, did not riſe again by and by but lay a time
trampled and troden underfoot of death;<note place="margin">1</note> ſo also that wee might
lie a time under the chaines and fetters of death, God ſuffers us not to
riſe till then.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> 
                  <hi>Ireneus</hi> ſhuts up his Booke with this ſaying, Even as our
Heavenly Maſter did not flie to Heaven by and by, but did remaine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
death and in the Grave for a time, ſo all his ſervants muſt be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to lie in the Grave,<note place="margin">2</note> and to be trampled and trodden underfoote of
death for a time, before they goe to Heaven.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Because that the bodies of all the faithfull that are gone before,
and thoſe that come after might have their full conſummation of glory together:</hi>
Therefore they ſhall not riſe to prevent one another in glory, but they
ſhall all goe together. As Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 15. <hi>For this ſay wee
unto you by the Word of the Lord, that we which live and are remaining unto the
comming of the Lord, ſhall not prevent them that ſleepe:</hi> ſo wee ſhall not get
the ſtart of them, but we ſhall ariſe all together to glory. This is a ſweet
comfort to us that live in the laſt age of the world, that all the Saints
that are departed ſhall not riſe to this Heavenly glory till wee be ready,<note place="margin">Simile.</note>
but lie waiting in their Graves for us. We read 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 11. <hi>When Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel
came to Iſhai to annoint David, Iſhai called all his Sonnes before him, to
whom Samuel ſaid, Are there no more children but theſe? there remaineth</hi> (ſaid
<hi>Iſhai) yet a little one behinde that keepeth ſheepe; unto whom Samuel ſaid, Send,
and fetch him, for we will not ſit downe till he come hither:</hi> ſo the People of
God, they lie waiting in their graves, and are kept from their honour
and glory,<note place="margin">3</note> and will not ſit downe in the Kingdome of Heaven (as it
were) till we all meete together.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="632" facs="tcp:17958:323"/>
Thirdly, <hi>For the further declaration of the Power of Chriſt;</hi> for it is a
greater matter that Chriſt ſhould raiſe men that have lien rotting in the
Grave a thouſand yeeres together, than for to raiſe men when they are
newly dead: therefore <hi>Martha</hi> ſaid to Ieſus, <hi>My brother ſtinketh already,
for he hath beene dead theſe foure dayes:</hi> Therefore it is not ſo eaſie a matter
to raiſe him as it was <hi>Iairus</hi> daughter, and the <hi>widdowes ſonne:</hi> ſo <hi>Ezek.</hi>
37. 3. the Lord ſaid unto him, <hi>Sonne of Man, can theſe dead and drie bones
live? and I anſwered</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>Lord thou knoweſt it is a hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to doe it:</hi> therefore this declaration is for the further manifeſtation
of the Power of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4</note> 
                  <hi>For the further confirmation of our faith;</hi> for looke how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
there are of the dead bodies of the Saints amongſt us, ſo many pled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
and pawnes there are of our Redemption: for although wee might
doubt in our ſelves of our owne bodies riſing, in regard of the badneſſe
of our lives, and in regard of our vile ſinnes; yet becauſe there bee ſo
many bodies of the dead Saints amongſt us, wee neede not doubt but
that he will raiſe them up one day to glory.</p>
               <p>There are three bodies already aſcended into Heaven; <hi>Henoch,</hi> in the
time of <hi>Nature; Elias,</hi> in the time of the <hi>Law;</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in the time of
the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> and for theſe three bodies hee hath left many thouſand bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of the dead Saints remaining under death, and in the grave, to bee
pledges and pawnes to us of our Reſurrection; one ſaith well; we have
here in this world many pawnes and pledges of our reſurrection; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let us not doubt but that the Lord one day will raiſe our bodies.
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks hereof, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. <hi>ult. God</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>providing better
things for us, that they without us ſhould not be made perfect:</hi> ſo we ſhall not
prevent one another,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> but ſhall all goe together. The uſe is:</p>
               <p>Firſt, ſeeing the bodies of the Saints doe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not riſe till the day of
Iudgement, therefore we muſt be contented to lye under affliction and
trouble, till God deliver us. We ſee all the bodies of the Saints be tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled
and troden underfoot of death till the day of judgement, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we muſt be contented to wait with patience for a time, til the Lord
deliver us out of trouble, ſeeing there will bee a day of deliverance.</p>
               <p>The ſecond uſe is, that ſeeing the bodies of the Saints riſe not till the
day of judgement,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> therefore we ſhould waite for it, deſire it, and long
for it: as <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. we read of two ſorts of <hi>groners;</hi> the <hi>Creatures</hi> grone by
the inſtinct of <hi>Nature,</hi> and the <hi>People of God</hi> grone by the inſtinct <hi>of grace;</hi>
ſo that there is never a Creature that is well ordered, ſenſible or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible
but doth grone and long for that day: therefore much more
ſhuld we long for that time and deſire it. If a man hath broken an Arme,
or put a Leg out of joynt,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> if one hath promiſed him that he will come
to ſet and put it into joynt againe at ſuch an houre, hee will every foote
be looking out of his window for his comming: ſo ſeeing at the day of
judgement the Lord will reſtore us againe to our former integritie, we
ſhould long for that day and be looking for it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Vſe 3.</note> ſeeing the Dead ſhall not riſe till the day of judgement,
therefore why doe men ſo pamper their bodies to cloath them ſo fine,
<pb n="633" facs="tcp:17958:323"/>
and to feede them ſo daintily, who cannot indure the winde to blow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, ſeeing they muſt goe to the duſt, bee companions with the
wormes, and dwell in the houſe to rottenneſſe; therefore all our care
muſt be to ſave our ſoules, to get faith in Chriſt, to repent of our ſinnes,
and ſo to ſhut up our eyes in this world, as that they may bee opened in
the Kingdome of glory for ever.</p>

               <p>Here a queſtion may bee asked,<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> ſeeing wee muſt lye ſo many yeares
and ages rotting in the grave,<note place="margin">What may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in our lying in the grave.</note> what may the meane while bee our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
to uphold and ſuſtaine us? I anſwer, that there are ſome things to
comfort us and ſuſtaine us, in this caſe.<note place="margin">Ans.</note>
               </p>
               <p>First,<note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>that God will be preſent with us, that he will not leave us nor forſake us;
no not in the grave:</hi> this is a ſweet comfort to us our wives and friends
bring us to the grave, lay us, in and there leave us, for there is none of
them that will goe downe with us to the place of rottenneſſe: but here
is comfort that the Lord will not leave us there but hee will goe to the
grave with us, and will watch over our dead aſhes by the eye of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
to keepe them: till the day come in which hee will raiſe them
up againe; as <hi>Gen.</hi> 46. 4. ſaith God to <hi>Iaakob, I will goe downe into Egypt
with thee, and I will bring thee up againe;</hi> ſo the Lord will go downe with us
into the grave, and tarry with us, and will watch over us with the eye of
<pb n="634" facs="tcp:17958:324"/>
his Providence to keepe our dead aſhes and bring us out againe: <hi>Rizpah</hi>
is condemned for that ſhee kept the dead bodies of <hi>Sauls</hi> ſonnes,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 21. 10.</note> that
ſhe did ſpread a tent over them,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and kept them that the fowles ſhould
not devour them by day, nor the beaſts by night; but much more may
wee admire and wonder at the goodneſſe of God to us, that hee goes
downe into the grave with us, ſpreads his tent over us, and will keepe
our dead aſhes which one day hee will bring out againe; this is a ſweet
comfort to a Chriſtian, that the Lord will not leave us nor forſake us,
no not in the grave, though our wives and friends leave us, yet God
will not.</p>
               <p>The ſecond comfort is,<note place="margin">2</note> that <hi>although our bodies lye rotting in the grave,
yet our ſoules ſhall be bleſſed and happy:</hi> this was <hi>Pauls</hi> comfort 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>For
we know that if this earthly houſe of this Tabernacle be deſtroyed, we have a buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
given us of God, &amp;c.</hi> and ſo <hi>Revel.</hi> 6. 11. <hi>The ſoules that lay under the
Altar cried, How long Lord?</hi> and it is ſaid, that <hi>long white robes were given
them,</hi> that is, that they were comforted with the glorious and bleſſed
eſtate of their ſoules. Indeed if our ſoule ſhould not goe to glory pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently,
but ſhould lye as the body in the paine of rottenneſſe; then we
might ſay (as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith) <hi>Proverb.</hi> 17. 22. <hi>the hope that is deferred is
the drying of the bones, &amp;c.</hi> but becauſe the ſoule goes preſently to God,
and is in an eſtate of glory and happineſſe (though the body lye in the
place of rottenneſſe;) therefore this may comfort us: a good ſoule is
like the good ſpies wee read of <hi>Numb.</hi> 13.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> that were ſent into the land
of <hi>Canaan</hi> to ſearch the land; when they came backe againe to the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of Iſrael, they tell them that the land is a good and pleaſant land;
that they have taſted of the fruits thereof, and therefore let us not bee
ſlothfull to enter in: ſo the good ſoule that goes before into the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
<hi>Canaan,</hi> and hath a taſt of the fruit of it, when it returnes againe
into the body to live in communion and fellowſhip with it, will ſay to
the body, Here is a good and pleaſant land, I have taſted of the fruite
of it, therefore let us not bee slothfull to enter in and poſſeſſe it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>this may comfort us in that although we lye in the grave a long time,
yet Chriſt hath ſanctified and ſweetned the grave unto us, by lying in it himſelfe,
and hath perfumed it;</hi> as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaith, That of a lothſome priſon houſe
Chriſt hath made the grave to be a ſtorehouſe to keepe all the bodies of
his ſervants till the day of reſurrection, &amp; hath made the grave as a ſweet
bed to reſt on: ſo we ſee <hi>Eſai.</hi> 57. 2. it is ſaid, <hi>Peace ſhall come upon them,
they ſhall reſt in their beds every one that walketh before me:</hi> One ſaith well,
that Chriſt hath made the grave a beaten and a plaine way to heaven,
for he himſelfe went no other way thither but through the grave and
dennes of death, therefore wee muſt looke to goe no other way than
this, ſeeing wee may finde in this way the footſteps, markes and prints
of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt and our deare friends, and therefore alſo wee
may be bold to venture, the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> went through the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe,
a place of ſtinging Serpents and endured much hardſhip; yet
becauſe this was the way to <hi>Canaan,</hi> this made them bold to venture;
ſo though the grave be a dreadfull place, yet Chriſtians know that it is
<pb n="635" facs="tcp:17958:324"/>
the way to the Heavenly <hi>Canaan,</hi> and in which Chriſt hath gone before
us; therefore we ſhould be bold to venter this ſame way.</p>
               <p>The fourth comfort is,<note place="margin">4</note> 
                  <hi>That although we lie a long time in the Grave, yet
we have aſſured hope that one day we ſhall riſe againe.</hi> This was <hi>Davids</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 9. (ſaith he) <hi>Wherefore my heart is glad, and my tongue rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth,
my fleſh alſo reſts in hope; for thou wilt not leave my ſoule in the Grave,
neither wilt thou ſuffer thine holy one to ſee corruption:</hi> This is not onely true
of Chriſt, that he would not ſuffer himſelfe to lie in the grave for ever,
but it is true alſo of all his members, that God will not ſuffer them for
ever to dwell in the Grave, but will one day raiſe them up againe. We
ſee when <hi>Ionas</hi> was cast into the Sea,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> there was a Whale that did ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
him up; one would have thought that there had beene an end of
him, and that he had beene utterly conſumed, and no man ſhould have
heard any more of him, yet the Lord did but speake a word to the
Whale, and he caſt him up on the drie land: ſo when a man is put into
the Grave, ſome thinke there is an end of him, we ſhall never heare more
of him, yet let the Lord ſpeake but a word, and the grave ſhall give up
his dead: This is comfort to a Chriſtian, that although one may lie a
long time in the grave, yet he may have aſſured hope that he ſhall one
day be raiſed up.</p>
               <p>The uſe is,<note place="margin">Vſe.</note> ſeeing that there be theſe comforts, notwithſtanding that
a man may lie a long time in the grave, why then ſhould a Chriſtian be
affraid to die? for when the world thinkes that hee is at the worſt, then
he is a bleſſed and happy man, becauſe the Lord will never leave him,
nor forſake him; but hee will bee preſent in the grave with him, and
though his body be in the place of rottenneſſe, yet his ſoule ſhall be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
and happy (for that is an eſtate of bleſſedneſſe) and the Grave (that
was a lothſome priſon houſe) is made as a ſtore houſe to keepe the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of Gods People in, and as a beaten way to Heaven. Indeed life is
an excellent bleſſing, becauſe the time of life is the time of Grace and
of Repentance: Therefore we ſhould labour to preſerve this candle of
our life, but when the time commeth that God hath appointed, and
death approacheth neere, why ſhould we be affraid to die, ſeeing that
we may have ſuch comfort, that notwithſtanding all our enemies, wee
ſhall riſe againe. Chriſt when he drew neere his death ſaid, <hi>he thirsted;</hi>
and the cruell ſouldiers preſently gave him vinegar to drinke; but
Chriſt doth not ſo by us, hee hath tempered us a cup of comfort; Hee
ſayes to us (as he ſaid to the Theefe) <hi>This day ſhalt thou be with me in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe,</hi>
this day ſhall be a bleſſed day to thee: therefore our care muſt bee
to repent our ſinnes, to get faith in Chriſt, and to live holily here; and
then when death commeth, our ſoules ſhall goe to Heaven, and though
our bodies lie in the grave a long time, yet one day they ſhall riſe at the
time appointed.</p>
               <p>The fourth point is,<note place="margin">Fourthly by whoſe power we ſhall riſe.</note> 
                  <hi>By whoſe power we ſhall riſe:</hi> the Scripture ſhewes,
<hi>by the Power of Chriſt;</hi> no man can riſe by his owne power, it cannot bee
done by the power of nature: So <hi>Iob.</hi> 14. 14. (ſaith he) <hi>If a man die, ſhall
he live againe?</hi> meaning that if a man die, hee cannot riſe of himſelfe,
<pb n="636" facs="tcp:17958:325"/>
the power of nature cannot put life into him againe: no man can raiſe
himſelfe, nor no body elſe can doe it, it muſt be by the power of Chriſt
onely. So ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 49. 7. <hi>None of them can by any meanes redeeme
his brother, nor give to God a ranſome for him:</hi> and the Scripture elſewhere
makes it plaine unto us, that it muſt be by the power of Chriſt that wee
ſhall be raiſed; for he is ſaid to be <hi>the reſurrection and the life:</hi> and further
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 22. ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>For as in Adam all died, even ſo in Chriſt
ſhall we all be made alive:</hi> ſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49. 15. <hi>But God ſhall deliver my ſoule from
the power of the grave, for hee will receive mee:</hi> ſo then all ſhall riſe by the
power of Chriſt, but there is great difference in their riſings for hee
will raiſe the godly as a mercifull Saviour and Redeemer, as a Head
to give life to his Members and quicken them. Thus all the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God ſhall be infinitly made glad of the power of Chriſt, but the
wicked of the world, and ſuch as have deſpiſed God and goodneſſe, they
ſhall riſe with feare and aſtoniſhment, and ſhall wiſh that the Sea or the
Grave might have retained and kept them, yea they ſhall deſire the hils
and mountaines to fall upon them to cover them.</p>
               <p>The uſe is,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> firſt, ſeeing all ſhall riſe by the power of Chriſt, we muſt
learne to magnifie this power that ſhall raiſe us from the power of the
Grave, and out of the belly of rottenneſſe. In the ſtory of <hi>Ioſeph, Gen.</hi>
40. 13. when hee lay in the priſon houſe, hee ſaid unto <hi>Pharoahs</hi> butler,
<hi>Remember me to Pharoah, that thou mayeſt bring mee out of his houſe, for I was
taken out of my Countrie and ſold, &amp;c.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> So the body ſhould ſay to the ſoule,
remember me to Ieſus Chriſt, that he may bring mee from this priſon
houſe and place of rottenneſſe, that he may raiſe me out of the duſt and
bring me to Heaven.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> ſeeing all ſhall riſe by the power of Chriſt, therefore let
all labour to feele the power of Chriſt here in this life to their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
or elſe they ſhall feele the power of Chriſt to their terrour at the
day of judgement: Therefore labour thou here whoſoever thou art,
to feele the power of Chriſt to raiſe thee out of thy ſinnes and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
to quicken thee up to newneſſe of life; or elſe thou ſhalt feele the
power of Chriſt to raiſe thee at the laſt day to thy confuſion.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Vſe 3.</note> ſeeing all ſhall riſe by the power of Chriſt, therefore let us
not doubt but that the Lord will raiſe us out of our troubles whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
they be; ſeeing hee will raiſe our bodies at the laſt day. Wee read,
<hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. that the Lord ſaid to the Prophet, <hi>Sonne of Man, can theſe dead
bones live?</hi> and ſo bade him propheſie upon the bones, till bone ran to his
bone, fleſh and ſinewes grew on them againe; and there was a great
army that ſtood up, verſe 11. ſaith the Lord, <hi>Sonne of Man, theſe bones
are the whole houſe of Iſrael that did lie in captivitie and bondage:</hi> therefore
the Lord did ſhew the Prophet, that as hee was able to raiſe theſe dead
bones to life, ſo hee was able to bring them out of trouble and bondage
againe. Therefore doe not thou doubt but that the Lord will raiſe thee
out of thy troubles whatſoever they be. As <hi>Pſal.</hi> 86. 13. <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>great
i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> thy mercy towards me, and thou haſt delivered my ſoule from the loweſt grave;</hi>
Therefore if thou doſt not beleeve that God will raiſe thee out of thy
<pb n="637" facs="tcp:17958:325"/>
troubles (whatſoever they be) then blot this article out of thy Creede,
and ſearch it out, for it he can raiſe thy body out of the grave, then doe
not doubt but that he can raiſe thee out of thy troubles whatſoever
they be.</p>
               <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5</note> 
                  <hi>In what eſtate our bodies ſhall riſe in;</hi> in an <hi>estate of glory:</hi> Now
they are mortall and mutable,<note place="margin">In what eſtate our bodies ſhall riſe in.</note> ſubject to a number of infirmities, to hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
nakedneſſe, cold, ſickneſſes, diſeaſes and paines: now they are dull
and heavie in the ſervice of God, but at the laſt day (when we ſhall riſe
againe) our bodies ſhall bee made immortall and ſhall bee ſubject to no
infirmities of nature, ſickneſſes or paines: then they ſhall have ſtrength
to performe their owne actions, in ſo excellent and perfect an eſtate our
bodies ſhall riſe.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> If a Phyſitian ſhould out of his Art and skill give us
ſuch a potion that we ſhould never hunger nor thirſt after it, and ſhould
be free from ſickneſſes, diſeaſes, paines and griefes, a man would give
many a pound to procure it; ſuch a potion the Lord will give us at the
laſt day, hee will give us a cup of immortalitie, that wee ſhall have no
more paines and ſickneſſes; therefore how ſhould wee long and deſire
for that day. <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 8. our Saviour Chriſt ſaith, <hi>It were better for a
man to enter into life hurt and maimed, than having two hands and two feete to
be caſt into Hell fire:</hi> It were better for a man to goe to Heaven wanting
his parts, than for a man to goe to Hell with all the glory that this world
can afford him; and yet we may have this aſſured hope, that we ſhall not
goe deformed to Heaven; but we ſhall have all our parts, and glory put
on them; but whoſoever cares not for Chriſt, or for religion, they
ſhall ſee this glory put upon the People of God, and ſhall not taſte of it.
Let us therefore be exhorted to labor to have communion with Chriſt,
to repent us of our ſins, and to feare God, that when death commeth, our
eyes may be ſo ſhut up in this world, as they may be open in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of God for ever. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaith, that the Goldſmith putteth
into a pot his ſilver or his gold,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> then hee ſets the pot into the fire and
melts it, where he formes a bowle or a cup to ſet before the king; ſo the
Lord melts us by death, and then out of the dead aſhes and cinders of
the bodies of his ſervants, hee frameth and will make them goodly veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
of honour to ſtand before him in his Temple. One ſayes well, It is
a good thing to thinke of the future glory of the body, eſpecially in the
time of ſickneſſe, and in the houre of death againſt the crawling of the
wormes, and the place of rottenneſſe; <hi>Iob</hi> comforteth himſelfe with
this, <hi>for I am ſure that my Redeemer liveth, and hee ſhall ſtand the laſt on the
Earth, and though after my skinne wormes, deſtroy this fleſh, yet ſhall I ſee God
with my fleſh, Iob.</hi> 19. ſo wee muſt comfort our ſelves in the like time of
extremity. Now this glory ſhall not bee from the redundance of the
ſpirit onely; but in regard of the bleſſed and happy eſtate that the body
ſhall be in at that time. As 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 42. ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>It is ſowen in
corruption, and is raiſed in incorruption, it is ſowen in weakneſſe, and it is raiſed
in power:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The glory of the body conſiſts in ſixe things at the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> ſo the glory of the body ſhall be in regard of the bleſſed eſtate
that it ſhall be in at that time.</p>
               <p>Now in ſixe things the glory of the body conſists: Firſt, the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="638" facs="tcp:17958:326"/>
of the body conſiſts in <hi>that there ſhall be all the parts of the body perfect and
entire,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1</note> they ſhall want nothing, howſoever a man may be maimed or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
want a hand or an eye, a legge or a finger, or an eye here, yet all
ſhall be ſupplied to him at that day:<note place="margin">Intireneſſe of parts.</note> and that for two Reaſons:</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Reaſon 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Becauſe all things ſhall be reduced to their former eſtate:</hi> for as <hi>Peter</hi>
ſhewes <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 21. ſpeaking of Chriſt, <hi>whom the Heavens muſt containe and
keepe, untill the time that all things ſhall bee reſtored:</hi> in the beginning the
body of man was made perfect and intire, wanting nothing either for
beautie or comelineſſe; therefore to this eſtate it ſhall bee reſtored a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Reaſon 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Tertullian</hi> raiſeth it from another ground, <hi>Revel.</hi> 21. 4.
where it is ſaid, <hi>there ſhall be no more death;</hi> alwaies (ſaith he) in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is inferred the leſſer; therefore if death be expelled from the whole
man, then it ſeemeth to bee expelled from every particular member:
and therefore for concluſion, the bodies of the Saints ſhall riſe perfect
and entire againe with all the parts.</p>
               <p>The uſe is,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> ſeeing all our parts ſhall be perfect and entire at that day,
we muſt comfort our ſelves with this; though wee want an eye, a hand,
or a foote; for we know by faith that they ſhall all be reſtored againe at
the laſt day:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> if a man ſhould want a member, an eye, a legge, or an arme,
and there were one could reſtore it to him againe, he would give many
pounds to have it ſupplied; but better by many degrees is the eſtate of
Gods children; for let a man feare God, make conſcience of his waies,
repent his ſinnes, and labour to pleaſe him, and hee may bee aſſured the
Lord will reſtore to him all his parts, and that not onely to himſelfe,
but alſo to his family and friends.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> ſeeing at the day of judgement all our parts ſhall be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
againe by Chriſt, we ſhould not bee affraid to forgoe any of them
for the Name of Chriſt: for hee that did reſtore the eare of <hi>Malchus,</hi>
which was his enemy,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſure it is therefore that he will reſtore any part
that his friend ſhould loſe for his names ſake: as <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 35. it is ſaid of
the holy men that they would not bee delivered from thoſe paines and
torments (which the wicked had deviſed againſt them) that they might
receive a better reſurrection; and in the ſtory of the <hi>Macchabees</hi> we read
a ſtrange and worthy narration, recorded alſo by <hi>Ioſephus,</hi> that when
one of the ſeven Children of the mother, came to ſuffer, and was to have
his tongue and other parts to be cut off, he ſaith, <hi>Theſe have I received
from the Heavens, but now for the Law of God I deſpiſe them, and truſt that I
ſhall receive them againe:</hi> ſo becauſe wee know that if wee loſe any part
for the Name of Chriſt, he will reſtore it to us at the day of judgement:
Therefore wee ſhould not bee affraid to loſe it, but contented and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to part with all for Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Now if any man ſhould object,<note place="margin">Object.</note> that wee ſhall not then have all our
parts reſtored againe, becauſe Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. that <hi>a man were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to goe halt and lame into the Kingdome of God, than having two hands and
two feete to be caſt into everlasting fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I anſwere,<note place="margin">Anſ.</note> 
                  <hi>That Chriſt doth not ſpeake poſitively, but by ſuppoſition;</hi>
                  <pb n="639" facs="tcp:17958:326"/>
for he doth not ſay, ye ſhall goe halt and lame into life; but hee ſaith, it
were better for a man to goe in any meane and baſe condition to God,
as blinde, lame, naked and poore, than to goe into everlaſting fire, with
all the glory that this world can afford.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Anſ. 2.</note> I anſwer, <hi>It is to be underſtood of the eſtate of the ſoule, and not
of the body:</hi> for if a man were to loſe his hands or feete, yea all the
parts of his body for this end onely to have his ſoule goe to Heaven,
it were better than that he ſhould have all the parts of his body, and go
with the wrecke of his ſoule and conſcience into everlaſting fire.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> the glory of the body conſiſts in this, that <hi>it ſhall be beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and lovely:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The body ſhall bee beautiful and lovely.</note> howſoever now our bodies may bee rotten, deformed
and ill-favoured, eſpecially when we be dead, at which time the bodies
of the beſt and beautifulleſt are ill-favoured to looke on. We ſee good
<hi>Abraham</hi> when <hi>Sara</hi> was dead, deſired to have a place to bury her out of
his ſight, ſo lothſome and ill-favoured we be when we be dead; but at
the reſurrection, then our bodies ſhall bee made beautifull and lovely;
no man or woman is now ſo beautifull as we ſhall be then, and that for
two Reaſons:</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Reaſon 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Looke what estate Adam was in, in the time of innocencie, in the ſame
eſtate ſhall the bodies of the Saints be at the reſurrection:</hi> but the body of man
was ſo beautifull and glorious, ſo full of brightneſſe and ſpendor which
iſſued from it, as all the Beaſts of the field ſtood gazing and looking on
him: in the ſame eſtate ſhall all the bodies of the Saints be at the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Reaſon 1.</note> all deformities, blackeneſſe, ill-favouredneſſe and croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe
are puniſhments and penalties for ſinne; but when our ſinnes
and our corruptions ſhall ceaſe, then the penaltie and puniſhment ſhall
ceaſe. Oh how ſhould this quicken up our care to repent of our ſinnes,
to get faith in Chriſt, to walke holily here, that wee may have our por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with the Saints. Wee ſee here when men and womens bodies bee
crooked and deformed,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> they weare iron bodies, and will indure any
thing to make them ſtraight againe; beſides if they be not well-favored
they will ſend into <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> to buy complexion, which when
they have, it doth not help nature, but they be the worſe for it, becauſe
it eats out their favour: But if men will feare God, repent their ſinnes,
get faith in Chriſt, and walke holily here, our Lord Ieſus Chriſt will
repaire all and make our bodies beautifull and lovely:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> when <hi>Salomon</hi> had
built the Temple, the Chaldeans came and deſtroyed it; afterwards
when it was built againe, it came not to the former glory that it had:
but it ſhall not be ſo with the bodies of the Saints, for they ſhall bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored
to a more beautifull and glorious eſtate, than ever they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> the glory of the bodies of the Saints ſhall conſiſt in this,<note place="margin">In brightneſſe and ſplendor.</note>
                  <hi>that they ſhall be filled with brightneſſe and ſplender.</hi> now their bodies are
darke and obſcure, but then they ſhall be like ſo many bright ſtarres and
ſhining Lampes, when all the bodies of the wicked ſhall gather blacke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and darkneſſe, and ſhall looke like filthy ſcroules; all the bodies of
<pb n="640" facs="tcp:17958:327"/>
the Saints ſhall be like ſo many bright Stars: as <hi>Daniel</hi> 12. 3. it is ſaid,
<hi>And they that be wiſe ſhall ſhine as the brightneſſe of the Firmament, and they
that turne many to righteouſneſſe ſhall ſhine as the Starres for ever and ever:</hi>
this Chriſt doth further inlarge <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 43. <hi>The Iuſt ſhall ſhine as the
Sunne in the Kingdome of their Father:</hi> the Sunne did never looke more
glorious upon this world, than the bodies of the Saints ſhall shine with
glory at that day; therefore what a comfortable eſtate ſhall our bodies
be in at that time. We ſee when <hi>Moſes</hi> had talked with God forty daies
(by the reflexion of Gods glory upon him) his face did ſhine ſo that the
children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were not able to behold it: how much more will the
glory of Saints be, when they ſhall abide with God not forty daies, but
for ever and ever; if there ſhall be ſuch glory and brightneſſe in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of the Saints, how ſuperexcellent ſhall the glory of the Soule bee
then?</p>
               <p>The uſe is,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> that a Chriſtian ſhould ſolace himſelfe in the meditation
of this, and not thinke his time loſt in the Service of God, but abſtract
his heart from the love of this world and worldly things, to thinke on
the future glory that God hath prepared for the Saints, and cheare up
thy heart with it: as <hi>Gen.</hi> 13. the Lord makes an excellent promiſe to
<hi>Abraham</hi> concerning the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> bidding him <hi>Ariſe and walke
through the land in the length and breadth thereof;</hi> ſo the Lord makes good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
promiſes to a Chriſtian concerning Heaven. Therefore though hee
hath not put us in poſſeſſion of it hitherto, yet we ſhould ariſe and walke
through the land in the length and breadth of it; that is, meditate and
thinke on the glory and goodly delights of it, and ſolace our ſoules
therewith.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> ſeeing the Lord will honour our bodies then with ſuch a
deale of glory, we muſt be carefull to ſpend our time well, to live in all
holineſſe and righteouſneſſe while wee live here: for how can wee
looke that God ſhould honour us, when wee are not carefull to keepe
our bodies holy,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and labor to honor them our ſelves? It is a rule in Art
that they that would finiſh their colors in brightneſſe, muſt lay grounds
ſutable; ſo, if thou wouldſt have Chriſt to finiſh up thy life in glory
and brightneſſe, lay no ſad grounds, no blacke colors of ſin and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for a foundation: therefore if we would have Chriſt to honour our
bodies, it muſt be our care to repent us of our ſins, to get faith in Chriſt,
to keepe our bodies pure and cleane, to poſſeſſe them in holineſſe, and
then wee may have comfort that God will honour them at the day of
judgement with brightneſſe of Glory.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4</note> 
                  <hi>It ſhall be immutable and immortall:</hi> in this life our bodies
are ſubject to changes and alterations;<note place="margin">In that they ſhall bee immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall and immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</note> as <hi>Iob</hi> 14. it is ſaid, <hi>He ſhooteth forth
as a flower and is cut downe, he vaniſheth away as a ſhadow and never continueth
in one ſtay;</hi> here our bodies are ſubject to hunger and thirſt, to naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
cold and diſeaſes; but then they ſhall bee brought to an eſtate of
permanencie that they ſhall reſt in, ſo that they ſhall not hunger nor
thirſt, nor be naked: as <hi>Revel.</hi> 7. 16. <hi>They ſhall hunger no more, neither
thirſt any more, neither ſhall the Sunne light on them, neither any heate;</hi> and ſo
<pb n="641" facs="tcp:17958:327"/>
alſo <hi>Revel.</hi> 21. 4. it is ſaid, <hi>And God ſhall wipe away all teares from their eyes,
and there ſhall bee no more death, neither ſorrow, neither crying, neither ſhall
there be any more paine,</hi> ſo then their bodies ſhall be free of all vexations,
and then they ſhall be at reſt: this we ſee is cleere by the <hi>Scripture;</hi> and
manifeſt alſo <hi>by reaſon;</hi> for it is a ground in nature that <hi>all things labour
to attaine to their laſt perfection,</hi> and ſo to reſt in it; but the bodies of the
Saints are not yet come to their laſt perfection while they live here,
therefore here they cannot bee at reſt: but at the laſt day when our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
ſhall be brought to an eſtate of perfection, then they ſhall reſt in it,
and ſhall not be ſubject to change or alteration:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> wee ſee in nature if the
ſhipmans needle be touched with a load ſtone it turnes and turnes and
is not at reſt till it ſtands againſt the North-pole, and if it bee hindered
with any thing, it ſtands trembling as if it were diſcontented, but when
it commeth there, it is at reſt and quiet; ſo it is with the bodies of the
Saints, that are touched with the load-ſtone, that is, that have touched
Chriſt by faith, they bee not at reſt and quiet here, but ſubject to many
infirmities of nature; but when they come to the eſtate of perfection,
there they reſt contented and are brought to live with Chriſt, then our
bodies ſhall be immutable and unchangeable: In this world our bodies
are ſubject to ſickneſſe and diſeaſes, to paines and aches; to the ſtone,
gout, and to the crampe, &amp;c. by which death doth enter within our
wals, and labour to take the caſtle of our hearts; but at that time our
bodies ſhall bee made immutable and unchangeable, immortall, free
from all theſe exigences; therefore what muſt we doe when wee feele
theſe decayes in nature, and theſe infirmities? I anſwer, it is good to
take Saint <hi>Peters</hi> counſell, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 19. <hi>That we ſhould repent and turne unto
the Lord, that our ſinnes may be put away when the time of refreſhing ſhall come,
from the preſence of the Lord:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> If a Phyſitian ſhould give you ſuch a
diet that after a few daies taking of it, yee ſhould never bee ſicke
againe, ſhould feele no paine, nor bee ſubject to any diſeaſe, and
have thy bodie brought into ſo good an eſtate, that you ſhould not
hunger or thirſt any more, or be naked, this were an excellent ſtate; but
there is no Phyſitian in the world can doe it, none but our Heavenly
Phyſitian Ieſus Chriſt, and that by this meanes: Wee ſhould get faith
in Chriſt, repentance for our ſinnes, and walke in holineſſe a few dayes
while we live here, and then he will ſet our bodies in ſuch an eſtate, as
we ſhall never be ſicke nor feele any more paine, never bee a hungred or
a thirſt, naked, or cold; here in this life time we muſt ſeeke it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let us labour to repent our ſins, to get faith in Chriſt, and to walke
holily here, and then our bodies ſhall bee brought to ſuch an eſtate, as
ſhall not alter and change.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> It is a world to ſee what meanes men uſe to
keepe their bodies from putrification, they will keepe them up in lead,
imbalme them with ſweet ſpices, and lay them in marble; yet none of
theſe will ſerve, but the bodies of Kings and Queenes muſt yeeld to it.
But doe thou labour to repent of thy ſinnes, to get faith in Chriſt, to
pleaſe God, and to make conſcience of thy wayes, and then thy body
ſhall bee brought to ſuch an eſtate, as it ſhall not bee ſubject to alter
<pb n="642" facs="tcp:17958:328"/>
and change, but ſhall bee made <hi>immutable</hi> and <hi>immortall.</hi>

of ſubſtance, for it ſhall have breadth and length and thickneſſe; it
ſhall have parts and dimenſions as our bodies have; ſo <hi>Luk.</hi> 14. when <hi>Chriſt</hi>
entred into the houſe and ſtood amongſt them, they thought it had beene
a Spirit; but he tells them, that a ſpirit had not fleſh and bloud and bones,
as wee have. Now in two Reſpects our bodies are ſaid to bee ſpirituall.</p>

                  <hi>Becauſe they ſhall bee ſuſtained and upheld by the Spirit;</hi> In this life our

the uſe of meate and drinke in the eſtate of mortalitie, much more
ſurely ſhall the bodies of the Saints bee upheld in the eſtate of glorie; ſo
that there ſhall not bee no need of the uſe of meate, drinke, ſleepe and

                  <hi>The body ſhall bee ſubject to the Spirit,</hi> and be ready to attend the

                  <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, it is not called a ſpirituall body,
becauſe (as ſome men thinke) the ſubſtance of the body is turned into a
Spirit; but (ſaith hee) becauſe it ſhall bee ſubject to the Spirit, and ſhall
attend it; and ſome of the Schoolemen, namely <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> ſaith, that
it is an evident truth that in the ſtate of glory, the Spirit ſhall not depend

the beſt there is ſuch reluctation between the Spirit and the fleſh as they
cannot doe the good they would; ſo <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 40, 41. The Diſciples,
when they ſhould have watched and prayed, Chriſt found them a-ſleepe:
and <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 22. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>I delight in the Law of God, concerning the inward
man, but I ſee another law in my members, rebelling againſt the Law of my mind,
and leading me captive to the law of ſinne,</hi> which is in my members; ſo <hi>Ezek.</hi>
3. 14. (ſaith the Prophet,) <hi>So I went, but it was in the bitterneſſe and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of my Spirit:</hi> hence wee ſee that in the beſt there hath beene relu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation
between the fleſh and the Spirit, that the fleſh laboureth to reſiſt
the Spirit; but here is comfort to a Chriſtian that one day it ſhall attend
the Spirit, and bee led by it in all holy duties. Wee ſee when <hi>Rebekah</hi> had
conceived, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 25. 22. ſhee felt ſuch ſtrugling and ſtriving in her that
ſhe was amazed, and ſaith in that agonie, Seeing it is ſo, why am I thus? as
if ſhee ſhould ſay, ſeeing there is ſuch a ſtriving and ſtrugling in mee I
were as good bee barren; but there was an Oracle of God that did anſwer
her,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> that two Nations were within her, of whom the elder ſhould ſerve the
yonger ſo many times a Chriſtian findes ſuch ſtriving and ſtrugling in
him, that it makes him amazed; the Oracle of God tells us that then there
are two within us, the fleſh and the Spirit; and that the fleſh ſhall ſerve
<pb n="643" facs="tcp:17958:328"/>
the Spirit: if one come to a great heap of Gunpowder, and bring but a
little ſparke of fire and put to it, it will diſſolve and bring it to nothing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo
although there bee a great heape of ſinne and corruption in us,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> yet if a
man get but a little ſparke of the Spirit of God in him, it will diſſolve and
bring it to nothing; therefore we muſt comfort our ſelves with the hope
of this, howſoever now our bodies are not ſubject to the Spirit, that yet
one day they ſhall bee ruled and guided by the Spirit.</p>
               <p>The ſixth thing wherin the glorie of the bodie conſiſts,<note place="margin">6</note> is, <hi>that it ſhall bee
a powerfull bodie:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">It ſhall bee a powerfull Bodie in three things.</note> as <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 43. <hi>It is ſowen in weakneſſe and it
riſeth in power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the power of a glorified bodie is in three things:<note place="margin">1</note> Firſt, <hi>Becauſe it
ſhall have power to performe its owne actions without defatigation or weariſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">To act without wearineſſe.</note>
now wee cannot doe any action, but in time wee ſhall bee wearie of
it, wearie with going, ſitting, ſtanding or doing of any thing. We know,
Chriſt as hee was man was wearie, <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. for it is ſaid, that hee being
wearie ſate him down on the well: ſo <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. <hi>Moſes</hi> hands were ſo wearie
with holding up, inſomuch that <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Hur</hi> did ſtay them up; ſo the
beſt Chriſtians ſometimes are wearie with doing the beſt things. Wearie
with kneeling at prayer, with ſtanding to heare and conferre and ſuch like;
but at the laſt day wee ſhall have ſuch power in our bodies that wee ſhall
never bee wearie of ſtanding before God or kneeling in Prayer for ever
and ever; there ſhall bee ſuch power and ſuch ſtrength in the body: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as oft as wee bee wearie in prayer, or with doing any good thing in
the labours of our callings, wee muſt comfort our ſelves with this, that
one day wee ſhall have power and ſtrength to doe any good dutie and
ſervice that God requires at our hands without defatigation or weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomneſſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>In that the body ſhall move it ſelfe any way with eaſe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Becauſe it ſhall bee able to move it ſelfe nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in the aire.</note> 
                  <hi>and ſhall bee
able to walke in the ayer and on the water;</hi> as now we can walke on the ground.
Though our bodies bee weighty and ponderous, yet then they ſhall have
ſuch power and ſtrength as they ſhall bee able to move upward and
downeward, forward and backward, with as much eaſe as a man lifts up
his hand, there ſhall bee ſuch ſtrength and agilitie in our bodies: now
they are ſubject to one motion onely, to goe forward, but then they ſhall
bee able to move any way.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>In that they ſhall bee able to paſſe through any thing, as a mans finger</hi>

came into the place where the Diſciples were met, the doores being ſhut.</hi> The
Schoolemen ſay, that <hi>the Creature gave way to the Creator,</hi> but there was
ſuch power in the body of Chriſt that if it had beene ſhut up in a cheſt of
ſteele, Iron or marble, it could have paſſeth through; in like manner it ſhall
bee with a glorified body, it ſhall bee able to paſſe through any obſtacle
whatſoever; therefore ſeeing it is ſo, that the Lord will beſtow on the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of Chriſtians ſuch goodly indowments, let us thinke of theſe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
things, and comfort our ſelves with the hope of theſe, and let us bee
contented to walke a few dayes in holineſſe and feare before God: and
then wee ſhall have our part in them. <hi>Plinie</hi> reports of the little Bees that
<pb n="644" facs="tcp:17958:329"/>
in a great winde or tempeſt they catch up little ſtones in their clawes to
ballance themſelves againſt the winde that they be not carried away by it;
ſo ſhould Chriſtians doe in winde and tempeſt;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> that is, in the time of
temptation and trouble, they ſhould catch up ſtones in their clawes,
that is, they ſhould ballance themſelves with the Promiſes of God, and
with the hope of bleſſedneſſe; that ſo they bee not carried away with the
winde of temptation and trouble.</p>
               <p>Now wee come to ſpeake <hi>in what estate the wicked ſhall riſe;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In what eſtate the wicked ſhall riſe.</note> this wee will
ſhew in two things:</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>In an eſtate of ſhame and diſgrace,</hi> the bodies of the Saints they ſhall
bee beautifull and lovely to looke on,<note place="margin">In a diſgrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full eſtate.</note> but the bodies of the wicked ſhall
riſe deformed, ilfavoured and loathſome to looke on; as <hi>Eſai</hi> 66. it is ſaid,
<hi>And they ſhall goe forth and looke upon the carkaſſes of the men that have tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed
againſt mee, for their worme ſhall not die, neither ſhall their fire bee quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
and they ſhall bee an abhorring unto all fleſh:</hi> The bodies of the wicked
ſhall bee as ugly and loathſome carkaſes to looke on, and their faces ſhall
gather darkeneſſe and blackeneſſe: As in this life when a man is ſicke a
little and hath paines upon him, it changes his favour and makes him
looke pale: O but what will it bee when bodies and ſoules ſhall bee tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
for ever? and therefore all the glorie of the wicked is in this world.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> the Godly ſhall bee free from all neceſſities of nature, they
ſhall not hunger,<note place="margin">They ſhall bee clogged with all miſerie, neceſſitie and want.</note> thirſt, bee naked, nor ſubject to diſeaſes and paines, but
the <hi>wicked ſhall bee in hunger and thirst, in all extremeties that may bee;</hi> ſubject
to head-ach, tooth-ach, back-ach, belly-ach; all the paines that may bee
ſhall come upon them. They ſhall not be free in any one part of them, but
bee in ſo great extremitie that although they ſhould deſire but a drop of
comfort,<note place="margin">Luk. 15. 19.</note> they ſhall goe without it. Wee ſee the rich Glutton fared de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licately
every day, lay ſoft, had rich apparell, and had a knot of knaves to
attend on him, but when he was in Hell, hee could not have ſo much as a
drop of water to refreſh him; this extremitie all the wicked ſhall bee in,
they ſhall be ſubject to neceſſities of nature and to all paines &amp; torments.
A number of men doe not beleeve us now, but one day they ſhall ſee and
feele it, for if wee live not holily in this world, I that am the Preacher,
and you that are the hearers, we ſhall all ſee it, and our hearts ſhall tremble
at it. The Godly they ſhall bee in an eſtate of glorie, but the wicked in an
eſtate of ſhame then how ſhall they crie out againſt the other and ſay; yee
would not bee ruled by us, nor heare our counſell and advice. Wee have
heard what <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſaid to the men that were in the ſhip,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> 
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 27. 21. <hi>Had
you hearkned to mee, you might have ſcaped this loſſe, ſaved your ſhip and your
goods.</hi> So good preachers ſhall ſtand up in that day againſt men and ſay,
if you had hearkned to us, you might have ſhunned this loſſe, if you had
repented of your ſinnes, gotten faith in Chriſt and walked in a Holy
courſe, you might have ſaved your bodies and ſoules.</p>

               <p>Now having finiſhed the Doctrine of the <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> yet there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines
ſome queſtions to bee anſwered, although for mine owne part
I could be contented to paſſe them over, becauſe as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi>
131. 1. <hi>I have not exerciſed my ſelfe in great matters, or in things too high for
me:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 19. 24.</note> and to obſerve the order expreſſed in the <hi>Law,</hi> where the <hi>Prieſts</hi> as
well as the <hi>People</hi> had their bounds ſet them, which they might not paſſe
beyond: Nevertheleſſe, I purpoſe to anſwer your deſires and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in making ſupply of them, as farre as (by the light of Gods Truth)
I can, and as I gather by the grace of God given me.</p>
               <p>The firſt queſtion is,<note place="margin">Queſt. 1. whether mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters borne, ſhall riſe monsters.</note> 
                  <hi>whether ſuch as were borne monsters and miſhapen,
ſhall riſe monsters at the laſt day?</hi> To this <hi>Augustine</hi> anſwers, that they ſhall
not riſe monſters, but ſhall riſe corrected and amended in all the parts:
Becauſe (ſaith he) if a workeman ſhould make a thing ill-favoured and
deformed,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> he lets it not alone ſo, but will melt it againe till it bee moſt
excellent and beautifull,<note place="margin">Anſ.</note> much more can the Lord when he hath made
them deformed, melt them by death, and ſo make them glorious bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
<pb n="646" facs="tcp:17958:330"/>
faſhioned like to the Saints. Now to his Iudgement I aſſent thus
farre, that all the bodies of them that are godly, and holy people and his
choſen, their bodies ſhall riſe glorious and beautifull, though they were
borne monſters and miſhapen but they that be wicked ſhall have the ſame
deformities upon them at the day of Iudgement that they had in this
world;<note place="margin">That the defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of the Saints, ſhall onely bee repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> for deformedneſſe and to bee miſhapen, is a puniſhment for ſinne,
but at the day of Iudgement, the puniſhment of ſinne to them ſhall not
bee leſſened, but further increaſed as the Schoolemen ſay: If a wicked man
have a hand cut off, or loſe an eye juſtly for his offence by the Magiſtrate,
they ſhall bee reſtored to him at the day of Iudgement to his further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
of torment; unto which I aſſent, becauſe there are two courts, the
Court of men and of God; the Court of men extendeth but to this life
onely, and there ceaſeth, they cannot make them loſe their members for
ever; but the Iudgements of God beginne in this life to a wicked man, and
are perfected in the life to come, and therefore if a man be borne a monſter
and miſhapen and a wicked man, he ſhall riſe ſo againe: ſo we ſee here in
this world, what a man that is miſhapen and deformed would give to
have it redreſſed, and amended, and yet they doe not conſider, to live in
their ſinnes is a meanes to bring all deformities upon them.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Queſtion is,<note place="margin">Queſt. 2. In what Sex all ſhall riſe againe.</note> in what Sex we ſhall riſe againe, <hi>whether or not
men ſhall riſe men, and women women as they bee?</hi> I anſwer, they ſhall riſe in
the ſame Sex they lived in; as wee ſee <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 28. the <hi>Sadduces</hi> came to
Chriſt ſaying,<note place="margin">Anſ.</note> 
                  <hi>There was a woman that had ſeven husbands, and at laſt ſhe
died, therefore in the reſurrection whoſe wife ſhall ſhe bee of the ſeven, for ſeven
had her to wife?</hi> whereunto Chriſt doth not ſay there ſhall bee no woman
at the reſurrection, but <hi>that they ſhall not marrie, but ſhall bee as the Angells of
God in Heaven;</hi> the Sexes ſhall not ceaſe: and <hi>S. Ierome</hi> ſaith upon that
place, that Chriſt giveth us to underſtand where hee ſaith, that they ſhall
not marrie, nor give in marriage, that both ſhall riſe againe, men ſhall riſe
men, and women ſhall riſe women, and the <hi>Greeke</hi> words will beare it
though the <hi>Latine</hi> will not; ſo 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 3. 7. hee exhorts <hi>men and women to
live together as heires of the grace of life;</hi> and <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 42. it is ſaid, <hi>The
Queene of the South ſhall riſe up in Iudgement with this generation, and ſhall
condemne it, &amp;c.</hi> Hence it is manifeſt, both Sexes ſhall riſe againe.</p>
               <p>The third Queſtion is,<note place="margin">Queſt. 3. Whether Children and old men ſhall riſe ſo againe or not.</note> 
                  <hi>In what age wee ſhall riſe, whether Children ſhall riſe
Children, and old men old men? Auguſtine</hi> anſwers, that they ſhall all riſe at
the age of Chriſt, that is, at 33 yeeres of age, whereunto the <hi>Schoolemen</hi>
agree, but I dare not aſſent unto it; becauſe there is no warrant out of the
Scripture for it,<note place="margin">Anſ. 1.</note> for, <hi>whatſoever is not of faith is ſinne,</hi> and that which hath
not his warrant from the word of God, cannot bee of faith, which muſt bee
grounded on the Scripture: And <hi>Auguſtine</hi> himſelfe ſaith, whether little
Children ſhall riſe Children, wee doe not finde in the Scripture, or in
what age men ſhall riſe: indeed there is one place that ſeemes to confirme
his opinion, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 13. <hi>Till wee all come in the unitie of the faith and of the
knowledge of the Sonne of God, unto a perfect man, unto the meaſure of the ſtature
of the fulneſſe of Chriſt.</hi> Now by a generall conſent the Fathers doe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
it otherwiſe. <hi>Chryſostome</hi> ſaith, that by the fulneſſe of the age of
<pb n="647" facs="tcp:17958:330"/>
Chriſt, in this place is not meant the full age of Chriſt, but the Gifts and
Graces of Chriſt. So another Father affirmes, that by <hi>a perfect man in Chriſt,</hi>
is not meant the temporall age of the Sonne of God; ſo <hi>S. Ierome</hi> ſaith, of
the ſame place, that by the <hi>age of Chriſt</hi> is not meant the grounds of the
bodies of the Godly; but the inward man, the gifts and graces of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
of his ſoule, and not of his body.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>Tertullian</hi> is of another judgement (ſaith hee) let Chriſtians
remember this, that our ſoules ſhall receive the ſame bodies from the
which they departed, and therefore looke in what ſtature and in what age
and yeeres wee were of, in the ſame wee ſhall riſe againe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>Auguſtine</hi> doth much relie on his own opinion, for (ſaith hee)
every age is capable of bleſſedneſſe; and therfore I doe not purpoſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
of ſtrive to know in what age wee ſhall riſe in.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4</note> there are ſome reaſons to prove the contrarie: Firſt, that
there is nothing in a Child more than in a man,<note place="margin">Reaſ. 1. againſt the former opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</note> to hinder them from the
Kingdome of God, for Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Suffer little Children to come unto mee
and forbid them not, for unto ſuch belong the Kingdome of God:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſeeing there is nothing in a Child that may hinder him from the
Kingdome of God, why may not Children riſe Children againe? A
Child may bee bleſſed; for if a Childe could not have beene bleſſed, what
ſhall wee ſay if <hi>Adam</hi> had had Children in the time of innocencie, ſhould
they not have beene bleſſed? moſt certainly, they ſhould<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now if <hi>Adams</hi>
Children ſhould have beene bleſſed in the time of innocencie, much more
ſhall Children bee bleſſed in Heaven.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> Children may perfectly performe the chiefeſt act that the
people of God are to doe in Heaven, namely to praiſe God; as wee ſee
<hi>Psal.</hi> 8. <hi>Out of the mouthes of Babes and ſucklings haſt thou ordained praiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> all thoſe Chriſt raiſed in this life were raiſed in the ſame age
and ſtature, that they were in when they died, as the <hi>Maide,</hi> the <hi>widdowes
Sonne,</hi> and <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and thoſe that were raiſed at the Reſurrection of
Chriſt; or elſe how ſhould they been knowen to their friends againe
ſo perfectly.</p>
               <p>Now againſt this there is one Objection of ſome weight to bee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered;<note place="margin">Object.</note>
                  <hi>A Child is not in an estate of perfection, and there is no imperfect thing
ſhall enter into the Kingdome of Heaven.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Anſ.</note> To this I anſwer, that a Child is
imperfect onely in regard of labour and travell, but not imperfect for the
life of glorie, and a ſpirituall life; and therefore it muſt bee our wiſedome
and care to ſpend our time well in the feare of God, in repentance for our
ſinnes, and to get faith in Chriſt, and then let our age, ſex or eſtate of our
body bee what it will, wee ſhall bee bleſſed and happy when wee dye, and
wee ſhall riſe to a glorious eſtate. It is a good ſaying of <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> if a
grave ſenatours ſhould bring thee into his houſe, and ſhew thee a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of grave ſenatour,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſitting on Thornes richly clothed, with chaines
of gold about their necks and crowns on their heads, and ſhould tell thee
that after a few dayes hee would bring thee thither, and make thee one of
them; how carefull wouldeſt thou bee to pleaſe him, and fearefull to offend
him in any thing? This (ſaith hee) is our caſe, Ieſus Chriſt hath ſhewed us
<pb n="648" facs="tcp:17958:331"/>
by the eye of faith, Heaven and the bleſſed eſtate and condition of the
godly, and hath promiſed to bring us thither after a few yeares, if wee will
repent our ſinnes, get faith in Chriſt and walke holily before him; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
how carefull ſhould wee bee not to offend him; what fooles are men
to loſe eternall things for earthly, for if men would live holily here, they
ſhould live eternall in the life to come.</p>
               <p>Thus at laſt wee are come to ſpeake of Everlaſting life, for the Lord
doth raiſe the dead out of the grave, and out of the dennes of death, to
give them everlaſting life: and this is that which Chriſt hath promiſed
to his people,<note place="margin">Iohn 10. 27.</note> as we ſee <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. <hi>My ſheepe heare my voice, they follow mee, and
I give them everlaſting life:</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 47. ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Verely, verely, I ſay
unto you hee that beleeveth in mee hath everlaſting life:</hi> ſo alſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 21. 4. ſaith
the Prophet, <hi>Hee asked life of thee and thou gaveſt it him; even length of dayes
for ever and ever.</hi> So then everlaſting life is the great bleſſing that hee hath
promiſed to his people that none partake of but they, it being the Center
of a Chriſtian mans deſires, all whoſe labours, paines and endevours tend
to this and no further;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> for as wee know things when they bee at the center
there they reſt, ſtay and goe no further; ſo if once the people of God come
at this, there they ſtay and goe no farther; with thoughts hereof they
comfort themſelves in the troubles and afflictions of this life;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> 
                  <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 28. 11.
<hi>Iacob</hi> being wearie in his journey, tooke ſtones and layd them under his
head, and ſlept, where hee ſaw an heavenly viſion, a ladder carried up to
heaven, and Angels aſcending and deſcending thereupon, which comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him in all his troubles and labours; ſo Chriſtians muſt comfort them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in all the afflictions and travels of this life, with this that Chriſt hath
reared up a Ladder in his death and blood-ſhed that reacheth unto hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
therefore if Chriſtians will bee contented to walke Chriſtianly and
holily here, but a few dayes and yeeres, hee will bring them to everlaſting
life.</p>
               <p>I,<note place="margin">Object.</note> but ſome may ſay, why doe yee ſpeake of everlaſting life now, ſeeing
every man is buſie to get ſome thing to maintaine this life? I anſwer, a
man doth well to bee buſied in his honeſt labours to get ſome thing to
maintaine this life,<note place="margin">Anſ.</note> becauſe (as wee ſhall heare afterwards) this life is the
way to eternall life and the ſeede time of a Chriſtian: But ô how miſerable
a thing is it for a man to provide for this life and neglect eternall life? and
therefore our care muſt bee to provide for this life ſo as it may further us
to everlaſting life; In the <hi>Law</hi> the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were commanded to
keepe the feaſt of reconciliation, which was in the end of the yeere, when
harveſt was done, and their barnes and wine-preſſes full, which was to
teach us that in the middeſt of our joy and plentie wee ſhould ſeeke for
eternall life, and ſhould labour to have the pardon of our ſinnes, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
our ſelves to God, ſo to bee fitted for eternall life: therefore let
every man ſo attend to the things of this life as that he may labor for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
life, which is the bleſſing of all bleſſings.</p>
               <p>I,<note place="margin">Object.</note> but is everlaſting life ſo great a bleſſing, ſeeing the wicked ſhall bee
raiſed to everlaſting life? I anſwer, that the wicked ſhall bee raiſed up
to everlaſting life,<note place="margin">Anſ.</note> which life ſhall bee a continuall death to them, for looke
<pb n="649" facs="tcp:17958:331"/>
in what extremitie any man is in when hee is a dying, grieving and groa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
as though his Spirit were departing; in the like extremitie ſhall all
the wicked bee in;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> dying and never dye, breathing out their laſt breath,
and yet never breathing it out; If a man for an offence ſhould be adjudged
to lye in ſuch a hot furnace as was prepared for the three Children <hi>by Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar</hi>
but two yeeres,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> hee would thinke he were better die a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
deaths than to lye in ſuch extremitie. But what is temporarie fire to
Hell fire? It is nothing comparable to it: what is the wrath of man to the
wrath of God? nothing; there is no death to the death of the wicked, and
no torment like the torment of Hell; for their death is continuall. If a
man were put to his choyce, no doubt hee would die a thouſand deaths
temporary, before hee would dye that death. For though the deaths of
mens deviſing bee terrible, yet they are nothing compared to the death
and puniſhments that God can deviſe for the wicked? And yet wee ſee
how men labor to avoid &amp; to flie temporarie death, they will runne, ride,
take phyſicke, endure any paines to ſhunne it; which is but a flea biting as
it were, if compared which eternall death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and never feare, never labor to
ſhun this latter which is the moſt wofull of all other. We ſee how afraid
men bee of the plague, ſo as they will labour by all meanes to avoide it,
which yet brings but temporarie death; how much more afraid ſhould
wee bee of ſinne, becauſe that is the cauſe of eternall death? Here wee ſee
the madneſſe of the world which labours to avoid temporarie death, and
yet will not ſtrive to avoid ſinne which brings eternall. But let us pray to
God to avoid ſinne, that ſo wee may avoid eternall death: for the wicked
ſhall riſe no to live eternally, but to dye eternally; nay, their life ſhall bee
worſe than death, (if any thing can be worſe:) but it is otherwiſe with the
people of God, they ſhall riſe to everlaſting life, for hee beſtowes that of
none but his people and Church.</p>
               <p>Now here wee are to conſider two things:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. What it is that God doth promiſe.</item>
                  <item>2. The Continuance of it.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> hee promiſeth to his People <hi>Life:</hi> now <hi>Life</hi> is two-fold:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Naturall.<note place="margin">God promiſeth to his people. Life twofold.</note>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. Spirituall.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> the <hi>Naturall life</hi> is upheld by the uſe of meate, drinke and
phyſicke,<note place="margin">Naturall Life.</note> wherein both the good and bad have their part; for this is proper
to both: but that is not the life that our chriſtian faith (here) ſpeakes of. For
to ſpeake exactly, it is but the way to life, whereof Chriſt ſpeakes, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.
25. <hi>Agree with thy adverſarie quickly whileſt thou art in the way with him, &amp;c.</hi>
where Chriſt ſhewes, that this life is but the way to everlaſting life: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it muſt bee every mans wiſedome to paſſe this life ſo here, as that hee
may make it the way to everlaſting life.</p>
               <p>Now our ſpirituall life is upheld by having Communion with God,<note place="margin">2</note>
for <hi>as the ſoule is the life of the body,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Our ſpirituall Life.</note> 
                  <hi>ſo God is the life of the ſoule;</hi> becauſe as the
body cannot have life but by Communion with the ſoule, ſo the ſoule can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
live unleſſe it have Communion with God. Which life is ſpoken of
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 11. <hi>Thou wilt ſhew mee the path of life, in thy preſence is the fulneſſe of
<pb n="650" facs="tcp:17958:332"/>
joy, at thy right hand are pleaſures for evermore:</hi> And <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 40. Chriſt ſayes,
<hi>But yee will not come unto mee that ye may have life:</hi> And this is the life which
Chriſt promiſeth here; for it is nothing to live the life of nature, to eate,
drinke and ſleepe, which doth but nouriſh the body, and never looke to
the life of grace; but the ſpeciall care of a Chriſtian muſt bee, (for that a
number of men thinke if they can live the life of nature, they care not for
living the ſpirituall life, for faith, or repentance, or to live holily here,) the
ſpeciall thing, I ſay, which we ſhould looke to is, to live hereafter. We finde
<hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 18. <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaith unto God, <hi>Oh that Iſmael might live in thy ſight;</hi>
ſo this ſhould bee the requeſt wee ſhould make to God: Oh that I may
live the life of the Spirit, indeed I live a naturall life, but I deſire to live the
life of grace; ſo <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 119. 175. ſaith, <hi>Let my ſoule live and it ſhall
praiſe thee;</hi> my body liveth and I goe up and down with it, but let my ſoule
live and then I ſhall praiſe thee; which is the bleſſing of all bleſſings to
have Communion with God, to draw neere to him, and bee acquainted
with him by prayer, repentance and amendment of life. Now there are
two degrees of ſpirituall life:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The Life of Grace.</item>
                  <item>2. The Life of Glorie.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> in that the ſoule hath Communion with God by faith,<note place="margin">Degree of Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Life, The Life of Grace.</note> which
Communion is many times darkened and eclipſed by ſinne, when yet in
the interim it hath many a glimpſe of it, as the Sunne being under a
cloude is kept from our ſight that we cannot ſee it untill it breakes out: ſo
it is our ſinnes which hinders this ſweet Communion,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> that is, betweene
God and the ſoule. As it is with the light and the eye; as long as the eye is
well it dare boldly looke on the light, but if it catch a blow or an hurt, it
muſt have ſomewhat to hang before it,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> becauſe the light offends it. So it
is between God and the ſoule, as long as it ſtands in good termes with
God, ſo long it dare with boldneſſe come unto God: but if once it catch a
blow, have a hurt and a wound, it is afraid to come before God. This is the
life of Grace.</p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Life of Glorie</hi> is,<note place="margin">2</note> to live in the bleſſed preſence of God,<note place="margin">The Life of Glorie.</note> in the
Kingdome of Heaven, where the ſweet face of God ſhall ſhine on us, and
where wee ſhall have the Company of the Angells and Holy Spirits. But
this is the order: Firſt, wee muſt live the life of grace, and then the life of
Glorie, and therefore every man muſt acquaint himſelfe with God by
Prayer, and in repenting for his ſinnes, that ſo we may looke to have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with him in the life to come; but if we doe not acquaint our ſelves
to prayer, and in the uſe of holy meanes, then we are as ſtrangers to him,
and muſt not looke to have Communion with him in the life of Glorie.</p>
               <p>But to inlarge my ſelfe further in the point of <hi>Eternall Life;</hi> let us
conſider of it a little more, as Philoſophers ſay, the end of a thing is
the firſt thing in intention &amp; the laſt in execution, which doth order the
reſt of the actions, and is like the ſterne of a ſhip that commeth behind
but yet doth order and guide it this way and that in all the turnings; ſo
eternall life is the firſt thing in a Chriſtian mans intention and the laſt
thing in execution,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> which muſt order all our actions; for to what end doe
<pb n="651" facs="tcp:17958:332"/>
wee pray, repent us of our ſinnes and walke holily and obediently here, but
to this end that wee may come to everlaſting life. Wee ſee when the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
have beene trading a long time at Sea, at laſt they put their ſhip
into the harbor to reſt and ſtay there;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſo when Chriſtians have beene in the
Sea of this world a long time trading, they muſt put their ſhip into the
harbour, that is, come to life everlaſting, there to reſt and ſtay themſelves.
Great is the folly of the men of this world who dote and thinke upon the
things of this life, which the Devill knew well, when hee ſaid, <hi>Iob</hi> 1. <hi>all that
a man hath hee will give for his life, &amp;c.</hi> even the very skinne, and yet this life
is but a ſhaddow of that life and a way unto it. Therefore brethren, let us
bee in love with eternall life, let it bee our wiſedome, ſo to ſpend our time
here in the feare of God, as that wee may come to life everlaſting.</p>
               <p>Which is the next thing we are to ſpeak of but here mans wiſedome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
folly in that the deepeſt reach of any created underſtanding, is too
ſhallow to comprehend the imme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſity of this life; for as the Apoſtle ſaith,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 9. <hi>Eye hath not ſeene, neither eare heard, neither hath it entred into the
heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him:</hi> ſo
ſaith <hi>David</hi> alſo, <hi>Psal.</hi> 31. 19. <hi>O how great is thy goodneſſe which thou haſt laid
up for them that truſt in thee; which thou haſt wrought for them that truſt in thee
before the ſonnes of men:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>S. Paul</hi> alſo ſaith, <hi>That he was taken up into Paradiſe, &amp;
heard words which cannot bee ſpoken, which are not poſſible to be uttered.</hi> This is
ſo great a matter as the tongues of Angells are not able to expreſſe it; and
therefore when I or any other am to ſpeake of life everlaſting, wee are to
conſider that no man is able to expreſſe it;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> for if a man ſtand on the Sea-ſhore,
and looke on it, hee cannot ſee the length, breadth and the exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of it, yet they may ſee that it is an infinite great thing; ſo though life
everlaſting bee a thing, that no man can ſee the full extenſion of, yet wee
may conceive it to bee an exceeding glorious thing; therefore whatſoever
wee heare any man to ſpeake of eternall life, wee are to conceive it is more
than any man can expreſſe. It is not (as <hi>David</hi> ſaith) <hi>Pſal.</hi> 48. 8. <hi>As we have
heard, ſo wee have ſeene in the citie of our God;</hi> But as the <hi>Queene of the South,</hi>
ſaid of the wiſedome of <hi>Salomon,</hi> that <hi>the one halfe was not told mee which I
have ſeene:</hi> So wee may ſay when wee come to poſſeſſe everlaſting life; it
was a true ſaying that Gods Preachers told mee of Heaven and of everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
life, but they have not told me halfe that which I finde; and therefore
oh that God ſhould ſhew ſuch mercie to poore ſinners here in this life,
to give them hope of Heavenly things, and make them partakers of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
life; of whom wee may ſay with <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 18. <hi>Who am I ô
Lord God; and what is my Fathers houſe, that thou haſt brought mee hitherto?
And this was yet a ſmall thing in thy ſight ô Lord God, but thou haſt ſpoken alſo
of thy ſervants houſe, for a great while to come, &amp;c.</hi> So wee may ſay, Lord
what am I, and what is my Fathers houſe, that thou ſhouldeſt beſtow this
great mercie and goodneſſe on mee ſo vile a creature? Now wee are to
consider of this in two heads:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1 In the things we ſhall be freed from.</item>
                  <item>2 In the things we ſhall enjoy.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>the things we ſhall be freed from</hi> are ſix: firſt, <hi>from all neceſſities of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:</hi>
                  <pb n="652" facs="tcp:17958:333"/>
here are a number of things we ſtand in need of, an houſe to put
our heads in, meat and drinke to nouriſh us, cloathes to cover our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe,
wee have need of fire to warme us, and a bed to lye on and
ſleepe, and phyſick and a number of things; but in the life to come
God ſhall be all in all to us, muſick to our eares, <hi>Manna</hi> to our taſt, wee
ſhall drinke of the Rivers of his pleaſures, and the kingdome of God
ſhall be a houſe for us to dwell in, and the armes of God a bed for us to
lye in; wee ſhall bee fed with Angels food, with the contemplation of
God, for Chriſt wee know told the Iewes, I have meat that yee know
not. Now if the contemplation of God bee ſo great here in the eſtate
of Grace, much more it will be in the life of Glory; where wee ſhall
no more hunger nor thirſt, nor be ſubject to nakedneſſe or infirmities of
nature, we ſhall have need of nothing, for God ſhall be ſtrength to our
bones, and reſt to our eyes, &amp;c. therefore thinke of this thou that art a
poore Chriſtian to comfort thy ſelfe with, when thou art in want
and neceſſitie, when thou wanteſt food to feed thee, clothes to keepe
thee warme, that one day thou ſhalt bee freed from all the neceſſities of
nature: but the wicked ſhall be ſubject to hunger and thirſt, and to all the
miſeries of nature, if they doe deſire but the leaſt drop of water to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh
them, they ſhall not have it. The people of God ſhall be free from
all theſe things, which now kings and queenes are ſubject unto, for God
ſhall be all in all to them: <hi>At thy right hand there are joyes and pleaſures for
evermore,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 16. 11. then we ſhall not need houſe,
food, rayment, or ſleepe, but ſhall be freed from all theſe things.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Secondly, from all the labours of this life.</note> 
                  <hi>from all the labours of this life;</hi> here wee are ſubject to ſore
labour, for it is the ſentence of God upon us all, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 19. that <hi>in the
ſweat of our face we muſt eate our bread, till wee returne to duſt againe;</hi> and <hi>Pſal.</hi>
128. 2. It is the bleſſing of Gods people, that <hi>they ſhall eate the labour of
their hands;</hi> ſo we ſee all are ſubject to labour, as it is <hi>Iob</hi> 5. 7. <hi>Man is
borne to labour, as the ſparkes fly upwards:</hi> but here is the comfort of it, if a
man feares God and repents him of his ſinnes, gets faith in Chriſt and
walkes holily here, he ſhall one day bee freed from all labours; even ſo
ſaith the Spirit, <hi>Revel.</hi> 14. 13. <hi>Bleſſed are they that dye in the Lord, for they
reſt from their labours, and their workes follow them;</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> layes it
downe as a ground, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 9. that there remaines <hi>a reſt for the People of
God:</hi> here in this world they have a great deale of trouble, therefore
<hi>Habbak.</hi> 1. 13. the Prophet complaineth, <hi>Wherefore doſt thou looke upon the
tranſgreſſour, and holdeſt thy tongue when the wicked devoureth the man that is
more righteous than himſelfe?</hi> ſo <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 34. 19. <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Many are the
troubles of the righteous but the Lord doth deliver them out of all:</hi> ſo here is
the ſtay of a Chriſtian, though he hath a great deale of trouble and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
yet there remaineth a reſt for the people of God. One ſaith
well, all Gods works were good, who when he had laboured ſix dayes,
reſted the ſeventh day; ſo (ſaith he) if thy workes are good which thou
doeſt, then after thy labour thou ſhalt have reſt, when the wicked ſhall
have neither reſt nor peace. The Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> when they were in
the wilderneſſe endured ſore labour, but here was their comfort that
<pb n="653" facs="tcp:17958:333"/>
their labour tended to <hi>Canaan,</hi> to give reſt unto them, as it is <hi>Ier.</hi> 30. 2.
<hi>He walked before Israel to cauſe him to reſt:</hi> ſo though the People of God
have ſore labour forty yeares together, yet becauſe they bee in the way
to Heaven, and to the kingdome of God where they ſhall have reſt, end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
comfort, and bee free from all both bodily and ſpirituall labours,
they ſhould be comforted: now it is a labour for mee to preach, to get
learning, but then all theſe things ſhall ceaſe and we ſhall bee infinitely
indued with all heavenly knowledge, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 9. ſaith Saint <hi>Paul,
Now we know but in part, prophecie in part, but when that which is perfect is come,
then that which is imperfect ſhall be aboliſhed;</hi> ſo the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> ſaith, <hi>Wee
ſhall be all taught of God,</hi> therefore who would not but endure a little la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
here, ſeeing hee ſhall have eternall reſt? <hi>Philoſophers</hi> ſay, that <hi>All
things reſt when they come at their proper place,</hi> but heaven is the proper place
of Gods people where they ſhall have reſt; therefore let us be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to take a little labour and paines that we may have reſt in the life to
come.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> If a king ſhould ſay to us, goe walke in ſuch a high way, cole-pit,
or, in ſuch a mine, but a few dayes, after which ye ſhall be free from all
labours, then I will keepe and maintaine you for ever, who is there
but would bee contented to take any paines and labour for a little time,
that ſo he may be freed from everlaſting torment? ſo ſeeing the Lord
will one day free us from all our labours, if we will bee contented to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
here in this world, and to doe that which the Lord commandeth
us, we ſhall one day bee free from all labours and ſhall reſt in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of God.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> It was the manner of the ancient <hi>Romans,</hi> that if any
man had gone out to warres, and had returned ſafe home againe, he
ſhould ever after bee kept without labouring any more: ſo the Lord
hath ſent us out to warre againſt our ſinnes, luſts, and the devill, after
which when we returne home to heaven we ſhall be freed from all our
labours.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Thirdly, from Originall sinne.</note> 
                  <hi>wee ſhall be freed from originall ſinne, and the fruits of it;</hi> in the
time of this life, what is it that a Chriſtian would not give to bee free
from originall ſinne and the fruits thereof; indeed a prophane man is
loth to part from his ſinnes, which he cannot live without no more than
a fiſh can live without the water, as wee heard in the forenoone; but
Chriſtians will part with their meat and drinke, with any thing to bee
rid of it, for they deſire above all things to bee rid of corruption; ſo
<hi>Paul</hi> cryeth out, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. <hi>Oh wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver mee
from this body of this death?</hi> After this life wee ſhall no more diſplease
God but be free from originall ſinne, which is the corruption of nature,
now it may be repreſſed, but not quite aboliſhed till the day of death;
as the Childe was rent and torne by the devill, when hee departed out
of it; ſo ſinne will deale with us; but here is the comfort that in the
life to come wee ſhall be freed from it, and the fruits of it, and ſhall no
more grieve God:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> as <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 10. 25. when he had diſcomfited the five kings,
he did not kill them by and by, but put them into a cave, and rolled a
great ſtone on them to keepe them in, untill he had made an end of kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of his enemies, then he commanding them to roll away the ſtone
<pb n="654" facs="tcp:17958:334"/>
from the Caves mouth, they brought out theſe kings, that the chiefe
of his men might ſet their feet on their necks ere he killed them; in
like manner our great captaine Ieſus Chriſt will doe by originall ſinne
and the fruit thereof in us, which ſhall not be quite killed in this life, but
ſubdued, brought under, put into a cave (as it were) and great ſtones
rolled upon it: that is, by repentance, obedience, and prayer it ſhall bee
ſubdued here, and then at the day of judgement, Ieſus Chriſt ſhall abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
it, when hee ſhall make us ſet our foot on the neck of it; then the
people of God ſhall ſay as it is, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 55. <hi>O death, where is thy ſting?
O grave where is thy victory? the ſting of ſinne is death, and the ſtrength of
ſinne is the law, but thanks bee to God that hath given us victory through our
Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi>

                  <hi>we ſhall be freed from all worldly authority and power,</hi> then there
ſhall be no king but God ſhall bee all in all, as it is 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 27. <hi>And
when all things ſhall be ſubdued unto him, then ſhall the Sonne himſelfe likewiſe
be ſubject unto him, that did ſubdue all things under him, that God may be all in

how joyfull ſhall it bee when God ſhall raigne over us? wee ſee
when <hi>Salomon</hi> was crowned king, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 1. 40. how joyfull the people
were, it is ſaid, that <hi>they rejoyced with great joy,</hi> ſo that the earth rang with

kings ſhall come and lay downe their crownes at Gods feete, when God
ſhall raigne over the houſe of Sion? <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 91. it is ſaid, <hi>The Lord reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,

the day of judgement there ſhall not be left one wicked man to grieve

Exod.</hi> 15. 13.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> to the Children of <hi>Iſrael, Feare ye not but ſtand ſtill, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold

Sixthly, <hi>wee ſhall bee freed from all paines, ſickneſſes and diſeaſes;</hi> as it is,
<hi>Revel.</hi> 21. 4. <hi>And God ſhall wipe away all teares from their eyes, and there ſhall be
no more death,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">6</note> 
                  <hi>neither ſorrow, nor crying, neither ſhall there bee any more paine:</hi>
Now we are ſubject to the head-ach,<note place="margin">We ſhall be freed from all ſickneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and diſeaſes.</note> back-ach, tooth-ach, gout, ſtone,
and to a number of diſeaſes, but in the Life to come wee ſhall bee freed
from all. We ſee how men can bee contented to endure any paines to
be freed from theſe diſeaſes and other charges; much more ſhould wee
be contented to have the Law of God to ſearch our conſciences and to
trie us, ſo that we may be freed then from all paines and ſickneſſes: theſe
be the things we ſhall be freed from. Here therefore thinke what a life
it is that God hath called a Chriſtian to; and it muſt bee our care to
make all things light unto us, in compariſon of thoſe things wee ſhall
enjoy hereafter, and be contented to let goe all our pleaſures and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
to lay hold on eternall life whereunto wee are called. Let us part
with all things which may hinder us; as our luſts, ſinnes, corruptions,
with all our pleaſures and profits to lay hold on eternall life: As <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome</hi>
ſaith,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> if a man ſhould be called to the honour of the kings court,
how lightly would hee paſſe by all things that may hinder him from
thence: the pleaſant Meadowes, Towers, Caſtles, and all the faire hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
to haſten to the kings Court: So thou that art a Chriſtian (ſaith he)
art called to a farre greater honor, to the Court of Heaven; therefore,
how lightly ſhould ſuch an one paſſe by all things that may hinder him
from this honour where wee ſhall live with God for ever and ever. So
much for the things we ſhall be freed from;<note place="margin">What things we ſhall inioy in life everlaſting.</note> we proceed:</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>The things we ſhall enjoy</hi> may be drawne into <hi>five heads:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1</note> 
                  <hi>We ſhall have immediate ſocietie with God himſelfe;</hi> as it is, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 2.
<hi>Dearly beloved,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Immediate soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie with God.</note> 
                  <hi>now are we Sonnes of God, but it doth not appeare what we ſhall
be, and we know that when he ſhall appeare, we ſhall be like him, for wee ſhall ſee
him as he is:</hi> ſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36. 9. ſaith <hi>David, In thy light, ſhall we ſee light, &amp;c.</hi> So
<hi>Revel.</hi> 22. 4. it is ſaid, <hi>And they ſhall ſee his face, and his Name ſhall bee in
their foreheads.</hi> Divines ſay, that the eſſentiall happineſſe of the Saints
conſiſts in the beholding of God; as in nature, the more excellent and
of the more higher nature any object is, the more affected a man is with
it, and the more delight hee takes in the beholding of it; as a pleaſant
Meadow and goodly Fountaine, a heape of gold and ſilver, &amp;c. But
what is the bounty of the Creatures, to that which is in God? And
therefore if a man delights in any of the Creatures, much more hee
ſhall delight in the beholding of God:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſo the comfort that wee ſhall
have by the beholding of God, is like the light of the Sun that dimmes
the light of the candle; for our comfort in God ſhall bee ſo great, that
all the comfort of the Creatures is nothing to it; as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 28. <hi>That God ſhall be all in all.</hi> In this life (I dare boldly ſpeake it)
God is not all in all to the beſt of his ſervants; Indeed he is ſomewhat,
and a good ſomewhat to them in this life, to a comfortable portion; as
<hi>Ieremie</hi> ſaith, <hi>Lament.</hi> 3. 24. <hi>The Lord is my portion ſaith my ſoule, therefore
will I hope in him,</hi> and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63. 5. <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>For thy loving kindneſſe is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than life.</hi> So then God is ſomewhat to his ſervants, but not all in all
<pb n="656" facs="tcp:17958:335"/>
to them here; but in the life to come he ſhall be all in all to them, <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>
to their taſte, <hi>Muſicke</hi> to their eares, <hi>Light</hi> to their eyes, <hi>Ioy</hi> to their
hearts, and <hi>Reſt</hi> to their loynes, becauſe the perfection of all creatures
are in God; for if there be any creature that giveth contentment to any
man, it is a thouſand times more in God. In this life God giveth out
his goodneſſe by parts and peece-meale (as it were) in his Creatures, but
then wee ſhall have immediate ſociety with God himſelfe: Now hee
doth reveale himſelfe to us in his Word and Sacraments, but in the life
to come he ſhall be all in all. <hi>Revel.</hi> 21. 22. it is ſaid, that <hi>Iohn ſaw no Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in Heaven, for the Lord God Almighty and the Lambe are the Temple, and
the citie hath no neede of the light of the Sunne, nor of the Moone to ſhine in it,
for the glory of God did light it, and the Lambe is the light of it: Moſes wee
know put a veile on his face, becauſe the Children of Iſrael could not behold the
glory of it:</hi> ſo the Lord puts a veile before him in his Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
but in the life to come he will plucke away the veile, and reveale
Himſelfe as Hee is. Therefore let us labour to cleare our eyes, and to
cleanſe them from all ſinne, that ſo wee may looke on him to our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.
Wee ſee <hi>Eſay,</hi> 6. 5. when the Prophet ſaw the Lord in a viſion,
how hee cryeth out and ſaith, <hi>I am undone, I am undone, for I have seene
the Lord of Hosts, I am a man of polluted lippes, and I dwell amongſt a
People of polluted lippes:</hi> Now if <hi>Eſay</hi> cried out thus when hee ſaw but a
glimpſe of him, how ſhall all the ſinners of this world cry out
when they ſhall looke upon him, and behold him in terrour and
wrath?</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note> 
                  <hi>We ſhall enjoy the eternall preſence of Chriſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Eternall preſence of Chriſt wee ſhall enjoy.</note> which next unto
God himſelfe is the lovelieſt and moſt delightfull object or ſight that is;
and it is that that Chriſt prayes for, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. 24. <hi>Father, I will that they
which thou haſt given mee, bee with mee where I am, that they may behold my
glory which thou haſt given me:</hi> ſo alſo <hi>Revel.</hi> 14. 4. it is ſaid, <hi>Theſe are they
which are not defiled with women, for they are virgins; theſe follow the Lambe
wheresoever he goes.</hi> Hence it is plaine we ſhall enjoy the eternall preſence
of Chriſt, which how comfortable will it bee to a poore Chriſtian,
even the chiefeſt, even the onely thing which hee deſires? As Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>I deſire to be diſſolved and to be with Chriſt,</hi> which is beſt of all:
And the Wiſemen <hi>Matth.</hi> 2. 10. when after a long journey, and a great
deale of travell,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> they found Chriſt, it is ſaid, that <hi>they rejoyced exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
and thought all their paines and travell well beſtowed in that they
had found him: ſo when a Chriſtian hath found Chriſt, not poore and
meane lying in a manger, but gloriouſly ſitting upon a Throne, what a
comfort will this be to him, when he ſhall thinke all his labor and pains
well beſtowed? what a comfort was it to <hi>Ioſephs</hi> brethren, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 45. 4.
(in their great diſtreſſe) when he ſaid, <hi>I am Ioſeph your brother, &amp;c.</hi> ſo
what a comfort will it bee to a poore Chriſtian in that great diſtreſſe,
when Ieſus Chriſt ſhall ſay, I am your Brother, your Saviour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,
that have loſt my life for you, and ſhed out my pretious blood
to redeeme you, and gave my life and ſoule for your ſakes? Now enjoy
me to your comfort. How comfortable (I ſay) will this bee to a poore
<pb n="657" facs="tcp:17958:335"/>
Chriſtian in the perplexitie and great amazement which ſhall then
come on the world.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>We ſhall enjoy the ſocietie of all the holy Saints, of Angels and Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angels,
Prophets and Patriarkes;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The ſocietie of all Saints, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angels, &amp;c.</note> as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. 11. <hi>Many ſhall come
from the Eaſt and Weſt, and ſhall ſit downe with Abraham and Iſaak and Iaakob
in the Kingdome of Heaven:</hi> It was the end of Chriſts death to bring us
to Heaven, as it is <hi>Iohn</hi> 11. 52. where ſpeaking of his owne death, hee
ſaith, <hi>And not for that Nation onely, but that he might gather together in one
the Children of God which were ſcattered abroad:</hi> ſo that wee muſt firſt bee
gathered into the kingdome of grace, and then into the kingdome of
Glory. We ſee what a comfort it is when a few friends meete together
at a feaſt, when they have beene abſent a long time; but much more will
our comfort be when we ſhall meet together in heaven. We ſee how <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
was rapt with joy when he ſaw but two Prophets with Chriſt in the
tranſfiguration; <hi>Matth.</hi> 17. 4. (ſaith he) <hi>It is good being here, Let us make three
Tabernacles, one for thee, one for Moſes, and one for Elias:</hi> if he were thus rapt
with joy, when he ſaw but two of the Prophets onely, what will it bee
when we ſhall not onely have a ſight of two, but we ſhall have ſocietie
together with <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Archangels, Patriarkes and Prophets,</hi> and all the
holy men of God, to live with them for ever and ever? Thinke what a
comfort it will be, that after a few dayes ſpent here in the feare of God,
Repentance for our ſinnes, and new obedience, we ſhall enjoy Heaven
for ever. Therefore thinke (if thou canſt thinke) how comfortable it
will bee; and doe not loſe heavenly things for earthly, and for ſociety
with ſinners doe not loſe ſocietie and fellowſhip with the People of
God in the Kingdome of Heaven for ever.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4</note> 
                  <hi>We ſhall enjoy Lordſhip over this whole world:</hi> So we ſee <hi>Psal.</hi>
49. 14.<note place="margin">Lordſhip over all the world.</note> where it is ſaid, <hi>The upright ſhall have dominion over them in the
morning:</hi> though the People of God be kept low in this life, and have
but little comfort, yet when the great morning ſhall come the day of
judgement, then the People of God ſhall raigne over this whole world,
and have dominion and Lordſhip over it. So <hi>Revel.</hi> 21. 7. <hi>He that overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
ſhall inherit all things;</hi> that is, Hee that overcommeth his luſts and
his ſins: this may be a comfort to a poore Chriſtian, though his eſtate be
but meane and poore. It may be thou wanteſt a houſe to put thy head in,
or haſt but a poore one: Be of good comfort, if thou laboureſt to repent
thee of thy ſinnes, and to overcome thy luſts and corruptions, then thou
ſhalt poſſeſſe the new Heaven, and the new Earth, and mayeſt ſay, as it
is, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 3. <hi>Bleſſed be God, even the Father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, which
according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us againe unto a lively hope by
the Reſurrection of Ieſus Chriſt from the dead to an inheritance immortall and
undefiled, and that fadeth not away reſerved in Heaven for us.</hi> If a man hath
but little in poſſeſſion, and great matters in reverſion, hee will comfort
himſelfe and ſay, I thanke God though mine eſtate bee but meane and
poore now,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> yet one day I ſhall have ſomewhat that will keepe mee like
a man: ſo a Chriſtian may comfort himſelfe, and ſay, I thanke God, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
my eſtate be but meane and poore, ſo as I have but little in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion,
<pb n="658" facs="tcp:17958:336"/>
yet I have a great reverſion, I ſhall bee Lord over this whole
world.</p>
               <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5</note> 
                  <hi>We ſhall enjoy a continuall Sabbath to the Lord;</hi> In this life wee
keepe but every ſeventh day a Sabbath,<note place="margin">A con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>inuall Sabbath to the Lord.</note> which day to a Spirituall man
is the comfortableſt; but to a Carnall man, heavie and irkeſome: Here
we keepe but one of ſeven, but there every day ſhall bee a Sabbath to
them. As wee ſee <hi>Eſay</hi> 66. 23. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſſe as from one new
Moone to another, and from one Sabbath to another ſhall all fleſh come to worſhip
before me, ſaith the Lord:</hi> ſo <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 9. he ſaith, there remaineth therefore a
reſt to the People of God. Now wee keepe but one day of ſeven, but
then we ſhall keepe every day a Sabbath unto the Lord, which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
comfortable, as it appeares, <hi>Revel.</hi> 15. 2. where we ſee how thoſe
that paſſed over the glaſſie Sea, did ſing the ſong of <hi>Moſes and the Lambe:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So all the People of God when they have paſſed the glaſſie Sea of this
world, ſhall ſing ſongs of deliverance, and praiſe the Lord who hath
delivered them from the power of ſinne, the Divell and Hell. The
Prophet <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 84. 4. ſaith, Bleſſed are they that dwell in thine
houſe, they will ever be praiſing thee: and <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſpeaking of this
place (ſaith hee) what is that which makes a man bleſſed? <hi>Every man
who is bleſſed, is bleſſed either by poſſeſſing, or doing of ſome thing;</hi> but then we
ſhall poſſeſſe the houſe it ſelfe, and therefore ſhall be bleſſed. For a man
may dwell in theſe houſes, and yet be a poore man, but he that dwels in
the Houſe of God is rich.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> One may dwell in theſe houſes and be affraid
theeves; but if wee dwell in the houſes of God, wee neede not bee
affraid of any ſuch things, for God will be a defence to ſuch. How ſhall
a man be bleſſed in doing any thing? our workes which wee doe here
there is neceſſity in the doing of them, but <hi>there is no neceſſitie in Heaven,
where all ſhall be done willingly.</hi> For take away jarres and brawles, and there
is no need of Lawyers; take away wounds and hurts, and there is no
neede of a Chirurgeon; take away diſeaſes, and there is no neede of a
Phyſitian; take away hunger, and we ſhall not need to plow nor ſow;
take away thirſt, and wee ſhall not need drinke: Nay, let us come to
things of a higher nature, as to feede the hungry, cloth the naked, viſit
the ſicke, they ſhall doe none of theſe things, but ſhall ſing prayſes unto
God, and give thankes to him for his mercy and goodneſſe to them: ſo
they ſhall be every way bleſſed.</p>
               <p>And therefore thinke (if thou canſt thinke) what a happy and bleſſed
life this will be: Firſt, that wee ſhall enjoy God, and have immediate
ſocietie with Him: Secondly, that we ſhall have the preſence of Chriſt:
And thirdly, that we ſhall have ſocietie with al the holy People of God:
Forthly, that we ſhal have dominion &amp; lordſhip over his whole world:
And laſtly, that we ſhall keepe a continuall Sabbath to the Lord, where
we ſhall continually praiſe him, and ſpend all our time in lauding of him.</p>
               <p>Now the next thing is the continuance of this life,<note place="margin">The continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting.</note> how long
wee ſhall enjoy it. It ſhall not bee for dayes, moneths, yeeres and ages
onely; but it ſhall bee everlaſting as the Scripture tells us; not for a
few dayes and yeeres, but it is for ever and ever. For when a man hath
<pb n="659" facs="tcp:17958:336"/>
lived ſo many thouſand ages as there are piles of graſſe on the ground,
piles of ſand on the ſhore; Starres in the Skie, they ſhall bee as new to
beginne againe,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> as the firſt day; and therefore thinke (if thou canſt
thinke) what a life it is that God wil give us.</p>
               <p>Now it is called <hi>everlaſting life,</hi> in oppoſition to the fraile and fickle
life that we live here, which is not everlaſting, but a dying and a decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
life, whereof one ſayes well: as ſoone as a man is borne, he is a dying,
and the further we grow into this life, the nearer we are to death. As a
man that hath taken a Leaſe,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> as ſoone as it is taken it beginnes to expire,
and never reſts till it comes to an end; ſo this life, as ſoone as we enter in
it, it beginnes to expire, and never ceaſeth waſting till it is runne to an
end: So the life which we live here is a decaying life, which every lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
diſaſter may take away, a ſlip with a mans foote, a fall off an horſe, a
ſtone out of a wall, a tile off an houſe, a crum of bread going awry, &amp;c.
But the life which God giveth us in Heaven ſhall be everlaſting, as long
as there is God and Chriſt who giveth it, whoſe glory ſhall not bee
greater at the firſt, then afterwards. But the ſame as great for ever, &amp; the
joy and comfort which we ſhall have (when we have beene there 1000.
thouſand yeeres) as great as it was the ſame day wee came thither. All
the things in this life, though we take delight in them, yet in time wee
we ſhall be weary of them.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> As when a man commeth into a fine Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
being delighted with the pleaſant walkes and flowers, yet when
he hath beene there a while, he becomes weary of it; ſo likewiſe when
a man is weary, and goes to bed, he is delighted with it a while, and in
time he is weary and loves to riſe, though it bee never ſo ſoft: But the
joyes of Heaven and the glory thereof we ſhall never be weary of them,
but when wee have beene there as many yeeres as there is ſands
on the Sea ſhore, it will bee as comfortable as it was the firſt day wee
came thither.<note place="margin">1. Pet. 1. 4.</note> And therefore as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, ſeeing wee are borne
a-new, not of mortall ſeed, but of immortall by the Word of God, <hi>to an
inheritance incorruptible and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reſerved in
Heaven for us:</hi> let us ſo love and ſerve God in ſinceritie, as we may come
thither; for the life that we ſhall live in Heaven, ſhall be everlaſting, the
glory whereof ſhall never decay.</p>
               <p>And therefore ſtand ſtill yee people of God, and behold the great
things that God hath prepared for you; let goe all the pleaſures and
profits of this life, and lay hold on eternall life, and bee not ſlothfull to
come and poſſeſſe it. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith well, All men can bee contented
with life everlaſting, to ſee God and to behold him in glory, but they
are not carefull to walke in the way that leadeth to life. Therefore it
muſt be the care of every Chriſtian to repent of his ſinnes, to get faith
in Chriſt, to paſſe his time in holineſſe and feare before God, that
ſo when he commeth to die, hee may make a happy exchange, to paſſe
from Earth to Heaven, from Men to God, from an eſtate of miſery to
an eſtate of happineſſe and glory, from a temporall life to a life eternall.
And now that wee are ready to diſmiſſe this aſſembly, and finiſh this
long worke, the Lord knowing whether ever we ſhall meete together
<pb n="660" facs="tcp:17958:337"/>
againe all in this place; (ſeeing upon the leaſt occaſions we ſee ſuch
examples from time to time of our mortalitie, and ſhortneſſe of life)
therefore let us ſo paſſe our time here in holineſſe before God, ſo, as
that we may meete together in glory and happines in the life to come;
which I beſeech the Lord to bring us to for Chriſts ſake.</p>
