            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>TO some it may seem impertinent, to usher a <hi>Letter</hi> into the World with a <hi>Preface;</hi> as to which I shall make no other Apology, but that the Importunity of those who prevail d with me to make the <hi>Letter</hi> Publick, is likewise the Cause of this piece of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formality.</p>
            <p>Those <hi>Gentlemen</hi> being of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, That the following <hi>Remarks</hi> might do <hi>some Service,</hi> they are exposed to the Censure of the World, in hopes that as in a General Assault, the Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of the Weak as well as the Efforts of the Strong, are taken in good Part, the <hi>Author</hi> may escape the Censure of having been too Officious.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:96634:3"/>
No Man can be so little acquainted with the Posture of Affairs in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as not to know that our <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Civil Liberties</hi> have suffered ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Attacks from Persons of different In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests and Principles. But, perhaps we Labour under the Influences of one of the strangest <hi>Conjunctions,</hi> at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, that ever we did since form'd into a <hi>Regular Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Any Man that would have offered to fore-tell, some Years ago, That those who were for having <hi>Property</hi> swallow'd up by <hi>Prerogative,</hi> should in so small a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution of Time,</hi> set up for Patriots to their Country; and that so many of those who complain'd of <hi>Innovations</hi> in <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> should have joyned with them against a <hi>Government</hi> found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Peoples free Choice, would have been look'd upon as an Enthusiast or Brain sick Person.</p>
            <p>Yet such is our Misfortune, That we have seen the Church of <hi>England</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:96634:3"/>
deserted, but accused of Apostacy by some who pretended to be her most Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and Dutiful Sons, meerly because she hath Recogniz'd the Title of a Prince who generously rescued her from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring Jaws of <hi>Popery,</hi> in opposition to that of another, who made all the haste he could to offer her up in Sacrifice to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And at the same time we have seen too many of those from whose Mouths nothing was to be heard but Complaints of an insupportable Tyranny in former Reigns, ingratefully joyn with those who were the Tools and Promoters of it, to make the Throne of a King, who Gloriously knock'd off our Fetters, unstable and uneasie.</p>
            <p>And now, which is strangest of all, a third Party is taken into the Combinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who, under pretext of joining with them, to assert our <hi>Liberty,</hi> not only strike at the Foundation of the <hi>Civil Government,</hi> but have boldly laid the Axe to the Root of the Tree, and avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
<pb facs="tcp:96634:4"/>
endeavour the subversion of the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> dealing their Blows indifferently amongst those of the Church of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Dissenters</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is plain from many Instances, but from none more than the Life of Mr. <hi>Milton,</hi> latel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> published by <hi>J.

               </gap> Feet, Gulphs of Benefices, and dry Pits of Spiritual Devotion; the Ministry as useless, for the most part, to their Flocks, as to the Sheep in <hi>Smithfield</hi> Pens, and to be meer Hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>ings if they have any Benefices; Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age he would have dissolvable for as tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling Causes, (as I have heard it was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in his own Country) as <hi>pissing the Bed.</hi> And abundance of other things, equally destructive to <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Civil Society.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:96634:4"/>
Yet he takes mighty Care to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the <hi>Establishment</hi> of a <hi>Liberty</hi> to the <hi>Socinians,</hi> who treat the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of our Saviour with as much Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt as they do Church and State, and make <hi>Mahometism</hi> and <hi>Christianity</hi> all one in the main, as I have prov'd in the following Sheets.</p>
            <p>The matter being thus, it seems high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly necessary to enquire by what secret Springs such a Person is acted, and whether those of so near an Alliance in <hi>Religion</hi> with the <hi>Turks,</hi> are not as capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of being <hi>Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>If the following <hi>Remarks</hi> may any way excite those who are concerned, to make such <hi>Enquiries,</hi> or be a <hi>Warning</hi> to well-meaning Persons that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded by the specious Pretensions of <hi>J.

Socinians,</hi> about an Age ago, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> and <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Government,</hi> I shall think my self abundantly Rewarded.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May the God of Heaven and Earth, by whom Kings Reign and Princes decree Justice, direct His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty and His High Court of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to such Measures as may se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure our</hi> Nation <hi>and</hi> Religion <hi>from the Attempts of such blasphemous Incendiaries, who are Enemies to all</hi> Government, <hi>deny the</hi> Lord <hi>that bought them, encourage</hi> Libertinism, <hi>and would reduce us again to hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> Paganism, <hi>under a Pretence of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing</hi> Reason.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Wish you had sav'd your self and me the Trouble, when you desired my Thoughts of the Life of Mr. <hi>John Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> publish'd lately by <hi>J.

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:96634:6"/>
in such Colours, as <hi>J. T.</hi> hath thought fit to draw him in. It is storied of the <hi>Italian</hi> Painters, That they Compliment their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses by drawing the blessed Virgin accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Features; and in truth I am of Opinion that the Author design'd the like Compliment to himself in forming Mr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s Character; for his natural and acquir'd Parts, Estate, Publick Post, Great Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Universal Esteem excepted, the Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel seems to be drawn as near as may be. This you may perhaps think severe, but if you consult the last two Pages of this <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Life,</hi> you will find it to be exactly true: For there we have an Account, <q>That Mr. <hi>Milton</hi> in his early days was a favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Puritans; in his middle Years he was best pleased with the Independents and Anabaptists, as allowing of more Liberty than others, and coming nearest in his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to the Primitive Practice; but in the latter part of his Life he was not a profess'd Member of any particular Sect among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians; he frequented none of their Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, nor made use of their peculiar Rites in his Family.</q> This, I am inform'd, is so exactly the Authors own Temper, that no Man, who knows him, can doubt of it; for he was formerly a Papist, then a Church of <hi>England</hi> Man, next a Presbyterian, and is now best pleased with the Independents and Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:96634:6"/>
and for that very Reason too, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they allow him more Liberty than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do; and therefore he Compliments them with coming nearest the Primitive Practice in his Opinion. But then he gives them fair Warning, that in the latter part of his Life, he will frequent none of their Assemblies, nor make use of none of their peculiar Rites; a mighty Loss, and which they ought now to bewail, as Mermaids do the approaching Winter in the middle of Summer. Now what Man alive, that has any value for Mr. <hi>Milton</hi>'s Character, can with Patience hear that great Man represented as an Hypocrite in his Youth, a Libertine in his middle Age, a Deist a little after, and an Atheist at last? Yet such is the noble Character assign'd him by <hi>J. T.</hi> For in his Youth he says, <hi>Page</hi> 27. <hi>He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged against the Bishops to help the Puritan Ministers, who were inferiour to the other in Learning.</hi> Page 30 and 34. <hi>He wrote in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Sinectymnuus</hi> [which is altogether Presbyterian.] Page 61. he says, <hi>This was only a Service to the Presbyterians by accident, for he never intended to set up the Consistorian Tribunal in the room of the Hierarchy.</hi> And yet, Page 77. <hi>He brings him in, enjoyning the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Model, in these words:</hi> 
               <q>Let them as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble in Consistory with their Elders and Deacons, to the preserving of Church-Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, each in his several Charge.</q> If this
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:96634:7"/>
be not either to make Mr. <hi>Milton,</hi> or <hi>J. T.</hi> his Biographer, guilty of Hypocrisie and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, let the World judge.</p>
            <p>Then as to the Charge of <hi>Libertinism</hi> he fixes it plainly upon him, <hi>Page</hi> 52, &amp;c. where he gives us an Account of, <q>His disowning his Wife, and resolving never to take her back again, because she refused to come to him when sent for, and dismiss'd his Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger with Contempt; and at the same time kept Gaudy-Days with his Friends, and particularly the Lady <hi>Margaret Lee,</hi> whose sprightly Wit and good Sense drew frequent Visits from him; that thereupon he publish'd his <hi>Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce.</hi> And, <hi>Page</hi> 70. says, That he was seriously treating a Marriage with a young Lady of great Wit and Beauty, when his Wife threw her self at his Feet, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging her Fault, and begging Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; and yet at first he seemed inexora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</q> If any thing of this be the Character of a Christian, and not exactly that of a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertine, Let Men of Sense and Religion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine.</p>
            <p>Then as to the Charge of <hi>Deism,</hi> we are told, <hi>p.</hi> 151. <q>That Mr. <hi>Milton</hi> ever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed the profoundest Reverence to the Deity, as well in Deeds as Words; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 words">

Properties of Goodness, Justice and Mercy, were the adequate Rule of Human Actions; nor less the Object of Imitation for private Advantages, than of Admiration or Respect for their own Excellence and Perfection.</q> By <hi>J. T</hi>'s leave, I must make bold to say, That this fine and high-flown period, makes either himself, or his Hero, to have a very false Notion of the Deity; for to make the Infinite Perfections and Attributes of God an adequate Rule for Human Actions, is, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the literal sense of the Word, to make Man equal to God; whereas we find, by Experience, that his Revealed Will is more than an adequate Rule to the Holiest of Men, so that they come infinitely short of it. But we want words to express; nay, thoughts to conceive, how much shorter we must needs come of those Incomprehensible Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes just now mentioned: This is like <hi>Job</hi>'s Friends, to darken Council by Words with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Knowledge. But if we are to believe God himself, his written Word is our Rule; without which, we see the greatest and wisest of Men, who had the highest and most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd Notions of his Attributes, have but grop'd, like blind Men, in the dark. The lustre and brightness of his Perfections, serv'd only to dazle their Eyes, and confound their Apprehensions. But in his Word, he hath been graciously pleas'd to condescend to our
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:96634:8"/>
Infirmities and Weaknesses, and revealed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self so, in, and through a Mediator, as that we may have access, with boldness, to his Throne, and a fuller knowledge of him, and our duty towards him, than ever we could otherwise have had. This, there's no doubt, Mr. <hi>Milton</hi> understood as well as any Man, but it's <hi>J. T</hi>'s business to represent him as a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourer of the <hi>Socinians</hi> and <hi>Deists,</hi> who not contented with Revelation, form to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Notions of a Deity according to their own corrupt Reason.</p>
            <p>In the last place, he makes him an Atheist, a perfect Separatist from all Christian Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, and a neglecter of their Rites in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. What he means by their Rites, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be Publick, Family, and Closet-Worship, I know not; and if he neglected those, by the Verdict of the Prophets and Apostles, he was liable to the Vengeance of the Almighty, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10. 25. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 25. Thus then you see, how kindly Mr. <hi>Milton</hi> is treated by <hi>J. T.</hi> he had rather subject him to damnation it self, than not have him a Patron to his own <hi>Socinian</hi> Principles. It must be own'd indeed, <hi>that there's no such Mystery as this to be found in Christianity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to pursue this point a little further, he makes Mr. <hi>Milton</hi> a perfect Enemy to all sorts of Clergy-men and Churches, which is another mighty point gain'd to the <hi>Socinians.</hi>

For proof of this, he tells us, <hi>p.</hi> 27. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 
               <q>That he heartily engaged in the dispute, against the Order and Vices of the Bishops; that he accounted our retaining of Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and confining the Power of Ordination to Diocesan Bishops, the chief Impediments of a perfect Reformation; That our Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies are senceless in themselves, and serve for nothing but to facilitate our return to Popery; That our Bishops, tho' they had renounc'd the Pope, they hugg'd the Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and shar'd the Authority among themselves, and made their prostitute Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities the Common Stales to countenance every Politic fetch; That the Mortalest Diseases and Convulsions of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, did ever proceed from the Craft of the Prelates. <hi>P.</hi> 47. That the Bishops were the Gulphs and Whirlpools of all Benefices, and the Dry Pits of all sound Doctrine; That Chaplains were the Sewers, or Yeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men-Ushers of Devotion, where the Master is too Resty, or too Rich, to say his own Prayers, or to bless his own Table. <hi>P.</hi> 48.

               </q> which <hi>J. T.</hi> thinks not severe enough, and therefore he is very liberal of his own paultry Choler upon that Party, as we shall see af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards.</p>

               <hi>P.</hi> 116. he gives us an account of his rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the <hi>Independents,</hi> and upbraiding them with taking that Name, whilst they sought to be dependent on the Magistrates for their Maintenance; which two things, <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> and <hi>State-hire</hi> in Religion, can never consist long or certainly together.</p>
            <p>Thus the Church of <hi>England, Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Independents,</hi> are obliged to <hi>J.

has a mighty dependance on that Party at present, he finds some amongst them that are ready to assist him in propagating his Anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical Notions, to the disturbance of a well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>settled Government and therefore he must deal gently with his Friends.

the latter, because he knows he may do so with more safety.</p>
            <p>His Malice against the Presbyterians is very remarkable, he thinks, as was hinted before, That Mr. <hi>Milton</hi> did not say enough against them, and therefore he is resolved to supply that Defect out of his own Stores. As <hi>Page</hi> 64. he says, <hi>They were more intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably Rigorous, Severe and Tyrannical in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament times than the Bishops were before.</hi> Page 73. <hi>That the Presbyterian Ministers, who from the beginning were the Kings mortal Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, were then enrag'd that the Independents and other Sects should enjoy either Life or Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, (not angry at the Fact but the Faction) did tragically declaim in their Pulpits, that the King's Usage was very hard, that his Person was Sacred and Inviolable, and that any Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence offered to him in the Field (much less by the Hands of an Executioner) was contrary to the Doctrine of the Reformed Churches.</hi>

            <p>I am of Opinion, That <hi>J. T</hi>'s new Friends, the <hi>Independents,</hi> will scarely thank him for this Vindication of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:96634:12"/>
that know the History of those Times, are not ignorant that the Presbyterians, whilst they had any Interest in the Parliament or Army, always expressed themselves with Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the King's Person, and that they Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his last Concessions a sufficient Ground to Treat with Him; and were altogether against his Trial and Death, as having taken Arms for the Defence of their Liberties and Religion, and not the Destruction of their Prince. But <hi>J.

their own sufferings of late have made them more tender to the Consciences of others. This naturally leads Men to think that they have not repented of their Rigour in the Civil Wars, and that should the Dissenters once more get the Secular Sword into their Hands, they would press Uniformity of Sentiments in Religion as far as any other</hi> Protestants <hi>or</hi> Papists <hi>ever yet have done; witness their inhumane Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of</hi> Daniel Williams, <hi>a sober Man and judicious Divine, for no Cause that I can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, but that he made Christianity plainer than some of his Collegues in the Ministry.</hi>

He tells us, That few will believe that <hi>the English Presbyterians</hi> differ from their Brethren in <hi>Scotland</hi> about Persecution: so that here's both Nonsense and Contradictions.</p>
            <p>But we must pardon him, his Passion was in a ferment upon the Remembrance that <hi>Aikenhead,</hi> one of his Brethren in Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,

was hang'd by the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> some time ago, and therefore he Vows Revenge upon the whole <hi>Bulk of those</hi> of that Name in both Nations.</p>
            <p>That you may the better judge whether the Scotch <hi>Presbyterians</hi> deserve the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Persecutors or not, for hanging that Fellow, I shall give you an Account of what was prov'd upon him at his Trial, as follows, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>That he denied the Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence of a Deity, maintaining that God, Nature and the World were the same thing; that Divinity and the Doctrine of Christianity, was a Rhapsodie of fansied and ill-invented Nonsense, patch'd up part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Moral Doctrines of Philosophers and Poetical Fictions, and Extravagant Chimera's He call'd the Old Testament <hi>Ezra</hi>'s Fables, saying, That <hi>Ezra</hi> was the Inventer thereof. He affirmed the New Testament to be the History of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postor Jesus Christ, who (he said) had learn'd Magick in <hi>Egypt;</hi> by which he made the Ignorant believe he wrought Miracles. He also cursed our Holy Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and did affirm, That the Doctrine of Redemption by Jesus Christ, was a proud and presumptuous Device, and that the Inventers thereof are damned, if after
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:96634:14"/>
this Life there be either Reward or Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment. He likewise affirmed, That if ever there was such a Man as <hi>Moses,</hi> he was a Magician and Impostor also; and preferred him and <hi>Mahomet,</hi> as having more Skill in their Arts (as he termed it) than the blessed Jesus. He said, That he hoped to see Christianity much weakned, and that he was consident, in a short time, it would be utterly extirpated.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now, let any Man judge, whether such a Monster of Blasphemy deserved to live, and what sort of a Man <hi>J.

great Persons, should be publish'd and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd in those Primitive Times.</hi> I confess my self to be but slenderly Vers'd in Antiquity, and therefore the discovery of my Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in that Point is the more pardonable; but at the same time I must needs say, That I don't remember of any supposititious Piece alledg'd upon our Saviour, his Answer to <hi>Abgarus</hi>'s <hi>Letter excepted,</hi> I know that the Divine Authority of the Epistle to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,</hi> of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> and others have been objected against by some; and that the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies,</hi> and <hi>Canons,</hi> &amp;c. father'd upon some of the Apostles, are rejected by many: But to question the Divine Authority of any of those Books, of the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Testament,</hi> that by Christians in General are received as Canonical, has a dangerous Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency. And we have the more Reason to suspect <hi>J. T</hi>'s Words, because of the Hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Opinions he hath already publish'd, That another of the Party did sometime ago write a Book, call'd, <hi>The Oracles of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> with a design to ridicule Revelation, and that it is certainly the Interest of the <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> to do so, because they are not able to withstand the irresistible <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> Force of those Arguments which are brought against them from the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Testament.</hi> But, in the mean time, what Occasion was there
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:96634:15"/>
for <hi>J. T.</hi> in his Account of Mr. <hi>Milton</hi>'s Life, to advance such Propositions, or to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the World with his own silly Thoughts and malicious Reflections? Mr. <hi>Milton</hi>'s Name is indeed sufficient to procure some Regard to the Text; but I don't know any Reason why the World should have the least Esteem for <hi>J. T</hi>'s Comment.</p>
            <p>We have seen enough of the Vomit that <hi>J. T.</hi> hath disgorged from his foul stomach against Religion, and the Ordinance of the Ministry, and shall, in the next place, take notice of another design he has upon our Morals; and that is, about the Affair of Marriage and Divorce, <hi>p.</hi> 55. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where he gives an account of Mr. <hi>Milton</hi>'s Opinion concerning Divorce, occasioned by his Wifes refusing to come to him when sent for, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as mentioned before. I shall not now enter upon the dispute at large, that point being handled by many Authors, and of late, in a Book call'd, <hi>Concubinage and Poligamy dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd,</hi> in Answer to <hi>Butler</hi>'s <hi>Defence of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubinage.</hi> But this is evident, that if other Causes be assign'd for Divorce, than <hi>Adultery,</hi> and wilful <hi>Desertion,</hi> which are the only two Cases we find mentioned in the N. Testament, it will be attended with horrid consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and especially if the Party be allow'd
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:96634:15"/>
to be judge in their own Case, as <hi>J. T.</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents Mr. <hi>Milton</hi> to have been in his; and in defence of his Practice, to have laid down this Position, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Indisposition, Unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, or contrary Humours, proceeding from any unchangeable Cause in Nature, hindring, and always likewise to hinder the main ends and benefits of Conjugal Society, (that is to say, Peace and Delight) are greater Reasons of Divorce, than Adultery, or Natural <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>rigidity, provided there be a mutual Consent for Separation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether <hi>J. T.</hi> represents Mr. <hi>Milton</hi>'s Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument fairly or not I know not, but any one may see, that admitting those Causes to be sufficient, there's this great defect in the Position, <hi>viz.</hi> That there's no mention of having the Allowance of the Church and Civil Magistrate; nor, indeed, of so much as asking it, which, if neglected in such a Case, would quickly fill the Kingdom with Fornication, Adultery, and a Spurious Issue. Many things might be objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Position it self, as that it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Scripture, which assigns a <hi>Meet help,</hi> and <hi>the Propagating of a Godly Seed as the chief ends of Marriage,</hi> Gen. 2. 18. 1. 2. 8. <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 15. whereas <hi>Peace and Delight</hi> might have been had without it; the Man could not have fallen into Strife,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:96634:16"/>
when there was no other Human Creature for him to disagree with; and he had the Perfections of God and himself, and all the Beauties of the Creation to delight in, without the Woman. But this is the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief on't, when Men will become Wise above what is written, they do but disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their own Folly and Weakness.</p>
            <p>Then again; for <hi>Indisposition</hi> to be a cause of Divorce, is Unreasonable as well as Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian. It is unreasonable; for at that rate, Sickly and Indispos'd Persons must be expos'd to unavoidable Calamities, and the hazard o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> being neglected by all others, when abandon'd by so near a Relation. It is an addition unto, or rather an overwhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with Grief; must expose their Children to Contempt, and occasion fatal Discord in Families, betwixt Children of different Mothers and Fathers, and their Relations; and, by consequence, is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with (that Peace and Profit) which <hi>J. T.</hi> says are the main ends of Conjugal Society.</p>
            <p>It would be Unchristian, as contrary to our Saviours Rule, <hi>of doing as we would be done by,</hi> and of making any other Cause of Divorce, but <hi>Adultery and Desertion.</hi> It
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:96634:16"/>
would be as Unnatural, as for a sound part of the Body to neglect a wounded Limb, seeing the Scripture tells us, that a Man and his Wife become one Flesh.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Contrary Humours</hi> is yet less tolerable; for in that Case, either of the Parties, when they had a mind to change, would be sure to be cross humour'd on purpose.</p>
            <p>Then as to <hi>unchangeable Causes in Nature, hindring the ends of Conjugal Society,</hi> they are sooner pretended than determin'd, and not always easie to be discover'd.</p>
            <p>As to <hi>the Mutual Consent,</hi> I have already said that it is not enough, without the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of the Church and Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate; and besides, it may be obtain'd by force from the Injur'd Party, who may be rendred so uneasie, that they will chuse ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Consent, than to live in perpetual vexation and danger. These are some ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Objections, which occur to me imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately upon reading what <hi>J. T.</hi> calls Mr. <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s grand Position; as to his own, I think them unworthy of a Reply, or any further Remark, than that he had nothing to do to mix his own Impertinent Jargon with Mr. <hi>Milton</hi>'s Life; but it is Natural for one,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:96634:17"/>
who does all he can to sap the Foundations of Christianity, to be a Patron of Immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality.</p>
            <p>He knows how grateful a Doctrine it is to Libertines, which he lays down of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, <hi>p.</hi> 56. That the Marriage Covenant may be undone, when the Persons find things otherwise than they promise themselves; and that it is Tyranny to punish their so doing. The Sparks of the Town will, no doubt, congratulate his happy Invention for such a plausible way of changing Wives in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Misses; for at this rate, when any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taste arises betwixt them and their Wives, theres no more to do, but for both Parties to draw Stakes, as he words it, and leave Matters as they were before. If this be the Purity of the <hi>Socinian</hi> Doctrine, we may ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally conclude it never came down from Heaven.</p>
            <p>Another, and which I suppose is his main design, is to promote the Cause of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth; but! remember it was object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against the late King <hi>James</hi>'s Regulation, that he imployed mean and unfit Persons in the Design, and therefore it was generally concluded it would not succeed. I am far from thinking that <hi>J. T.</hi> is imployed by the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:96634:17"/>
bulk of the Commonwealth Party, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he may be by a few; but this I think I may venture to say, That his Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Concern will add no Reputation to their Cause. If the advancement of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinianism</hi> and <hi>Immorality,</hi> and an unlimited Toleration to Heresies of all sorts, must be the Preliminaries. It's very reasonable to think, that it will be a long while, ere a People zealous for the Christian Religion, express'd in the Doctrinal Articles of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> can think of coming to a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with those who are for a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>
            <p>It's pleasant to find those, who have so well, and so justly baffled the Doctrine of the <hi>Jure Divino-ship</hi> of Kingly Government, exclusive of all others, fall into the same dotage themselves as to a Commonwealth. And thus <hi>J. T</hi> brings in Mr. <hi>Milton, p.</hi> 120, saying, That Christ forbad his Disciples to admit of any such Heathenish Government as that of Kings; from that Scripture, <hi>The Kings of the Gentiles exercise Lordship over them, and they that exercise Authority upon them are called Benefactors, but you shall not do so.</hi> This Text hath been often and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly urg'd against Lording it over the Faith of Christians, and domineering over God's
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:96634:18"/>
Heritage, which the Apostles themselves disclaim, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 24. but there seems no reason (with deference to Mr. <hi>Milton</hi>'s Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) to apply it against Kingly Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, any more than against that by States; for whereas <hi>Luke</hi> calls them <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, Kings. <hi>Matthew</hi> calls them <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, which signifies any other Princes or Rulers. <hi>Mark</hi> calls them <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, those who are <hi>accounted to Rule,</hi> and <hi>great ones;</hi> so that at this rate of arguing, no sort of Magistrate must be allowed at all, not so much as a Mayor in a Country Corporation, who, in respect of the Inferiour Burgers and Towns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, may well be accounted <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Then let <hi>J. T.</hi> see to it, how he will be able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend any Commonwealth, that ever was, or ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Besides, it is ridiculous to call Kingly Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment Heathenish, when it was the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Jews, and approved of by God himself, who gave a Law to direct their Kings in their Administration, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:96634:18"/>
               <hi>v.</hi> 14. Our Saviour commanded Tribute to be paid to <hi>Gaesar,</hi> and did not disown, but plainly confess his Right to be King of the <hi>Jews</hi> himself, tho' he declared that his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom was not of this World.</p>
            <p>And the Apostle, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 13, 14. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands submission to <hi>every Ordinance of Man, whether it be to the King as Supreme, or unto Governours,</hi> without any surmise, or hint, that when Nations became Christian, they should reject Kingly Government.</p>
            <p>On the contrary; it is a plain and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative Injunction to Christians to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have themselves peaceably under whatever Form of Government Providence should cast their Lot; <hi>not to use their Liberty for a Cloak of Licentiousness, but to Fear God and Honour the King;</hi> than which there can be nothing that more directly condemns the Practice of <hi>J. T.</hi> and those of this Kidney, who speak and write reproachfully of all Kings, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness their Healths; that the Thrones of Kings may be upon their own Heads, and their Crowns under the Peoples Feet; and their sly and malicious Inclinations in their Pamphlets, about <hi>Standing Armies,</hi> and others; against His present Majesty's Person and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration, tho' the best King that ever <hi>England</hi> had.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:96634:19"/>
It's scarcely to be supposed, That one of <hi>J. T</hi>'s changeable Temper, is capable of good Advice; but it were to be wish'd, that those who think a Commonwealth the best Form of Government, would consider that the time wherein Mr. <hi>Milton</hi> liv'd and ours is different, the Constitution was then dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd, the King beheaded, his Issue banish'd, the Bishops and their Form of Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment pull'd down; so that the People had then a fair Opportunity to form them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into a Commonwealth, without any further Bloodshed or Trouble; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Mr. <hi>Milton</hi> and other Men might less scruple to do all that in them lay to erect that sort of Government here; but the Case is now altered, our Kingly Government is administred by the greatest Prince of the Universe, the Champion and Restorer of our Religion and Laws; both of which have their free Course, every Man may sit under his own Figg-Tree, secur'd in his Property; the Bench is filled with upright and learned Judges; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ost of the Episcopal Sees are adorn'd with Persons of Learning and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bity; and Dissenters have their Liberty to worship God as their own Consciences di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect: So that to disturb such a Government as this, by endeavouring to set up another
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:96634:19"/>
Form, must unavoidably throw us into an Intestine War, which would quickly prove more fatal to us than the tedious War which we are just now come out of. If the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth Party had been able to have ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected any thing, their Season was when the late King run away, and before the present Government was establish'd by the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but to offer to disturb a Government settled upon so good a Foundation, and with which the People are so well satisfied, is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly contrary to all Laws Humane and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine.</p>
            <p>Another Reason <hi>J. T.</hi> had to promote the publishing Mr. <hi>Milton</hi>'s Life was, his <hi>plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Liberty to</hi> Lutherans, Calvinists, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists, Arians, <hi>Socinians, and</hi> Arminians. <hi>And his disapproving the Terms of Trinity, Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunity, Coessentially, Tripersonality, and the like, as the Notions of Scholasticks, who make a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of that in their Sophistick Subtleties, which is in Scripture a plain Doctrine.</hi> P. 144, 145. <hi>A little lower he brings him in, commending the Authors and late Revivers of all these Sects or Opinions, as Learned, Worthy, Zealous and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Men.</hi> This pleases <hi>J. T.</hi> so much, that he is in a perfect Extasie, and says, <hi>He never met with any Person who spoke with so much disinterestedness and impartiality of our various
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:96634:20"/>
Sects, except</hi> Thomas Firmin. Tho' at the same time Mr. <hi>Firmin,</hi> as I am informed, was so much dissatisfied with him, that he refus'd to give him any Countenance: But <hi>J. T.</hi> thinks this stroke of his Pen necessary to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliate a Respect to himself and his Books, among those to whom Mr. <hi>Firmin</hi>'s great Charity rendred his Name Savory. He is, however, so just, as to quote Mr. <hi>Milton</hi>'s Restriction too, <hi>viz. That the best Method to prevent the increasing of Popery in this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is by the Toleration of all kinds of Protestants, or any others, whose Principles do not necessarily lead them to Sedition or Vice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what will <hi>J. T.</hi> say, if it be proved that his Principles, and those of his Party, do necessarily lead them to Sedition and Vice? I am afraid they will scarcely be able to evince the contrary from their Practices. We have heard already what loose Principles, as to the dissolving of Marriage, <hi>J. T.</hi> has endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to propagate. Nor do I see what good Morals we are to expect from such as deny the Godhead of Jesus Christ, by which they make <hi>him</hi> a Lyar, who re-called Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage to its Primitive Institution, condemned those frivolous Causes of Divorce in the <hi>Jews,</hi> which <hi>J. T.</hi> would now revive again; and taught such a resin'd Morality, that he cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:96634:20"/>
a lustful look as Adultery. If Jesus Christ was a Lyar, in owning himself to be the Son of God, God himself, and equal with God, which the Jews charg'd him with, to prove their Indictment against him for Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphemy, we have no Reason to believe that sublime Chastity which he teaches in the Gospel, but may safely return to Poligamy and Concubinage, as practis'd among the Jews.</p>
            <p>Let <hi>J. T.</hi> prove, if he can, That this is not the natural Consequence of denying Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ to be God: And if it be so, it must be granted, That the <hi>Socinian</hi> Principles have a vicious Tendency; and therefore, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Mr. <hi>Milton</hi>'s own concession, ought not to be tolerated.</p>
            <p>But much more will it appear, that they are not to be suffered, when we consider their other Doctrines, such as that of <hi>Wolzo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genius,</hi> who in his Commentary on <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. <hi>v.</hi> 28. says, There is no such Justice in God, as doth exact Vindictive Punishment for sins; and the same is maintain'd by <hi>Crellius,</hi> in his Answer to <hi>Grotius de Satisfactione,</hi> and by <hi>Socinus</hi> in his Theological Prelections.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:96634:21"/>
Then the Opinion that <hi>Socinus,</hi> and others of them, broach about Death Eternal, that it is nothing but a perpetual continuance in Death, or Annihilation; that Everlasting Fire is so called from its Effect, which is the Eternal Extinction or Annihilation of the Wicked, who shall be found alive at the last Day, must necessarily be an incouragement for Men to indulge themselves in the pursuit of all sensual Pleasures, and cannot have any influence to deter them from the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of Villanies to reach their ends, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded they can but escape the Sword of the Civil Magistrate</p>
            <p>Their denying of secret Assistances, and the certainty of God's fore-seeing all future Events, that depend upon the Freedom of Man's Will, must needs also have a tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to incourage Immorality.</p>
            <p>I shall only add, that certainly no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Magistrate would ever allow the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans</hi> to form themselves into Societies, erect Mosques, and write Libels against the Christian Religion, in their Dominions, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence that they think themselves ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd in Conscience to do so; and therefore, there is much less reason to suffer such, as call themselves Christians, to undermine the Foundations of our Religion, and to teach,

about 1546. as we are inform'd by <hi>Wisso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>watius</hi>'s <hi>Compend. Biblioth. Antitrin.</hi> p. 18.

            <p>To conclude: Whatever <hi>J.

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:96634:28"/>
that the Mystery is foolish, and their Hieroglyphical Language as false and contridictory, as vain and trifling; that the Doctrine of the Trinity is the very Genius and Spirit of the Old Mystical Hieroglyphicks, that is to say, partly foolish, and partly false. That what <hi>Cato</hi> said of the <hi>Roman</hi> Augurs, is appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to the <hi>A<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Then as to the Sacraments, they treat them with a Contempt equally blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and irreligious, as may be seen in the <hi>Trinitarian Scheme consider'd.</hi>

'Its all one to them whether the Cross or the Crescent be predominant, nay it is much better that the latter should carry it, for as we have heard already, Mahomet <hi>intended only the Restitution of the true Intent of the Christian Religion.</hi> Nay, I have read it somewhere, that the Learned <hi>Socinians</hi> ascribe the Propagation of <hi>Mahometism</hi> to <hi>their Denial of the Trinity,</hi> and not to the <hi>Sword.</hi> Then let any Christian judge what can be too vile or base for Men of such Principles to attempt or act, so they can but attain their Ends of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning the chief Principles of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, that so they may be at Liberty to take a full swinge in pursuing the Lusts of the Flesh, and other Impurities in which the Mahometans do so much delight.

Another Instance of their Dissimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is, <q>That they, good Men, have a mighty Esteem for the Church of <hi>England;</hi> they approve of known Forms of Prayers and Praises, as also in administring Baptism, the Lord's Supper, Marriage, and the other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Offices; they like well of the Discipline of the Church by Bishops and Parochial Ministers; they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with the Church as far as they can, and contribute their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

presently be inclin'd to as much Good as will save you from Hell, and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie you for Heaven, and this no less certainly if you are one of the Elect; for else the Churches Incantation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces only a momentary Effect, and a false Appearance of Good: No less certainly, I say, than by tying the <hi>Norman</hi> Knot, you may gain the Love of the Person you desire, or by other Devices, recorded in the Learned Books (so Fools esteem them) of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, you may cause Hatred, raise Winds, and do a thousand other Feats which have no more Natural or Real Agreement with those Causes that are said to produce them, than Faith and Obedience have with a bit of Bread, or with a sprinkling of Water. Therefore, when St. <hi>Augustine</hi> defin'd a Sacrament to be the Outward Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Sign of an Inward Invisible Grace, or Energy, the good Father should have consider'd that this is the Definition of a Charm.</q> [Thus the <hi>Socinians</hi> shew their Respect to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> by Ridiculing her Description of a Sacrament] and after some more prophane Raillery of the same Nature, they conclude. So that
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:96634:36"/>
let them turn themselves which way so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they can, they have turn'd the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Sacraments into Charms and Spells.</p>
               <p>If this be not villainous Dissimulation, and dreadful Blasphemy, there can be no such thing. The Church of <hi>England</hi> pronounces no other Words over the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but those pronounc'd by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>Matt.</hi> 26. 26, 27. and by the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. And is that Mother-Churches <hi>Ritual,</hi> and her Wonder-work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Words? Don't those Men know that the Church of <hi>England</hi> believes nor teaches no such thing as Transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor ascribes no other Efficacy to the receiving of the Lord's Supper by Faith, but what the Scripture ascribes to it? But perhaps this is <hi>J. T</hi>'s meaning, when he tells us, as before, <hi>that he ceases to wonder how so many Supposititious Pieces come to be charged upon Christ and his Apostles.</hi> The whole New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>is only Mother Churches Ritual.</hi> Yet these are the Men that ought to have a Toleration, tho' they impiously ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicule and blaspheme our Saviour and his Church, whom they pretend to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:96634:36"/>
I have already taken notice of <hi>J. T</hi>'s Respect to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> her Bishops, Liturgy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by his taking to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether all that Mr. <hi>Milton</hi> thought fit to bespatter them with; yet he, good Man, <hi>is for s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

T.</hi> does not approve of these Sayings of Mr. <hi>Milton,</hi> why did he take such Care to extract them from his Works, and publish them in his Life? And if he do approve them, is he not a gross Hypocrite to wish the Church may be secur'd in a senseless fantastical Worship, which is a Pattern for Jigs,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:96634:37"/>
and in her Emoluments, which send up a soul Stench to Heaven? More might be said to prove the fraudulent, hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical, versatile Temper of <hi>J. T.</hi> and his Party; but this is more than enough.</p>
               <p>The last thing I shall take notice of, is, their <hi>mighty Declamations against Perscution;</hi> the Reason of which, is, that they know themselves to be liable to all the Punishments appointed by those Laws which establish Christianity in the Nation, but not that they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally against using Force in Matters of Religion; which will be manifest, if we consider the malicious and vindictive Temper, which <hi>J. T.</hi> and the rest of his Party have discover'd against King <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam,</hi> the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the Presbyterians, for the Law enacted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Socinian</hi> Heresie last Sessions. Their Malice against the King has been sufficiently evidenc'd by their libelling his Administration in all their Pamphlets against Standing Armies, and by <hi>J. T</hi>'s bringing the Argument in again by Head and Shoulders into Mr. <hi>Milton</hi>'s Life, p. 118. where from Mr. <hi>Milton</hi>'s saying,
<q>
                     <pb n="65" facs="tcp:96634:37"/>
the Army (meaning that left by <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well)</hi> lately Renowned for the Civilest, best Order'd, and most Conscientious Army in the Universe, did, for no Cause at all, subdue the Supreme Power that set them up; if, says he, an Army deserving this Character was capable of enslaving their Country, what may be expected from any other, as most are, of a worse disposition?—</q> Their Malice against the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> I have just now prov'd, and that this is the Cause of their Malice against the Presbyterians; he fairly insinuates himself <hi>p.</hi> 79. Then let any reasonable Man judge, whether a Party who have discover'd so much Malice and Rage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst those that oppose them, would not Persecute if they had Power to do it.</p>
               <p>But I proceed to give a Proof of their Temper that way from matter of Fact, as related by themselves in their Brief History, Letter 4. p. 48. where we have an Account that the prevailing Party Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted their Brethren severely;—<q>That those in <hi>Transilvania</hi> would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit none into the Ministry, without obliging themselves before-hand, by Subscription, not to speak against Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping Jesus Christ;—They in
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:96634:38"/>
                     <hi>Poland</hi> were more Rigid, Depos'd and Excommunicated such as held Christ might not be Worship'd with Divine Worship, which was so much the more extraordinary, that the Persecutors did not think themselves oblig'd to call upon, and worship Christ, but only that they might lawfully do it.—And <hi>Socinus</hi> himself, in his Premoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to what he wrote against <hi>Francis Davidis,</hi> says, It is a Sin to omit the Worshiping of Christ when we join with them in Worship who call upon his Name, or when the Spirit moves</q> us to do it; and in their Answer to <hi>Milborn</hi> they own that the Question about the Invocation of Christ has very much divided them.</p>
               <p>Nor can any Reason be given why they who are in a manner of the same Religion with the Mahometans, as has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready prov'd, should not, according to <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Command, in the <hi>9th</hi> Chapter of the Alcoran, <hi>Break Truce with their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, Kill them where-ever they meet them, take them for Slaves, detain them Prisoners, and lay Ambushes for them: And therefore it were but just that</hi> J.

Some of them again profess sincerely to believe that God is truly Omniscient, and forseeth all Events, how Contingent soever they may be to us, as in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration on the Explication of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, <hi>p.</hi> 32.—Others of 'em again think that it is more dishonourable to God to be the Author of all the Sin and Wickedness that ever was, or ever will be in the World (which they falsly charge as the necessary consequence of his Prescience) than to deny his Fore-knowledge, as may be seen in <hi>The Desence of the Reasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Christianity,</hi> against Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> p. 18. compared with <hi>The Considerations on the Explication of the Trinity,</hi> pag. 32.</p>

                  <hi>Biddles Confession, p.</hi> 21. 22. Argues stre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuously for the Personallity of the Holy Ghost,—but the Brief History of the Unitarians, Sect. 1. p. 7. denys it,—and says he is only call'd so by the same Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of Speech that describes Charity as a Person. Thus it is evident that they cannot agree among themselves, tho' like <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> they agree in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying the Foundations of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <p>The last thing I shall take notice of, is, that their Principles have a direct Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to Introduce Atheism, or at least

Paganism.—This was observ'd of them of Old, by <hi>Bisterfield,</hi> in his Dispute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Crellius, De Uno Deo,</hi> Lib. 1. Sect. 2. Cap. 18.—And will be evident if we consider,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Author of Answer to the Lord Bishop of <hi>Worcester</hi>'s Sermon <hi>p.</hi> 5. Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules the Eternity of God, thus, <q>That to say a Person or Thing was from its self, implies this Contradiction, That it was before it was; [and adds] I am sorry an Eternal God must be a Contradiction.</q> It's true, that herein he Contradicts <hi>Socinus, Crellius,</hi> and others in their Institution of the Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,—where they say God hath from himself a Divine Empire over us, and that his Nature, and whatever else is proper to the Supreme God, he receiv'd from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; but then we see that ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p n="2">2. If in the next place it be observ'd, That <hi>Crellius, Smalcius,</hi> and <hi>Socinus,</hi> deny God's Immensity, Circumscribe his Essence within the Heav'ns, deny

his Omnipresence, the Infinity of his Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, his Prescience and Omnisci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as may be seen in <hi>Socin. Frag. Catech. Tom.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 685. <hi>Smalcius</hi> his Answer to <hi>Fran.

               <p>Then again, they pretend to believe a Trinity, but cannot agree what it is: <hi>Rua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, Przipcovius, John Biddle</hi> and his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, say there are Three Persons, <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinus, Sclichtingtius, Crellius,</hi> and the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test

part say there are but Two:—-The Holy Ghost is, according to them, One of the Three, but not a Person, nor God, nor a Creature. They own that is a thing truly Divine and Eternal, but yet not God, as may be seen in <hi>Sclichtingius</hi> against <hi>Meisner, p.</hi> 694.—And <hi>Ostorodius</hi> in his Controversie with <hi>Tradelius,</hi> says, It is neither God nor a Creature,—as <hi>Gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Sacr. p.</hi> 635.—Then let any Man judge whether their Scheme be not full of Mysteries and Contradictions; can there be any Medium betwixt a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and an Uncreated Being? Can the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost be Eternal and Divine, and yet not God? Can a deriv'd Omnipotence, such as they alledge that of our Saviour's is, be enough to make a meer Creature, as they esteem him, a true God? And is not an Eternal and Increated Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, which they ascribe to the Holy Ghost, sufficient to make him God? Are not these Contradictions plain and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent? And have not those Masters of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son (as they love to be call'd) justly forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all Right of Pretension to it, when they would impose Mysteries and Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of their own Inventing upon the W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Revelation, because they are above their Reason?</p>
               <p>Thus, Sir, you see what sort of Men they are whom <hi>J. T.</hi> hath rais'd Mr. <hi>Milton</hi> from his Grave to Patronize and Plead for. This is a New Socinian Invention to make the Name of so great a Man subservient to their Cause. You have heard they can turn themselves into all Shapes and Sizes of Religion, in order to overturn the whole; and now they have put on the disguise of true Patriots for our Liberty, in order to Cheat us of Christianity: But seeing God hath put it into the Heart of his Majesty and the Parliament to put a stop to this impetuous Current of Atheism, by strengthning Old, and proposing New Laws against Blasphemy; it's hoped they will not be able, with all their Subtilty, to give any diversion to that good design.</p>
               <p>We have had already too good Proof of the Usefulness of our Laws for preserving our Religion to be prevented (by idle and crafty Outcries of Persecution) from guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it further that way. It's an ordinary saying in the Mouths of that Party, that all Religion Establish'd by Civil Sanction is Persecution, which is Ridiculous i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> not Blasphemous.—The Jewish Religion, which was Revealed by God himself, was
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:96634:43"/>
Establish'd by Civil Sanction, and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates were thereby impowr'd to put to Death those that turn'd away to Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie; yea, Nature it self was laid under a Force in that Case; for the very Parents of the Idolaters were obliged to Condemn them, and to lay their Hands first upon them in order to Execution, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. 6, 7, 8. It is not to be doubted but many of the poor Heathens follow'd their Idols out of Conscience; nay, it is certain they did so, for the Apostle tells us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 7. that some People eat with Conscience of the Idol; but that Plea was not regarded by God, in Apostates at least: Nor ought it to be regarded now, they have better and clearer means of informing their Consciences now than then, but if they be perverse and obstinate, the Maxim holds good, <hi>pertinaciae nullum Remedium posuit Deus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Their Objection that the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion propagated and preserved it self, at first without the Sanction of Laws, and in a time of Persecution, will no more argue against Christian Nations provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for the security of their Religion by Law, than the Increase of the Israelites and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p>I have already hinted that Kings and Queens are promis'd to be Nursing Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Mothers to the Church of Christ in the Times of the Gospel, that the Church her self is ordered to reject Hereticks and throw them out of her Communion; and therefore by natural Reason it will follow that the Christian Magistrate ought to make use of the Sword God hath put into his hand to prevent the disturbance of the Peace of the Church, or the poysoning of her Children by Heretical Doctrine, seeing they are Nurslings committed to his care by God himself, and for whose sake if they neglect or abuse the trust com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them, he hath not only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to <hi>reprove Kings, Psalm</hi> 105. 14. but also <hi>to strike them through in the day of his Wrath, Psal.</hi> 110. 5. of the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of which there have been se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral instances in our own and other Nations, of which the late K. <hi>James,</hi> to name no more is a living Monument.</p>
               <p>It cannot be denied but theLaws which we had got enacted by the Providence of God, prov'd the chief Instruments to preserve our Religion against the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:96634:44"/>
of the Papists, and therefore no just reason can be assign'd why we should not especially now that we have a Prince who invites us to it, enact Laws in the same manner to secure it from the danger of being overturn'd by <hi>Socinians, Deists,</hi> and <hi>Atheists.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This will not at all countenance or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the practise of enacting and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Laws against those who may differ from the National Establishment, in things which the Imposers own to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, and for which no Divine Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution can be produced: In such Cases the Lord Jesus Christ who is K. of his Church and <hi>God over all blessed for ever,</hi> hath by the mouth of his Apostles commanded a forbearance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. and therefore the opposite Conduct is an Invading of God's Throne, and a Rebellion against Heaven: We have a plain and a positive Law giv'n us as to that matter. But the Case is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise as to those who bring in dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Heresies, and deny the Lord that bought them, or teach Doctrines tending to a dissolution of manners, as <hi>J. T.</hi> seems evidently to do in his Book now in Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, and therefore Sir, it's hop'd that you will use your Interest in Parliament to promote such Laws as his Majesty and

the rest of our Representatives shall think meet, to prevent the growth of such dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Opinions. He owes his advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Throne, and the Establish. of it, to his Zeal for the Christian Religion in opposition to Antichristian Idolatry, and it must be own'd as a grateful Retribution that he shews himself equally Zealous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Blasphemy and Profaness. In the Prosecution of which may the Son of God, who thought it no Robbery to be accounted equal with the Father, strengthen his Hands and those of the Great Council of the Nation now in Parliament assembled,</p>
