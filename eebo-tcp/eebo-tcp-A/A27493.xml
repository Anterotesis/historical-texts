            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe time is onward to two years, ſince I have been, by ſeverall <hi>Committees</hi> at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> ſequeſtred from my calling, and charge in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> baniſhed from my dwelling, and the ſociety of my deare Wife, and Children: they turned out of thoſe doores, which no body elſe hath, that I can heare, employed ſince. My ſelfe by barbarous Rebells, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be cut into a thouſand pieces, Pistolls diſcharged at me upon the high way: with ſeverall other abuſes, which to recount would ſavour of malice, to which Christianity commands me to be a ſtranger. Some, I confeſſe, ſhewed me ſome favours; which I ſhall never be ſo ingratefull, as to forget. Among others, ſome enquiring of thoſe that were; or would ſeem to be, my moſt intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent <hi>Witneſſes:</hi> (which was the title, the <hi>Committee Chaire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> was pleaſed to beſtow on my <hi>informers,</hi>) what courſe they thought, I ſhould take to live? were anſwered: that I was an able bodied man, and might goe <hi>worke.</hi> I underſtood their prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they intended me: (and <hi>they</hi> were ſuch as pretended <hi>my advancement</hi>) and I reſolved, to follow their advice. But being never bred to, nor practiſed in <hi>Manuall arts:</hi> I think they would allow me time to chuſe, and to fit my ſelfe, to a calling. And now you have, my firſt <hi>handy-worke, A Looking-glaſſe</hi> of Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: which I dedicate to your <hi>uſes.</hi> And when you ſhall therein, throughly, and truly, ſee your ſelves, either innocent, or peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, I ſhall look for thankes, at leaſt, from you. For thoſe that like decay'd Gentlewomen, perceive, or but conceit, their faces by no art to be repaired: I believe, they will not ſticke to breake, and marre my glaſſe: not becauſe it is, but becauſe themſelves are too faulty. Men are uſually not apt to believe their own fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces foule, without a reflection. Neither can they ſee, to convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or Reformation without this kind of helpe: becauſe the faces as their own, are not within their own view, directly. <note place="margin">2.

but the ſame with mine. I conceive Men that way intereſted are now blind, to the evill of Rebellion: becauſe it is their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquity. I hope they will perceive better, how the caſe ſtand; with Witches, in poynt of Religion, and reformation, and apply it. My <hi>glaſſe</hi> cannot deceive them: it is (I dare ſay) <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>true.</hi> And the <hi>Cover</hi> is a little (I confeſſe) too <hi>coſtly</hi> for them; But too mean, for the place, where it was firſt opened, from whence, I was enjoyned by authority, to convey it abroad, by the Preſſe, to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique view. My engagements to turne my face and Glaſſe <hi>Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> are great, and many: and yet truely, my brethren, I <hi>doe it without any Idolatry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But where is he, that will <hi>confeſſe</hi> himſelfe a <hi>Rebell?</hi> And where are they, that will confeſſe themſelves witches? The Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, though it pretend not to it, will yet with a little help of your conſciences: ſhew you not only what you are <hi>like;</hi> but what you <hi>are.</hi>

            <p>I have had the happineſſe, while I lived amongſt you, to be an inſtrument of conveing good to ſome, as I am able to prove by evidence, by ſome of your own acknowledgements. It is my deſire to be bleſſed that way ſtill: for this end, I ſend this unto you, which, if it thrive not, retract your ſentences; and confeſſe you did ill, to turne me to worke for my living. Though indeed, that is not my aime in this worke, but to procure a bleſſed change in them that are guilty; and a turning from ſuch a ſinne, as will poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon all their graces, were they ten thouſand times more then they are: diſgrace all their Religion, were it really anſwerable to the noyſe, the empty ſound, makes in their dwellings: and like the colloquintida, bring <note place="margin">2, King. 4. 40.</note>

            <p>The other, <hi>Ducens ad impoſsibile,</hi> in the words of my Text, whoſe Syllogiſticall ſenſe runs thus, Impoſſible it is, that Religious intentions, or Sacrifice ſhould pleaſe God, comming by that, which is <hi>as the ſinne of Witch-Craft.

no ſacrificing, nor intentions of Religion, can excuſe Rebellion or make it pleaſing to God. Thus pleads <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel:</hi> And thus ſtands my Text, in the order of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text. <hi>For Rebellion, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Argument being thus made evident, by the cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and ſcope of the place, I muſt crave further leave, to conſider <hi>Logically.</hi> Firſt, what this Argument con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes: and ſecondly, how it concludes.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, it concludes two things; one by way of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition. Namely, that Diſobedience, when it is counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced by Religion, amounts to Rebellion. For to ſay, that all diſobedience, even to God, is Rebellion againſt God, is neither univerſally true, nor Logically inferred from this Text. Not every way true, for <hi>David,</hi> then whom no man is more free, in confeſſion of his ſin: yet denies, that at any time, he was a Rebell. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18. 21.

His omiſſion was a defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from God, but his defence of it by ſacrifice, made it <hi>galeatum peccatum,</hi> a ſin in Armes, and a Rebellion. And ſo the word [<hi>Patzar</hi>] following, Engliſhed <note place="margin">Pagninus. <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:107619:6"/>Secondly, it inferres and concludes, by way of an <hi>Elen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> That no pretences of Sacrifices, or Religion, can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile God to Rebellion. Which is <hi>ſimpliciter malum:</hi> being, as the ſin of witchcraft. For as it is moſt abſurd, for a man to ſay, or think, I will turne witch, or conſult witches, that I may ſerve God better, and advance the purity of his worſhip: ſo is it equally ſottiſh, I will Rebell (<hi>i.</hi>) riſe up in Armes againſt my Ruler: that I may ſerve God the more freely, or the better. For <hi>Rebellion is as the ſin of witchcraft.</hi> And thus, have I ſhewne the firſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall propounded, in this argument, namely, what it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes: I proceed to the ſecond: to wit <hi>how it concludes</hi> in this <hi>FOR. For Rebellion is as the ſin of witchcraft.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The manner, how this argument concludes, is conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable two wayes; <hi>Ad Rem,</hi> and <hi>Ad Hominem.</hi> Firſt to the <hi>matter</hi> in hand, and ſecondly to the <hi>Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the matter, it concludes neceſſarily: and therefore the affirmative premiſes muſt be univerſall: for as <hi>Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarium</hi> is, at leaſt, or in the loweſt degree, <hi>De omni,</hi> ſo no neceſſary concluſion, can be inferred out of particular premiſes, for</p>
            <q>Syllogizari non est ex particulari.</q>
            <p>Hence I inferre, againſt all the <hi>Rebells</hi> in the world, that this word, Rebellion, is <hi>Terminus communis,</hi> a common name: And intends not any particular, or proper thing. It is not this particular buſineſſe, onely of <hi>Saul,</hi> who was a King to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but a Subject in relation to God; nor ſins as they are immediatly, onely againſt God himſelfe. But all Rebellion whatſoever, whether immediately againſt God, or mediately, the Rebellion alſo of a Subject or Subjects againſt the King, Children againſt their Parents, Servants againſt their Maſters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Of all which this <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:107619:7"/>
is true. That Rebellion is, as the ſinne of witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft.</p>
            <p>If any object, that this propoſition is not formally uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall: nor ſo propoſed, I anſwer.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Vid. Cracan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorp. Log.</note>That it is an eaſie rule, and obvious to every <hi>Puiny</hi> in Sophiſtry: <hi>That an indefinite Propoſition in a neceſſary mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> or truth, <hi>is equivalent to an univerſall:</hi> and ſuch is this. And therefore, according to S. <hi>Paul,</hi> written <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>better fed then taught.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the man: which is <hi>Saul,</hi> it is obſervable, out of 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 28. 3. that <hi>Saul</hi> had ſhewed himſelfe a very ſevere man, againſt wizards, and witchcrafts: and that, long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Samuels</hi> death; And therefore probably before this time. Now the Prophet argues againſt him (after Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> manner, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 21, 22. <hi>Thou that abhorreſt Idolls, committeſt thou Sacriledge?</hi>) from a thing which himſelfe abominates. In this manner. O <hi>Saul</hi> what haſt thou en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprized? is all thy zeale, againſt witchcraft, come to this? haſt thou thought them intolerable, fit to be taken away, <hi>root</hi> and <hi>branch;</hi> to be extirpated out of the land?<note place="margin">Mal. 4. 1.</note> and doeſt thou, now doe that, which is as bad? doeſt thou commit <hi>Rebellion: which is as the ſin of witchcraft?</hi> The time will come: that thou wilt goe after witches too<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> namely when <hi>I am dead.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Sam. 28. 14.</note> Thus ſtands the argument againſt the man. Let my Text be ſupplied, but with the following words: and the argument will hold, againſt the Rebells, of this generation, [<hi>and ſtubborneſſe is as iniquity and ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry</hi>] in the ſame manner.

And how juſt theſe were for Rebells no man but ſees. In ſhort.

            <p>Verſes can doe miracles: And particularly, kill Serpents, and Vipers, if they ſtop not their eares. To which alludes that place of <hi>David.</hi> Where the Scripture ſpeakes of the<note place="margin">Pſal. 58. 5.</note>

               </gap>, for we are his Poeme, created in Chriſt Ieſus, to good workes.

            <p>The fourth Remedy againſt Witchcraft, is <hi>Ritus &amp; cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonias Eccleſiae colere.</hi> That is to eſteeme and obſerve
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:107619:13"/>
the Rites and Ceremonies of the Church. For as it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by <hi>Tholoſanus</hi> out of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius:</hi> That<note place="margin">

So muſt I obſerve: That this Rebellion, how often ſoever, attempted hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by Papiſts; how long ſoever, plotted by the preſent Agents: could never thrive; did never break forth: while the Church ſtood. But the Sinewes, and the Pillars, of the Government thereof, being cut, and turned out of doores. Then Rebellion extended it ſelfe, like the Divell with a <hi>woe to the Inhabitants of the Earth and of the Sea.</hi> To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme<note place="margin">Rev. 12, 12.</note> us, in that maxime, <hi>Imperare neſcit qui parere non</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The fifth is, <hi>Publicam justitiam bene exſequi,</hi> a faithfull execution, of publique Iuſtice. Not onely that, which is to be between man and man. Wherein S. <hi>Augustine</hi> hath<note place="margin">Lib. 2. de doct.

But putting the Lawes of the Land in execution; which ſeizing upon any Witches once, is a ſole ſufficient charme, to conjure away the Devill from them. So, I cannot but wonder, ſince a legall proceeding, againſt Rebellion, hath in one County of this Kingdom, lay'd the Witchcraft of it, there<note place="margin">

            <p>And that is. <hi>Verberentur trunco vitis, vel fune palmitum colloinjecto.</hi> That is. Beat them with a cudgell of a Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtock, or ſtrangle them with a Witth of Vine-branches. For (ſaith my Author) Witches can have charms, againſt
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:107619:13"/>
the ſtrokes of a Sword or Halberd, or the ſhots of Muskets, or Bowes. But there is no charme, againſt weapons made of Vines. So Rebells, there is no ſubduing, by humane forces: but the Vine Chriſt Ieſus. Him and his wayes, muſt we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, and then, we ſhall proſper againſt them, which bids you, but reflect to the forenamed five Remedies, and ſo we ſhall cure, <hi>Rebellion—as the ſin of Witchcraft.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which brings me, to my laſt <hi>ſicut</hi> of <hi>Application:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I will conclude.</p>
            <p>The firſt is of <hi>Reprehenſion.</hi> For as, although the Law of God preſcribe againſt Witches: The ſacred Story makes faith concerning them: Though the Lawes of the Land, provide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Witches, and our frequent experiences of ſeverall hurts done by them aſſure us of them. Notwithſtanding there are ſome, who ſtick not, to maintaine; That, there are no Witches in the World. So, are there ſuch monſters in opinion: that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Gods word tell us: we muſt <hi>ſubmit to the King, as to</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Per. 2.</note>

               <hi>threaten damnation to Rebells;</hi> Though the Law of the Land, tell us; and the oath by Statute, confirme us: That the King is Supreme; that it's Treaſon to riſe up in Armes againſt Him; yet will hold, the King may be reſiſted; though to the danger of His Life; His Lands; <hi>Crowne Lands</hi> ſeized on, to maintaine a Warre againſt Him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And yet, after all this, they that doe ſuch things, to be no Rebells: nor the Acts, Acts of Rebellion. Let theſe men know, that even the Rebells, would have theſe very things, themſelves goe on with, to be Treaſons and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, with the higheſt aggravations, ſhould they have been done by a Parliament of Papiſts. And although, it were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignancy in us, to conſider of the <hi>Cauſes;</hi> and not of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. Yet let 'em be aſſur'd, theſe things, will one day be Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, by <hi>One,</hi> that is no <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Secondly, of <hi>Exhortation,</hi> wherein I would be earneſt: for whereas the Scripture, all Lawes, Divine, Secular, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non forbid us, for any cauſe, or pretence whatſoever, to have to do with witch-craft: not for the ſaving of a Kingdom: <hi>which was Saul's caſe;</hi> nor for the ſaving of ones life: which is <hi>Ahazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah's</hi>

            <p>The third, is of <hi>Information,</hi> to ſhew us.

            <p>The laſt is of <hi>direction;</hi> That as for the Removall of Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, no indirect courſe may be taken. For <hi>Eſtius</hi> tells us, it is unlawfull to break a Magick Spell, with intention, by break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, to diſenchant what is bewitch'd thereby; becauſe even therein, we have ſociety with the Divell: who is <hi>Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to all mankind,</hi> ſaith <hi>Gerſon: Gods Enemy,</hi> ſaith <hi>Eſtius.</hi> And therefore no way to be dealt with, but by reſiſting till we conquer him. As S. <hi>Hieron:</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">'Tis a Story, and it's this. The Devill declared to <hi>Hillar.</hi> (who was praying for one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch'd) that he was char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated to doe what was done, but if he pleaſed to ſend to ſuch a place, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move ſuch Spells, all then would ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed without force. <hi>Hillari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> would not caſt out the Devill by <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> but prayed on till he obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it that way. And ſo ſhould we.</note> in the life of <hi>Hillarion.</hi> So we muſt uſe no indirect meane, to ſtave off this Rebellion, as it were by charmes, (other then ſuch as I before mentioned) but goe on to reſiſt it; till we conquer it: As the Sin, and the Divell, that now bewitches, and torments, the whole Land. To the ſubduing whereof, as Gods helpe muſt be implored, and Gods word muſt be followed. So to the uſe of all good meanes, (without complying with the ſinne) will I conclude, as the Bible doth: with, Even ſo, Come Lord Ieſus, come quickly. <hi>Amen.</hi>
