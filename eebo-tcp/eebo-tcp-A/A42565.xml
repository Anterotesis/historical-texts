            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>FOR AS MUCH as Mr. <hi>William Geddes,</hi> late Minister at <hi>Urquhart,</hi> having made
ane humble addresse to his <hi>Majesties</hi> Privy Council, Representing that he hath been at
great care, pains, diligence and expences, in compiling the Books following, and
which are now in the Press, <hi>viz. Memoriale Historicum,</hi> and the <hi>Saincts Recreation;</hi> and
these other Books, Which he intends for the Press, <hi>viz. Geographical,</hi> and <hi>Arithmetical
Memorials, Memoriale Hebraicun,</hi> for facilitating the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Language, <hi>Vocabularium La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tino-Hebraicum,</hi>

he might have a Priviledge for Printing the Books by himself, his Heits, Executors, or As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signeys,
for some years: and that he might be Recommended for his Encouragement and
Assistance to all Persons of Ingenuity and Generosity, for promoving and perfecting such ane
Work. THE LORDS of His <hi>Majesties</hi> Privy Council having heard and considered the
foresaid Addresse and Representation, with the report of a committè of their own number;
that the said Books are worthy to be Published, and will be very useful and conducive to the
advancing of Piety and Learning: Do therefore Recommend the said Mr. <hi>William Geddes</hi>
his printed Advertisement of the saids Treatises, to all His <hi>Majesties</hi> good Subjects, for his
Encouragement and Assistance in the said Work, as their generosity, and ingenuity shall
prompt them. And further, do hereby give and grant to the said Mr. <hi>William Geddes,</hi> the
sole and only Priviledge of Printing the foresaid Treatises compiled by him, for the space of
<hi>Nineteen</hi> years, after the date hereof: Discharging all others to print, re-print, import, or

            <head>An Apology for the Authors delay.</head>
            <p>WHeras many generous persons have advanced before hand, the price of the Books, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in the Authors advertisement; and they may possibly admire, that they have
not received these Books long ago, according to the Authors promise: I humbly plead
at those generous persons hands, that they may have the author excused. For, as no man can
promise absolutely for his own life or health, so much as for ane houre, so not for the constant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
of a press, and the Author used all diligence imaginable, yet, <hi>Ultra posse, non est esse.</hi>
And as the best of works meet ordinarly with the most and greatest obstructions, be reason of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi>
and his Instruments malice: So hath his pious and worthy designe been obstructed several
wayes, which are not altogether pertinent to be divulged. Therefore, I hope, that discreet and
intelligent persons will have so much humanity and ingenuity as to consider, that such promises
must be alwayes understood to be conditional, implying such reservations as these, <hi>IF GOD
WILL, IF HEALTH-SERVE, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I humbly intreat also, that you read this Book deliberatly and seriously, comparing it with
the Authors design mentioned in his Preface, before you passe a rash or harsh censure upon it. In
this Giddy Notional age, there is much imaginary supposed knowledge, but too little conscience:
Many new coyn'd words and high slown Notions, but few Spiritual Meditations and Religious
practises, which are most suteable to those who keep a closs constant Heart-communion with GOD,
walking alwayes as in the view of Heaven and Hell, Death and Iudgement: And I suppose
such hes been the Spiritual frame of the Author at the compiling of this treatise. It is probable,
that some Men of preposterous tempers, at the first sight of the Book, not finding it stuffed with
fruitles curiosities, may presently nauseat and disdaine. But read, I pray you consideratly,
and you shall find it wants not Christian acutenes: And be pleased but to have a little patience,
till the Authors other Book called Memoriale Historicum, come to your hands, (which I hope
shall be shortly,) and you shall find there some pleasant curiosities, both for recreation and edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which may serve to exercise with delight, the Fansy, Iudgement and Memory.</p>

Loyaltie. There is yet one thing more, which I cannot omit, deserving great deference, being
some piece of rariety in this cold, <hi>Laodicean</hi>-like and backslyding Age: And that it your
Christian-Moderation, Prudence and Sobrietie, that whileas the most part of People are devia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to some sinful and vicious extreams, upon the right hand or the lest; some to erroneous
giddiness and unconstant levity; some to Atheistical loosenoss and profanity, Your <hi>Ladieship</hi>
all the time hath keeped the middle line of a golden Mediocrity, even the straight course
of solide, sober and substantious Christianity: Which [I am confident] shall afford your
<hi>Ladieship</hi> unspeakable Peace and Comfort here, and conduct you to Eternall Felicity hereafter:
And this shall be the constant Prayer of him, who it.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is not a new nor strange thing to teach
Religion by way of Songs: We find the
most material and Spiritual subjects in all
the Sacred Scriptures, not only by way of
precept enjoyned, but also (according to
divine precept) delivered in Songs. <hi>Moses</hi>
the choice Man of God is observed to
make the first <hi>Hexameter</hi> verses in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew,
in that super-excellent, gratulatory
Song <hi>Exod 15.</hi> upon the miraculous deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
of <hi>Israel</hi> at the <hi>Red Sea.</hi> Did not the Lord command
<hi>Moses</hi> to teach the People of <hi>Israel</hi> in a Song<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Deut. 31.</hi> and
<hi>chap. 32.</hi> His manifold mercies; their horride and base unthank:
fulness &amp; the formidable consequents of their ingratitude, to wit,
fearful Iudgements: Which is indeed, an abridgment of all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies.<note n="*" place="bottom">And so the People of <hi>Israel,</hi> by way of Prophetical anticipation, are made to sing out their own <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> &amp; acknowledge the Justice of GOD in inflicting deserved plagues.</note>
Beside the Book of <hi>Psalms,</hi> penned for the most part
by <hi>David,</hi> and some by <hi>Moses</hi> and others, which by some is called
the marrow of Scripture; we have as Spiritual and Soul ravishing
a book as in all the Scripture delivered in Songs, to wit, the Song
of <hi>Solomon,</hi> which (being well understood) holds forth most pathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically,
the sweet, most intimat and heart-transporting commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
betwixt <hi>Christ</hi> &amp; his <hi>Spouse</hi> the Church. Moreover we have
the Song of <hi>Isaiah. Isai. Chap. 12.</hi> Of <hi>Habbakkuk Chap. 3.
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 17.</hi> The Song of <hi>Zacharias Luk.</hi> 1. 67, 68. &amp;c. The blessed
Virgin and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> at the rising of the Sun of Righteousness
upon the Horizon of a sinful World, or the <hi>Nativity</hi> of our <hi>Blessed
<pb facs="tcp:105399:4"/>
Saviour, Luke</hi> 2: 42, 46. &amp;c. And finally we have the heavenly
<hi>Halelujahs</hi> of Angells and Saints in the Church triumphant, delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in Songs; <hi>Rev.</hi> 15: 3, 4.—19: 5, 6. The Blessed Apostle of
the Gentiles not only enjoyns to sing <hi>Psalmes,</hi> but also Hymns and
Spirituall Songs, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5: 19 <hi>Col.</hi> 3: 16. The reason of all this,
seems to be, that the elegancy of the Poetical stile, and accuratnes
of the forme, together with the harmonious melody of the tune or
aire in singing, may induce people to the more frequent perusing
these subjects of the greatest consequence, for meditation; and may
take the deeper impress in the memory for delightful retention. It
is looked upon as one of the most edifying works that ever the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Reformers in <hi>Germany</hi> attempted, that (in imatation, as
it were, of the primitive patern of the ancient Jewish Church) they
reduced the most of Christian Religion into Spiritual Songs, which
the <hi>German</hi> Protestants are continually singing to this day, when
they are upon journey, when about their secular employments,
morning and evening and at all occasions. I have been much long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for the like work in the <hi>English</hi> Language, for reclaming (if
possible) our profane vulgar from obscene, bawdy Songs (which
are most scandalous to our profession) to more Christian-like diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisements:
but have not, as yet, found such a thing don me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodically
and fully. I find indeed, many excellent Poems upon
scattered select subjects, farre more accurat then mine, and some
godly ballads written by pious and devout Ministers at several occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
which (I acknowledge) Contain very good matter, and to
my certain experience, I have found them very useful for edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and raising the affections of some devout persons; (and have
often wished that all these godly Songs should be Collected and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in one Book.) Yet in them all, I desiderat a methodical cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
and confirmation by Scriptures, and some other illustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
for satisfying the Judicious. I have attempted, according to
my mean Talent, to break the Yce, and lay a foundation for
others of more excellent parts, to bring such a work to some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
I have not sought for a sublime, losty stile, nor hunted
<pb facs="tcp:105399:5"/>
after pedantick expressions, or Romantick phrases; partly, that
the Treatise might be usefull and intelligible to the vulgar, as well
as to the learned; And partly, because I supposed, that neither
the whorish dress of human eloquence, or high flowing notions,
nor yet the sluttish Garb of rustick expressions, were suteable for
the chast Lady of Divinity; but the grave Matronal habite of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
pertinent and Spiritual simplicity. If any do not fancy to sing
divinity (beside what I have said already, which may be sufficient
to refute that Childish mistake,) let such read it as prose; and
I hope, they shall find nothing but pertinency and Spirituality.
But I cannot omitt here, to obviat an objection which may be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by some inconsiderat Persons, which is this: O say they, we
remember some of these Ayres or Tunes were sung heretofore with
Amorous Sonnets, wherein were (may be) some bawdy-like or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scene-like
expressions. To this I answer, first, that in this practice,
I have the president of some of the most pious, Grave and Zealous
divines in the Kingdom, who to very good purpose, have compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Godly Songs to the Tunes of such old Songs as these, <hi>The bonny
Broom, I'le never leave thee, Wee'll all go pull the hadder,</hi> and
such like, and yet without any challenge or disparagement. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
it is alleadged by some, and that not without some colour of
reason, that many of our Ayres or Tunes are made by good Angels,
but the Letter or lines of our Songs by Devils. We choose the part
Angelical and leaves the Diabolical. Thridly it is as possible and
probable, that these vain or profane men who composed those Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
naughty Sonnets, have surreptitiously borrowed those grave,
sweet Tunes from former Spiritual Hymns and Songs, and why
may not we again challenge our own, plead for restitution, and
bring back to the right owner; applying those grave Ayres again to
a Divine and Spiritual subject. And lastly, we find that <hi>Paul,</hi> the
great Apostle of the Gentiles sanctified some sentences and verses of
Greek Poëts, converting them into Scriptural Maximes, such as
that <hi>Cretenses omnes sunt mendaces;</hi> The Cretians are alwayes
<pb facs="tcp:105399:5"/>
Liars, &amp;c. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1: 12. And that in <hi>Act.</hi> 17: 28. <hi>For in him we
live, move, and have our being,</hi> &amp;c. And why may not we,
(finding the measures of a melodious Tune or Ayre, indifferent in
themselves) consecrat and apply them to a Sacred Poem. I call this
Treatise, <hi>The third Part,</hi> as relating to two other Parts, anterior
to this, both in order of time and nature, to witt upon the Estate
of Innocency, and the Estate of Sin and Corruption, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which I
have also ready for the Press, but have, for several reasons begun
with this Treatise, till I see how the work may get acceptance; and
as I find it pleasing. I may adde the rest at another impression. If
any Devout and Religious persons reap any good by it, as it is my
principal Scope, so it shall be my great rejoycing, that I shall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumental,
either by word or write, to glorify GOD and edify
his People.</p>
            <p>To this GOD, infinit, eternal and incomprehensible, one in
Essence, three in distinct Persons, let all Men and Angels ascribe
all Praise, Honour, Glory, Power and Dominion for ever and
ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>
