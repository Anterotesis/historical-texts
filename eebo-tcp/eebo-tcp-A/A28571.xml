            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>RAsh Author, 'tis a vain presumptuous Crime</l>
            <l>To undertake the Sacred Art of Rhyme;</l>
            <l>If at thy Birth the Stars that rul'd thy Sence</l>
            <l>Shone not with a Poetic Influence:</l>
            <l>In thy strait Genius thou wilt still be bound,</l>
            <l>Find <hi>Phoebus</hi> deaf, and <hi>Pegasus</hi> unsound.</l>
            <l>You then, that burn with the desire to try</l>
            <l>The dangerous Course of charming Poetry;</l>
            <l>Forbear in fruitless Verse to lose your time,</l>
            <l>Or take for Genius the desire of Rhyme:</l>
            <l>Fear the allurements of a specious Bait,</l>
            <l>And well consider your own Force and Weight.</l>
            <l>Nature abounds in Wits of every kind,</l>
            <l>And for each Author can a Talent find:</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:49232:3"/>
One may in Verse describe an Amorous Flame,</l>
            <l>Another sharpen a short Epigram:</l>

               <hi>Spencer</hi> Sing <hi>Rosalind</hi> in Pastoral:</l>
            <l>But Authors that themselves too much esteem,</l>
            <l>Lose their own Genius, and mistake their Theme;</l>
            <l>Thus in times past<note n="*" place="bottom">Dubartas <hi>Translated by</hi> Sylvester.</note> 
               <hi>Dubartas</hi> vainly Writ,</l>
            <l>Allaying Sacred Truth with trifling Wit,</l>
            <l>Impertinently, and without delight,</l>
            <l>Describ'd the <hi>Israelites</hi> Triumphant Flight,</l>
            <l>And following <hi>Moses</hi> o're the Sandy Plain,</l>
            <l>Perish'd with <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in th' <hi>Arabian</hi> Main.</l>
            <l>What-e're you write of Pleasant or Sublime,</l>
            <l>Always let sen<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e accompany your Rhyme:</l>
            <l>Falsely they seem each other to oppose;</l>
            <l>Rhyme must be made with Reason's Laws to close</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:49232:3"/>
And when to conquer her you bend your force,</l>
            <l>The Mind will Triumph in the Noble Course;</l>
            <l>To Reason's yoke she quickly will incline,</l>
            <l>Which, far from hurting, renders her Divine:</l>
            <l>But, if neglected, will as easily stray,</l>
            <l>And master Reason, which she should obey.</l>
            <l>Love Reason then: and let what e're you Write</l>
            <l>Borrow from her its Beauty, Force, and Light.</l>
            <l>Most Writers, mounted on a resty Muse,</l>
            <l>Extravagant, and Senceless Objects chuse;</l>
            <l>They Think they erre, if in their Verse they fall</l>
            <l>On any thought that's Plain, or Natural:</l>
            <l>Fly this excess<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and let <hi>Italians</hi> be</l>
            <l>Vain Authors of false glitt'ring Poetry.</l>
            <l>All ought to aim at Sence; but most in vain</l>
            <l>Strive the hard Pass, and slipp'ry Path to gain:</l>
            <l>You drown, if to the right or left you stray;</l>
            <l>Reason to go has often but one way.</l>

Sometimes an Author, fond of his own Thought,</l>
            <l>Pursues his Object till it's over-wrought:</l>
            <l>If he describes a House, he shews the Face,</l>
            <l>And after walks you round from place to place;</l>
            <l>Here is a <hi>Vista,</hi> there the Doors unfold,</l>
            <l>Balcone's here are Ballustred with Gold;</l>
            <l>Then counts the Rounds and Ovals in the Halls,</l>

A Verse was weak, you turn it much too strong,</l>
            <l>And grow Obscure, for fear you should be Long.</l>
            <l>Some are not Gaudy, but are Flat and Dry;</l>
            <l>Not to be low, another soars too high.</l>

            <l>Who tire us, Humming the same heavy Tone.</l>

            <l>From Grave, to Light; from Pleasant, to Severe:</l>

            <l>IN <hi>Florence</hi> dwelt a Doctor of Renown,</l>
            <l>The Scourge of God, and Terror of the Town,</l>
            <l>Who all the Cant of Physick had by heart,</l>
            <l>And never Murder'd but by rules of Art.</l>
            <l>The Public mischief was his Private gain;</l>
            <l>Children their slaughter'd Parents sought in vain:</l>
            <l>A Brother here his poyson'd Brother wept;</l>
            <l>Some bloodlessdy'd, and some by <hi>Opium</hi> slept.</l>
            <l>Colds, at his presence, would to Frenzies turn;</l>
            <l>And Agues, like Malignant Fevers, burn.</l>
            <l>Hated, at last, his Practice gives him o'er:</l>
            <l>One Friend, unkill'd by Drugs, of all his Store,</l>
            <l>In his new Country-house affords him place,</l>

            <l>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:49232:29"/>
Here first the Doctor's Talent came in play,</l>

            <l>His Friend approves, does for his Mason send,</l>

            <l>In short, to finish this our hum'rous Tale,</l>
            <l>He <hi>Gaien's</hi> dang'erous Science does reject,</l>
            <l>And from ill Doctor turn good Architect.</l>
            <l>In this Example we may have our part:</l>
            <l>Rather be Mason, ('tis an useful Art!)</l>

               <hi>Amphion's</hi> Notes, by their melodious pow'rs,</l>
            <l>Drew Rocks &amp; Woods, and rais'd the <hi>Theban</hi> Tow'rs:</l>
            <l>These Miracles from numbers did arise,</l>
            <l>Since which, in Verse Heav'n taught his Mysteries,</l>
            <l>And by a Priest, possess'd with rage Divine,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Apollo</hi> spoke from his Prophetick Shrine.</l>
            <l>Soon after <hi>Homer</hi> the old Heroes prais'd,</l>
            <l>And noble minds by great Examples rais'd;</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Hesiod</hi> did his <hi>Graecian</hi> Swains incline</l>

            <l>

Thus useful Rules were by the Poets aid,</l>
            <l>In easy numbers, to rude men convey'd,</l>
            <l>And pleasingly their Precepts did impart;</l>
            <l>First Charm'd the Ear, and then ingag'd the Heart:</l>
            <l>The Muses thus their Reputation rais'd,</l>
            <l>And with just Gratitude in <hi>Greece</hi> were prais'd.</l>
            <l>With pleasure Mortals did their Wonders see,</l>
            <l>And Sacrific'd to their Divinity:</l>
            <l>But Want, at last base Flatt'ry entertain'd,</l>
            <l>And old <hi>Parnassus</hi> with this Vice was stain'd:</l>
            <l>Desire of gain dazling the Poets Eyes,</l>

               </gap> VVorks were fill'd with fulsome flatteries.</l>
            <l>Thus needy Wits a vile revenue made,</l>
            <l>And Verse became a mercenary Trade.</l>
            <l>Debase not with so mean a Vice thy Art:</l>
            <l>If Gold must be the Idol of thy heart,</l>
            <l>Fly, fly th' unfruitful <hi>Heliconian</hi> strand,</l>
            <l>Those streams are not inrich'd with Golden Sand:</l>

Great Wits, as well as Warriors, only gain</l>
            <l>Laurels and Honors for their Toyl and Pain:</l>
            <l>But, what? an Author cannot live on Fame,</l>
            <l>Or pay a Reck'ning with a lofty Name:</l>
            <l>A Poet to whom Fortune is unkind,</l>
            <l>Who when he goes to bed has hardly din'd;</l>
            <l>Takes little pleasure in <hi>Parnassus</hi> Dreams,</l>
            <l>Or relishes the <hi>Heliconian</hi> streams.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Horace</hi> had Ease and Plenty when he writ,</l>
            <l>And free from cares for money or for meat,</l>
            <l>Did not expect his dinner from his wit.</l>
            <l>'Tis true; but Verse is cherish'd by the Great,</l>
            <l>And now none famish who deserve to eat:</l>
            <l>What can we fear, when Virtue, Arts, and Sence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </l>
            <l>Receive the Stars propitious Influence;</l>
            <l>When a sharp-sighted Prince, by early Grants</l>
            <l>Rewards your Merits, and prevents your Wants?</l>
            <l>Sing then his Glory, Celebrate his Fame;</l>
            <l>Your noblest Theme is his immortal Name.</l>
