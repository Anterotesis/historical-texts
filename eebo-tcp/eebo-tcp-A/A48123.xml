            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A LETTER of several French Ministers Fled into Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many
upon the account of the PERSECUTION in France,
to such of their Brethren in England as Approved the Kings
Declaration touching Liberty of Conscience.</head>
            <head type="sub">Translated from the Original in French.</head>
            <p>ALtho in our present Dispersion, most
dear and honoured Brethren, it has
pleased the Providence of God to
conduct us into places very distant
from one another. Yet that union which
ought always to continue betwixt us, obliges
us to declare our sense to one another with a
Christian and Brotherly Freedom upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions,
that may present themselves to us so to
do. 'Tis this makes us hope that you will not
take it amiss of us, if at this time we deliver
our opinion to you touching the Affairs of
England in matters of Religion, and with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to that Conduct which you have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
therein.</p>
            <p>We ought not to conceal it from you, That
the greatest part of the Protestants of Europe
have been extremely scandalized to understand,
that certain among you, after the example of
many of the Dissenters, have Addressed to the
King of England, upon the account of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration,
by which he has granted Liberty of
Conscience to the Non-conformists: And
that some others who had already ranked
themselves under the Episcopal Communion,
nevertheless published the said Declaration in
their Churches; and this at a time when al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
all the Bishops themselves with so much
Firmness and Courage refused to do it.</p>
            <p>If we may be permitted to tell you freely
what our opinion is concerning the conduct of
the Bishops and of the Dissenters in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture,
we shall make no difficulty to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
in favour of the former. We look
upon it that they have exceedingly well an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
the Duty of their Charge, whilst despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
their own private Interest, they have so
worthily supported that of the Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:
Whereas the others, for want of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
these things as they ought to have
done, have given up the interest of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
to their own particular advantages.</p>
            <p>It is not out of any complement to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
much less out of any enmity to the
Dissenters, that we make such different judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
concerning them. We know well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
how to commend or blame, what seems
to us to deserve our Praise or our Censure
both in the one and in the other. We do not
at all approve the conduct of the Bishops to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Dissenters under the last Reign. And
altho we do not any more approve that of the
Dissenters in separating from their Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
yet we do confess they had some reason in
the bottom for it; and that the Ceremonies
which they have refused to submit to are the
Remains of Popery, which we could rather
wish might have been entirely abolished. In
this unhappy Schism which has so long time
rent the Church of England; we look upon
it, that both Parties have been equally defective
in their Charity. On the one side, the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95505:2"/>
ought by no means to have separated
themselves for the Form of Ecclesiastical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
nor for Ceremonies which do not
at all concern the Fundamentals of Religion.
On the other side, The Bishops should have
had a greater Condescension to the Weakness
of their Brethren: And without doubt they
would have acted in a manner more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the Spirit of the Gospel, if instead of
treating them with so much Rigor as they did,
they had left them the Liberty of serving
God according to their Conscience, till it
should have pleased him to re-unite All un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the same Discipline. However the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
of Opinion between the dissenters
and Us, ought to have prejudiced us in their
favour, had we been capable of Partiality on
this occasion. There is also another thing
which might have disposed us to judge less
favourably of the Bishops than of them, and
that is the Yoke which they have imposed
upon the French Ministers, by obliging them
to receive a second Ordination before they
could be permitted to Exercise their Ministry
in the Church of England, as if the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
they had received in France had not
been sufficient. But we must do Justice to
all the World, and bear witness to the Truth.
We have already said, and we must again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat
it, It seems to us that on this last Occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Bishops have discharged their Duty,
and are most worthy of Praise, whereas the
Dissenters on the contrary are extreamly to be
<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>ned. And we will presently offer our
Reasons wherefore we judge so of the one,
and of the other.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, most dear Brethren,
give us leave freely to tell you, That if our
Brethren the Dissenters of England, who have
Addressed to the King, are to be blamed,
(as we verily believe they are) you certainly
are much more to be condemned. The
Hardships under which they had lived for
many years without Churches, without Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors,
without Assemblies, made them think
the Liberty of Conscience which was offered
to them, a great Ease. Their Spirits, soured
and prejudiced by the ill Treatments they had
received from the Church of England, had not
freedom enough to let them see that the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
which was made them was Empoison'd.
And therefore upon the sudden they received
it with joy, and thought themselves obliged to
testifie their Acknowledgment of it. But for
you who never had any part in the Divisions
of the Church of England, and who by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
were in a state to judge more soundly
of things, How is it that you should not
have perceived the Poison that was hid under
the Liberty of Conscience offered to them?
Or if you did not perceive it of your selves,
how is it that the Generous Refusal of the
Bishops, tho' at the peril of their Liberty and
Estates, to publish the Declaration in their
Diocesses, should not at least have open'd your
eyes?</p>
            <p>How have those Venerable Prelates now
highly justified themselves from the Reproach
that was laid upon them of being Popishly
affected, and of persecuting the Dissenters on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but of a secret Hatred to the Reformation?
How well have they made it appear that these
were only Calumnies invented by their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to render them odious to the Protestants,
and that their hearts were truly fix'd to the
Reformed Religion, and animated with a Zeal
worthy Primitive Bishops? Could you see those
faithful Servants of God, disobey the order of
their Soveraign, expose themselves thereby to
his Disgrace, suffer Imprisonment, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
themselves to suffer any thing, rather
then betray their Consciences and their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
without admiring their Constancy, and
being touched with their Examples? But above
all, could you resolve by your Conduct to
condemn that of those generous Confessors?
Is this the Acknowledgment which you ought
to have made to them for that Charity, with
which they had received and comforted you
in your Exile? Is this to Answer the Glorious
Quality of Confessors, of which you so much
vaunt your selves? Is this the Act of Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Ministers of Christ? Give us leave to tell
you, most dear Brethren, your Proceedings in
this Affair appear so very strange to us, that
we cannot imagine how you were capable of
so doing. It seems to us to have even effa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
all the Glory you had attained by your
Sufferings, to reproach your Ministry and
to be unworthy of True and Reformed Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:95505:2"/>
This is no rash judgment which we pass;
and to convince you that it is not, we beseech
you only to examine these things with us
without Prejudice and Interest.</p>
            <p>The Declaration of which we speak is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
for two purposes: The one, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>establishment
of Popery. The other, the
extinction of the Reformed Religion in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.
The former of these designs appears
openly in it. The second is more concealed;
'tis a mystery of Iniquity, covered over with
a specious appearance; and of which the
trace must be concealed till the time of mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation
comes. We will say nothing of a
third Design, which is, Of the oppression of
the Liberties of England for the Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of an absolute Authority, but shall
leave it to the Polititians to make their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions
upon it. As for us, if we some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
touch upon it, it shall be only with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to Religion: We will apply our selves
chiefly to the two other Designs which they
proposed to themselves who made that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration.</p>
            <p>It cannot be deny'd but that by this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration,
there is Liberty of Conscience
granted indifferently to the Papists and to
the Dissenters. It comprehends both the
one and the other under the name of
Nonconformists. And we may with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
affirm, That they were the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
especially whom the King had in his
eye when he gave this Declaration. And
howsoever he may pretend to have been
touched with the Oppressions which the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters
had suffered; yet that his principal
design was to re-establish Popery.</p>
            <p>Behold here already a very great evil, and
such as all true Protestants are obliged with
their utmost power to oppose. What, shall
we see Popery, that abominable Religion,
that prodigious heap of Filthiness and Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
re-establish it self, with all its honours,
in Kingdoms from which the Reformation
had happily banished it? And shall there be
found in those Kingdoms Protestants who not
only stand still without making any oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to it, but e'en favour its re-establishment,
and openly give it their Approbation? Who
could have thought that the Dissenters of
England, Men who have always testified so
great an aversion to the Roman Religion;
and who have no other pretence to separate
from the Bishops, than that they have in part
retained in their Government and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
the Exteriors of that Religion, should
now themselves joyn to bring it intirely in?
But above all, Who could have believed
that the French Ministers, who after having
experimented all the Fury of Popery in
France, were at last banished, rather than
that they would subscribe to its Errors and
Abuses: And for this very cause fled into
England, that they might there more freely
profess the Protestant Religion, should now
contribute to re-establish Popery in their
new Country, where they had been receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by their Brethren with so singular a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity?
Would you indeed, Gentlemen, see
England once more submitted to the tyranny
of the Pope, whose Yoke it so happily threw
off in the last age? Would you there see all
those monstrous Doctrins, all those Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and that horrible Idolatry which reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
there before the Reformation, domineer
once more in it? Would you that the People
should again hear the Pulpits and the
Churches sounding out the doctrins of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory,
of Indulgences, of the Sacrifice of
the Mass, &amp;c. and see the Images and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques
of the Saints carried solemnly in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession,
with a God formed by the hand of
Men? And that in fine, they should again
publickly adore those vain Idols? We are
confident there is not a good Protestant in
the world that would not startle but at the
thought of it.</p>
            <p>But this is not yet all. The Declaration
of which we speak does not only re-establish
Popery with all its abominations, but does
moreover tend to the Ruine of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in England. A Man need not to have
any great Sagacity to be convinced of this.
And that as much as it seems to establish for
ever the Protestant Religion in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
it does on the contrary destroy the very
Foundations of it.</p>
            <p>The ground upon which the Reformation
is founded in England, are the Laws which
have been made at several times for the settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95505:3"/>
of it, and to abolish either the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
of the Pope, or the Popish Religion
altogether. And as these Laws have been
made by the King and Parliament together,
so that the King has not the power to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
them without a Parliament, they secure
the Protestant Religion against the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prises
of such Kings as should ever think to
Destroy it.</p>
            <p>But now if this Declaration be executed,
we are no more to make any account of
those Solemn Laws which have been passed
in favour of the Reformation, they become
of no value, and the Protestant Religion is
intirely left to the King's Pleasure. This is
what will clearly appear from what we are
about to say.</p>
            <p>The King not having been able to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of the last Parliament to consent to a
Repeal of the Laws which had been made
against the Nonconformists, Dissolved the
Parliament it self. Not long after, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
attending a new one, he did that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
by his Declaration which the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
would not do conjunctly with him.
He granted a full Liberty of Conscience
to the Nonconformists; he freed them
from the Penalties which had been appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
against them, and dispensed with the
Oaths to which the Laws obliged all those
who were admitted to any Charges, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the Soldiery, or in Administration of
Justice, or of the Government. In pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of these Declarations he threw the
Protestants out of all Places of any great
Importance to clap in Papists in their room,
and goes on without ceasing to the intire
Establishment of Popery. Who does not
see, that if the Protestants approve these
Declarations, and themselves authorise such
Enterprises, the King will not stop here,
but that this will be only one step to carry
him much further? What can be said when
he shall do the same thing with reference
to those Laws which exclude the Papists out
of the Parliament, that he has done to those
which shut them out of all Charges and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys,
and forbad them the Exercise of their
Religion? Does not the Approbation of
such Declarations, as it overthrows these last,
carry with it before hand the approbation of
those which shall one day overthrow the
former? And if the King shall once give
himself the Authority to bring Papists into
the Parliament, who shall hinder him from
using Solicitations, Promises, Threatnings,
and a thousand other the like means to make
up a Popish Parliament? And who shall hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him with the Concurrence of that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
to Repeal all the Antient Laws that
had been passed against Popery, and make
new ones against the Protestants? These
are without doubt the Natural Consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of what the King at this time aims at.
These are the Fruits which one ought to
expect from it, if instead of Approving as
some have done his Enterprises against the
Laws, they do not on the contrary with all
imaginable Vigor oppose them.</p>
            <p>Reflect a little on what we have here
said, and you will consess that we have
reason to commend the Conduct of the
Bishops who refused to publish the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and to condemn those Dissenters who
have made their Addresses of Thanks for it.</p>
            <p>It is true that the Dissenters are to be
pitied, and that they have been treated
hardly enough, and we do not think it at
all strange, that they so earnestly sigh after
Liberty of Conscience. It is natural for
Men under Oppression to seek for Relief:
And Liberty of Conscience considered only
in it self, is it may be the Thing of all the
World the most precious and most desirable.
Would to God we were able to procure it
for them by any lawful means, and without
such ill Consequences, tho' it were at the
peril of our Lives! But we Conjure them
to consider how pernicious that Liberty of
Conscience is which is offer'd to them, as we
have just now shewn. On the one side, It
is inseparably linked with the Establishment
of Popery; and on the other, it cannot be
accepted without approving a terrible Breach
which his Majesty thereby makes upon the
Laws, and which would be the ruine of the
Reformation in his Kingdoms, were not
some Remedy brought to it. And where is
the Protestant who would buy Liberty of
Conscience at so dear a rate, and not rather
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95505:3"/>
choose to continue deprived of it all his Life?</p>
            <p>Should the private interest of our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
the Dissenters blind them in such a
manner, that they have no regard to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Interest of the Church? Should they
for enjoying a Liberty of Conscience so ill
assured, shut their Eyes to all other Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations?
How much better would it be for
them to re-unite themselves to the Bishops,
with whom they differ only in some points
of Discipline; but especially at this time,
when their Conduct ought to have entirely
defaced those unjust Suspicions which they
had conceived against them? But if they
could not so readily dispose themselves to
such a Re-union, would it not be better for
them to resolve still to continue without Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of Conscience, and expect some more
favourable time when they may by lawful
means attain it, than to open themselves a
gate to Popery, and to concur with it to the
Ruine of the Protestant Religion?</p>
            <p>You will, it may be, tell us, that it looks
ill in us, who so much complain, That we
have been deprived of Liberty of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in France, to find fault with the King
of England for granting it to his Subjects:
And that it is the least that can be allowed
to a Sovereign, to allow him the Right to
permit the exercise of his own Religion in
his own Kingdoms, and to make use of the
service of such of his Subjects as himself shall
think fit, by putting them into Charges and
Employs. You will add, That his Majesty
does not go about neither to abrogate the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Laws, nor to make new ones. All he
does being only to dispense with the Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of certain Laws in such of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
as he thinks fit, and for as long time as
he pleases; and that the right of dispensing
with, and suspending of Laws, is a right in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separably
ty'd to his Person: That for the
rest, the Protestant Religion does not run the
least Risque. There are Laws to shut the
Papists out of Parliament, and these Laws
can neither be dispensed with, nor suspended:
So that the Parliament partaking with the
King in the Legislative Power, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
still Protestant, there is no cause to fear,
that any thing should be done contrary to
the Protestant Religion. Besides, What pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
is there, that a King, who appears so
great an Enemy to oppression in matters of
Conscience and Religion, should ever have a
thought, tho he had the power himself, to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
in this very matter the greatest part of
his Subjects, and take from them that Liberty
of Conscience which he now grants to them,
and which he promises so inviolably to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
for the time to come?</p>
            <p>These are all the Objections that can with
any appearance of reason be made against
what we have before said. They may all be
reduced to five, which we shall examine in
their order. And we doubt not but we shall
easily make it appear, that they are all but
meer illusions.</p>
            <p>1. We do justly complain, That they have
taken from us our Liberty of Conscience in
France, because it was done contrary to the
Laws. And one may as justly complain, that the
K of England does labour to re-establish Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in his Country, because he cannot do it but
contrary to the Laws. Our Liberties in France
were founded upon solemn Laws, upon perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,
irrevocable, and sacred Edicts; and which
could not be recalled, without violating at
once the Public Faith, the Royal Word, and
the Sacredness of an Oath. And Popery has
been banished out of England by Laws made
by King and Parliament, and which cannot
be repealed but by the Authority of King
and Parliament together; so that therefore
there is just cause to complain, that the King
should go about to overthrow them himself
alone by his Declaration.</p>
            <p>2. It is not true that a Sovereign has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
the right to permit the exercise of his
own Religion in his Dominions, and to make
use of the service of such of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
as he himself shall think fit, that is to say,
by putting of them into Charges and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys:
And in particular, he has not this
right, when the Laws of his Country are
contrary thereunto, as they are in the case
before us. Every King is obliged to observe
the Fundamental Laws of his Kingdom. And
the King of England, as well as his Subjects,
ought to observe the Laws which have been
established by King and Parliament together.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:95505:4"/>
3. For the third, the distinction between
the Abrogation of a Law, and the Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
with and Suspending of it cannot here
be of any use; whether the King abrogates
the Laws which have been made against Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,
or whether without saying expresly
that he does abrogate them; he overthrows
them by his Declarations, under pretence of
dispensing with, or suspending of them;
It is still in effect the same thing. And to
what purpose is it that the Laws are not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated,
if in the mean time all sorts of
Charges are given to Papists, and Popery it
self be Re-established contrary to the tenor
of the Laws? The truth is, If the King has
such a power as this, if this be a Right ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
tied to his Person,'tis in vain that
the Parliament does partake with him in the
Legislature. This Authority of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is but a meer Name, a Shadow, a Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome,
a Chimera, and no more. The King
is still the absolute Master, because he can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
and without his Parliament, render
useless by his Declarations the Laws which
the Parliament shall have the most solemnly
established together with him. We confess
the King has Right of Dispensing in certain
Cases, as if the Concern be what belongs to his
private Interest, he may without doubt
whenever he pleases depart from his own
Rights; 'tis a Liberty which no body will
pretend to contest with him. But he
has not the power to dispense to the prejudice
of the Rights of the People, nor by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
put the Property, the Liberty, and
the Lives of his Protestant Subjects into the
hands of Papists.</p>
            <p>4. What we have now said in Answer
to the third Objection, will be more clear
from the Answer we are to give to the
fourth. They would perswade the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
that their Religion is in safety, because
on the one side the King cannot make Laws
without the Parliament; and that on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
there being Laws which exclude Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
out of the two Houses, it must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
follow, That the Parliament shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
to be Protestant. But if the King has
the Power to break throught the Laws, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the pretence of Dispensing with and
Suspending of them, What Security shall
the Protestants have that he will not Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spense
with the Papists, the observation of
those Laws which do exclude them out of
the Parliament, as well as he has Dispensed
with those that should have kept them out
of Charges and Imployments? What Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
shall they have that he will not at any
time hereafter suspend the Execution of the
former, as he has already suspended the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
of the latter? Which being so, what
should hinder us from seeing in a little time
a Popish Parliament, who together with the
King shall pass Laws contrary to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Religion? What difference can be
shewn between the one and the other of
these Laws, that the one should be liable to
be dispensed with and suspended, and
the other not? Were they not both esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
by the King and Parliament? Were
not both the one and the other made for the
Security of the Protestant Religion, and of
those who profess it? Are not the Rights of
the People concerned in the one, as well as
in the other? And whosoever Suffers and
Approves the King in the Violation of these
Rights in some things, does he not thereby
Authorise him to violate them in all? If
the King has power to put the Liberty and
Property and Lives of his Protestant Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
at the Mercy of the Papists, by placing
them in Charges contrary to the Law, why
should he not have the power to raise the
same Papists to the Authority of Legislators
by declaring them capable of sitting in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
seeing that is but contrary to Law?
Do not deceive your selves, the Laws are
the Barrier which bound the Authority of
the King, and if his Barrier be once bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
he will extend his Authority as far as he
pleases. And it will be impossible for you
after that to set any bounds to it.</p>
            <p>5. In fine, He must be very little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the Spirit of Popery, who i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magines
that it will be content to Re-establish
it self in England, without aiming to destroy
the Protestant Religion. Give it but Time
and Opportunity to fortifie it self, and you
may then expect to see what it is. In all
Places where it has got the Power in its
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95505:4"/>
hands, it will not only rule, but Rule alone,
and not suffer any other Religion besides it
self; and imploys the Sword and Fire to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate
that which it calls Heresie. Were
not this a Truth confirmed by infinite Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
both Ancient and Modern, which
every one knows who has read any thing of
History, it would be too much evidenced
by the Cruelties which it has so lately ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised
against the Churches of Hungary, of
France, and of the Valleys of Piemont. And
men ought not to be lulled asleep by
the Pretence of an Inclination which the
King of England would be thought to
have for Liberty of Conscience; nor by
the Promises which he makes to preserve it
to all his Subjects without distinction. Every
one knows that Perfidiousness and Breach of
Faith are Characters of Popery no less essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
to it than Cruelty. Can you doubt of this,
Gentlemen? You who so lately came from
making a sad Experiment of it? How often
did our King promise us to preserve us in
our Priviledges? How many Declarations,
how many Edicts did he set out to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose?
How many Oaths were taken to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
those Edicts? Did not this very King
Lewis XIV. himself solemnly promise by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Edicts and Declarations to maintain us
in all the Liberties which were granted to us
by the Edict of Nantes? And yet after all,
what scruple was there made to violate so
many Laws, so many Promises, and so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Oaths? The Protestants of England have
themselves also sometimes likewise experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
the same Infidelity: And not to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
here any other example, let us desire
them to remember only the Reign of Queen
Mary, what Promises she made at her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Crown, not to make any change
of Religion; and yet what bloody Laws she
afterwards passed to extinguish the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as soon as she saw her self fast in the
Throne? And with what inhumanity she
spilt the Blood of her most faithful Subjects
to accomplish that design? After such an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
as this, a man must be very credulous
indeed, and willing to deceive himself, that
will put too much confidence in the Promises
of the King that now Reigns. Do we not
know, that there are neither Promises nor
Oaths which the Pope does not pretend to
have power to dispense with in those whom
he employs for the extirpation of Heresie?
And do we not also know, that it is one of
the great Maxims of Popery, a Maxim au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized
both by the Doctrin and Practice of
the Council of Constance, That they are not
obliged to keep any Faith with Hereticks.
We ought not to believe that King James II.
a Prince who has so much Zeal for Popery,
should be govern'd by any other Maxims than
those of his Religion. And whosoever will
take the pains to examine his Conduct both
before and since his coming to the Crown,
will find that he has more than once put 'em
in practice.</p>
            <p>And this, Gentlemen, we suppose may be
sufficient to convince all reasonable persons,
that there is nothing more pernicious than
that Declaration which you have approved;
whether by publishing it, as some of you
have done, or by Addressing to the King to
thank him for it. When you shall have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected
upon these things, you will without
doubt your selves confess, that you have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
your selves to be amused with some ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary
advantages which you hope to make
by this Declaration. In the mean time, most
dear Brethren, you will pardon us, if we
have chanced to have let any thing slip that
is not agreeable to you. We had no design
to give the least offence either to you, or to
our Brethren the Dissenters of England. If
we have spoken our Thoughts freely of your
Conduct and of theirs, we have at least spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
with no less liberty of that of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops.
And God is our Witness, that we
have said nothing of the one or the other,
but in the sincerity of our heart, and out
of a desire to contribute somewhat to his
Glory, and the good of his Church. We are,</p>
