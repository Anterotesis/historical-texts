            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

folded vp in a scarfe; shut vp in a little Box, covered
with an <hi>Agnus Dei,</hi> written about with black letters
of perfumes, odorifirous Characters: and when
they draw it out themselves, they cast or sprinckle
some drops of holy water upon it, and which done,
they hang at the hafte of the said knife, five or sixe
graines of Corrall, which are blessed by them, who
blasphemously they give him to vnderstand, and
make him beleeve that so many blowes, as shall be
given by him with the said knife; so many soules
be released out of Purgatorie.</p>
            <p>Afterwards, putting the knife into the intended
Murtherers hand, they pronounce these words
saying:</p>

            <p>And thou oh dreadfull and terrible God, who

that he ought to murther a Tyrant, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
a Hereticke, and to give the Crowne to a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
King. And being by us disposed to this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious
Murther, vouchsafe to fortifie his senses,

give him Eagles wings, that the spight and malice

beames of thy joy and coelestiall felicity vpon his
sacred soule, to the end that by the blessed influence
thereof, the parts and members of his body also;
may be encouraged and enabled to this great work,
&amp; that it may chearfully dispose it selfe to this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:97388:4"/>
Combate without feare or shrinking pusillani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</p>
            <p>This accursed Conjuration being thus audacious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and gracelessely vttered, they carry the thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted
bloody Regicide, and set him before an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
where they shew him a Picture wherein the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
are seene and showne to have lifted vp and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
long since <hi>Iames Clement,</hi> a bloody Iacobine
Fryer, and represented him (as it were) before the
Throne of God, saying;</p>
            <p>Lord behold thy Pupill, behold thy well instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
Champion, and the accomplisher of thy iustice:
Whereupon all the Saints rise out of their seates to
make him roome, and give him place among them.
And when all these things are thus done and finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
there are no more but foure Iesuites onely left
with him, who when they come neare him; hey
with diabolicall impudency and lying flattery, say
unto him: that they seeme to perceive that there is
some Deity infused into him, and that they are so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonished
with the radiant light-shining and gliste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
in him, that they hold it their honour to kisse
his hands and feet; and make him madly to beleeve
that they account him not a meare man any longer;
but that they esteeme themselves (as it were) as
they say, half vnworthy of the happinesse and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
which he hath already obtained by his Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
resolution, and sighing deepely before him:
they say vnto him; we would that God had chosen
us, and called us to your estate: fince we should be
truly assured, that we should goe really, and direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
into Paradice without comming at Purgatorie.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97388:4"/>
And thus having intoxicated and bewitched the
miserable wretch, they thus leave him to his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

               <hi>The end of the Conjuration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BVt it is no wonder since they have so good cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence
with <hi>Iewes, Turkes,</hi> and <hi>Infidels,</hi> and
as <hi>Mahomet</hi> did in times past; so doe these propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
their Sect with fire and Sword and all manner
of violence; for let us looke vpon their first foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
he was a cruell and proud Hypocrite. <hi>Paul</hi>
the 3. who confirmed this order was both a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
and a bloody man<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> the one in having many
whores and bastards, the other in persecuting inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Christians in the Warres in <hi>Germany.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They professe obedience but practise Sedition
and Rebellion, <hi>Claudius Matthew</hi> a Iesuite, and <hi>R.
Henry</hi> the 3. of <hi>France</hi> his Confessor was the most
principall author and agent in the league of Papists
against him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Parsons</hi> and <hi>Campion</hi> were sent into <hi>England</hi> to
make a faction for the Papists.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iames Gordon, Creighton</hi> and <hi>Haies</hi> Jesuites, laid
a plot not onely for a rebellion in <hi>Scotland,</hi> but also
for the invasion of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither hath their beene any warre raised of late
in any part of Christendome, wherein they have
not borne a principall part.</p>
            <p>They talke much of Chastity, but how chaste
they are, let the <hi>Bona Robas</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Padua</hi>
witnesse.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:97388:5"/>
They professe poverty, but dwell in sumptuous
palace, the furniture of which is most gorgious
and princely, their Armes are placed above the
armes of Princes, they pretend to beg for the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi>
that are distressed beyond the Seas, but indeed
give them a small pittance and keepe all the rest to
themselves. In <hi>Venice</hi> they painted the Virgin
<hi>Mary</hi> like a Lady whom some of them loved.</p>
            <p>The like they did at <hi>Shertogen-Bosch</hi> in <hi>Brabant</hi>
at my being there, by the Lady of <hi>Piroy, Melanders</hi>
wife, which was Secretary vnto <hi>Grave Maurice,</hi>
and set her vp with a child in her armes in St. <hi>Iohns</hi>
Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> cast an <hi>Agnus Dei</hi> into a River, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it was to draw the Fish to the place, or to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
the violence of the waves, I cannot say.</p>
            <p>Nay, they administer the Sacrament to those
who goe about to murther Princes, as <hi>Walpoole</hi> did
to <hi>Squire,</hi> who poysoned the pommell of Queene
<hi>Elizabeths</hi> Saddle when she was to ride abroad.</p>
            <p>Moreover, they pervert Scriptures, and corrupt
the ancient Fathers, which power <hi>Gregorie</hi> the 13.
in a Bull bearing date 1575, seemeth to have given
them. But to proceed in their practises.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Benedict Palmio,</hi> and <hi>Anniball Codret,</hi> two famous
Iesuites did not onely teach <hi>William Parrie,</hi>
that it was lawfull to kill the Queene of <hi>England,</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:97388:5"/>
but also that it was an act very meritorious, <hi>Varade</hi>
a <hi>Iesuite</hi> of <hi>Lyon,</hi> in confession did absolve <hi>Peter
Barrien</hi> that went about to murder that Prince of
famous memory <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, late King of
<hi>France,</hi> assuing him that it was a most noble and a
Christian Act, for which he should obtaine Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiall
glory. In <hi>Paris</hi> the <hi>Iesuits</hi> not onely resolved
that it was lawfull to kill King <hi>Henry</hi> the third, but
by their perswasions did induce <hi>Iames Clement</hi> to
effect the same.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Richard Williams, Edmund Yorke, Patrick Ocollen,
Iohn Savage,</hi> and dives others, who have beene at
sundry times executed for attempting to kill Queen
<hi>Elizabeth,</hi> confessed that they were set on by <hi>Holt</hi>
and other Iesuits, and were made beleeve it was a
most meritorious Act.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Peter Panne</hi> at his execution at <hi>Leyden,</hi> confessed
that he was hired by the Iesuites to kill <hi>Count
Maurice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Rebels of <hi>Paris</hi> that held out against their
King, were principally directed and encouraged by
<hi>Comolet</hi> and other Iesuites.</p>
            <p>Nay when money and victuals grew scarce in
<hi>Paris,</hi> yet would not the Iesuites suffer the Rebels
to give over, but came into the Trenches and
brought them reliefe both of meate and money.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:97388:6"/>
And by the practises of this seditious Sect, the
cities of <hi>Perigueux, Agen, Tholofe, Verdun,</hi> and divers
tooke armes against the King.</p>
            <p>They perswaded the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> to goe
on foote to visit the Reliques of some Saint or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
while these gallants rode in Wagons.</p>
            <p>I know not whose device it was, except some of
theirs, that made young wenches and marryed
wives beleeve if they could stride over at one

            <p>The Princesse of <hi>Tyrole</hi> not many years agoe, built
the Jesuites an house hard by her owne, but they
like Foxes beate the Princesse out of her own <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,</hi>
her sumptuous house, and thrust her into their

            <p>By meanes of their confessions, they have drawne

many rich houses, leaving little to the Widdowes

            <p>
               <hi>Maldonate</hi> a <hi>Iesuite</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> caused the president
<hi>Monbrun,</hi> St. <hi>Andrew,</hi> through his perswasion in
confession to give the <hi>Iesuites</hi> all his moveables
and halfe his revenues.</p>
            <p>The president <hi>Goudran of Dijon</hi> making his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament
by their practises, gave only halfe a crown
to his sister, and to the Colledge of Jesuites, seven
thousand pounds French money in rent.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Bordeaux</hi> they ruined the whole house of
<hi>Bollans,</hi> and impaired the state of the house of <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gebaston.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Country of the Grisons, they perswaded a
silly old man called <hi>Lambertin,</hi> to sell all that hee
had, and to take their Habit, who gathering 20000.
<hi>Duckats,</hi> meant to give them all from his onely
daughter.</p>
            <p>So cruell they are that they spare none, who is
repugnant to their purposes; <hi>Masteus</hi> complaineth
that the elder Jesuites managed all things absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
they brought <hi>Harbort</hi> and <hi>Glisell,</hi> two famous
preachers in <hi>Vienna,</hi> in danger, onely envying their
excellency. One <hi>Lupus</hi> a <hi>Franciscane</hi> in <hi>Millan,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

               <hi>Iohn Chastell</hi> was so wonne and overcome by the
Iesuits, that at his death he denyed that the Jesuits
had any end in the businesse; but his examination
before the whole Court of <hi>Paris,</hi> affirmeth flat
contrary, but onely by them plotted, wherefore it
was ordered, that <hi>they should depart out of Paris with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
three dayes, and out of France within fifteene dayes,</hi>
after notice to them given, as corrupters of youth,
perturbers of publique peace, and enemies of the
King and State. <hi>Iohn Chastell</hi> himselfe also confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
that <hi>Garet</hi> a <hi>Iesuite</hi> did teach him these lessons,
which made him resolve to kill the King.</p>
            <p>It is not, nor I hope shall never be forgotten, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
to be engraven in Letters of brasse, the most
hellish and damnable plot of the powder Treason,
in the dayes of our late Soveraigne of blessed me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
King JAMES, plotted onely by the <hi>Iesuites</hi>
whereof <hi>Garnet</hi> was one of the principals, who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
had beene a Corrector to a <hi>Printers</hi> presse
here in <hi>London,</hi> and I shall never forget what that
Reverend Bishop of <hi>Norwich</hi> Doctor <hi>Overall</hi> told
me sitting at his house in <hi>Norwich,</hi> what <hi>Garnet</hi>
confessed unto him at the time of his execution, he
being at that time Deane of <hi>Paules,</hi> (Master <hi>Garnet</hi>
quoth he) your time is very short in this world, tell
me I pray you as you will answere before GOD,
<hi>what just fault can you find with our Liturgie, or
Common prayer, the Booke which wee vse in the
Church of England?</hi> (truely (quoth Mr. <hi>Garnet</hi>) none
at all, it is very agreeable to the word of God, and
to the practise of the <hi>primitive Church,</hi> and truely
Mr. <hi>Deane</hi> you are very happy in your Booke of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:97388:7"/>
               <hi>Common Prayer,</hi> afterwards this <hi>Garnet</hi> was made a

they, was evidently to be seen in a wheat or barley

you must understand that our <hi>Iesuites</hi> keepe three
severall stations, some follow the Camp and armies
in the field, as they did in <hi>France,</hi> and not long since
<hi>Spinola's</hi> army in <hi>Cleve</hi> &amp; <hi>Gutick</hi> being the greatest
<hi>incendiaries</hi> or <hi>Boutefeux</hi> in the world, setting Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

others follow the Court, and can come with God-morrow
Madame into a Ladyes Chamber before
she be stirring, others like the Nether Milstone re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
setled in their Cloyster without Motion,
yet helpe they the other to grind their Grist, for

that their Engines are set on worke, and that they

an exceeding blemish to our Nation aud Country,
which lying in so cold a <hi>climate, should breed and

            <p>We all know, God appointed Kings and Princes
to be Nursing Fathers, and Nursing Mothers to his

these Wolves that walke in sheeps clothing, are not

an absolutions of an easier nature: there was

daughters neere to <hi>Beneventum</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi> with
child, the Archbishop after some sharpe rebuke
caused him onely for his penance, to say the Lords
<hi>Prayer</hi> five times over, which done, he received for
absolution.</p>
            <p>A merry companion having committed many
foule offences, came to his <hi>Confessour</hi> the parish
<hi>Priest</hi> where he dwelt, who after he had laid open
all his offences, the <hi>Priest</hi> told him his sinnes were
so many and so hainous, that he could not absolve
him without a great summe of money; the fellow
told him he had no money, but he would give him
an hare, <hi>well I am content quoth the Priest,</hi> where is
she, Sir, J have her not heere, but you shall receive
her when my Dog can catch her.</p>
            <p>There was a <hi>Priest</hi> in <hi>England</hi> of late yeares, that
confessed how he had shrived few women, but he
lay with them, and yet our simple Recusants nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
have a sence of their owne shame, nor privide
a Remedy for for it. Besides of all others are apt to
be drawne into disloyall practises, as by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Arden, Somervile, Babington,</hi> and many other
in Quee <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, of <hi>Watson Cateby, Digby,

their people, that they openly call one another to

as familiarly as one neighbour will call another to
