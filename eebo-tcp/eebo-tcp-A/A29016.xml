         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE riſe of the following Tract,
intimated near the beginning
of it, was not ſuch a fictitious thing
as the Reader may imagine. But <hi>tho'</hi>
I really receiv'd a Viſit from a Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,
known to me, but by his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
purpoſely to propoſe to me
his Objections againſt the Corpuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Phyloſophy, and he had a long
conference with me about them; <hi>yet,</hi>
becauſe the Hiſtorical paſſages of that
interview, cannot be circumſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
related in few words, I ſuppoſe
the Reader will willingly allow me,
to imploy this Preface in giving him
Advertiſements about the ſcope and
deſign of the Treatiſe it uſhers in.</p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore advertiſe him,
that he will be much miſtaken, if he
ſhall expect, as I perceive ſeveral
have done already, to find in this
Book a Collection of Receits of Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick
<pb facs="tcp:49353:3"/>
Remedies. For a moderate atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the Title Page will enable
him manifeſtly to diſcern, that the
following Paper in its own nature,
and in the direct and immediate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
of it, is a Speculative diſcourſe;
ſince it tends but to ſhow, that, in
caſe there be Specifick Medicines (as
'tis probable there are ſome) their
experienced vertues are reconcilcable
to the principles of the Corpuſcular,
or (as many call it) the new Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy;
and at leaſt do not ſubvert
them; if theſe Effects and Operations
be not clearly explicable by them.
And as this is the, avowed ſcope of
the following Eſſay, ſo I choſe to
treat of it leſs like a Phyſician than a
Naturaliſt. For Phyſicks being a
Science, whoſe large extent invites
and warrants its Cultivaters, to ſearch
into the nature and <hi>Phaenomina</hi> of
things corporeal indefinitely; it muſt
often happen, that the Medicinal Art
and this Science will be converſant
about the ſame ſubject, tho' in differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ways, and with differing ſcopes.
<pb facs="tcp:49353:3"/>
For there are divers hurtful or advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous
accidents and changes of the
humane Body, whereof the Natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt
takes notice, but as they are
Phaenomina or changes produc'd by
Natural cauſes in the Body of an Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal,
whilſt the Phyſician conſiders
them as Symptoms of Diſeaſes, or
Effects of Medicines, the former di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting
his Speculations to the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of truth, and the other his Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the recovery of health. But
becauſe I elſe where particularly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
the Cognation and diſtinction,
between the Diſcipline that the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turaliſt,
and that which the Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
cultivates, I ſhall for bear to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
them in this place; but rather
acknowledge, that I ſcarce doubt but
that I might have inrich'd the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
diſcourſe with ſome choice parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,
if I would have perus'd and
borrow'd from the learned writings
of the famous Dr. <hi>Willis:</hi> But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
that I had not his Books at hand,
I was unwilling to be prepoſſeſs'd or
byaſs'd by his notions, and I preſum'd
<pb facs="tcp:49353:4"/>
the Perſon I wrote to would not be
unwilling to ſee, what, without
their help, the conſideration of the
thing I treated of ſuggeſted to me.
About this I ſhall now proceed to
obſerve, that <hi>tho'</hi> the direct ſcope
of the following diſcourſe, being to
explicate the Phaenomena of ſome bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
which from their uſe, are call'd
Medicinal, and declare how poſſibly
they may produce the Effects aſcrib'd
to them, the enſuing diſcourſe is for
the main of a Speculative nature;
<hi>yet</hi> the conſequences that may be
drawn from it, and the applications
that in this induſtrious Age are like
to be made of ſome things that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
may probably render it practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.
For I have more than once ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd,
that divers conſiderable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies,
and ſome not unpromising
methods too, have either remain'd
unthought of, both by many Gale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
Phyſicians, and divers of their
modern Antagoniſts too, or if pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
by others, have been rejected
or ſlighted, barely upon this ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
<pb facs="tcp:49353:4"/>
that no rational account can
be given of their way of working, or
how they ſhould do good, and 'tis
ſaid to be unworthy of a rational
Phyſician; to make uſe of a Remedy,
of whoſe manner of operating he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
give a reaſon. How prejudicial
it may be to many Patients, that
Phyſicians be prepoſſeſs'd with a bad
opinion of an uſeful Remedy, may be
gueſs'd by him that ſhall conſider,
what multitudes of Teeming Women,
that probably might have been ſav'd
by the skilful uſe of Phlebotomy, have
been ſuffer'd to dye for want of it, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a diſlike of that Remedy that Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians
for many Ages thought to be
grounded upon no leſs authority than
a poſitive Aphoriſm of <hi>Hippocrates.</hi>
And therefore if, to remove the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
objection newly mention'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
that whole kind of Remedies
call'd Specificks, the following Tract
has been ſo happy as to ſhow, that
'tis at leaſt poſſible, that Medicines
ſaid to be <hi>Specifick,</hi> may perform
their operations by ways, which tho'
<pb facs="tcp:49353:5"/>
not explicable by the vulgar Doctrine
of the Schools, are intelligible, and
reconcileable, to the clear Principles
of the Mechanical Phyloſophy: If, I
ſay, this have been done by the Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
propos'd in this Treatiſe, it may
conduce ſomewhat to inlarge the
minds of many Phyſicians, and invite
them to make uſe of ſeveral Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
of which they did not think,
or againſt which they were preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic'd.
And ſince Specificks, where
they can be had, are wont to be free
from any immoderate manifeſt qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and for the moſt part to work
more benignly, as well as more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually,
<hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> than other
Medicines; I think that to bring them
into due requeſt, and invite Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
to ſearch for new ones, as well as
imploy thoſe already known, may
tend much to ſhorten many Cures,
and make them more eaſy and more
ſafe.</p>

Advertiſement
OF THE
PUBLISHER.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>THE Author had occaſion to
touch upon ſome of the ſame
Subjects that he here treats of,
in a Book,</hi> The Uſefulneſs of
Experimental Philoſophy, <hi>long ſince
publiſht; but he had the misfortune to be
reduc'd to write the following Diſcourſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout</hi>
Specifick Medicines, <hi>and the Utility
of</hi> Simple Remedies, <hi>in a Village where</hi>
he had not that Book at hand, and
could not call to mind all that he had
therein publiſhed ſeventeen or eighteen
<pb facs="tcp:49353:6"/>
years before: On which account, though
he ſtudiouſly forbore to repeat the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
that he remembred to have ſet
down in that Treatiſe, how oppoſite ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they would have been to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
purpoſe, yet having ſince the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Diſcourſe was ſent to the Preſs, got
a ſight of that other (which he had not
read in many years) he finds upon a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient
View that ſome of the ſame things
are mentioned in both Books: at which
diſcovery, though he be ſomewhat trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
yet he is the leſs ſo, becauſe they are
but few, in compariſon of the new ones,
and ſet down on ſuch occaſions, or with
ſuch other circumſtances, that may
make a favourable Reader look on them,
as not bare repetitions. And tho' in the
forecited Treatiſe, ſome of the motives to
make uſe of ſimple Medicines, be lightly
touch'd, yet beſides, that they are not all
that are mention'd in the following invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
thoſe arguments that are there
but pointed at, are here treated of, and
both confirm'd, and explain'd by other
Obſervations, and Receits. And ſince the
Printed Book above mention'd has been
<pb facs="tcp:49353:6"/>
for divers years very ſcarce, 'tis preſum'd
that thoſe many Readers that have it not,
will not be diſpleas'd to find here ſome
few things for which they cannot reſort
thither: And as the Author foreſaw he
might be oblig'd to conſent to the tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the following papers into the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Tongue, ſo he thought his Latine
Readers would not repine, tho' a great
number of particulars had been borrow'd
of a Book that is not yet extant in their
Language.</p>
            <p>I ſhall give you no farther account of
the particulars contain'd in the two enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Treatiſes, ſince the title pages give a
ſufficient hint of the Noble Authors
main ſcope, and chief deſign, I ſhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſay, that the firſt Treatiſe effectually
performs what has not been as yet at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
by anſwering a very conſiderable
objection againſt the Doctrine of the
Corpuſcularian Philoſophers, namely,
that which is taken from what we call
Specifick Medicines, <hi>their vertues, and
operations being hitherto judg'd by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
of the learnedeſt ſort wholly irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable
to the principles of the new Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy;
<pb facs="tcp:49353:7"/>
whereby he gratifieth not only
the curioſity of Speculative Philoſophers,
but does likewiſe a notable piece of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to all Phyſicians, uſhering in here
and there ſuch notions as may be the
Principles of a ſure, and eaſie Practice,
yea and enable them too, to give a good
account of their own Receits; I mean of
thoſe that contain Specifick Medicines,
whoſe vertues hitherto we could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
to our</hi> Patients, <hi>but by ſaying they
did work we knew not how, or by ſome</hi>
Specifick, <hi>that is by ſome occult or hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>
quality. <hi>The ſecond Treatiſe, which
is an Invitation to the uſe of ſimple Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines,
is of ſuch a general uſe, that
Mankind is much indebted to this Noble
Author for it, 'tis ſo well grounded both
upon Reaſon, and Experience, that this
as well as the foremention'd diſcourſe,
does fully anſwer the great repute of the
Author both at home, and abroad, where
he is commonly ſtil'd the</hi> Engliſh Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher.</p>

the Mechanical Origine of
Qualities.</head>
               <p>AMong the ſeveral kinds of oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
qualities that, which is
afforded by Specifick Vertues of
Medicines, is not here to be pretermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
For theſe Qualities do not only,
like other hidden ones, invite, our
curioſity, but concern our health and
may hereafter (if I miſtake not) ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to be of much greater importance,
than as yet they are commonly
thought. However it may be worth
while to take ſome notice of them
in this place, if it were but becauſe
divers Learned Phyſicians do, as
ſome of themſelves owned to me,
reject or disfavour the Corpuſcular
Philoſophy upon this account, That
they think it cannot be reconcil'd to
the vertues of Specifick Remedies, or
at leaſt cannot, either in a particular
or in a general way, give any tolerable
account of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:49353:10"/>
I find three ſorts of Qualities men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
in the Books of phyſicians, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the notion of <hi>Specifick Vertues.</hi>
For by <hi>ſome</hi> a Medicine is ſaid to have
a Specifick Faculty, becauſe it is emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
and peculiarly friendly to this
or that particular Part of the Body, as
the Heart, the Brain, the Eye, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By
others it is ſaid, by a Specifick Power,
to attract and evacuate ſome deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
Humour, as Choler, Phlegm,
<hi>&amp;c</hi> But the moſt uſual account, upon
which a Medicine is ſaid to be <hi>Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick,</hi>
is that it has the vertue to cure,
by ſome hidden property, this or
that particular diſeaſe, as a Pleuriſy,
an <hi>Aſthma,</hi> the colick, the Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this being the principal
and moſt common ſenſe, in which the
word <hi>Specifick</hi> is employ'd by Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians,
I ſhall ordinarily make uſe of
it, in that ſenſe, in the following diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
but yet without ſo confining
my ſelf to it, as not to conſider it in
the two other ſenſes, when occaſion
ſhall require.</p>
               <p>But before I deſcend to particular
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49353:10"/>
conſidertions 'twill not be amiſs to
obviate miſtakes by declaring, in what
ſenſe in this Paper, I ſhall employ
the Term <hi>Specifick Medicine,</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in the laſt of the three foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
Acceptions.</p>
               <p>I do not then by a <hi>Specifick</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
a Medicine, that will cure the
diſeaſe it is good for Infallibly, and in
all Perſons that take it, for I confeſs
I never yet met with any ſuch reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
Nor do I by <hi>Specifick</hi> underſtand
a Medicine that, almoſt like a <hi>Charm,</hi>
works only by ſome latent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable
Property, without the
aſſiſtance of any known Quality, as
Purgative, Diuretick, Sudorific, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
to be found in other Medicines:
But by <hi>Specifick</hi> I mean, in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
ſuch a medicine as very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, 
if not moſt commonly, does very
conſiderably, and better than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Medicines, relieve the Patient,
whether by quite curing, or much
leſſening, his diſeaſe, and which acts
<hi>principally</hi> upon the account of ſome
Property or peculiar vertue; ſo that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49353:11"/>
if it have any manifeſt Quality that is
friendly, yet the good it does is
greater, than can reaſonably be aſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the degree it has of that mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
Quality, as hot, cold, bitter, ſudo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifick,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are two grand Queſtions,
that may be propos'd about the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifick
vertues aſcrib'd to Medicines,
The firſt is, whether there be really
any ſuch, and the ſecond whether,
if there be, the Mechanical <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis</hi>
can be accommodated to
them.</p>
               <p>The former of theſe Queſtions
may admit of a double ſenſe, for
it may be propos'd with reſpect,
either to the preſent meaſure of our
knowledge, or to thoſe further attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that, in future times, men may
arrive at.</p>
               <p>In the latter of theſe ſenſes, (to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch
firſt the conſideration of that)
I ſhall not preſume to maintain, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
reſtriction, either part of the
Queſtion. For I do not only hope,
but am apt to think, that in time
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49353:11"/>
the Induſtry and Sagacity of men
will be able to diſcover Intelligible
cauſes of moſt of thoſe Qualities, that
now paſs for <hi>Occult,</hi> and among them
of many of the Specifick vertues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd
to Medicines. And yet, on the
other ſide, I much fear that men will
not be ſucceſsful, in tracing out the
true and immediate cauſes of thoſe
good effects of ſome remedies, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon ſuch fine and uncommon
Textures, and ſuch latent and odly
guided Motions, as fall not under
our Senſes, thô perhaps aſſiſted
by Inſtruments. Which conjecture
will appear the leſs improbable, if we
conſider thoſe admirable <hi>Idioſyncraſiae,</hi>
or Peculiarities of Diſpoſition, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the Books of eminent Writers af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
us many inſtances, to whoſe num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
I could, upon my own Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
add ſeveral, if I thought it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
And, thô I am not ignorant that
ſome of theſe may be plauſibly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
for, as that of ſome mens a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
to cheeſe, or to cats; yet I
do not think that the like expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49353:12"/>
can be extended to ſome
others, that might be nam'd, if it
were here pertinent to diſcuſs that
throughly.</p>
               <p>As to the former ſenſe, of the
Queſtion lately propounded, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
my ſelf very amiable to the
Affirmative, as far as I can judge by
thoſe writings of Phyſicians I have
had occaſion to peruſe. Which limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
I add, becauſe I would not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate
from the knowledge of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
perſons, who in ſo learned and
inquiſitive an Age, may be arriv'd at
far greater attainments than thoſe
Phyſicians have done, that have
entertain'd the Publick about the
Occult and Specifick Qualities of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines.</p>
               <p>I know there have been, and ſtill
are, Dogmatical Phyſitians, that upon
the Principles, as they pretend, of the
School-Philoſophy, reject all Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinal
vertues that they think not
reducible to manifeſt Qualities. But
of ſuch <hi>Galen</hi> ſomewhere juſtly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains,
that they either deny matters
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49353:12"/>
of fact, or aſſign very incompetent
cauſes o the effects they pretend to
explain. And, for my part, I am ſo far
from believing theſe men capable of
giving ſufficient reaſons of the more
hidden Properties of Medicins, that
I am not apt to think them able, by
their Principles, to give clear and
particular explications, even of the
more eaſy and familiar vertues of ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
               <p>I am therefore diſpos'd to think
that, in the ſenſe formerly deliver'd of
the Term <hi>Specifick Medicines,</hi> there are
ſome Remedies that deſerve that
name.</p>
               <p>To this opinion I have been led by
ſeveral Reaſons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And firſt (to begin
with the leaſt weighty) it has the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage
of many learned Phyſicians,
both Ancient and Modern, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
that of <hi>Galen</hi> himſelf in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
places of his Works. And I
remember that, treating of a Specifick
Remedy againſt the biting of a mad
Dog, which vertue he aſcribes to an
occult Quality, or, as he ſpeaks, to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49353:13"/>
the Propriety of the
whole Subſtance;<note place="margin">Galen. <hi>de Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pl. Medicam. Fac.</hi> Lib. 11.</note> he
takes occaſion to promiſe,
that he would write a Book of things
that operate upon that account.
Which Book, if it had ſcap'd with his
other Works (for he elſewhere cites
it as having written it) would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
have furniſh'd us with ſeveral
things to ſtrengthen our opinion.
And thô in Matters Philoſophical I
am little ſway'd by mere Authority,
yet the concurrent ſuffrage, of many
eminent Phyſicians, may in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy
be the more conſiderable,
becauſe moſt of them, being noted
Practitioners, had opportunity to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
whether or no any Remedies
deſerv'd the name of Specificks: And
their Teſtimony is, in our caſe, the
more to be regarded, becauſe Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,
eſpecially famous ones, are not
wont to be willing to acknowledge,
that there are Effects, which fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Cogniſance of their art, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
they cannot give the cauſes.</p>
               <p>My next Inducement, to admit
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49353:13"/>
Specificks, is founded upon Parity of
Reaſon: For 'tis manifeſt, that there
are divere formidable Maladies, that
are produc'd by inconſiderable quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities
of Poyſons, that have not been
diſcover'd to produce ſuch great and
diſmal Effects by any Manifeſt Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
whether firſt, ſecond, or third, as
Medical Authors (I doubt not over
accurately) diſtinguiſh them.</p>
               <p>On this occaſion I ſhall add a very
odd Accident, about which I was
advis'd with by an expert oculiſt, very
ſoon after it happen'd: The Caſe was
this. A man lying ſomewhat long
in Bed in the morning, and chancing,
as he lay upon his Back, to caſt up
his Eyes to the Teſter, ſaw a great
Spider, that ſtood ſtill juſt over his
Face: Wherefore having reproach'd
his Wife, who happen'd to be in the
Room, with groſs negligence, ſhe
took a Broom, and ſtruck it upon the
upper part of the Teſter, to beat
down the Spider; but the Animal
held ſo faſt with his Feet that ſhe
miſs'd her aim, and he, whether frigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49353:14"/>
or irritated by this rude ſhake,
let fall upon the Man, that was ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at it to ſee what would happen, a
drop of Liquor that lighted directly
upon one of his open Eyes. But
finding no heat nor ſharpneſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue,
but rather a very ſenſible cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
he made nothing of it, but
roſe and put on his cloth's. But
preſently after, happening to rub with
his finger the other Eye, he was ſadly
ſurpriz'd to find himſelf ſuddenly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nighted,
and calling for aſſiſtance, he
found that the Eye, which the Spider
had let fall ſomething on, thô no
change were noted in it by the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanders,
was totally depriv'd of ſight.
Upon which ſcore he repair'd to the
above mention'd Oculiſts: But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he afterwards recover'd his ſight
or no, I cannot tell; all the endeavours
the Oculiſt arid I imploy'd to find out
his Lodging (to which it ſeems he had
left a wrong direction) having been
Fruitleſs. This brought into my
mind, that I had ſometimes wonder'd
to ſee how much more quickly Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49353:14"/>
will kill Flyes, than the cutting
off their Heads, or running them quite
through with Pins or Needles will do.</p>
               <p>But to return to what I was ſaying,
of the great Miſchief done to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Bodies, by very ſmall quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Poyſon; methinks one may
thence argue that it ſeems not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
that Appropriated Medicines,
eſpecially when adminiſtred in
greater quantity, may produce very
notable changes in the Humane Body
to the advantage of it. But on this
occaſion I expect to be told, that 'tis
much more eaſy to do harm,
than good, and I confeſs 'tis ſo
in the general, but yet, in the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
caſe before us, I conſider that
ſome Poyſons, that produce ſuch
dreadful Symptoms in the Body, are
frequently cur'd by their appropriated
Antidotes, which therefore muſt have
a Sanative Power great enough, with
the help but of the ordinary Concourſe
of Nature, to ſurmount the efficacy
of the venemous Matter. To which
I ſhall add this more familiar inſtance
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49353:15"/>
that <hi>as</hi> Perfumes do often enough
produce various, and ſometimes
frightful, Symptoms in many Hiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
Women; <hi>ſo</hi> the fumes of the
burnt Feathers of Patridges, Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocks,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> do frequently cure the
Fit in as little time as the ſweet
ſmell procur'd it. And I have often
found the ſmell of ſtrong Spirit of
Harts-horn, or Sal-Armoniac, reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſuch Women in far leſs time, than
the fragrant odours imploy'd to make
them ſi<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>The Third and Principal Inducement
I had, to think there are Specifick
Remedies, is from Experience. I
might urge, on this occaſion, the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of <hi>Galen,</hi> who tells us more
than once, that he himſelf therefore
confided, in the Aſhes of burnt Craw-Fiſhes,
for the cure of the biting of a
Mad Dog, becauſe never any of thoſe
that took it dy'd. And to annex
that upon the by, for the uſefulneſs
of it, he adds, that thô
the effect of theſe aſhes
be admirable,<note place="margin">Galen. <hi>de ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pl. Med. Fac. lib.</hi> 11.</note> even when
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49353:15"/>
given alone, yet their vertue may
be increaſed, by adding to ten parts
of burnt Craw Fiſhes five of <hi>Gentian</hi>
and one of Frank-incenſe. And the
great vertue of theſe burnt Shell-fiſhes
I find to have been taken notice of
ſome ages before <hi>Galen; Dioſcorides</hi>
much commending them againſt the
ſame Diſeaſe that the <hi>Pergamenian</hi>
does.</p>
               <p>I ſhall in this place purpoſely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
to mention ſuch Medicines, as,
thô by divers learned Phyſicians
commended as Specificks, are yet by
others much queſtion'd, if not flatly
deny'd to be ſo. Since it may be
more proper, and may perhaps ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
to mention two or three, whoſe
efficacy is more notorious.</p>
               <p>'Tis known, by almoſt daily expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
in <hi>Italy</hi> and divers other hot
Countreys, that thô the ſtings of
Scorpions oftentimes produce very
acute Pains, and formidable Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms,
yet the Miſchief is eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy'd,
either by preſently cruſhing
the Body of the Scorpion upon the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49353:16"/>
Hurt, or by anointing the part
affected with Oyl of Scorpions, (for
that reaſon to be almoſt every where
found,) which being made by ſuffoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
thoſe Inſects in common Oyl,
and keeping it long in the Sun, the
Liquor does not at all appear to have
any manifeſt Quality, to which
its ſanative Efficacy may be aſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>The Bitings of thoſe Serpents,
which for the noiſe they are wont to
make, with a kind of empty Bladders
in their Tails, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> call Rattle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnakes,
are counted much more poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous
and dangerous than the ſtings
of Scorpions. Of which I remember
a learned Eye witneſs, that liv'd
divers years in <hi>Virginia,</hi> where they
much abound, related to me a very
ſtrange Inſtance, which I cannot now
ſtay to ſet down. And yet the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
Planters, when they have the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
to be bitten by theſe Serpents,
are wont to cure themſelves very
happily by the uſe of that plant, which
from its effects, and the place it grows
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49353:16"/>
in, is well known by the name of
<hi>Virginian Snakeweed,</hi> [<hi>or Serpentaria
Virginiana.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the <hi>Peruvian Bark,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
call'd here in <hi>England</hi> the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits
Powder,</hi> is a Specifick againſt
Agues, particularly Quartans, divers
learned Phyſicians not only grant but
aſſert. And I remember the juſtly
famous Dt. <hi>Willis</hi> gave me this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of it in private diſcourſe, (not
without taking notice that ſome
decry'd it,) <hi>'Tis the nobleſt Medicine we</hi>
(meaning the <hi>Phyſicians</hi>) <hi>know.</hi> But
thô I will not diſpute, whether it be ſo
certain and ſafe a Specifick for Agues,
as 'tis believ'd by, divers eminent
Doctors, yet I think it can ſcarce be
deny'd, to be a Specifick Medicine
to ſtop the fits of Agues, (in the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Specifick Remedies</hi> formerly
deliver'd) ſince it does that far more
effectually, than the generality of
Phyſicians, for many ages, were wont
to do, with their other Antifebrile Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines.</p>
               <p>I might here tell you, that I have
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49353:17"/>
my ſelf ſeen a ſtone, whoſe efficacy
in ſtopping Hemorrhagies invited my
Wonder; and another, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
extraordinary things in more
than one Diſtemper thô I could not
perceive that either of them did theſe
things by any manifeſt Quality. And
I might here add ſome other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
that may be borrow'd from
Experience, in favour of our opinion,
but that 'tis like they will be more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
alledg'd hereafter in ſome places
of the remaining Part of our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
               <p>I know thoſe, that have rejected
Specifick Medicines, have confidently
urg'd three plauſible Arguments
againſt them. For <hi>ſome</hi> Phyſicians de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
there are any Effects of Medicines
ſo conſiderable, as to make them
deſerve the name of <hi>Specifick. Others</hi>
would probably allow that Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
favours our opinion, if they did
not think the way of a <hi>Specifick</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines
operating muſt be inexplicable,
and conſequently ought not be
admitted by Phyſicians. And <hi>others</hi>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:49353:17"/>
again (being of Sentiments very
differing from theſe) will allow them
to be very efficacious, but endeavour
to derive their whole Efficacy from
Manifeſt Qualities, as heat, cold, te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity
of Parts, faculty of making large
Evacuations by Vomit, Siege, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But theſe objections will be more
opportunely conſider'd in due places,
Only there is one Argument, that
may be objected by the deniers of
Specifick remedies, which I confeſs
is ſo ſpecious, as to deſerve to be
particularly examin'd in this place,
leſt it ſhould, if unremov'd, beget too
ſtrong a prejudice againſt a great part
of the enſuing Diſcourſe. For it may
be ſaid, that a Medicine taken in at
the Mouth muſt, in the Stomach and
Guts, be at leſt very much chang'd by
Digeſtion, and the Aliments it meets
with there, and a good Part of it
will be proſcrib'd among excrements.
That alter it has paſs'd out of the
Stomach, it muſt meet with divers
ſtrainers of differing Textures, which
will probably ſtop all or moſt of the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49353:18"/>
Medicinal Corpuſcles that would
pervade them. And that if any ſhal
be ſo lucky, or ſo penetrating, as to
ſurmount all theſe obſtacles, they will
probably either be aſſimilated unto
the Subſtance of the Body, or quite
chang'd by the parts they will be
fain to combine with there. Or, if
yet any ſhould be able ſo obſtinately
to retain their priſtine Nature, they
will in all likely hood be too few to
have any conſiderable operation
upon the Body. But to this plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
objection I have ſeveral
things to oppoſe by way of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
               <p>1. And firſt I may repreſent, that
divers Specifick Medicines, as ſome
ſome Oyntments, Plaiſters, Poultis's
Amulets, <hi>Pericarpia, &amp;c.</hi> Being out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
apply'd, their Corpuſcles can
get into the Maſs of Blood without
paſſing through the Stomach, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
are not concern'd in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
objection.</p>
               <p>2. Againſt moſt of the <hi>Galenical</hi>
Phyſicians, that are wont to urge
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49353:18"/>
the formerly propos'd objection, I
ſee not why one may not argue <hi>ad
hominem</hi> by putting them in mind,
that the ſame Difficulties for the
main, or others not inferior, may be
alledged againſt a common opinion of
their own. For ſince they believe
that Purgatives, Cordials, Diaphore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
beſides Cephalicks, Hepaticks,
and ſome other ſorts of Medicines, do
contemperate, and ſweeten the Blood,
and uſefully affect the newly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
ſtable Parts; and ſince theſe
Medicines act not by naked Qualities
but by ſmall Particles, of their own
ſubſtance, if they can give us an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible
account of the ingreſs of
theſe Particles in conſiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
into the Receſſes of the Body,
without being, diſpoyl'd of their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
virtues, they will at the ſame
time inſtruct us, how to anſwer
the objection they urge againſt
us.</p>
               <p>3. And in regard the generality of
Phyſicians hold, that Milk, and U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,
were materially in the Maſs
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49353:19"/>
of Blood, and are ſeparated from it by
the Breaſts, and Kidneys; I think
one may by experience ſhew she in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>validity
of their ratiocination againſt
Specificks. For 'tis obvious to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
and I have ſeveral times done it
my ſelf, that Rubarb will (perhaps
for many hours) tinge the Urine of
thoſe that take any conſiderable doſe
of it And in ſome of our <hi>Engliſh Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican</hi>
Colonies, there grows a fruit,
which the planters call the <hi>Prickled
Pear,</hi> whoſe inward Subſtance is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
red, and whoſe being plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
in taſt, as well as colour, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
invites eaters; but its Juice
is of ſo penetrating a nature, that it
paſſes from the ſtomach into the
Bladder, and then into the chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pot,
with ſo little loſs of its redneſs,
that ſtrangers are wont to be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pris'd
and frighted at it, as thinking
this unknown fruit had made them
void bloody Urine, if not blood ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than Urine. This is a known
thing among thoſe, that have dwelt
in our Southern Plantations, and has
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49353:19"/>
been affirm'd to me by unſuſpected
Eye-witneſſes, and among them by a
famous Phyſician. As for Milk, the
great <hi>Hippocrates</hi> himſelf informs us,
that if a Woman, or a ſhe-goat take
<hi>Elaterium,</hi> the Cathartick vertue
paſſes into the Milk, and will purge the
Child that drinks it. And I remember
that haying occaſion to make ſome
ſtay, in the Spring or beginning of
Summer, in the confines of <hi>Switzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and <hi>Savoy,</hi> I had the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to obſerve this odd <hi>Phaenomenon,</hi>
That when the Cows, in that Diſtrict,
fed, as they would in that ſeaſon plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully
do, upon a certain weed, ſaid
to be a kind of Wild-Garlick, that
grew copiouſly in the Paſtures, the
very Butter made of their Milk had
ſo rank a taſt of the Herb, that though
I was not, yet divers other ſtrangers
were, thereby diverted from eating
of it, though otherwiſe freſh and
good. And I remember too, that
having paſs'd a Winter on the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coaſt
of the County of <hi>Cork</hi> in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
I found it a known obſervation,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49353:20"/>
that a ſort of greedy Sea-fowl, whoſe
name comes not now into my mind,
living almoſt wholly upon Fiſh, (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whoſe ſcholes I have ſometimes
wondered to ſee ſuch a multitude of
ravenous Fowls attending) they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
a Taſt that makes ſome plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly
Queſtion, whether the food
they afford be to be reputed fleſh or
fiſh. But how conſtantly the Particles
of divers Bodies may retain their
nature in all the digeſtion, and ſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
they paſs through, I have more
amply diſcours'd in another Tract,
<hi>About the concealments and diſguiſes
of ſeminal Principles.</hi> And I preſume
I have here ſaid enough, to allow me
to proceed to the fourth part of my
anſwer.</p>
               <p>4. I conſider then, in the laſt place,
that whereas 'tis objected, that ſo
ſmall a quantity of the matter of a
Specifick, as is able to retain its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
when it arrives at the part it
ſhould work on, muſt have little or no
power left to relieve it. This diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
will not much ſtagger thoſe
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:49353:20"/>
that know, how unſafe it is to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
the power that natural Agents
may have, to work upon ſuch an
engine as the Humane Body, by their
bulk rather than by their ſubtilty and
and activity A ſober Gentleman, that
was Governour of a Colony in the
Torrid one, and commanded a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Veſſel, that ſail'd up very
far in the great River of <hi>Gambia</hi> or
<hi>Gambra</hi> in <hi>Africk,</hi> and ſtaid there
ſome time to trade with the <hi>Negro's</hi>
of the Inland Countrey, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of by me, among other things,
about the Poyſons that are ſaid to be
extraordinarily powerful in the Parts
he came from; he anſwered me, that
the Blacks had a Poyſon, that was,
though ſomewhat ſlow, yet very
mortal; in ſo ſmall a doſe, that it was
uſual for them to hide enough of it
to kill a man, under one of their
Nails, which they wear ſomewhat
long: Whence they would drop it ſo
dextrously into the Drink, or Milk,
or Broth or other Liquid Aliment of
thoſe they ow a ſpite to, that 'tis ſcarce
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49353:21"/>
poſſible for a ſtranger to be watchful
enough to prevent it. For which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
as he told me, though he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
eat with their petty Princes,
or Governours, at the ſame table, yet
he would never eat out of the ſame
diſh, nor drink out of the ſame Cups
with any of them. He added that, in
another part of <hi>Africa,</hi> a famous Knight,
who commanded the <hi>Engliſh</hi> there, and
lately died a ſhip-board in his way
home, was ſo poyſoned at a parting
Treat, by a young <hi>Negro</hi> Woman of
Quality, whom he had enjoy'd and
declin'd to take with him, according
to his promiſe, into <hi>Europe.</hi> And
though my Relator early gave him
notice of what he ſuſpected to be the
cauſe of this Indiſpoſition, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd
him thereupon to take Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes,
and Cordials, as Treacle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
yet his languiſhing diſtemper ſtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed,
till it kill'd him.</p>
               <p>I could name a Vegetable Subſtance,
growing in <hi>Europe,</hi> and perhaps not
far from hence, which though ſome
Empiricks employ as a Medicine, is
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49353:21"/>
ſo violently, operative, that a Learned
and famous Modern Phyſitian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,
that no more than half a grain
would work ſo violently, as to cauſe
very dangerous <hi>Hypercatharſes,</hi> of
which though he remedy'd ſome, yet
he was not able to keep all from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Mortal. And becauſe many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
men deny that out <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Vipers are poyſonous, I ſhall add in
favour of the Argument that I have
been enforcing that I know a Young
man, who having been bitten by an
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Viper, which he too raſhly
laid hold on, though the tooth prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
but his hand, yet the venom, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd
by ſo ſmall a hurt which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
equal'd not in quantity the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dredth
part of Pins head, quickly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
in him the bad Symptoms that
uſually follow the Biteing of that
Serpent,; And among others (for I
particularly ask'd him about that)
a violent vomiting of ill condition'd
ſtuff. I know alſo a perſon, that
practis'd Phyſick in the Iſle of <hi>Iava,</hi>
where Scorpions are held to be more
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49353:22"/>
venemous than in <hi>Italy</hi> who having,
after he had drank ſome what freely,
provok'd, and bin ſtung by, a Scorpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
thô the Hurt was but in his Thumb,
and was ſo ſmall that I could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the leaſt ſcar it had left, that it put
him preſently to ſuch violent tortures,
for ſome hours, till he had procur'd Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifick
remedies, that he look'd upon
himſelf a dead man; and felt ſo
raging a heat within that he thought
(to uſe his own Expreſſion) that hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire
was got into his Body. Nor is it
only by mere poyſons, that a Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Body may be greatly affected,
thô the agent be but very inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
for bulk and weight, for we ſee,
that divers Women, otherwiſe ſtrong
and healthy, will be caſt into ſounding
fits, and perhaps will complain of
ſuffocation, and be put into convulſive
Motions, by the fragrant Odours of
Musk, or Civet; though if all the
<hi>Effluvia,</hi> that cauſe theſe Symptomes,
were reduc'd into one aggregate, this
would not probably amount to a
hundredth, nor perhaps to a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandth,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:49353:22"/>
part of a grain. And I have
oftentimes ſpeedily ſuppreſs'd ſuch
fits, by the odour of the volatile Salts
Harts-horn, Sal Armoniac, or the like,
or of deſtill'd Spirits abounding with
ſuch Salts; though perhaps all the
Particles, that actually relieved the
patient, and calm'd theſe fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Symptoms, if pack'd together,
would not have equal'd, either in
bigneſs or in weight, the tenth, not
to ſay the fifteenth, or the hundredth,
part of a grain of muſtard-ſeed. And
as for inward remedies, 'tis vulgarly
known, that in the infuſion of <hi>Crocus
Metallorum,</hi> Corpuſcles that ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Liquor vehemently vomitive
and Purgative, are ſo very minute,
that great proportions of Wine, or
other Vehicles may<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be ſtrongly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated
with them without any
ſenſible diminution of the Body that
parts with them. And of this we
have a not leſs, if not more, conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
inſtance, when Quick-Silver is
decocted or long infus'd in common
Water. For <hi>Helmont</hi> obſerves that,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49353:23"/>
though the Liquor be not altered in
Colour, or Taſt, nor the Quick-ſilver
at all ſenſibly chang'd, nay nor grown
any thing lighter in a ballance, yet
the Liquor does, by means of theſe
inſenſible and unponderable Effluxes
of the Quickſilver, acquire a notable
virtue againſt worms; for which
purpose not only <hi>Helmont,</hi> but before
him that experienc'd Chymiſt <hi>Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
and another eminent Writer,
extoll this Medicine. And on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
I remember that a fine Boy,
born to be heir to a very illuſtrious
family, falling into a dangerous Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
which was judg'd to proceed
from worms or verminous matter;
a famous and Experienc'd Phyſitian,
that treated him, confeſs'd to me,
that he was out of hopes of him; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Child, having been bred
to have his will, and tir'd with unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful
Remedies, was ſo obſtinate and
carefull in refuſing to take any thing,
that ſmeld or reliſh'd of a Medicine,
that he forbore, in ſpite of all the art
uſ'd to deceive him, even to drink
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49353:23"/>
any thing but ſmall Beer Whereupon
I perſwaded both the Doctor, and
the Lord, whoſe ſon the child was, to
impregnate his ſmall beer with Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curial
particles, by frequently ſhak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it with good Quick-ſilver in it.
By which means the patient, perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no change of Colour or Taſt in
the Drink, ſwallow'd it greedily, and
through the bleſſing of God was ſoon
after reſtor'd to a Health, which the
Parties concern'd aſcrib'd to the
Mercurial remedy.</p>
               <p>I ſhould condemn my ſelf, for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
beſtowed ſo many words upon
one objection, but that I hope the
Anſwer, given to it in this place, will
facilitate and ſhortens ſeveral things
relating to my preſent Subject <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifick
Medicines.</hi> About which I ſhall
now proceed to offer my thougths in
ſome Propoſitions, and ſhort diſcourſes
upon them.</p>
               <p>Having now diſpatch'd the firſt
of the two formerly propos'd Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
I proceed to the ſecond, name<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly,
whether the Mechanical <hi>Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:49353:24"/>
can be accommodated to Specifick
Medicines, ſo as that they may be
either intelligibly explicated by a, or
at leaſt ſhown to be reconcilable to it.
I preſume you will eaſily believe,
that there are few writers more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable,
than I'am, to confeſs the
dimneſs of our knowledge, and the
obſcurity of many things in nature;
or that are more forward than I to
grant, that many of the operations,
of Specifick Medicines, are to be reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
among thoſe abſtruſe things,
whereof nature ſeems to affect the
concealment. But notwithſtanding
this, when I conſider how compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive
and fertile the principles of
the Corpuſcular Philoſophy are, I
cannot deſpair bur that it will be
found, that divers of the effects of
theſe Medicines may be, in a general
way explicated by them, and not any
will appear inconſiſtent with them.
This I deſire may be here taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of once for all that, retaining the
Scope of the following diſcourſe ſtill
in your memory, you may not think
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:49353:24"/>
it ſtrange, that I content my ſelf, on
moſt occaſions, to give in general
poſſible explications, and to ſhew that
Specifick Medicines may operate on
ſome ſuch account as I propoſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
affirming that they certainly do
ſo I obſerv'd ſoon after the beginning
of this Paper that there were three
ſorts of virtues to which Phyſicians
(thô not unanimouſly) have given
this Title of <hi>Specifick;</hi> namely <hi>ſuch</hi>
as evacuate ſome particular humour,
ſuch as are peculiarly friendly to this or
that part of the Humane Body, and <hi>ſuch</hi>
as in an unknown way cure or much
leſſen this or that determinate Diſeaſe.
But yet I ſhall now apply my diſcourſe
peculiarly to the laſt ſort of theſe Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines,
as being both more conſiderable
in it ſelf and the chief ſubject intended
in preſent Diſcourſe, giving neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
as occaſion ſerves, ſuch additio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Hints and obſervations, as may
make the Reflections, belonging to
this Third ſort of Specificks, eaſily
applicable <hi>Mutatis Mutandis</hi> to the
other two.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:49353:25"/>
And I ſhall begin with laying here
for a foundation what I have in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Treatiſe had occaſion to deliver
and make out, namely, That a living
Humane Body is not to be look'd
upon as a mere ſtatue, or a mere
<hi>Congeries</hi> of the Materials 'tis com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
of, Fleſh, Blood, Bones, Fat,
Nerves, Veins, Arteries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably
fram'd Engine, conſiſting of
Stable, Liquid, and Pneumatick Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
ſo exquiſitely adapted to
their reſpective functions and Uſes,
that oftentimes the effects of an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
upon it are not to be meaſured
ſo much by the power of that agent
conſidered in it ſelf, as by the effects
that are conſequently produc'd by
the action of the parts of the Living
Engine it ſelf upon one another.</p>
               <p>This premis'd, I conſider<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that there
is no need to grant that the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of all Specificks, or of the ſame
in differing Diſeaſes, muſt be of one
kind; but that differing Specificks
may operate in ſeveral manners, and
ſome by one of theſe ways may op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugn
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:49353:25"/>
ſuch a diſeaſe, and others may
do good againſt ſuch another. And of
theſe general ways I ſhall briefly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
ſix or ſeven that now occur to
my thoughts. For having firſt given
you this important caution, that the
Specifick Remedy do's not commonly
(though ſometimes it may) relieve the
patient by this or that ſingle way of
operating, but by a concurrence of two
or more, that as it were joyn their
forces to produce the deſired effect.</p>
               <div n="1" type="proposition">
                  <head>PROPOSITION. I.</head>
                  <p>And firſt, ſometimes the Specifick
Medicine may cure by diſcuſſing, or
reſolving the morbifick matter, and
thereby making it fit for expulſion by
the greater common ſhores of the Body,
and the Pores of the skin.</p>
                  <p>'Tis known that many Diſeaſes,
and thoſe oftentimes ſtubborn and
Chronical, proceed from certain tough
or viſcous Humours, that obſtruct
the paſſages wereby the blood ſhould
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:49353:26"/>
circulate, or other uſefull Liquors be
tranſmitted. And theſe peccant Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
are oftentimes ſo viſcid and
obſtinate, that ordinary Remedies
will do little or no good upon them.
And yet a Specifick may, by the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and congruous Figure of ſome of
its Corpuſcles, get through the Pores
into the Receſſes of this ſtubborn mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
and by their <hi>ſolidity, Figure,</hi> and
<hi>Agitation,</hi> promoted by the heat of the
patients Body, may diſſolve and ruine
the texture of the Morbifick matter,
and render it capable of being proſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
by nature, by Urine, Sweat, or ſome
other commodious and innocent Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation.
Thus the blood, or ſome other
Liquor of the Body, being (to uſe the
Chymiſts Phraſe) impregnated with
the friendly and operative Particles of
the Remedy, becomes an appropriated
<hi>Menſtruum</hi> in referrence to the Pecant
matter: impregnated with Sal Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niack
becomes a <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> that by
degrees will diſſolve both Copper and
Iron, as compact bodies as they are.
I ſaid <hi>appropriated Menſtruum,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:49353:26"/>
there is no ſufficient reaſon to
ſuppoſe, that the <hi>Menſtruum</hi> works
by any manifeſt quality, as Heat
Moiſture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or even by Acidity
it ſelf: But rather by virtue of the
fitneſs, which the ſhape, bulk, ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilty,
and other Mechanical affections
of its particles, concur to give it, to
disjoyn the parts of a body of ſuch a
determinate Texture. For as I have
in another Paper amply ſhewn, there
are far more <hi>Menſtruums</hi> of diſtinct
ſorts than are commonly taken notice
of, and the operations of theſe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſafely be meaſured by the ſtrength
of their manifeſt qualities, ſince it
may ſeveral times happen, that a
<hi>Menſtruum,</hi> leſs acid or leſs ſtrongly
taſted, may diſſolve this or that bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
which another <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> that
ſeems far ſtronger, will not work on.
Thus cold water will diſſolve the
white of an Egg, which pure ſpirit of
wine will be ſo far from diſſolving,
that it will coagulate it; [and ſo
will ſpirit of Salt and Oyl of Vitriol it
ſelf.] Thus dephlegm'd ſpirit of Urine
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:49353:27"/>
will readily diſſolve minute filings of
Copper, which ſpirit of Vinegar will
but ſlowly work upon; and yet this
Liquor will ſpeedily diſſolve Crabs
Eyes, which ſpirit of Urine will leave
entire. Thus Quickſilver, that is
inſipid, will in the cold diſſolve Gold,
which <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> it ſelf, though aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
by exeternal heat will not work
upon; and yet <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> will fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
bear aſunder the parts of
Iron, though Quickſilver will not ſo
much as adhere to its ſurface. And
thus in fine (not to accumulate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances)
common Oyl, that is ſo
ſmooth upon the Tongue, and
will not diſſolve ſo much as an
Egg-ſhell, will diſſolve Brimſtone,
which yet will reſiſt <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> it
ſelf, that will diſſolve almoſt all Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,
beſide many hard Stones and
Minerals. And I know a liquor,
having more than once prepar'd it,
which, though ſo weak that one may
drink a Wine Glaſs full of it pure
without danger, will yet work on
ſome very hard bodies, both Stones &amp;
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:49353:27"/>
Metals, in a way that is not to be
matched, among the highly corroſive
<hi>Menſtruums</hi> in uſe among Chymiſts.</p>
                  <p>And now, ſuppoſing that the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Corpuſcles, of a ſpecifick Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cineaſſociated
with the blood, or other
Vehicle they impregnate, may
act upon the morbifick matters they
meet with in the body, after the
manner of <hi>Menſtruum;</hi> ſuppoſing
this I ſay, we may hence illuſtrate
ſeveral things that have reference to
the operation of ſpecifick Medicines.</p>
                  <p>1. And we may hence derive a
Gueſs, why an appropriated Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine
will perform things, which will
not be done by another, whoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
qualities ſeem to be the ſame for
kind, and much ſtronger in degree.
For <hi>Menſtruums</hi> do not always act
according to the degree of their Aci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity,
or the like ſenſible quality,
but according to the congruity of their
Corpuſcles to the pores of the body
they are to diſſolve; and alſo often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
according to a fitneſs that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
upon other Mechanical Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:49353:28"/>
of the acting Liquor. And
therefore Phyſicians, as well as others,
may eaſily miſtake in their Argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
<hi>à majori ad minus, &amp; à mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nori
ad majus.</hi> For the conſequence
is not good to argue either thus,
Water, which is ſo ſtrengthleſs Liquor,
will diſſolve Gum Arabic, therefore
highly rectified ſpirit of Wine, which
is a much more ſubtil and penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teing
Liquor, will doe the ſame thing
more powerfully; for Experience
ſhews, it will not diſſolve it at all:
or thus, ſtrong Oyl of Vitriol is more
corroſive in taſte, and will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
many bodies that <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi>
will not, therefore it will alſo diſſolve
Silver as well as <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> the
contrary of which is true. Nay 'tis
not a good inference to argue thus,
<hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> is diſſolves Silver by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of its acid Spirits, therefore the
more it abounds with theſe, the more
potently it will diſſolve that Metal,
whereas I have elſewhere prov'd by
Experience, that if <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> be
made exceeding ſtrong, it will not
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:49353:28"/>
work upon Silver, but it will readily
do it if it be weakned by the additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a fit quantity of Common Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                  <p>To this I ſhall add, that the diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of a Body may depend, as well
upon the peculiar texture of the
body it ſelf, as the manifeſt ſtrength
of the <hi>Menſtruum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2ly. The foregoing Doctrine may
ſuggeſt a Reaſon, why a Medicine
that does wonders in one diſeaſe, may
do little or nothing in another, that
ſome may think to be a kin to it, and
perhaps too, more eaſily ſuperable by
it. For the preſum'd cognation may
not be ſo great, but that ſome diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude
of texture in the morbifick
matters, may make one of them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
to be wrought upon by the ſame
<hi>Menſtruum</hi> that diſſoloves the other.
And though pure Spirit of Wine will
eaſily enough diſſolve <hi>Gummi Guaja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,</hi>
and alſo the little portion of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinous
matter that are harbour'd in
the Pores and ſmall cavities of the
Wood; yet the ſame <hi>Menſtruum</hi> will
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:49353:29"/>
not work upon the Wood it ſelf of the
Tree that affords thoſe ſoluble Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
                  <p>3. This may keep it from being
thought ſtrange, that Specifick Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines
ſhould ſometimes fail of their
uſual Effects. For, <hi>as</hi> the Bodies of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual
Patients, may differ very
much, either according to their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Conſtitution, or to that which they
acquire by the diſeaſe that diſtempers
them, or on both thoſe accounts; <hi>So</hi>
it ought not to ſeem ſtrange, that in
ſome ſick Perſons among many, the
congruity between the agent ct pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
ſhould be alter'd, either by ſome
conſiderable change in the Texture
of the Morbifick matter, or by ſome
notable alteration that the Corpuſcles
of the Medicine receive in their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
through the Veſſels, by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture
of ſome incongruous Particles
of the Blood or other Vehicle. Thus
Spirit of Salt will, as I have try'd,
diſſolve Copper, as Spirit of Niter
does: which notwithſtanding, thô this
laſt nam'd Liquor will diſſolve Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:49353:29"/>
yet if you mix with it Spirit of
Salt, which by the like operation of
both upon Copper, ſeems to be ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
to it, the Spirit of Niter will no
more be able to diſſolve Silver, as it
could before.</p>
                  <p>4thly. Our <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> may alſo
hint to us an anſwer to one of the main
and moſt plauſible objections of the
deniers of Specifick Medicines. For
ſome of them ask in a Scornful way,
how 'tis poſſible that a Medicine
ſhould rove up and down in the Maſs
of Blood, and neglecting all other
things, ſhould ſingle out, and faſten
upon the Morbifick matter men wiſh
it ſhould proſcribe. For if the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine
acts by impregnating the Blood,
or ſome other Liquor of the Body,
and turning it into a kind of <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruum,</hi>
'tis very poſſible, both that
the ſtrainers through which the
Corpuſcles muſt paſs, may keep back
the inconvenient parts of the vehicle,
and (which is in our caſe more conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable)
the <hi>Menſtruum</hi> may be either
appropriated to the peccant Humour,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:49353:30"/>
as has been formerly declar'd, or elſe
may at leaſt be qualify'd, to reſolve
that more eaſily than any other Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
it meets with in the Body. As
if you take ſome Bone-aſhes, and
<hi>Crocus Martis,</hi> and Saw-duſt, and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
Sea-Salt, and Filings of Gold,
and blend all theſe together, if upon
one half of this mixture you pour
common Water, it will not meddle
with any other of the Ingredients ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the Sea-Salt, which it will rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
diſſolve: &amp; if upon the other half
of the ſame mixture, you put a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
quantity of Quick-ſilver, and rub
them together, this Metalline Liquor
will neglect all the reſt of the Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,
and the Sea Salt it ſelf, and faſten
upon the Gold. And thoſe that work
in the Spaniſh Gold mines inform us,
that when they have well ground
ſome Ore, that contains Gold and
Copper, beſides Heterogeneous Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals,
well heated Quick-ſilver will
take up the Gold much ſooner and
better than it will the Copper, ſcarce
meddling with the latter, as long
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:49353:30"/>
as there remains any not deſpicable
quantity of the former, to be wrought
upon by it. And as for the ſuppoſed
difficulty, that the Medicine ſhould
Ferret out, if I may ſo ſpeak, the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bifick
matter, in what veſſel ſoever
of the Body it lies, this objection
might have been conſiderable, before
the diſcovery of the Bloods circulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
But 'tis not ſo now that we know,
that things that once get into the
Maſs of Blood, are preſently whirl'd
about with it, and may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd
by it even to ſmall veſſels
lying in the remoteſt Parts of the
Body.</p>
                  <p>5thly. And this prompts me to
take notice, that our <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> may
help us to anſwer thoſe many learned
Phyſicians, that either reject, or at
leaſt deſpiſe, moſt External remedies,
eſpecially <hi>Pericarpia, Amulets,</hi> and
<hi>Appenſa,</hi> upon a ſuppoſition, both
that they neither can furniſh the Body
they do but externally touch, with
any ſtore of Medicinal Particles; and
which is chiefly in this place to be
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:49353:31"/>
conſider'd, that being but external re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies,
they muſt be very unable to
do good in Internal diſeaſes, eſpecially
ſuch as are ſeated in Parts, remote
from thoſe which the Medicine is
apply'd to. But as to the former part
of the objection, 'twill not be difficult
to anſwer it to him that has read
what I have elſewhere written of the
ſubtility, numerouſneſs and efficacy
of <hi>Effluviums.</hi> And we need but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
what plenty of Particles ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the noſtrils, are for a long time
emitted by a ſmall quantity of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-greece,
or even of Camphire (which
is often externally us'd) and the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of Magnetical Corpuſcles, that
for many years conſtantly effluviate
from a ſmall vigorous Load-ſtone, to
think it poſſible that even dry and
ſtable Bodies may afford ſufficient
ſtore of <hi>effluvia,</hi> to perform conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
things in ſo curiouſly fram'd an
Engine, as the Humane Body is; where
we ſee that the odour of Musk, or
Civet, for inſtance, may ſpeedily caſt
divers Perſons into Fits, and the ſmell
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:49353:31"/>
of Caſtor or <hi>Aſſa faetida,</hi> and much
more that of Salt of Harts-horn
or of Sal Armoniack, quickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
them. And as to the Second
Part of the objection, what I have
elſewhere made out, and
the beſt Modern Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
grant,<note place="margin">The Eſſay of the Poroſity of Animal Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</note> of the Poroſity
of the Skin, ſhows, that
'tis very poſſible for the
ſubtil <hi>Effluvia</hi> of ſeveral Bodies, to
get through the Pores of the Skin;
and when they have once got admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
ſo much as into the ſmaller
Veſſels, 'tis eaſie to conceive how
theſe may carry them into the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and conſequently into the Maſs
of Blood, by whoſe Circulation they
may be readily conveyed to all the
Parts of the Body, and among them to
the ſeat of the diſeaſe: &amp; perhaps, (to
add that upon the by,) the efficacy of
theſe Corpuſcles, that, if I may ſo ſpeak,
get in at the Key-hole, not at the Door,
may be the more considerable, becauſe
they get preſently into the Maſs of
Blood, without paſſing thrô thoſe
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:49353:32"/>
Digeſtions in the ſtomach and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Parts, which oftentimes much
weaken the vertue of Medicines ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

at the Blood.</p>
               </div>

                  <p>Sometimes a Specifick Medicine may
mortify the over Acid, or other immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Particles that infeſt the Maſs
of Blood, and deſtroy their coagulatory or
other effects.</p>
                  <p>Thô I am not of their opinion, who
of late are wont to impute almoſt all
Diſeaſes to acidity, abounding in the
Blood and other Liquors of the Body,
by whoſe intervention the ſtable parts
alſo are offended; yet I readily grant
that a conſiderable number of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers
are, at leaſt in great part,
produc'd either by Acids themſelves,
or by their bad effects or Producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Agreeably to which Doctrine we
may very probably conceive, that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Maladies may be either quite
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:49353:32"/>
cur'd, or much leſſen'd, by a Specifick
Remedy that abounds in Corpuſcles
fitted to mortify Acids. This mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
may be effected by more
than one way, and of theſe wayes the
chief that now occur to my thoughts,
are two.</p>
                  <p>For there are ſome Bodies, that mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify
or diſable Acids by a <hi>poſitive
Hoſtility,</hi> if I may ſo term it; that is,
by ſuch a contrariety as is diſcernable
by the Taſt, and more by the viſible
conflict, and manifeſt Tumult, that is
produc'd, when they come to invade
an Acid. Of this ſort of mortifiers
of Acids, are the moſt part of thoſe
that are call'd <hi>Alcaliſate Salts.</hi> Whether
<hi>fixt,</hi> as the Lixivial Salts of Plants,
or <hi>volatile,</hi> as the Spirits and aſcending
Salts of Urine, Blood, Harts-horn,
Soot, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As may be exemplify'd,
when any of theſe comes to be min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
with <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> Spirit of Salt,
Oyl of Vitriol, or the like Acid Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors,
by which by the way we may
ſee, that thoſe Galeniſts miſtake, who
aſcribe the vertues of Spirit of Harts-horn,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:49353:33"/>
and of Urine, only to their te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity
of Parts, Briskneſs of Motion, and
the like affections, that they might
not ſeem beholding to the Chymiſts
for ſo uſeful a notion, as that of
the contrariety of Acids and Alca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.</p>
                  <p>The other principal way, by which
Acids may be mortifi'd, or diſabled
to bite, is by <hi>Sheathing</hi> them, if I
may ſo expreſs it. For <hi>as</hi> a knife may
be diſabled to cut, either by filing
off or otherwiſe blunting its Edge,
or elſe by covering the Blade with
a ſheath fit for it, or by ſticking it into
a Loaf of Bread, or the like Body fit
to receive and detain the whole Blade;
ſo an Acid Corpuſcle may loſe its
power of cutting or pricking, either
by having its Figure ſpoil'd by the
action of a ſtrong and manifeſt Alcaly,
or elſe by being as it were ſheath'd
in a Porous Body, thô perhaps en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow'd
with no Taſt, or any other
manifeſt Quality, by which one would
think it contrary to the Acid it diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
as a file is to the edge of a knife.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:49353:33"/>
Of this way of mortifying Acids,
Chymical operations afford us many
inſtances, as when <hi>Menium</hi> deſtroyes
the Acidity of Spirit of Vinegar, as
I have found Chalk will do that of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua
Fortis</hi> it ſelf; and <hi>Lapis Calamina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi>
very much leſſens, as well as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
the Acidity of Spirit of Salt,
and even of Spirit of Niter. And I
the rather mention this Mineral,
both becauſe its Qualities are leſs
known to Phyſicians, and the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of Chymiſts, and becauſe it
ſupplies me with an Argument to
prove that Acids may be, thô I do
not think they alwayes <hi>are,</hi> rather
ſheath'd in, than deſtroy'd by the
Bodies that ſilently mortify them.
For, as <hi>Glauber</hi> has truly enough ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
Acid Spirits (as I have try'd
in ſome) may by force of fire be
driven in Diſtillation out of the
<hi>Lapis Calaminaris,</hi> very much
dephlegm'd, and ſtronger than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                  <p>I know it may be here objected,
that the Mortification of Acids is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:49353:34"/>
by a manifeſt Quality, and
therefore makes nothing for the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourers
of Specifick Medicines. But
to this I anſwer.</p>
                  <p>1. That the power of mortifying
Acids, eſpecially by ſheathing them,
or if you pleaſe, by Abſorption of
them, is none of thoſe Qualities,
whether Firſt, Second or Third, that
the former Phyſicians took no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of in Medicines; thô the ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
of theſe Qualities to cure diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
has been, and ſtill is, us'd by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
as a ground of denying the Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick
vertues of remedies.</p>
                  <p>2. That I have often look'd upon
it as an happy miſtake, and of ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence,
that ſo many learned mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Phyſicians take it for granted,
that if a Medicine be endow'd with a
manifeſt Quality, as Acid or Alcali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſate,
the <hi>good</hi> it does, (and the like
for the moſt part may be ſaid of the
<hi>Harm</hi>) may ſafely be abſcrib'd to that
Quality, that is to its being of an
Acid, or elſe of an Alcaliſate nature;
whereas in my poor Judgment, there
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:49353:34"/>
being a conſiderable diſparity, as va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Tryals have aſſur'd me, between
Acid and Acid, as likewiſe between
Alcaly aud Alcaly, 'tis fit to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
betwixt an Acid for inſtance, as
meerly ſuch, and the peculiar modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
that may belong to that Acid.
Thus, thô all Acid <hi>Menſtruums</hi> that I
know of, if they be well dephlegm'd,
will diſſolve Copper, yet <hi>Aqua Regis</hi>
that will diſſolve not only that Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
but the much more cloſely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted
body of Gold, will not at all
diſſolve Silver; as on the other ſide
<hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> as corroſive a <hi>Menſtruum</hi>
as it is, will not of it ſelf diſſolve Gold,
but if you give it a new Modification,
by adding to it common Spirit of Salt,
which it ſelf I have often found
(whatever Chymiſts think or have
written to the contrary) will leave
it entire, the <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> will eaſily
diſſolve that Metal. Nay a different
Modification may not only make a
<hi>Diſparity</hi> between Acid, but that which
according to the receiv'd way of
Judging, ought to be call'd a <hi>contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety:</hi>
                     <pb n="54" facs="tcp:49353:35"/>
for Spirit of Salt will precipitate
Silver, which <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> has diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd,
and Spirit of Niter, thô one of
the Acideſt <hi>Menſtruums</hi> we have, will
not only precipitate an Antimonical
powder out of that odd ſubſtance, that
Chymiſts call <hi>Butter of Antimony,</hi>
but will do it with a wonderful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict,
tumult, and efferveſence; and
yet this Butter of Antimony is ſo
highly Acid, that a little quantity
of it, put into a conſiderable one of
Water, makes it ſo ſour, that many
Chymiſts call it <hi>Acetum Philoſopho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</hi>
And now to apply theſe things
to the lately propos'd objection, I
deſire it may be remembred, that
near the beginning of this Letter I
plainly intimated to you, that I did
not deny, but that a Specifick Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine
may ſometimes be accompany'd
with, or even in part operate by a
manifeſt quality, but that yet I thought
the good effect was not due, barely
to the kind or degree of the manifeſt
Quality, but to ſomewhat ſuperadded
which gave it a Specifick vertue,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:49353:35"/>
againſt this or that particular Diſeaſe.
And ſuitably to this it may be ſaid,
that, as there are ſeveral kinds of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cids,
and of Alcalies too, 'tis not every
Acid that will be mortifi'd by every
Alcaly; and have its Effects deſtroy'd
by it, which may be illuſtrated by this,
that, <hi>thô</hi> when Copper is diſſolved in
<hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> 'tis poſſible, by the help
of meer Chalk skilfully apply'd to
make the <hi>Menſtruum</hi> let go the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles
of the Metal, <hi>yet</hi> if upon ſuch
a high colour'd ſolution of Copper,
you ſhall pour (as to convince ſome
ingenious men, I have purpoſely done
a due quantity of Spirit of Urine, or
the like volatile Alcaly, thô there
will preſently enſue a great conflict
and manifeſt ebullition, with noiſe
and ſtore of Bubbles, yet between
theſe Hoſtile Salts, a multitude of the
Acid Corpuſcles of the <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi>
will not be ſo mortified, as to let go the
Metal, but the ſolution varying its co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
will have and keep a deeper one
than before.</p>
                  <p>And when I conſider the differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:49353:36"/>
that a Skilful Obſerver may find,
between Vinegar, Alum, Cryſtals of
Tartar, Juice of Lemmons, Juice of
Barbaries, the eſſential Salts (as Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts
call them) of thoſe Plants that
are ſour in Taſt, to omit divers other
Acids, I am apt to think, that diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
nature may have, in a diſeaſed
Body, produc'd Acids of ſeveral ſorts
which are not particularly known to
us, and that ſome of theſe may be of
ſuch a nature, that none of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Alcalies, as ſuch, is able to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify
them, and which yet may be
mortify'd, at leaſt by the way of
Sheathing, by ſome appropriated or
peculiarly modify'd Corpuſcles of a
Specifick Remedy which may be il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrated
by what is elſewhere ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd,
that, thô neither Spirit of
Vinegar, nor Spirit of Salt, nor Oyl
of Vitriol it ſelf, would, as far as I
have try'd, diſſolve a ſtone taken
out of a mans Body, yet Spirit
of Niter, (which does not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
ſeveral Podies, that I have
found diſſoluble in Oyl of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol)
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:49353:36"/>
will readily work upon it,
and thereby loſe, its Corroſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p>Before I leave this Subject, 'twill
not be amiſs to intimare a couple of
things, that perhaps you will not think
impertinent to it.</p>
                  <p>One of theſe is, that, whereas I
not long ago diſtinctly nam'd Acids
themſelves and their Productions, I
did it (not out of Inadvertence, but)
becauſe I think Preternatural Acids do
not only diſaffect the Body whileſt
they continue ſenſibly Acid, but may
in divers caſes be the cauſes of ſome
Diſtempers, whereof moſt men would
think them more likely to be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies.
For, <hi>thô</hi> Acids be reputed to
have an Inciſive and Reſolutive ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
and therefore <hi>Oxymel</hi> and ſome
other Acetous Medicines are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
to cut tough Phlegm, and
Spirit of Vitriol is us'd for the ſame
purpoſe, and to diſſolve coagulated
Blood; <hi>Yet,</hi> as I am willing to grant
this vertue unto Acids in ſome caſes,
ſo there are others wherein I much
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:49353:37"/>
ſuſpect, that obſtructions, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
the diſeaſes that uſually
attend obſtinate ones, may be occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd
by Acids, as they coagulate
ſome Fluids in the Maſs of Blood,
that are diſpos'd to be thicken'd by
them, and by that conſiſtence made
unfit to paſs with the reſt of the
circulating Blood, through the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
Veſſels and ſtrainers of the Body,
where upon that account they make
obſtructions. This I ſhall exemplify
by the coagulation that I have made
by ſome Acid Salts, as Spirit of Salt,
of the White of an Egg, eſpecially if
by beating reduc'd to an Aqueous
Conſiſtence. And the like coagula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
may eaſily be effected in Milk,
which may not only be ſpeedily
curdl'd with Spirit of Salt, but, as
is known by Bodies not Chymically
prepar'd, as Rennet and Juice of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.
And Experiments purpoſely
made have ſhown, that, if ſome
Acids be convey'd immediately into
the Maſs of Blood, they will coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
even that Liquor, whilſt it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:49353:37"/>
in the Veſſels of the yet living
Animals.</p>
                  <p>The other thing I lately told you,
I was to obſerve, is, that, <hi>thô</hi> Acid
Corpuſcles are thoſe, that modern
Phyſicians and Chymiſts are wont
to take notice of as hurtful, both in the
Blood and ſtable Parts of the Body,
except the Stomach, and perhaps
ſome few neighbouring Parts, as the
Spleen and <hi>Pancres.</hi> And, <hi>thô</hi> ſome
ingenious men proceed ſo far, as to
impute almoſt all Diſeaſes to the bad
Effects of <hi>Acids,</hi> yet I am very incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
to think, that divers maladies
and ttoubleſom Symptoms proceed
from Corpuſcles, that, whether they
be of a Saline nature or not, are diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
from Acids properly ſo call'd. For
I conſider, that there may be many Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
which may as 'twere reſult from
the combination of Acids with other
Saline Particles, that much alter their
nature, as I have elſewhere noted, that
Spirit of Salt will, with Spirit of
Urine, compoſe a kind of Sal-Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niac;
and Spirit of Niter with Salt of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:49353:38"/>
Tartar diſſolv'd in common Water,
will concoagulate with it into Salt
<hi>Petre</hi> (or a Body exceeding like it,)
and the ſame Spirit of Niter or <hi>Aqua
Fortis</hi> with Spirit of Urine, or of Blood,
or the like, will afford a very fuſible
Salt, differing enough from what
either of the Ingredients was before
their conjunction. And 'tis vulgarly
known, that Oyl of Vitriol, and Oyl
of Tartar <hi>per deliquium,</hi> do by their
coalition produce <hi>Tartarum Vitriola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi>
in which the Acidity of the
former, and the Alcaliſateneſs of the
latter, are very much infring'd, a
third Body being by reſultancy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd,
that differs much both from
the former and the latter <hi>Oyl,</hi> or rather
<hi>Saline Liquor.</hi> And when, beſides
Inſtances of this nature, I conſider
how many differing ſorts of Corpuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
ſo fruitful a Principle as <hi>nature</hi>
may have form'd, that, without being
Acid, may yet have notable and
hurtful Effects upon the Blood, or
ſome particular ſolid part of the Body.
It ſeems probable to me, that there
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:49353:38"/>
may be other Qualities requir'd, to
mortify or diſable theſe Morbifick
Corpuſcles, than a contrariety to
Acid Salts, and conſequently, that a
Medicine that affords Corpuſcles
peculiarly fitted to correct or ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
this particular ſort of hurtful
ones, may deſerve the name of a <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And here I further conſider, that,
as in the Body there may be divers
coagulations made by Saline Corpuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
manifeſtly Acid; ſo there may
be others produc'd by Corpuſcles,
Whether Saline in taſt or no, that are
not manifeſtly Acid, but perhaps
rather of a contrary nature, which
obſervation, being wont to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look'd
by Phyſicians, and yet in my
opinion of no ſmall importance, may
deſerve to be a little the more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
made out. I have ſometimes
for curioſity made a Liquor, that
was not in Taſt either Acid or Uri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous;
to which having put a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
proportion of a diſtill'd Liquor,
which it ſelf was not in taſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:49353:39"/>
Acid, or Urinous, or lixiviate,
it would in a very ſhort time, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
in not many minutes, be coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated
into ſo conſiſtent a Body,
that, thô the wide mouth'd Veſſel
were held with the Orifice down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
nothing would fall out of it.</p>
                  <p>I have taught in another (unpub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd
Paper, that if upon a certain
ſolution (which I there ſhow how to
make) one drop ſome Spirit of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,
or anorhet Volatile Alcaly, there
will preſently be produc'd a Gelly,
whoſe conſiſtence and colour may
make it eaſily be taken for common
Starch, ready to be imploy'd to ſtiffen
Linnen.</p>
                  <p>The like Gelly, but more tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſparent,
I have more than once
made, without the help of any
thing, that is ſenſibly Acid or Uri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous.</p>
                  <p>I have alſo, to convince ſome
<hi>virtuoſi,</hi> ſhowed them ſomewhat to
their ſurpriſe, a ſubſtance I had
prepar'd without the help of Urine,
or any volatile Alcaly, (and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:49353:39"/>
almoſt in a trice) that would
in very few minutes coagulate
above twice, if not thrice its
weight of highly rectify'd and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamable
vinous Spirit into a ſtable
Maſs.</p>
                  <p>And to ſhew you, that 'tis not
requiſite that a Liquor be ſtrongly,
or ſo much as ſenſibly Acid, to
coagulate an Animal Subſtance, as I
lately noted, that the Spirit of Salt
did the White of an egg, I ſhall add,
that well dephlegm'd Spirit of Wine
will do the ſame thing as well, if not
better.</p>

                  <p>Sometimes the Specifick Medicine
may help the Patient, by precipitating
the Peccant matter out of the Blood, or
other Liquor (of the Body) that har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
it.</p>
                  <p>Thô Precipitation be oftentimes
a conſequent of the Mortification of
Acids, or of Alcalies, by Corpuſcles
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:49353:40"/>
of a contrary Quality, yet I thought
fit to ſay ſomething of it apart:
Becauſe I have obſerved that ſome
Acids and Alcalies may be put together
without cauſing Precipitation by their
contrariety; and on the other ſide,
that divers Precipitations may be
produc'd where there do's not appear
any Hoſtility, though I know divers
ingenious men, who think this Effect
it ſelf a ſufficient Argument, that the
hoſtility of Acids and Alcalies muſt
be the cauſe of it. But that ſhould
not be taken for granted, but prov'd
by collateral Experiments, that do
not ſuppoſe the Truth of the <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis</hi>
it ſelf. But to proceed to our
Exampls, I know (and elſewhere
mention) ſeveral Urinous Spirits,
that I could mix with Acid <hi>Menſtruum</hi>
without making any manifeſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict,
or Precipitation; And on the
otherſide, Acids and Alcalies, that
will make a manifeſt Conflict by
their mutual creation, and yet if they
be mingled in a juſt proportion, will
have for the conſequent of their
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:49353:40"/>
Mixture, Coalition inſtead of Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitation;
as may be exemplified in
certain Mixtures of Spirit of Sal-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniac
(made with Salt of Tartar,
or Pot-Aſhes) and Spirit of Nitre or
<hi>Aqua Fortis;</hi> and alſo when Spirit of
Urine and Spirit of Salt, being min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
in a certain proportion, convene
into Corpuſcles for the making of
Sal-Armoniac, which the Phlegm of
thoſe Liquors will keep ſwimming.
But that which makes moſt for my
preſent purpoſe, is, that there may
be Precipitations, where, whatever
may be ſuppos'd, it does not appear
that there is any Tumult or Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety,
as when Silver being diſſolved
in <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> and the <hi>Menſtruum</hi>
diluted with 30 or 40 parts of diſtill'd
Water, or of Rain Water, if clean
Plates of Copper be immerſ'd in the
Solution, the Metal will be very
ſlowly Precipitated out of it, in the
form not of a <hi>Calx,</hi> conſiſting of
Metalline, and Saline Parts incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
together, but, at leaſt at the
beginning in the form of pure ſhine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:49353:41"/>
Scales of Silver, almoſt like the
white and glittering Scales of ſome
ſmal Fiſhes. There is alſo a way, by
which I have brought diſſolv'd Gold
to ſettle about a Body, ſuſpended in
the Solution, in the form of a fine and
high-colour'd <hi>Calx</hi> of pure Gold. But
you may eaſily ſee an Inſtance of ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Precipitation, if you do but rub
a little either <hi>Roman</hi> or <hi>Dantzick</hi>
Vitriol, upon the well whetted blade
of a knife wetted with Water or Spit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
for you will have the Steel, almoſt
in a trice, overlaid with a reddiſh ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
which by its colour and other
ſigns appears manifeſtly to be Cupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
And here I ſhall advertiſe you,
that 'tis not only, as is wont to be
ſuppos'd, out of Solutions made with
Acids, that bodies may be thus Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitated,
for upon ſearch I have found
that there are in nature Precipitants,
that are capable of ſilently Precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating
ſome Bodies diſſolv'd in U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinous
<hi>Menſtruums,</hi> or others not A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid.
I know it may be ſuſpected, and
that not without colour of Reaſon,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:49353:41"/>
that ſuch Precipitations may be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
by producing Heterogene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Corpuſcles in the Blood, that
may be too-heavy or groſs to be eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated.
And I look upon this as a
ſuſpicion, for whoſe Reſolution
'twere fit to conſult Experience.
But in the mean time one may repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
                  <p>1. That, thô ſome Inconvenience
may happen from the Bulk of the
precipitated Corpuſcles, yet that may
be much inferiour to the danger
threatned by the over-active &amp; hoſtile
Particles, that produc'd or fomented
the diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>2. That, 'tis not neceſſary that all
concretions ſhould conſiſt of Corpuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
ſo bulky, as to be too big to be
thrown out of the Maſs of Blood, for
we ſee that ſtony matter, which, as
the Chymical <hi>Analyſis</hi> of it ſhews, is
of a very compounded nature, may
be carryed to all Parts of the Body.
And I remember I knew a Lady, who
a while before ſhe told me the Story,
had a ſtone taken out of the lower
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:49353:42"/>
part of her Tongue. And Phyſicians,
that preſcribe great quantities of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Waters impregnated with <hi>Iron,</hi>
ſuch as I found thoſe of <hi>Tunbridge</hi> to be,
and with <hi>Sulphur,</hi> ſuch as ſome of the
<hi>Bath</hi> Waters are, are wont to build
their expectations of Curing with
them, upon a ſuppoſition, that they are
carryed into the Maſs of Blood, and
conſequently to the innermoſt parts
of the Body.</p>
                  <p>3. That yet 'tis poſſible, Precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
may be made of matters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
in the Blood, by Medicines
that do not get into the Maſs of it.
As Phyſicians give Steel in Subſtance
ſometimes crude, as well as often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
prepar'd, to mortify the Acidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the Blood, though the Metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line
Corpuſcles do not, for ought
we know, paſs into the Maſs of it,
but are wrought upon by the matter,
that in its circulation is thrown out
of it into the Stomach &amp; Guts, where
their operation on it is probably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
from the blackneſs, that Chaly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beates
are wont give the excrements
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:49353:42"/>
of the lower Belly; and if they will
have it, that prepar'd Steel, for inſtance,
calcin'd with Sulphur, gets through
the Pores of the Bowels, or the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities
of the capillary Veſſels, into
the Maſs of Blood it ſelf, 'twill be
obvious to demand, why nature ſhould
not be able to expel Precipitate Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles
at the ſame paſſages, at which
ſuch compounded Concretions, as
thoſe of Sulphur and Metal, can get
in.</p>
                  <p>4. That ſome may very ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
pretend; that Experience has
been already conſulted about the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediency
of imploying Precipitating
Medicines. For not to urge, that the

to intimate, that in ſome caſes the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brile

changes may be wrought
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:49353:43"/>
in the fluid Parts of the Body by
appropriated Precipitants, if that be
true which is unanimouſly taught by
a multitude of Phyſicians, who impute
many Diſeaſes to the Putrefaction of

you ſhould on this occaſion know
Hiſtorically, (what probably you
will think ſtrange) that there is in
<hi>rerum natura,</hi> a certain Subſtance,
which is ſo powerful an Enemy to
Putrefaction, that, when a few grains
or drops of it were put into a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
quantity of Water, that had
been kept till it ſtunk ſo ſtrongly and
offenſively, that, if I had not known
what it was, I ſhould have judg'd
the ſmell to have proceeded from
Carrion. This Medicinal Liquor, I
ſay, (for ſo I may call it,) being dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd
by agitation through this abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
ſtinking Water, (which did not
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:49353:44"/>
appear turbid to the Eye) in ſo very
ſmall a proportion, Precipitated out of
it a very little and light Feculency,
which being ſeparated, the reſt of the
Liquor was quite freed from all ſtink;
nor did I obſerve that the Feculency
it ſelf had any. And, which is very
notable, all this was done in a very few
minutes, by a Precipitant, whoſe Taſt
was not at all either Bitter, or Acid, or
Urinous, or Lixivial. All which are
Circumſtances, that may afford good
Hints to ſpeculative and ſagacious
Inquirers.</p>

                  <p>Sometimes the Specifick Remedy
may work, by peculiarly ſtrenthening,
and cheriſhing the Heart, and by that
means, or without it, the Part affected.</p>
                  <p>This Obſervation can ſcarce be
made good, without entring into the
Controverſy, which for its difficulty
and importance, has perplex'd divers
Modern Phyſicians; whether there

be any Medicines, that have a Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy

Cordial,</hi> or <hi>Hepatic &amp;c.</hi> Or,
to ſpeak ſomewhat more clearly,
whether there be any Medicines, that
in a peculiar manner do good to this
or that particular internal part of the
Body. In this diſpute the Affirmative
part has been held, but I doubt upon
ſlender grounds of reaſon, in moſt of
the Phyſick Schools for ſeveral Ages.
But in our times, many do not only
maintain the Negative, but deride the
Opinion they have forſaken. For ſome
of them object in a Triumphant Style,
that tis ridiculous to fancy ſuch a Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy,
betwixt a dead Medicine, and
the Parts of a living body. As that the
Phyſician may ſend the Drug, as
'twere of an Errand, to find out one
in the dark, among a multitude of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and do it good offices.</p>
                  <p>But notwithſtanding this, I think
it very poſſible, that a Medicine may
ſo far reſpect a particular Part, as,
though not to be beneficial to that
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:49353:45"/>
only, yet to be friendly to that, in a
peculiar manner or degree. And this
I conceive it may be, upon one or
more of the Accounts, that I ſhall
briefly mention.</p>
                  <p>And Firſt, when I conſider that the
ſtable Parts of the Body, as the Heart,
Brain, Liver, Kidneys <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have
each its particular ſtructure, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it differs from others, and proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
the fluid Parts alſo, as Blood,
Gall, Lympha <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct
Textures, it ſeems not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
to me, that the Corpuſcles of a
Medicine diſſolv'd in the Stomach,
and carryed too and fro by the Liquors
of the Body, may according to the
determinate ſhape, ſize, ſtiffneſs or
flexility, motion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be much more
fit to be detain'd by one part of the
Body, as the Brain, the Heart <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
than by the reſt; and ſo, by lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it ſelf in its Pores, or aſſociating
with its Fibres, may ſupply it with
ſuch congruous Particle, as it either
does want, or in caſe it do not, may
by their congruity be of advantage to
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:49353:45"/>
it, by re-eſtabliſhing or ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Tone of it. And by this Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboration,
the Part may be made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to reſiſt the Hoſtilities of Morbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick
Matters, which Phyſicians
uſually obſerve to be wont, by the
more <hi>Vigorous</hi> Parts, to be thrown up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Weakned</hi> or <hi>Diſtemper'd</hi> ones;
as is manifeſt in perſons that are much
ſubject to the <hi>Gout,</hi> in whom often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
peccant humors are very apt,
upon ſeveral occaſions, to be thrown
off by the nobler Parts, if they be ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſt,
upon the frequently debilitated
Joints; on which ſcore the Gout, if
it be well managed, is, not irrational<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
wont to be thought conducive to
long life. And on this occaſion I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
that I formerly knew a
Learned Phyſician, who, though a
great Traveller, and, as ſuch, accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom'd
to great varieties in point of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et,
had ſuch a peculiar indiſpoſition
in his Jaw, that though he could mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately
drink Wines of ſeveral ſorts
without inconvenience, yet the drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
even of a very little Brandy, would
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:49353:46"/>
ſoon after give him the Tooth Ach,
of which odd diſtemper he has ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
complain'd to me. But this up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the by: For I muſt now proceed
to illuſtrate and make probable, what
I was ſaying of the poſſible fitneſs of
ſome Medicinal Corpuſcles, to aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate
themſelves with thoſe of the
Part they are to befriend, by obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what happens in Nutrition, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in that of ſucking-children. For
in theſe, one ſingle Aliment, namely
Milk, does afford, beſides various
excrements, ſuch as the groſſer <hi>faeces</hi>
of the Guts, and the more fluid ones
of the Bladder, the Mouth, the Noſe,
the pores of the Skin <hi>&amp;c.</hi> a great
number of Corpuſcles, that are not
only detain'd, but aſſimilated by Parts
of differing Structures, as the Brain,
the Heart, the Bones <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſince other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
theſe parts could never be ſo
plentifully nouriſhed by them, as day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to increaſe in all their Dimenſions.
And tis conſiderable, that ſome Parts,
which in Babes are Cartilaginous, do
in proceſs of time become Boney,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:49353:46"/>
which change ſeems not probably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable
to the bare exſiccation, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
by Native heat, increaſing with
the Perſons Age.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the friendly Corpuſcles
of a Specifick Medicine, may not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
confirm the good eſtate of a deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
Part, but, which makes moſt
for our preſent purpoſe, they may
very much conduce to reſtore it to a
ſound condition, when it is diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered,
and this they may do upon
two or three Accounts.</p>
                  <p>For in the firſt place, thoſe friendly
Particles may diſpoſe the Obſtructing
or other Morbifick matter, to be
more eaſily and ſafely expell'd. And
this they may do, not barely <hi>as</hi> they
impregnate the whole Maſs of Blood,
and ſo may be carried by it, as well
to many other Parts, as to that we
now conſider; but <hi>as</hi> by their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Texture, Motion <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they
may in a peculiar manner reſpect that
peculiar Modification, which the
Peccant matter may have acquir'd by
being produc'd or harbour'd in that
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:49353:47"/>
determinate part: And that the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct
Structure of an affected Part
may much diverſifie the condition of
a Morbifick matter, I argue from
this, among other things, that Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians
are wont to teach (though I
have found the Obſervation rather to
hold commonly than unreſervedly)
that in thoſe that are ſubject to this
Stone, the Petreſcent matter, when
it is bred in the Kidneys is reddiſh
or yellowiſh, but when in the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
white, or of a light gray; and
that the Stones that are generated in
the firſt nam'd Parts, are more friable,
or at leaſt of a ſlighter Texture, than
thoſe that have their Original in the
Bladder, ſome of which are exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hard, eſpecially in compariſon of
large ones, that I have had out of the
Bladder or Gall of luſty Animals.
The aptneſs then that the Corpuſcles
of the Specifick may give the Blood,
or other Liquor that conveys them,
to act as an appropriated <hi>Menſtruum,</hi>
upon the peculiarly modified Matter
that obſtructs, or otherwiſe diſaffects,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:49353:47"/>
the Liver, for Inſtance, may enable
the Remedy, to be very helpful to
that Part, by preparing the moleſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Matter for expulſion. But it may
alſo ſuccour the ſame Part in another
way.</p>
                  <p>For in the ſecond place, it may ſo
work upon the Fibres, and ſtable
portion of the Part affected, as both
to enable it, and excite it to free its
ſelf from its Enemy. For <hi>it</hi> may give
firmneſs and ſtrength to the Fibres of
the part; <hi>it</hi> may alſo contemperate,
or correct the immoderate heat, cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> of it: <hi>It</hi> may mortify the
Acid, or other incongruous Particles,
that are lodg'd in the minute Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals
of the ſtable Parts, end perhaps,
even in the Pores of the Fibres: <hi>It</hi>
may appeaſe its Convulſions, Cramps,
or other inordinate motions, that
hinder it from daily executing its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Functions; <hi>it</hi> may relax or wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
the Pores, according to the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency
of the work to be perform'd.
And having thus, by means of its
friendly Corpuſcles, prepar'd the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:49353:48"/>
matter to be expell'd, and diſpoſed
the part to expell it, <hi>it</hi> may then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
excite the Part to do its office, by
irritating the Fibres, or motive Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans,
or ſtimulating them to disbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
the Part of the Matter that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends
it, as a very ſmall Doſe of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharides</hi>
is known by this way of
irritation, to be capable of making
the Bladder forcibly, though not ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
diſcharge it ſelf of Urine, and
with that oftentimes expel the Sand
and Gravel, or leſſer Stones, and the
Excrementitious Slime that moleſted
it before.</p>
                  <p>And this Inſtance may be of uſe to
us, in anſwering that which we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
noted to be ſo confidently urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Rejecters of Specifick Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines.
For here we have a Medicine,
though a dangerous one, whoſe Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles
have ſuch a peculiar refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to the Bladder, and Urinary
Organs, that though being gotten into
the Maſs of Blood, they are carried
by it indiſcriminately to other parts
of the Body, as well as to theſe; yet
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:49353:48"/>
oftentimes, without manifeſtly diſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
the reſt, they exceedingly ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritate
the Bladder, and determine it
to the excretion of what it contains.
And whereas it may be objected,
that the <hi>firſt</hi> of the three ways, by
which we noted, that a particular
Part may be ſuccour'd by a Specifick,
ſeems contrary to the <hi>ſecond;</hi> the
former tending to corroborate the
Part, and the later to relax and irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
it: I anſwer two things, <hi>one,</hi>
that ſince the Part may be ſometimes
in a Natural, and ſometimes in a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural
ſtate, in the <hi>former,</hi> a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine
may deſerve the name of
<hi>Friendly</hi> or <hi>Appropriated,</hi> becauſe it
keeps it ſound, which is moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
done by ſtrengthening it; and
in the <hi>later</hi> it may merit the Title of
a <hi>Specifick,</hi> becauſe it helps to reſtore
it to a ſtate of ſoundneſs: And the
<hi>other,</hi> that though to effect this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery,
'tis often very expedient, if
not neceſſary, that the Medicine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
an Evacuation of ſome matter
that offends it; yet that Evacuation
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:49353:49"/>
itſelf is often much promoted and
facilitated, by ſtengthening the Part
ſo, as to enable it to disburthen it ſelf.
And the ſame Medicine may contain,
and communicate to the Blood, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles
of ſuch differing ſhapes, ſizes,
motions <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as may at leaſt ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively
relieve the Part by both theſe
ways; as Phyſicians obſerve that
Rhubarb does, not only by its finer
and Laxative Parts, purge the Liver
of Choler, but by its more earthy
Aſtringent Corpuſcles ſtrengthen the
Tone of that Part: [What farther be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to the Illuſtration of this matter
will be met with in due place.] On
this occaſion, 'twill not be imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
to add, that in ſome caſes, this
very Corroboration of a Diſtemper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Part, may reſtore it to ſoundneſs;
there being ſome Diſeaſes of ſuch a
nature, that they are, if I may ſo
ſpeak, almoſt always in <hi>Fieri,</hi> that
is, they could not continue to ſubſiſt
in the affected Part, unleſs through
its debility, and the conſequences of
it, it were ſubject to admit from
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:49353:49"/>
time to time freſh recruits of peccant
matter, to foment the Malady: And
in ſuch Diſtempers, if the Structure
and Tone of the Part be re-eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the operation of the Specifick
Medicine, its acquir'd vigour will
enable it to reſiſt the Ingreſs of new
ſupplies of peccant Matter, and to
turn them off into the Maſs of Blood,
to be thence diſcharg'd by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Shores of the Body; whilſt in
the mean time Nature will be able by
degrees to ſubdue, diſſipate, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
diſpoſe of, that comparatively
little Portion of peccant Matter, that
was lodg'd in the Diſeas'd Part.</p>
                  <p>We have not in this Paper given
any Example of the peculiar reſpect
of a Specifick Medicine to a determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
diſaffected Part, that one would
think ſo incredible, as that a heavy
ſtony ſubſtance, being in no great
quantity taken in at die Mouth,
ſhould manifeſtly contribute to the
Cure of a broken Bone in one of the
Limbs, as the Leg or the Hands. And
yet, not to urge the Teſtimony of
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:49353:50"/>
Chymical Writers, I remember a
<hi>German</hi> Phyſician, that was Famous
for notable Cures, related Wonders
to me of the efficacy of that Stone
growing in his Country, which from
its effect they call <hi>Oſteocolla,</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
if it be improv'd by a Skilful Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,
which he communicated to
me, but I had not opportunity to
make Tryal of it. But without Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
the judicious and long expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienc'd
Chirurgeon <hi>Fabricius Hilda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
much commends upon his own
Obſervation a ſingle Dram of it fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Powder'd, for the breeding of a
<hi>Callus</hi> to ſoder together the Parts of
a broken Bone: Inſomuch that he gives
a caution to uſe it but ſparingly in
young and vigorous Patients, leſt it
breed too great a <hi>Callus,</hi> of which he
gives a notable Inſtance. And the
like caution was inculcated to me
from Experience, by the lately men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
<hi>German</hi> Doctor, becauſe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
(he ſaid) his Preparation would
in ſuch Perſons make the Medicine
generate a <hi>Callus</hi> too ſoon and too
great.</p>

                  <p>Sometimes a Specifick Medicine may do
its work, by producing in the Maſs
of Blood, ſuch a diſpoſition, as may
enable Nature, by correcting, expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
or other fit waies, to ſurmount
the morbifick Matter, or other Cauſe
of the Diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>He that ſhall heedfully obſerve the
practiſe of divers Learned and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesful
modern Phyſitians, may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
that many, if not moſt, of their
Preſcriptions are founded upon a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
that a great Part of the
Diſeaſes incident to Mans Body, and
the recovery from them, depends
mainly upon the vitiated Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Blood, and the reſtoring
it to a ſound Condition.</p>
                  <p>This advantageous change of the
Blood may be effected by a Specifick,
ſeveral waies, (ſometimes ſeparate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and ſometimes jointly,) and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
by thoſe that follow.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="86" facs="tcp:49353:51"/>
1. That which I ſhall firſt name,
is, by furniſhing the Blood with ſome
ſort of active Corpuſcles, that it
needs to <hi>ferment</hi> it, or excite <hi>an
uſeful Commotion or Agitation</hi> in it.</p>
                  <p>I will not here examine, whether
the Maſs of Blood, contain'd within
the Veſſels of a living man, is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of a <hi>Fermentation</hi> properly and
ſtrictly ſo call'd; and therefore I
employ'd alſo the word <hi>Commotion,</hi>
which will be eaſily admitted, if the
other be diſliked. But in regard <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation</hi>
is a Term that hath gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
obtain'd, I ſhall not ſcruple to
make uſe of it, after what I have inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
about it.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe many modern Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
eſpecially ſince the Learned <hi>Dr.
Willis</hi>'s Notions came to be in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,
have looked upon Feavers and
Agues to conſiſt in, or be produc'd
by vitious Fermentations of the
Blood; I thought fit to add to
the <hi>Fermentation</hi> I am about to ſpeak
of, the diſtinguiſhing Epithets of
<hi>uſeful.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="87" facs="tcp:49353:51"/>
This premis'd, it ſeems not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable
to me, that, as there is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
a vitious Fermentation of
the Blood, ſo there may be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
a want of Fermentation, or a
certain Sluggiſhneſs, upon whoſe
account, <hi>either</hi> the brisk inteſtine
Agitation, that it ought to have as
a warm Fluid of ſuch a Nature as
'tis wont to be in ſound Perſons,
or a due quickneſs of Circulation
through the Heart is wanting: To
which Sluggiſh State of the Blood,
if it be obſtinate and laſting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſeveral
Diſtempers are wont to be conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent.
Now, <hi>although</hi> there be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Medicines, ſuch as Spices,
Brandy, and other Spirituous Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors
diſtill'd from fermented vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables,
that are uſually, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ſuccesfully enough, employ'd
to correct this dull Indiſpoſition of
the Blood; Yet in regard they are
wont to be very hot, being
uſually pitch'd upon by thoſe that
preſcribe them becauſe they are ſo;
there are ſeveral conſtitutions of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:49353:52"/>
Patients, and divers other Circum<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtances,
wherein they are not ſafe,
but may do more harm by their
immoderate Heat, than good by
their Spirituoſity, Beſides, that the
Sluggiſhneſs of the Blood may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
proceed from Cauſes, that
this ſort of hot Medicines will not
correct. I remember, that having
for Tryals ſake moderately dry'd
a parcel of Human Blood, a <hi>Vinous
Spirit</hi> Total inflammable would not,
at leaſt in many hours that my
Experiment laſted, make a Solution
of it, or draw a red Tincture from
it, though it were well pulveris'd:
Whereas a well rectified <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rinous
Spirit</hi> grew red upon it in leſs than
the tenth, or perhaps the twentieth,
part of that Time.</p>
                  <p>Now a Specifick Medicine may
abound in Corpuſcles of ſuch a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that without dangerouſly, or
incommodiouſly heating the Blood,
they may diſable thoſe Corpuſcles,
they meet with in the Blood, that make
that Liquor viſcous, or roapy, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirited;
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:49353:52"/>
and alſo by enlivening the Maſs
of Blood, if I may ſo ſpeak, or put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it into a more brisk and kindly
Agitation, may make it fit to throw
off thoſe Heterogeneous Parts, or
recrements, that were blended with
it before, and to permeate, as freely
as it ought, the <hi>Viſcera,</hi> whoſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillary
Veſſels and Pores would for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
ſcarce, and but very ſparing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly,
admit it.</p>
                  <p>That a Specifick may perform this,
you will perhaps the more eaſily al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
if you conſider, that the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of Phyſitians teach, that
there are ſeveral <hi>Cordials,</hi> which they
ſtyle ſome of them <hi>Temperate,</hi> and
divers of them <hi>Cold,</hi> (as in effect
'tis not uſually obſerv'd, that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably,
if at all ſenſibly, heat the
Body;) as Pearls, and ſome of them,
being gratefully Acid, ſhould rather
cool it, as Wood-ſorrel (<hi>Alleluja</hi>) and
Goats-Rue (<hi>Galega.</hi>) And 'tis very
poſſible, that the Corpuſcles, that
make the Blood thick, and Sluggiſh,
may not be of a Cold Nature, but of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:49353:53"/>
a Hot, and therefore may have their
Effects rather befriended than de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd
by divers Hot Remedies:
As, if the white of an Egg be by
beating reduc'd to Water, (which is
not neceſſary to the Experiment, but
ſhews it better) if you put to it a
certain Proportion of well dephleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m'd
Spirit of Wine, inſtead of deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the viſcoſity of the Liquor, it
will curdle a good part of it, and
thereby produce a Body far more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
from Thinneſs and Fluidity.</p>
                  <p>And I remember, I once for Tryal
ſake made a vegetable Liquor, which,
from ſomewhat Sluggiſh that it was
before, did preſently by the Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a little Spirit of Wine, grow
ſurpriſingly viſcous, and roapy.</p>
                  <p>2. Another way, by which a Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick
may befriend the Maſs of Blood,
is, by imparting to it a dilatation or
tenuity that it wants. This Second
way is of much affinity to the Firſt,
but yet is not the ſame: Becauſe in
that, the thing mainly conſidered
was, the Fermentation or Agitation
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:49353:53"/>
of the Blood; Whereas this mainly
reſpects the Conſiſtence of it, which
is a thing of no mean importance to
health. For if the Blood be too thick,
as oftentimes it is, it cannot paſs
ſo freely and readily, as it ought,
through the Capillary Veſſels, which
thereby come to be by little and little
obſtructed, and the Circulation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniently
retarded; Whence 'tis
eaſy to foreſee, that divers miſchiefs
muſt in time ariſe. And on the other
ſide, if the Blood be too thin, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if it be over much agitated too,
tis apt to make its way out of the
Veſſels, and produce Hemorrhagies, in
caſe it flow out of the Body, or other
bad Effects that uſually attend the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travaſation
of the Blood. Which Liquor,
when it is out of its proper Veſſels,
in ſo warm a place as a Living Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Body, is very Subject to Putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
and thereby apt to produce
Impoſthumes and ſeveral miſchievous
Symptoms.</p>
                  <p>Now a Specifick Medicine may
remedy this faulty Conſiſtence of the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:49353:54"/>
Blood, by furniſhing it with Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles,
fitted by their figure, bulk,
motion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to diſable thoſe peccant
ones that make the Blood groſs, or
elſe to cut, or divide the Parts of the
Blood it ſelf, and ſo diſpoſe them to
be more fluid: Or elſe they may
produce in it ſuch Pores, as may, as
it were invite the ſubtil Aetherial mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that abounds in the Atmoſphaere,
to inſinuate it ſelf into the Maſs of
Blood, and rarifie it. And on the other
ſide, when the Blood is too thin, as
not only ſome Diſeaſes, but ſome
Medicines, eſpecially Aloes, are
wont to make it; A Specifick Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
may reduce it to a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence,
<hi>either,</hi> by furniſhing it with
Corpuſcles, apt to Combine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with the active ones, that did
too much Attenuate the Blood; <hi>Or,</hi>
by helping Nature to expel thoſe
over-buſy Particles, by inſenſible
Tranſpiration, or ſome other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſturbing
way.</p>
                  <p>3: There is yet another way, by
which a Specifick Remedy may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:49353:54"/>
to rectifie the State of the Blood
And that is, by ſo working on
the Heart, as to make it advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
regulate the Tranſmiſſion of
that Liquor through it.</p>
                  <p>That a Specifick Medicine may pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly
befriend this or that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Part, and conſequently the
Heart, is granted by the Generality
of Phyſitians, who are wont to reckon
up many Cordials, (of which yet I
fear, but few deſerve that name.)
But, ſince 'tis elſewhere in this Paper
ſhewn, that ſome Medicines may
particularly reſpect a determinate
Part of the Body, and conſequently
the Heart; One may be allowed
to ſuppoſe, that the Corpuſcles of a
Specifick may <hi>either</hi> diſſolve ſome
Particles they meet with in the Heart,
by which that Noble <hi>Viſcus</hi> is by
Irritation, or otherwiſe diſturb'd in
the Regularity of its Dilatations, and
Contractions; <hi>Or,</hi> ſo Corroborate
the Fibres, or Motive Organs of it,
as to diſpoſe it to moderate the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation
of the Blood that paſſes
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:49353:55"/>
through it, in the moſt advantageous
way. And that the Diſpoſition of the
Heart, even when men have no ſenſe
of it in the Part it ſelf, may be of
moment as to health and ſickneſs,
will appear credible, if we reflect on
two thing. <hi>One,</hi> that a living Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Body is not a meer Aggregate of
Fleſh, Bones, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But an exquiſitely
contriv'd, and very ſenſible Engine;
Whoſe Parts are eaſily ſet a work by
proper, though very Minute, Agents;
And may, by their Action upon one
another, perform far greater things,
than could be expected from the bare
Energy of the Agents, that firſt put
them into Motion. The <hi>Second,</hi>
(which ſuppoſes the firſt,) that the
Diſpoſition of the Heart, being,
though perhaps inſenſibly, chang'd,
it may produce a notable Alteration
in the Motions of the Blood, and
its paſſage through the Heart, in
point of quantity, celerity, or
both.</p>
                  <p>How much this change in the
Circulation may in many Caſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:49353:55"/>
to ſickneſs or recovery may
partly appear by the Effects of vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or durable paſſions of the mind.
As 'tis obſerv'd, that in a deep ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
which does in a manner ſtraiten
the Paſſages of the Heart, the Blood
being too ſparingly diſpens'd, the
enlivening Spirits are not generated
plentifully enough; And (beſides
other bad Effects of this State of the
Heart) the Blood is ſo diſpirited, as
(in theſe Parts of <hi>Europe</hi>) to diſpoſe
the Body to the Scurvy, which does
either produce or irritate divers
other Maladies. We ſee alſo, that the
Paſſion of ſhame does oftentimes
ſuddenly alter the Motion of the Blood,
and make it ſwell the little Veſſels
that lye under the <hi>Cuticula</hi> of the
Face, and ſometimes other Parts;
as is very manifeſt in young Maids,
and other Perſons of a Delicate Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion,
the white Part of whoſe
Faces in bluſhing turns Red. The
like Effect I have ſeen produc'd by a
great and ſudden Joy. And though
Grief, which is the oppoſite Paſſion
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:49353:56"/>
to it, has been uſually taken notice
of, as a thing that deads the Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite
to meat; Yet ſo much does de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon a well moderated Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of the Blood, that it has
been obſerv'd in divers Perſons, and
I have known an eminent Inſtance of
it, that great Joy has very much
leſſen'd Hunger: Of which Effect
<hi>Mr. Des Cartes</hi> ingeniouſly attempts
to derive the cauſe, from the vary'd
Dilatation and Motions of the Heart.
And it ſeems not abſur'd to conceive,
that ſuch like Motions may be caus'd
by the Corpuſcles of a Specifick
Medicine; Which by affecting the
Fibres of the Heart, after the like
manner that Joy is wont to do, may
produce in it ſuch friendly Dilatati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Contractions, as are wont
to flow from the agreeable Paſſions.
In favour of which conjecture, I ſhall
take notice that a Lady of my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
has complain'd to me,
that the ſmell of perfum'd Gloves
is wont to make the Blood fly to her
Face, and continue there for a great
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:49353:56"/>
while, giving it ſuch a colour as if
ſhame, or joy had cover'd it with
bluſhes. And the like ſhe ſays ſhe
has obſerv'd in others of her Sex.
But having in another Tract ſpoken
of the power of the Paſſions of the
mind, to alter the ſtate of the Body,
by producing changes in the Blood,
that is tranſmitted through the
Heart; what has been ſaid may now
ſuffice to make it credible, that a
Specifick Remedy, by peculiarly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friending
the Heart, may contribute
much to introduce, or re-eſtabliſh
a healthy <hi>Craſis</hi> in the Blood. And
this being thus rectified, and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorated
it ſelf, may both befriend
the Body in general, and conduce
to the removal of ſome particular
Diſeaſes, by ſtrengthening, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
too exciting, the particular
part, in which the peccant matter
reſides, to ſubdue or expel that
which it already harbours, and reſiſt
any acceſſion of more. And the Blood,
being it ſelf well conſtituted, as well
as the ſtable Parts corroborated, the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:49353:57"/>
Specifick Medicine that produces
theſe good effects, may be ſaid to
cure, tho' perhaps but ſlowly, divers
particular Diſeaſes; ſuch as thoſe
elſewhere mention'd in this Paper,
which to continue, muſt be frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſupplyed with vitious matter by

                  <p>Sometimes a Specifick Remedy may
unite its Particles with thoſe of the
Peccant matter, and with them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute
a <hi>Neutrum quid,</hi> that may be
eaſily proſcrib'd, or not neceſſary to be
expell'd.</p>
                  <p>This I take to be one of the moſt
proper and genuine ways of doing
good, that belongs to a Specifick Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine,
as ſuch, becauſe in this opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
an effect is produc'd, either with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the aſſiſtance, or beyond the
meer power, of the manifeſt qualities
(as Phyſicians call them) of the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:49353:57"/>
and the cure or relief the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
finds, is uſually attain'd without
violence, and without tormenting
or much diſordering him.</p>
                  <p>This way of working of a Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick
Medicine is of near affinity with
one or two of thoſe formerly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd
of; but yet theſe ways differ
in ſome things, as may be gather'd
by the ſequel of § this diſcourſe
§ ſometimes when a certain kind of
Acid has impregnated the Blood, or
lodg'd it ſelf in ſome ſtable part, as
the Liver, Spleen, Kidneys, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The
Corpuſcles of a Specifick may, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any ſenſible luctation or conflict,
which uſually happens when Acids
are mortify'd by Sapid Alkalies, be
ſo qualifi'd, as <hi>both</hi> to make Coaliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
with the ſmall Parts of the Pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
Acid, <hi>and</hi> with them to conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
little Concretions, which differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from the minute Parts of the
Acid, either in Bulk, Figure, Solidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Stifneſs, Motion, or in two or
more of theſe; may be quite of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
nature, and of a much innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:49353:58"/>
than the Acid was before 'twas
ſo corrected. Of this we may be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
with a notable Illuſtration, by
what I have elſewhere taken notice
of about <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> it ſelf; for as
corroſive a <hi>Menſtruum</hi> as that is, yet
by digeſting it, and perhaps, diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
it too, with an equal, or rather
double weight of Ardent Spirit, I
found the highly Acid Liquor would
be ſo chang'd, as not to retain any
ſenſible corroſiveneſs; and exchange
its piercing Stink and great Acidity,
for a not only inoffenſive, but plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
Scent, and a grateful and poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
ſweetiſh Taſt. Which brings
into my mind the practice of a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident
of the Famous <hi>London</hi> Colledge,
who (as himſelf told me) was wont
to relieve a Patient of very great Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
in Nephritick Torments, by giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her a good Doſe of an inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Spirit. (But this upon the by.) I
have elſewhere given an account of
the effects of Spirit of Wine, upon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
other Acid <hi>Menſtruums,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
I mingl'd and digeſted it; by
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:49353:58"/>
which it may appear, that it does not
work upon them uniformly, as they
are all of them Acids; but differingly
enough, according to the Nature and
Proportion of the Acid Corpuſcles,
with which the vinous Spirits are
brought to be aſſociated.</p>
                  <p>And, to ſhew that this change
and contemperation of the <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruum</hi>
by the Spirit of Wine, is
produc'd rather by a peculiar fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the convening Corpuſcles of
both, than by the contrariety or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtility,
that the vinous Spirit, which
ſome Moderns will have to be an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caly,
has to the <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> as an Acid;
I ſhall add, that pure Spirit of Wine
being mixt in a due proportion with
<hi>Highly rectifi'd</hi> Spirit of Urine;
which is reckon'd by Chymiſts among
volatile Alcalies, and of which a
drop or two is ſo fiery upon the
tongue; as to be ready to burn it,
or to bliſter it; this Vinous Spirit I
ſay, will very much take off the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick
penetrancy of the urinous one,
and compoſe with it a Salt much
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:49353:59"/>
more moderate than the Spirit was,
and which being ſublim'd, or (which
is better but harder to be done,<note place="margin">N. B.</note>)
reduc'd into a Liquor, affords
a mixture of no little uſe in fome Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
and other Diſeaſes as a <hi>Medicine;</hi>
and with a ſmall, if skilful alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
is of great uſe in divers Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Experiments as a <hi>Menſtruum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A few grains of Glaſs of Antimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
made without addition, being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
inwardly, will vehemently both
vomit and purge. But <hi>tho'</hi> Wine, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
its copious Spirits, will,
if it be well impregnated with the
Corpuſcles of this Glaſs, work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
and downwards violently e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough;
yet of Spirit of Vinegar, that
is, of degenerated Wine, be for a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
time digeſted upon this Glaſs
finely powder'd, and, when the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
is ſufficiently impregnated with
the Particles of the Glaſs, be abſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from it, there will emerge from
the Antimonial and Acetous Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles,
a multitude of minute Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions,
of which many grains may
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:49353:59"/>
be given without ordinarily provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
either Vomits or Stools: Which
correction may hint, that 'tis not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
that all Mortifications uſefully
made by Medicines, ſhould be of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cids,
ſince here we ſee, that Acids
themſelves prove Correctors. And
perhaps it may be by ſome ſuch kind
of Combinations, that ſome Poiſons
(for I do not think they all work
one way, or peculiarly aſſault the
heart) may be ſubdued. And I have
ſometimes ſuſpected, that it may as
probably be upon this account, as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any that has been offer'd, that a
man ſtung with a Scorpion may be
cur'd, by cruſhing the <hi>Animal</hi> that
ſtung him upon the hurt, as is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd
by many Phyſicians, and as
an acquaintance of mine told me,
he try'd upon himſelf (as another
Virtuoſo did on a Souldier) with
good ſucceſs: And when I conſider
what a multitude and variety of
figures may fit the Corpuſcles that
are endowed with them, to make
Coalitions very different from both
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:49353:60"/>
the component parts; I can ſcarce
think it very improbable, that in a
Patients Body there may be made,
between the Corpuſcles of the Pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
matter, and thoſe of a Medicine,
ſuch uſeful combinations as may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
reſulting Concretions, innocent,
if not alſo beneficial.</p>
                  <p>If I had leizure, and thought it
fit, I could eaſily add a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of inſtances, about ſuch changes
of Colours, Odours, Taſts, and other
qualities, as are produc'd by the
coalleſcence of the ſmall parts of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
Bodies, and diſcourſe of the
natural conſequent of ſuch Coali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
but having done that ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
in other Papers, it will be here
more proper to intimate to you, that
when a particle of peccant matter
comes to be aſſociated with one of a
Specifick Medicine, that combination
may alter it for the better, not only
by changing its bigneſs and figure,
but alſo by encreaſing, or leſſening
its ſtifneſs, and its ſolidity, and giving
a new modification to its motion; as
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:49353:60"/>
a little attention to the natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences
of the Coalitions of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
may eaſily induce you to grant.</p>
                  <p>And I ſhall add (as it were <hi>ex
abundanti</hi>) that the ſmall Concretions,
made by the union of ſome Morbifick
with ſome Medicinal Corpuſcles, may
not only become innocent, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
alſo beneficial, which may be
illuſtrated by what happens by a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
preparation, to common ſubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate;
for though this be a ſubſtance
ſo highly corroſive and miſchievous,
that a few grains of it may ſuffice to
kill a man; yet by making a Coaleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
of it with leſs than its weight
of Quickſilver, which is a Body in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipid
as well as modorous, the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſive
ſublimate will be ſo alter'd
and tam'd, as to be turn'd into what
Chymiſts call, becauſe 'tis freed from
ſharpneſs, <hi>Mercurius Dulcis;</hi> which
if it be skilfully prepar'd and given,
though in the quantity of many
grains, is not only for the moſt part
an innocent thing, but a very good
Medicine, and that perhaps in more
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:49353:61"/>
caſes than Phyſicians generally know
it to be good in.</p>
                  <p>The newly mention'd account
may hint to us a probable Argument,
to ſhow, that, notwithſtanding all
the digeſtions and changes that a
Specifick Medicine may receive in
its way, it may prove a ſalutary one,
when it arrives at the Part it ſhould
relieve. For, tho' the Corpuſcles of
the Medicine ſhould in their way to
the Part affected be conſiderably
chang'd, yet 'tis poſſible that theſe
alter'd Corpuſcles may, by that very
alteration, be made Medicinal; ſince
they may be qualifi'd, (even by thoſe
changes) when they arrive at the
Part affected, to combine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſtrictly with ſome Corpuſcles,
whether Morbifick or others, that
they find already there; and may
with them compoſe new Concretions
that may acquire a new Nature very
friendly to the Patient. Something A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalogical
to this we may obſerve in
<hi>Aſparagus,</hi> which being eaten, afford
ſtore of Particles, that mixing with
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:49353:61"/>
thoſe they meet with in the Kidneys
or the Bladder, produce a new O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour,
very differing, both from that
of meer Urine, and from that of the
Plant it ſelf. And ſo if good Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
be taken at the Mouth, 'tis
known that arriving at the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys
and Bladder, it will mingle
its minute Parts with thoſe it meets
with there; whence will emerge
Corpuſcles, that will impregnate the
Urine with a very differing Odour,
from that which belongs to either of
the Liquors, ſince it oftentimes has a
fragrancy ſomewhat like the ſmell of
Violets.</p>
                  <p>Before I conclude this Paper, 'tis
like it will be thought fit that I
ſhould take notice of a difficulty, that
I know maybe objected, if not againſt
the paſt diſcourſe, yet againſt the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency
of it to anſwer the deſign I
propoſe to my ſelf in writing it. For
it may be ſaid, that, whereas my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
and Explications ſuppoſe all
along, that the <hi>Specifick Remedies</hi> are
taken in at the Mouth; 'tis known
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:49353:62"/>
that divers of the Aſſerters of <hi>Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficks</hi>
reckon among them, ſome that
are not by ſwallowing taken into the
Body, but only outwardly apply'd, or
perhaps do but barely touch it; as
may be obſerv'd in Amulets, Rings,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> On occaſion of this conſiderable
difficulty, I have, if I miſremember
not, repreſented divers things in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Tract. But however it may be
fit in this place, briefly to ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what,
by way of Anſwerto it. We
may then take notice, that the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
with which many Phyſicians
reject, and ſome of them deride, <hi>Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Specificks,</hi> if I may ſo call them,
ſeems to be built upon theſe two
things: The <hi>One,</hi> that the <hi>Medicine</hi>
cannot in part, as 'tis certain it do's
not in the Maſs, get into the Body;
and the <hi>other,</hi> that, in caſe a <hi>Specifick</hi>
ſhould have ſome part of it ſubtil
enough to gain admittance, that Part
muſt be too ſmall and inconſiderable,
to be able to produce in the Body any
ſuch notable change, as is neceſſary to
the expulſion of Peccant Humours,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:49353:62"/>
and the conquering of a Diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>As to the former of theſe
Grounds, I largely enough ſhow in
another Paper,<note n="*" place="margin">The Paper here mean't is the Eſſay of the Poro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of bodys.</note> that
a Mans Skin, tho' it
ſeems an entire conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
Body, is really
perforated with a great multitude,
and perhaps a not inconſiderable va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety,
of little Cutlets and Inlets,
which we call Pores; many of which
are viſible, even in the Skins of dead
Animals, by good Microſcopes; and
others are manifeſtly inferr'd, from
the numerous little drops that cover
all the Skin, at the firſt Eruption of
Sweat. And that theſe little Perfo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
may be Inlets to the finer Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of Externally apply'd Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines,
may appear probable by ſeveral
<hi>Phaenomena,</hi> ſuch as theſe. That Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
will ſoak through the Pores of a
fine Bladder, and diſſolve Salt of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
or even white Sugar, contain'd
in it: That I have prepar'd a certain
Liquor, whoſe Fumes, tho' not agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
by Heat, would quickly pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:49353:63"/>
divers Membrans of dead Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
and manifeſtly work on Metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line
Bodies wrapt up in them: That
'tis a known thing, that Quickſilver
outwardly apply'd in Ointments,
Girdles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will get in at the Pores of
the Skin, and invade the Internal
Parts of the Body, and ſtay there
longer, and perhaps too operate
more, than the Phyſician deſired.
And when once the <hi>Effluvia</hi> of theſe
Externally apply'd Remedies have
gain'd admittance at the Pores of the
Skin, 'tis not very difficult to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
how they may proceed fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
For underneath the <hi>Cuticula</hi> or
Scarf Skin, and cloſe to it, there are
ſo great a multitude of Capillary Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,
that you can ſcarce thruſt a
ſmall Pin into any Part, but that the
point of it will meet and tear ſome of
theſe little Veſſels; as will appear
by a ſmall drop of Blood, that will
be made to iſſue out at the new made
hole, as ſmall as it is. To which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
if it were neceſſary, I could
add divers others of the multitude and
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:49353:63"/>
ſpreading of the Capillary Veſſels,
that lie cloſe beneath the Skin, and
for the moſt part carry Blood, tho'
ſome of them may contain other
Juices, and diſcharge their recrements
by Sweat, or inſenſible Tranſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
at the Cutaneous Outlets. Now
theſe Capillary Veſſels, as ſmall as
they are, having their Cavities im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
continu'd with thoſe of leſs
ſlender ones, and by their interven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with thoſe of the greater, which
are branches of the greateſt of all; the
Corpuſcles of the Medicine, once
got into the Capillary Veſſels, may
have an eaſy paſſage, by means of
the Liquors they contain, into
theſe greater branches of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Veins, and ſo, by vertue of the
Circulation, come to be quickly
mingled with the Maſs of Blood,
and by it may be eaſily convey'd to
all the Parts of the Body: As it has
been divers times obſerv'd,
<note n="*" place="margin">See this at large prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Learned <hi>Diemerbro<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>

tho' they ſcarce touch'd the Skin,

the Heart, and ſeveral miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
Symptoms in other Parts of
the Body. And I find it recorded
in good Authors, that <hi>Canthari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi>
even when but held in the
Hand, nay ſometimes, tho' but carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in ones Pocket, tranſmitted their
hurtful <hi>Effluvia</hi> as far as the Bladder,
and excited great Pain and other
bad Symptoms there.</p>
                  <p>As for the ſecond Ground on
which Specifick Remedies are reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that, tho' they could get entrance
into the Body, yet it would be but by
their <hi>Effluvia;</hi> and theſe are no way
likely to prove efficacious enough, to
have any conſiderable effect upon an
Internal Diſeaſe: To remove this
difficulty, I ſhall briefly obſerve;</p>
                  <p>1. That the number of the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles,
that may paſs from the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Medicine into the Body, may
be far greater, and therefore make
them more conſiderable, than moſt
men are apt to think. This may be
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:49353:64"/>
rendred probable, by the great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
of Odorous, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Senſible, Expirations, that are
continually emitted for a very long
time together, by Ambergreece,
Musk, Civet, and much more by
skilfully made Compoſitions of them.
And that alſo ſubtil <hi>Effluvia,</hi> even
without the aſſiſtance of Heat, may
quickly penetrate Membrans ſo plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully,
as to act on ſtable Bodies
contain'd in them, I have intimated
a little above, and have experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
made appear to divers curious
men.</p>
                  <p>2. That the Corpuſcles of a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine
may retain their Nature, and not
looſe their power of operating, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
their being, as it were,
ſtrain'd through the Skin; as may be
argued from the Mercury, that we
not long ſince mention'd to have been
found in the form of Quick-ſilver, in
the Bodies of ſome men, that had
been too frequently anonited with
Mercury, mix'd up with unctuous
things into an Ointment: By which
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:49353:65"/>
the Patient may be as long and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
Salivated, as if he had ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
a <hi>Bolus</hi> or Pills with Mercury.</p>
                  <p>And ſo I have divers times ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd,
as I doubt not but others have
oftner done, that a little <hi>Opium,</hi> mix'd
up with other Ingredients for Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
did by outward application take
off the Acute Pains of inward Parts,
tho' moderately remote from the Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</p>
                  <p>3. And that the Corpuſcles of a
Specifick may on divers occaſions act
more powerfully, by getting in at the
Pores of the Skin, than if the Remedy
that afforded them had been taken in
at the Mouth: Becauſe if it had, the
Particles might be divided, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
on other accounts, (as by dilu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
compoſition with thoſe of the
Chyle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) much alter'd, by the
Ferment or the <hi>Menſtruum</hi> of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
by their Filtration through the
Guts, and their long and winding paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
through them and the Lymphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts,
before they arrive at the Heart,
to be mingled with the Blood;
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:49353:65"/>
whereas the Corpuſcles of the Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Specifick, preſently after they are
paſt the Skin, get into the Capillary
Veſſels of the Blood that lie under it,
and by their means are ſpeedily mix'd
with the Circulating Maſs of that
Liquor, and ſo eſcape the formerly
mention'd alterations, that other Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines
are ſubject to before they are
admitted into the Maſs of Blood. By
which it may appear, that thoſe Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians
are much miſtaken, that think
a Topical Medicine can at beſt relieve
but the Part 'tis apply'd to, becauſe
its Corpuſcles cannot be ſuppos'd to
reach beyond that Part of the Body,
that lies very near the Medicine they
iſſue from. But, tho' this reaſoning
might be excuſable enough, if not
allowable, before the Circulation of
the Blood was diſcover'd, yet, now
'tis known how great an intercourſe
that Liquor maintains between
diſtant Parts of the Body, the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is not ſeaſonable.</p>
                  <p>And on this occaſion, I ſhall add
an advertiſement, that I remember
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:49353:66"/>
not I have met with in Authors;
which is, that Body's outwardly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
may prove Specificks for ſome
Diſeaſes or Diſtempers, that one
would not think them very good for,
by the bare knowledge of their effects
when taken in at the mouth. Thus
Camphire ſwallow'd, is, in the doſe of
a very few grains, a great heater of
the Blood, and is in ſome Country's,
perhaps not altogether without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
extoll'd by Phyſicians in ſome
kinds of ill condition'd Fevers: but
outwardly it is apply'd to take off
thoſe Redneſſes of the Face, that are
thought to proceed from Heat of
Blood; and 'tis us'd in Ointments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Burns. So Spirit of Wine, that
is ſo hot when drunk, is a very good
remedy to take out the fire, as they
ſpeak, in Burns, eſpecially if the Part
be early moiſtend with it. Bread,
that is counted ſo moderate and well
temper'd and Aliment, when eaten, if
it be chew'd and outwardly apply'd,
hath conſiderable vertues in ſeveral
external affections. And I know an
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:49353:66"/>
ancient and experienc'd Phyſician,
that uſes to purge. Children, that
will not eaſily be brought to ſwallow
Medicines, by applying ſomething to
their Navels, that do's not offend
them by Colour, Smell, or Griping:
And this himſelf more than once con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd
to me, is but an ordinary Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that moſt men, and I among
others, have frequently taken unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd,
which he freely nam'd to me,
but which I have not yet had oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to make Tryal of.</p>
                  <p>That what we have been ſaying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the poſſible efficacy of external
Specificks, may appear the leſs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable,
'twill be fit to take notice of
ſoms obſervations, that comport very
well with our Doctrine. And though
the Inſtances to be brought will not
be all of them of remedies that deſerve
the name of Specificks; yet, beſides
that ſome of them may perhaps have
a Title to it, they will all conduce
to ſhow, that Simples or Druggs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally
apply'd, may have conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
operations againſt Internal Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers
of the Body.</p>

'Twere eaſy for me to mention a
great many external Specificks out of
Phyſicians Books. But I purpoſely
forbear it, becauſe to ſpeak freely, I
ſuſpect that moſt of thoſe Remedies,
though greatly extoll'd, have been
but little examin'd, by the deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of them. And it may ſuffice for
my preſent purpoſe to alledge a few
Inſtances that have been recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to me, either by my own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
or that of ſome Friends.
Only there is one obſervation that is
ſo ſolemnly and expreſly deliver'd by
<hi>Galen,</hi> upon his own knowledge, &amp; ſo
well back'd, by other eminent Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,
that I ſhall let it lead the way.
This memorable ſtory, that is rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by <hi>Galen,</hi> is of a <hi>Piony</hi> Root,
which having been worn as ah <hi>Apen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum</hi>
about a Boy, that had been Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leptick
for divers months, kept him
from his Diſeaſe as long as he wore
it about him; but when by an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
he ceas'd to do ſo, the Diſeaſe
invaded him again, and yet by apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Remedy again, he was the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:49353:67"/>
time freed from it, which <hi>Galen</hi>
obſerving, did for curioſity make the
Root be laid aſide, but finding the
<hi>Fits</hi> to return, he imploy'd it again
with the former ſucceſs.</p>
                  <p>I liv'd in the ſame houſe with a
learned and Judicious Perſon, that
was ſubject to be Paralytick, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
frequently tortur'd by violent
Cramps, was ordinarily and ſpeedily
reliev'd by wearing or handling the
Tooth of a true Hippopotamus or
River-Horſe. And he affirm'd to me,
that upon leaving off, the uſe of it,
for any conſiderable time, either out
of curioſity, or to accommodate ſome
Friend, the Fits would return with
violence upon him. I remember alſo,
that having my ſelf been for ſome
years frequently ſubject to Cramps,
and complaining of it to a Phyſician
that had been a Traveller into cold
Country's, he told me, that he had
brought home with him ſome Rings
made of the true Elks hoof, from a
place where theſe <hi>Animals</hi> are uſually
imploy'd, and that with theſe he had
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:49353:68"/>
cur'd many of the Cramp, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal
preſented me one to make
tryal of, which I the more willingly
accepted, becauſe he confeſs'd to me,
that divers Rings that were ſold for
ſuch as his, and look'd like them,
were either counterfeit or of no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy.
And tho' I did not find that
if the Cramp ſeiz'd me in the calf of
the Leg, the Ring would much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
me, yet when the Fits were but
moderate, and in other Parts, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
the hands, I found my ſelf eaſ'd,
ſo often, and ſo ſoon, that I was at
firſt ſurpriz'd at it, and us'd to have
the remedy laid every night by my
Bed-ſide, to have it ready when occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſhould require. And that which
I thought ſome what ſtrange, was, that
ſeveral times, when the Cramp ſeiz'd
my Foot or my Toes, the Pain was
quickly remov'd, tho' I apply'd the
Ring but to my Finger: which made
me much regret the loſs of it.</p>
                  <p>An eminent Phyſician ſpeaking to
me one day of a Patient of his, that
was ſubject to a nocturnal <hi>Inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nentia
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:49353:68"/>
Urinae,</hi> that was very inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
as well as ſhameful; I told him
of an Empyrical Remedy, which is
mention'd in another Paper, whoſe
ſucceſs I neither would warrant, nor
did altogether diſpair of, and which
at leaſt ſeem'd ſafe, tho' it ſhould not
prove effectual. This was only a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
ſubſtance, (belonging to the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Kingdom) that was to be worn
in a ſine Sarſanet Bag between the
Shift and the Skin, for which a good
while after the Phyſician gave me
great thanks, telling me, that he
was ſurpriz'd at the effect of it, and
that he obſerv'd that when the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
had worn it ſo long, that proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
the vertue began to decay, that
is in my ſenſe, that the <hi>Effluvia</hi> were
almoſt ſpent, the Patient found need
to take a freſh Remedy, to continue
the benefit ſhe had found by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
                  <p>I do not affirm or expect, that the
three fornam'd <hi>Appenſa,</hi> nor the
other Remedy's I am about to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
will always ſucceed. And I
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:49353:69"/>
think, one may aſſign ſome not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable
reaſons of the want of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
in their effects. But for my
preſent argument, it ſuffices that
they do <hi>ſometimes</hi> ſucceed, ſince that
is enough to ſhow it poſſible, that
outward Medicines may operate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
inward Diſtempers.</p>
                  <p>Having one day given a viſit to
one of the skilfulleſt and candideſt
Phyſicians of the Famous Colledge of
<hi>London,</hi> I obſerv'd in his Chamber, a
fine new faſhion'd Clock; and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
taken notice of it to him, as a
thing I had not ſeen there before; he
deſir'd me not to think, he was rich
and vain enough to purchaſe, ſo dear
a rarity; but that it belong'd to a
Courtier whom he nam'd to me, of
whoſe Daughter he told me this ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
This young Lady had a great Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor
in her Neck or Throat, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
apprehended to be of a Scrophu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Nature, made her Father fear it
would oblige him to increaſe her Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
more than his Eſtate could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently
bear. Wherefore at length
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:49353:69"/>
he addreſs'd himſelf to my Relator,
who judging the caſe to be difficult,
and being unwilling to torment the
Lady with a long courſe of Phyſick,
told the Courteour, that if he could
animate her to ſuffer a Remedy he
would propoſe, and would aſſiſt him
to procure it, he hop'd to remove
this Tumour without weakning her,
or putting her to pain. Soon after,
all Parties being agreed, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
conveniency procur'd, the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
was brought into a Room, where
there was yet in Bed the Body of a
man that had dy'd of a lingring Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe.
This mans Hand the Doctor
took, and laid it upon his Patients
Tumour, keeping it there till ſhe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
complain'd or confeſs'd that ſhe
felt the coldneſs of it penetrate to the
innermoſt Parts of her Tumour. This
application was afterwards repeated
more than once, whilſt the Body con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
without ſmelling: And by
this courſe the Tumour was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd,
and the Patient ſo reliev'd,
that her Father, by way of gratitude,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:49353:70"/>
knowing how much the Phyſician
was a lover of curioſities, made him a
preſent of that Clock.</p>
                  <p>The Learned Doctor aſcrib'd this
odd Remedy to <hi>Helmont,</hi> who is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
to be thank'd for having menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd
and recommended a Medicine,
that was unlikely to be good, beſides
that it was not in uſe. But the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of it ſeems to me to have been
for the main very much ancienter
than our Age: ſince there is mention
made of one very like it by ſo Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
an Author as <hi>Pliny;</hi> tho' ſince his
time till <hi>Helmonts</hi> it hath been ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
forgotten or disbeliev'd, ſave
that one Phyſician (<hi>Franciſcus Ulmus</hi>)
who, tho' no ill Obſerver, has not
had the Fortune to be Famous, takes
notice of a caſe very like that of our
Courtiers Daughter, affirming, that
by that one Remedy, after others
had been fruitleſly imploy'd, he
knew a Noble Virgin to have been
perfectly cur'd.</p>
                  <p>I was one Summer, to my great
ſurprize obnoxious to frequent Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:49353:70"/>
at the Noſe; for which I ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
us'd one Remedy, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
another, for the moſt part
with good, but not ſtill with quick
ſucceſs. But falling once unexpected<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
into a Fit, whoſe violence ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
alarm'd me, I reſolv'd to try
an unuſual Remedy: And having ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
obtain'd of my Siſter, in whoſe
houſe this Accident happen'd, ſome
true Moſs of a dead Mans Scull, which
had been ſent her, by a great Perſon,
for a preſent out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> in which
Country, I found it leſs rare and
more eſteem'd than elſewhere: I was
going to imploy it after the uſual
manner, which is to put it up into
the Patients Noſtrils, but before I
did it, I had the curioſity to try,
notwithſtanding the briskneſs of my
Haemorrhagy, whether the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine
would produce its effect by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
only held in my Hand, and
therefore covering a piece of the
Moſs with my Fiſt, that the warmth
might a little actuate the Medicine, I
found, to the wonder of the by-ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:49353:71"/>
that the Blood ſpeedily ſtopp'd,
nor thanks be to God have I been
troubled with a Haemorrhagy for
ſome years from that very time. But
this is far leſs ſtrange than what was
affirm'd to have happen'd to one of
the Eminenteſt Members of the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Society. This Learned Gentleman,
who was of a very Sanguine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion,
found himſelf much affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the uſe of the Moſs of a human
Scull, [pieces of which I have ſeen
ſticking to the Roots of the Vegetable,
when it was genuine] which had ſo
ſtrange an operation upon him, that
ſometimes when he was let Blood, if
for curioſities ſake he held a quantity
of this Moſs in his Hand, the Efflux
of the Blood would ceaſe, till he laid
it by again; which was not only
ſolemnly averr'd to me by himſelf,
but confirm'd to me by his Ingenious
Phyſician, with both whom I had a
particular Acquaintance; which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
I ſhould have thought ſcarce
credible, unleſs imagination, a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
very ſtrong in that Gentleman,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:49353:71"/>
contributed to the ſtrange effect of
the Remedy.</p>
                  <p>The hitherto mention'd External
Specificks are afforded by Vegetables
and Animals, which being Bodies of
a ſlighter Texture, may be ſuppos'd
to have their Parts more Effluviable:
And therefore I ſhall now add two or
three examples afforded by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Kingdom, which conſiſting of
Bodies that never were living, and
which are for the moſt part very cloſe
and compact, are generally thought
to have their Parts indiſpos'd to
emit <hi>Effluvia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I knew a Perſon of great Learning,
and by Profeſſion a Phyſician, who
enjoy'd a Health good enough, ſave
that uſually after a few hours ſleep,
he wak'd in the Night with great
Terrors, follow'd for a long time
with ſuch violent Palpitations of the
Heart, as were very troubleſom, and
ſometimes frightful to him. To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
this Diſtemper, he try'd all
that his Art ſuggeſted to him, but
without ſucceſs, Whereupon he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:49353:72"/>
of it to ſeveral of his Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
and mentioning it one day
among a Company of Merchants,
whereof ſome frequented very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
Country's; one of them told
him, he would eaſily relieve him, by
a Remedy that had been found effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
both upon himſelf and others.
This he told him was, to take divers
flat and ſmooth Cornelian Stones,
ſuch as they bring from the <hi>Eaſt-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi>
to cut Rings out of, and to ſow
eight or ten of them to a piece of Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let
or Flannel, to be hung about his
Neck, ſo as that the Stones may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
touch the Skin over againſt
the Heart, and the Mouth of the
Stomach. This Remedy the Phyſician
procur'd, and in no long time, found
the great benefit of it, inſomuch that
he thought he might now ſecurely
leave off the uſe of theſe Stones,
which he did once or twice out of
curioſity, as well as for his eaſe, but
finding the Diſtemper to return each
time, within very few Weeks after
he had laid aſide his Remedy, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:49353:72"/>
to keep it always on, as he had
long ſucceſsfully done, when he told
me the ſtory. And to convince me,
preſented me with ſome of the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelians,
that he had, for fear of
wanting them, procur'd in greater
number than he needed at once. But
ſince I have not yet had occaſion to
make tryal of them, I ſhall not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that the Remedy will always
ſucceed, but only (which is enough
for my preſent purpoſe) that 'tis at
leaſt poſſible that ſuch an External
Remedy may be very effectual.</p>
                  <p>I afterwards thought (which I
here note, to add to the probability
of what I have been relating) that
pos;ſibly thoſe that firſt made uſe of
the foremention'd Remedy, may have
had a hint from what <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith of
the Jaſper: Which Stone we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
to be various in point of Colour,
and I have ſeen in the green mixtures
of Red almoſt as deep as that of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelians.
Of this Stone <hi>Galen</hi> relates
that ſome made Rings, in which
were graven a Dragon having Beams
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:49353:73"/>
iſſuing from him, and commended it
as very friendly to the Stomach, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
apply'd to the Mouth of it. And
tho' he omitted (and found he ſafely
might do it) the Sculpture, he yet
approves the Stones upon his own
frequent experience, applying them
almoſt as our Merchant
did;<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Untzerus,</hi> to whom I

ſelf to mention in this

down, the firſt, that the Merchant
affirm'd to our Author, that by wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this Stone for ſome days, the
calculous matter was ſo powerfully
proſcrib'd, that a multitude of ſmall
grains of Sand were expell'd, even
at the corners of his Eyes. The like
effect, to which he often obſerv'd of
that Remedy in divers other Perſons.
The ſecond, that by wearing the ſame
Stone, his Wife who was troubled
with a great Catarrh found it conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably
Cathartick, inſomuch that
the firſt day ſhe was thereby purg'd
fourteen or fifteen times, the next
nine or ten times, and afterwards
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:49353:74"/>
had her Body kept very open. And
he adds, that he found alſo this Stone
to operate like a Purge, tho' not ſo
ſtrongly upon himſelf.</p>
                  <p>But enough, if not more than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
of the vertues of <hi>Periapta</hi> and

things I treat of ſuggeſted to me, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the <hi>Principal</hi> ways, by which I
conceive Specifick Medicines may
cure Diſeaſes, or at leaſt much leſſen
them. I ſaid the <hi>Principal ways,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I am far from denying, that
there may be many <hi>others,</hi> that muſt
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:49353:75"/>
not here be mention'd, leſt I ſhould
too much tranſgreſs the limits that
become an Epiſtle; eſpecially, this
being already far more prolix than I
at firſt intended; though I purpoſely
omitted the Authorities and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of divers Phyſicians and Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts,
that maintain that there are
Specifick Medicines, bccauſe they
proceed upon Principles, (ſuch as
ſubſtantial Forms, real Qualities, <hi>Ideas,</hi>

could not fairly employ, becauſe I
do not admit them. But though I
forbore to lengthen my diſcourſe, by
improper, and I hope needleſs Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions
out of others; yet 'tis long
enough to prompt me, now at the
cloſe of it to remind you of two or
three things that I declar'd at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</p>
                  <p>As <hi>Firſt,</hi> that I did not pretend
that a Specifick Medicine, or Nature
by a Specifick, does commonly effect
the cure by <hi>one</hi> of the particular ways
that I propos'd, excluſively to the
reſt; ſince I rather think that often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:49353:75"/>
two, and ſometimes more, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur
to the effect. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that I
propos'd to my ſelf, to explicate the
ways of working of Specifick Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
only in general. And <hi>Thirdly,</hi>
that I did not aſſert, that the ways
I pitch'd upon were the true and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine
ones, by which the Medicine
<hi>does</hi> act, but only propounded them,
as ways by which it <hi>may</hi> act: So that
without being Dogmatical, I offer
you my Explications, but as <hi>poſſible,</hi>
and perhaps not <hi>improbable;</hi> and that
may ſuffice for the occaſion and ſcope
of this Letter; in which I preſume,
you remember I aim'd but at ſhewing
you, that the operations of Specifick
Medicines <hi>are not irreconcileable</hi> to the
Principles of the Corpuſcular Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy:
Which I hope you will with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
reluctancy grant, if, by my
good Fortune, the difficulties that
made you heſitate, ſeem to you to

                  <p>Since <hi>SPECIFICK MEDICINES,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
that name, muſt be very
Efficacious; and yet are for the moſt
part either ſimple or very little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,
what has been ſaid about
them in the foregoing Tract con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Specificks may afford me a
not improper riſe to invite you, and
thereby others of your Profeſſion, on
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:49353:78"/>
whom your Authority and Example
may juſtly have much influence, to
ſeek after and Imploy, more than
they are wont to do, ſuch Remedies
as are either ſimple, or, when there
happens a neceſſity to compound,
are made up of no more Ingredients
than are abſolutely requiſite to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
the Indications, and the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
Scope.</p>
                  <p>This ſort of ſimple, or but lightly
Compounded, Remedies, I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
to prefer before thoſe pompous
compoſitions, wherein men ſeem to
have hop'd to ſurmount diſeaſes by
the multitude of the Ingredients,
upon the following Reaſons. In all
which I deſire the advantages a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd
to ſimple Medicines, above
others may be underſtood, not in an
abſolute and indefinite ſenſe, but, as
they ſpeak <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> which I
here give you notice of once for
all</p>
                  <p>And the firſt advantage that I ſhall
mention, is, That it is much leſs
difficult, to foreſee the operation of a
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:49353:78"/>
ſimple, than of a very compounded
Medicine. So that Phyſicians may
proceed more ſecurely, in imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the former than the latter ſort
of Remedies. And indeed, if I do
not greatly miſtake, we often pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
too much of our own Abilities
when we believe that we know be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hand, what the Qualities and
Effects of a Mixture of many Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients
of differing Natures, will be:
Since many Bodies, by Compoſition,
and the change of Texture conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
thereupon, do receive great
and unexpected Alterations in their
Qualities. Several manifeſt Inſtances
of this Truth may be met with in
our Hiſtory of Colours; In divers
of whoſe Experiments, the Colour
produc'd upon the Mixture of Bodies,
is quite different from that of any
of the Ingredients. As, when a blew
Solution of Copper made in Spirit
of Urine, does with Syrup of Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets,
which is alſo blew, produce a
fair Green. And even ſince I began
to write this Section, a Tryal pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:49353:79"/>
made has afforded me a new
Inſtance of the ſame import.</p>
                  <p>For having put together ſome
Tincture of Iron, made with good
Spirit of Vinegar, and a Volatile
Tincture of Sulphur, (which I elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
ſhow how to make) from a
Confuſion of theſe two very red Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors,
there emerg'd in a trice, a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
dark and almoſt Inky Mixture,
that retain'd nothing at all of Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p>The like notable changes I have
ſeveral times produc'd by Mixtures,
in divers other Qualities of Bodies
than their Colours, as in their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours,
Taſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And why ſuch
Alterations may not be alſo effected
by Composition, in ſome of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal
Qualities of Bodies, I do not
yet ſee. Quick-ſilver it ſelf inwardly
taken, does uſually cauſe, either no
manifeſt evacuation, or one that is
made at the mouth: But if it be
diſſolv'd in Spirit of Niter, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitated
with Sea-Salt, this white
Precipitate being edulcorated, if it
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:49353:79"/>
be warily given in a juſt Doſe,
doth (as far as I can yet learn) ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
fail of working, and yet ſeldo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
work by Salivation, but by
Siege. On the other ſide Glaſs of
Antimony (made <hi>per ſe</hi>) whereof a
very few Grains given in ſubſtance,
are wont to work violently upwards
and downwards, being diſſolved in
Spirit of Vinegar, (which is not
eaſily and quickly done) will not
uſually either Vomit or Purge, <hi>tho</hi>
the <hi>Menſtruum</hi> be drawn from it, and
tho it be given in a larger Doſe,
than that of the uncompounded Glaſs.</p>
                  <p>And tho if Crude Antimony be
flux'd with Niter and Tartar, as in
the ordinary way of making <hi>Crocus
Metallorum,</hi> there is produc'd, as
is vulgarly known, a Medicine ſo
Emetick and Cathartick, that an
Ounce or leſs of the Wine wherein
it has been infus'd, without ſenſibly
looſing its weight, is wont to work
ſtrongly enough both upwards and
downwards: <hi>Yet</hi> I have known ſome
that would without ſcruple, take
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:49353:80"/>
ſeveral Grains of Crude Antimony
in ſubſtance, and one particularly
that continued the uſe of it long,
without being vomited or purg'd by
it. And Tryals purpoſely made have
inform'd me, that if, inſtead of
Salt-Peter and Tartar, Antimony be
prepar'd with well dry'd Sea-Salt,
and a little Salt of Tartar, tho both,
theſe amount not to above half the
weight of the Niter and Tartar vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly
us'd, yet the Antimony well
flux'd with theſe (for about an hour)
is thereby ſo alter'd and corrected,
that it affords an uſeful Medicine, of
which one may give from 12 or 15
Grains to half a Dram, or more in
ſubſtance, without ordinarily work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
either by Vomit or Siege, but
uſually by Sweat, and ſometimes by
Urine. Whence we may gather,
that Antimony may be either made
a more dangerous, or a more friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Medicine, than of it ſelf it is, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Ingredients 'tis aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
with, tho theſe be in themſelves
Innocent, and perhaps of kin to one
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:49353:80"/>
another. And even Chymiſts, as
well as other preſcribers of Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
may be found, tho leſs fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
to add to a Simple, ſuch
things as rather deprave, than im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
it. As one of their great Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons
(a happy Practitioner) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains,
that Flower of Sulphur, by
being ſublim'd, (as by many it is)
from Calcin'd Vitriol, and one or
two other things, under pretence of
purifying and ſubtillizing it, does
really acquire a hurtful Corroſiveneſs.
And if I had here the Leizure, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
enough might be brought to
ſhow, that Chymiſts ſometimes miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takingly
produce by their additions
to a Medicine, other Qualities, if
not alſo worſe, than they deſign'd or
expected.</p>

                  <head>§ II.</head>
                  <p>ANother Advantage of Simpler
Medicines, is, that <hi>caeteris pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus,</hi>
they are more ſafe than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
ones, eſpecially if the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients
be valetudinary perſons. 'Tis
too much the cuſtom, both of many
Herbariſts, and ſeveral other Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
on the <hi>Materia Medica,</hi> to give
us rather <hi>Encomiums</hi> than impartial
Accounts of the Simples they treat
of; enumerating and magnifying all
the vertues they have, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
more than they have, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
taking notice of their ill Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
upon whoſe account neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
they may be inconvenient, if
not hurtful and dangerous, to ſome
Conſtitutions, and in divers Caſes.
We know that divers Perfumes, as
Musk and Amber, tho very grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and refreſhing to moſt Mens Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
are yet very hurtful to many
Women, and eſpecially to thoſe that
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:49353:81"/>
are Hyſterical. And I have known
the ſmell of Musk very much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affect
an eminent Perſon, though
otherwiſe of a robuſt Conſtitution.
I have alſo known ſeveral Perſons,
not all of them of the ſame Sex,
very much offended by the ſmell of
Roſes, which yet is very moderate, as
well as to moſt Perſons, whether Men
or Women, very grateful. I know a
very great Perſon to whom Honey,
whether inwardly taken, or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
apply'd, is almoſt as hurtful
as Poyſon, having ſeveral times pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
ſtrange and frightful Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms,
even when the Patient knew
not that any Honey had been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd,
and conſequently could not
be thus oddly diſtemper'd by the
force of Imagination. I think I have
elſewhere taken notice of the harm,
that both I and others, ſubject to
Diſeaſes of the Eyes, have receiv'd,
even by the moderate uſe of Parſley.</p>
                  <p>On this occaſion I ſhall add what
occurr'd to me long after I had dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
what I ſaid of Parſley, that
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:49353:82"/>
Worm-wood, tho for many uſes, an
excellent Plant, has been found by
many ſo apt to diſaffect the head,
and ſo unfriendly to the Eyes, that
I have for ſome years forborn it my
ſelf for fear of the head-ach, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warn'd
others of it that are ſubject
to weak Eyes. But I know a very
Learned Man, whoſe Elegant Pen
has made him deſervedly be taken
notice of by many, who, tho he have
naturally very good Eyes, found
upon an Obſtinate Tryal, that his
Curioſity ſeduced him to make of
the plentiful uſe of Worm-wood-Wine
and Beer, that within leſs
than three Weeks, his ſight was by
degrees brought to be ſo weak, that
he could not read a Gazet without
Spectacles; but by totally leaving off
Worm-wood, he quickly recover'd
the vigour of his ſight, without the
uſe of any of the helps that his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
which is Phyſick, would
have plentifully ſuggeſted to him.
this Relation I had from himſelf
ſoon after the thing happen'd, on
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:49353:82"/>
occaſion of what I told him about
Parſley, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And to ſpeak more generally, I
doubt not, but if Men were not ſo
prepoſſeſs'd with the Praiſes that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
give to Simples, that they
overlook the Inconveniencies they
may on divers occaſions produce,
we ſhould find in many Medicines
bad Qualities, that are not yet
taken notice of. And I have more
than once hit, but too well, in
the Prognoſticks I made of the
Hurt, ſome Patients would receive
by the uſe of applauded Medicines,
prescribe them, even by conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and Learn'd Men, when upon
their Authority my warnings were
neglected, and the uſe of the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines
unhappily perſiſted in. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
I once ſaw in the hands of
a learned and curious Traveller into
the Eaſtern Parts of the World, an
Arabick Manuſcript about the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria
Mèdica,</hi> which made me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret
the loſs of the moſt part
of the little skill I once had in
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:49353:83"/>
that Language. For beſides that
it was written in a delicate
hand, and the Letters in fit Places,
curiouſly adorn'd with Gold and
Azure, the Method ſeem'd to be more
accurate than any thing I had ſeen
on that Subject. And that which
pleas'd me not a little, was, that
the Author had been ſo wary, that
after the columns wherein he taught,
beſides many other things, the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
Doſes, &amp;c. of every Drug he
treated of, he had a diſtinct column
for the bad Qualities of it, and the
conſtitutions and Diſeaſes wherein
the uſe of it may be dangerous or
inconvenient. I think it therefore
not unreaſonable to ſuſpect, that,
where a great many Ingredients are
blended into one Medicine, one or
other of them may have other ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
beſides that deſign'd by the
Phyſician; it may awaken ſome
ſleeping Ferment, and, if not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
a new Diſtemper, may excite
and actuate ſome other hoſtile mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that lay quiet in the Body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:49353:83"/>
and perhaps would have been
little by little ſubdu'd by nature, if
it had not been unſeaſonably rous'd
and aſſiſted by ſome Ingredient,
that perhaps was needleſly put into
the Medicine. I have had ſo many
unwelcome Proofs of this in my ſelf,
that it engages me to be the more
careful to caution others againſt the
like Inconvenience.</p>

                  <head>§ III</head>
                  <p>ANother benefit accrewing from
the uſe of Simpler Medecines,
is, that thereby the Patient may,
without burdening his Stomach, or
nauſeating the Remedy, take a larger
Doſe of the Medicine, or of that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient
of it wherein the vertue
chiefly reſides. For, whereas Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians
are oblig'd to ſtint themſelves
in the Doſe of the Medicine, for fear
of diſguſting the Patient, or oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
his Stomach; when there are
many things heap'd together in a
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:49353:84"/>
moderate Doſe of one compounded
Medicine, theſe Ingredients that are
either ſuperfluous, or at leaſt are
leſs efficacious, muſt neceſſarily take
up a conſiderable part of that deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
Doſe, and conſequently leave
much the leſs of the more appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
or uſeful Ingredients.</p>
                  <p>To ſay, that all the Ingredients
that are thruſt into a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
are proper and conduce un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the ſame purpoſe, I doubt is not
always true. And however is not
a ſufficient Anſwer, ſince it does not
avoid the Inconvenience I have been
objecting.</p>
                  <p>If a Baker, being to make the
beſt Bread he can, eſpecially for a
Perſon of a weak Stomach, ſhould
to Wheaten Flower add the Meal of
Rye, of Barley, and of Oats; tho'
all theſe Ingredients be good and
nouriſhing, and each of them is by
many us'd to make Bread, yet none
will take him for a skilful Baker,
and few would prefer this compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Bread, to that more ſimple one
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:49353:84"/>
made of Wheat alone. And ſo to
make good Gun-Powder a skilful
man would not to Salt-Peter, Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,
and Charcole add Wax, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin,
and Camphire, though theſe be
very inflammable Subſtances as well
as Sulphur. And thus if one would
make an <hi>Aqua Vitae,</hi> whereof but one
ſmall cup were to be given for the
quick recovery of fainting Perſons,
he would not with Spirit of Wine,
or good Brandy, mix Mead or Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and ſtrong Bear or Ale, tho'
each of theſe be it ſelf a Spirituous
Liquor.</p>
                  <p>Gum Arabick (whereof I prefer that
which is tranſparent and colourleſs)
is preſcrib'd in ſeveral compoſitions,
as a Drug proper to mitigate the
ſharpneſs of Urine. But by the
quantity of the other Ingredients that
'tis mix'd and clog'd with, no more
than a ſmall proportion of it uſually
comes to be given in one Doſe. But
when I have had the Curioſity,
leaving out all the other things, to
give about a dram, or perhaps more
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:49353:85"/>
of it at one time, reduc'd by long
Pounding (for the beſt is very tough)
to fine Powder, in a large draught of
ſmall Ale or Beer, or ſome other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
Vehicle, I found very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Effects of it. And I remember
that a Gentleman of great note, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to bid me farewel, becauſe of a long
and troublesome Journey, he was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
to Mineral Waters, which he
intended to drink for many weeks,
to eaſe him of a very painful ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Urine; I that knew it was
not venereal nor from the Stone of
the Bladder (for when thoſe Cauſes of
the Strangury, the Medicine is not
near ſo powerful) I deſir'd him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he went to make uſe of this
Powder, once, or (if there ſhould be
need) twice a day. Which when
he had done, it ſo reliev'd, him that he
thought himſelf quite cur'd, and
forbore his intended Journey not
only that Year, but the next. For
the Chin-cough, as they call it in
Children, whoſe odd Symptoms do
uſually fright the Parents and Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:49353:85"/>
and oftentimes fruſtrate the
Endeavours of Phyſicians, skilful in
curing other Coughs, I have not
known any magiſterial compoſition
ſo effectual, as the ſimple Juice of
Pulegium (by many call'd Penny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>royal)
ſweetn'd a little with SugarCandy,
and given long enough from
time to time, in the quantity of a
Childs Spoonful. (This Plant may
be alſo made to afford a Syrup, that
will keep, and is uſeful in Coughs,
but which I doubt, is not ſo effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
as the Simple Juice.) There
are many and obvious experiments
of the great efficay of ſo ſimple a
Remedy as Aſſes Milk; (which yet
in ſome caſes, I think inferiour to
Goats Milk,) if it be given in a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
quantity, and for a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
time, there are alſo many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of dangerous and ſtubborn
Diſeaſes, that have been cur'd even
by Common Cows Milk, when it
has been very plentifully taken, and
for a long continuance of time, and
perhaps it is no leſs remarkable, that
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:49353:86"/>
in a far leſs time now and then, not
extending to very many daies,
Fluxes, as <hi>Dyarrhaeas,</hi> and tho more
ſeldom even Dyſenterical ones, are
happily and eaſily cur'd, as I have
ſometimes known by the bare uſe
of ſo ſlight a Remedy as Milk, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
whilſt it is gently boyling, an
equal quantity of fair Water is little
by little put, till at laſt there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
but as much Liquor as the
Milk alone amounted to at firſt.
This ſimple Alimentous Medicine
being liberally taken (for it ſhould
be us'd inſtead of all other Drinks
whilſt the Diſeaſe continues) has
been very frequently found to cure
Fluxes, not all of one ſort, in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
it ſelf, where that kind of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe
is Endemical. And, <hi>tho</hi> I have
formerly in another Paper recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
the uſe of <hi>Paronychia foliis
rutaceis,</hi> againſt that ſad and ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
Diſeaſe the <hi>Kings-Evil, yet</hi> I
preſume you will allow me, by the
mention of a Tryal that was ſince
made with it, to give a notable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:49353:86"/>
of the Utility of giving
an Alterative Simple, if need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
in conſiderable quantity. A
Phyſician that I knew, was ſent for
to a Scrophulous Patient, in whoſe
Throat there was a Tumour, ſo big
and ſo unluckily ſeated, that much
compreſſing the <hi>Aſophagus</hi> it rendr'd
Deglutition exceeding difficult: So
that being likewiſe ſo hard and ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born,
that tho the Phyſician was
alſo a famous Chyrurgion, he could
neither diſcuſs it, or bring it to
Suppuration; The Patient, tho rich,
was in imminent danger of being
ſtarv'd. In this Strait the Phyſician
remembring the Character I had
given of <hi>Paronychia,</hi> or <hi>Whitlom</hi>
Graſs, ſent about the Country to
to get all that could be procur'd: And
at firſt gave a little of it in form of
Infuſion, in ſuch liquid Aliments as
the Patient was able, with much
ado, little by little to get down.
And having by this means, after
ſome time, made the Deglutition
leſs difficult, he gave the Remedy
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:49353:87"/>
more and more plentifully, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bue
the whole maſs of Blood and
Juices of the Body with the Vertue
of the Herb, whereby the Tumour
was at length reſolv'd, and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
ſecur'd, ſo much to the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians
Reputation as well as Profit,
that, as he ſaid, he thought Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
oblig'd him to give me a Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantial
Account of his Succeſs;
as he very civilly did in a long Letter
whereof I have given you the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
                  <p>And tho I might here entertain
you with the Vertues of ſome other
Simple Remedies, plentifully given,
yet for brevity ſake I ſhall rather ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
in general, That I doubt not
but ſeveral Simple Medicines (I
ſpeak of alterative not evacuating
ones, would be found far more effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
than they are commonly
thought, if they were given in a
much larger Doſe, and continued
for a competent time. And proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
ſo many Phyſicians (eſpecially
of the Old School,) would not be ſo
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:49353:87"/>
forward to reject either Specifick or
ſimple Remedies, as having found
ſome of them not to anſwer Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation;
if they would allow them
as fair a Tryal, as they give to their
own Preſcriptions, ſuch as the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lybeats
of the Shops, the Spaw, or
Tunbridge Waters, the Decoctions
of <hi>Guajacum,</hi> &amp;c. which they often
give with divers intermediate helps
for a Month or ſix Weeks, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
for two Months together,
without expecting that in a few
weeks, much leſs in a very few
days, they ſhould perform the
cure.</p>

recommend the uſe of Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
Medicines, is, That <hi>caeteris
paribus</hi> they are more eaſy to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd
then Compounded ones. This
Aſſertion needs little proof. And
where ſeveral Simples are requir'd,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:49353:88"/>
one or more of them may oftentimes
be difficult to be got; and all of them
will ſtill be troubleſome to be fetcht,
and to be made up into a Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
How uſeful the knowledge of
Parable Remedys may be, I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd
to ſhow in a diſtinct Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per;
and therefore ſhall not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of it here, but only add this
one Obſervation, that ſome Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines
are ſo parable, that without
reſorting for them to Apothecarys
ſhops (which are not every where
at hand, nor always furniſhed with
them) we may find them in thoſe
of other Trades-men. Thus among
Maſons and Bricklayers we moſt
commonly meet with Quicklime;
whoſe bare Infuſion in common Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
[about a pound of the former,
as 'tis more or leſs ſtrong, to about
three or four Quarts of the latter,]
is of it ſelf a good Medicine in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Caſes, and as Experience has
perſwaded me, may be made the
<hi>Baſis</hi> of ſeveral good Remedys, both
Inward and Outward. Among the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:49353:88"/>
latter of which may be reckon'd an
Oyntment, that I uſually kept by me
for Burns, and made only by beating
up ſtrong Lime-Water with as much
good Lin-ſeed Oyl, as could be
made throughly to incorporate with
it into a very white Unguent.</p>
                  <p>And I ſhall add concerning Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeed
Oyl, (ſince I have mention'd
it) which is to be had in the ſhops
of Varniſhers and Painters; that
of it ſelf, being exhibited in a
large Doſe, as of ſeveral Ounces
at a time, I have known it anſwer
the Commendations given it by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
Phyſicians, for breaking of
Pleuritical <hi>Empyemas</hi> Simple Oyl of
Turpentine alſo, that may be uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
had in the ſhops of the ſame
Trades-men, is in reality a noble
Remedy in divers Affections, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Inward, in which Chymiſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
it, but Outward too. And
I have had great thanks, both from
Phyſicians and Chyrugeons, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending
the uſe of it to them in
Wounds, and particularly, where
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:49353:89"/>
one would expect little from it in
the ſtanching of Blood, if it be ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably
apply'd very hot to the
wounded Parts, where it alſo much
promotes a good Digeſtion. And I
am confirm'd in the good Opinion
I have long had of this Oyl, by the
Information that's given me, That
very experienced Chyrurgeon has
lately been ſo charitable, as to publiſh
a little Book, conſiderable for the
uſeful Obſervations it contains, of
notable Cures done by him in Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgical
Caſes, chiefly with Oyl of
Turpentine. And I ſhall add, that
a Chyrurgeon to a great Monarch,
and one of the skilfulleſt men I ever
met with of his Profeſſion, confeſs'd
to me, that in an admir'd Cure that
he had then lately done of a deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Gangrene, in an eminent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
very aged and almoſt bed-rid,
the Medicine he aſcrib'd moſt to,
was the Oyl we were ſpeaking of.
And, becauſe both he and others
make much and good uſe of Spirit
of Wine in Gangrens, which yet is
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:49353:89"/>
thought to be unmingleable with
Oyl of Turpentine, becauſe if it be
ſhaken with it, it will quickly ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
again from it; I thought it
might do Practitioners ſome ſervice,
to make for them a Mixture of Oyl
of Turpentine and Spirit of Wine,
that might probably be more pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trant
than the former, and leſs fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
than the latter, which of it
ſelf does not ſtay long enough upon
the Parts 'tis apply'd to. Which
Mixture I eaſily made, by digeſting
for a while, and ſtrongly ſhaking
from time to time, about equal
parts by gueſs of good Oyl of Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine
and throughly dephlegm'd
Spirit of Wine, till this Liquor, by
imbibing or diſſolving great ſtore
of the Oleaginous Parts, have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
a Yellow Colour, for which
reaſon I call it the Tincture of Oyl
of Turpentine.</p>
                  <p>And, ſince my ſubject has led me
into the ſhops of Colour-ſellers, I
will before I leave them, take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of one Simple that is wont to
be found there, which if it were
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:49353:90"/>
not very offenſive to the Taſt, and
ſomewhat diſagreeable to the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
would be perhaps preferable
for its Antinephritick Vertue, to
the moſt pompous Compoſitions
of the ſhops, and ſome of the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
<hi>Arcana</hi> of the (vulgar) Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts.
I procur'd it, not without
ſome difficulty, from a Spagyriſt,
very well vers'd in the School of
<hi>Paracelſus</hi> and <hi>Helmont;</hi> who, tho
a ſparing Commender of Remedyes,
extoll'd this as the beſt he had ever
met with, to cure the Stone where
it was not too big to paſs, and to
prevent the increaſe of it where it
was. I have known it us'd in
Clyſters, with very good ſucceſs in
a Fit of that Diſeaſe. But Inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
I had no occaſion to try it but
upon my ſelf. And judging it inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
enough, (as indeed I found
it rather Anodyne than Driving,
I took it now and then, mix'd with
Oyl of ſweet Almonds chiefly to allay
the Taſt, for otherwiſe I had long
found that alone, inſufficient) as a
Preſervative from Grave. And,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:49353:90"/>
thanks be to God, I divers times
thought it more manifeſtly effectual
to that purpoſe, by leſſening either
the bulk of the Grains, or the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of the Sand, or both, than any
of the Remedyes I had taken for
prevention in ſeveral years before.
And yet I ſcarce took a quarter of
the Doſe, preſcrib'd by the Spagyriſt
that communicated the Medicine
to me; which in ſhort is (for I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
you would gladly know it)
to take from time to time, by it ſelf
or in ſome convenient Vehicle two
or three ounces of the expreſs'd Oyl
of Walnuts, which, if the great
ſtaleneſs of it he requires be neceſſary,
(which I mean to examine by Tryals)
is ſcarce to be had but at the ſhops
of Artificers, becauſe he would have
it at leaſt a year old, and judg'd it
the elder the better.</p>
                  <p>Before I quite leave the Shops of
Trades-Men, I ſhall take notice of
one Medicine more, that ſeems to
have been firſt lodg'd there, and from
thence tranſlated into the Shops of
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:49353:91"/>
Apothecaries. The Medicine I mean
is Caſtile or elſe Venetian Soap, (for
either is often imploy'd in ſtead of
the other) which being a Body a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding
with Alcaliſite Salts and
Oleaginous Parts well combin'd, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
me to make ſome Experiments
with it, as a Subſtance that may be
applicable to good uſes, not only
Mechanical but Medical. Of ſome of
tho former ſort I elſewhere make
mention. And as to its Medicinal
vertues, I take notice in another Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of its Efficacy againſt the Jaundiſe;
for which I have ſince been inform'd,
that, as nauſeous a Medicine as it is,
'tis in great requeſt among ſome
Skilful Men in <hi>Holland.</hi> And ſome
freſh, but not ſufficient, experience
has recommended it to me againſt
the Stone. But that vertue of it
which I as yet moſt prize it for, and
now intend to communicate to you,
you will beſt gather from the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Story. Having had ſome deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
with a conſiderable Merchant
(of <hi>Cork,</hi> in <hi>Ireland</hi>) he ſadly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:49353:91"/>
to me, that he was afflicted
with a neceſſity of making Bloody
Water to that degree, that he fear'd
he muſt ſoon quit his Profeſſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
already unable to ride about his
buſineſs, and ſcarce able to walk a
foot the length of a Street, without
ſtooping to make red Water. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
I told him I had a Medicine,
that, if he could digeſt the unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs
of it, would, I thought, by
the bleſſing of God, do good even in
his caſe. And it was only to ſcrape
with a Knife as much Caſtile Soap
into a Spoon, as it would convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hold without being preſs'd, <hi>i. e.</hi> neat
a dram, and having fill'd the vacant
part with ſmall Ale, or ſome other,
convenient Drink, to facilicate the
ſwallowing ſo nauſeous a Remedy,
waſh it down with a ſomewhat large
Draught of the ſame Liquor, or other
fit Vehicle, repeating the Doſe twice
or thrice a day, if need requir'd.
The manifeſt relief he found by this
ſeemingly deſpicable Medicine, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
(if I miſremember not) two or
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:49353:92"/>
three days, invited him to continue
the uſe of it a while longer, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
to return me ſolemn thanks
for it; declaring that now for four
years together he had liv'd quite
free from his Diſtemper, without
ſcrupling to ride Journeys on Horſe
Back, as his occasions requir'd. To
which he added, that in regard I had
not confin'd him to ſecreſy, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd
I intended the Medicine ſhould
do as much good as might be, and
therefore ſcrupled not to give it to
ſeveral others, who were likewiſe
happily cur'd by the uſe of the ſame
Remedy. Which Account was
therefore the more welcom to me,
becauſe in the place were I liv'd, I
had not opportunity to make fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Tryals of its Efficacy. And on
this occaſion I ſhall beg leave to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſe
you once for all, in reference
to the Remedies deliver'd by me,
either in this Paper or in my other
Writings; That I am as ſenſible as
another of the almoſt inſuperable
Difficulty, of making any certain
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:49353:92"/>
Experiments in Phyſick; and that,
having of a long time (for Reaſons
given in due place) ſtudiouſly, tho
not unreſervedly, declin'd the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of giving (and conſequently
of reiterating) Medicines: I juſtly
deſire that none of my Readers, and
eſpecially that Dr. F. would too
much rely upon them, till they
have been more competently try'd,
than perhaps ſome of them, for
want of opportunity, have been;
and adminiſtred to Patients of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
Complexions, Ages, and
other Circumſtances.</p>
                  <p>You may find other Inſtances of
the vertue of Parable, and ſome
of them unpromiſing Medicines, in
one of my Eſſay's <hi>Of the Uſefulneſs
of Experimental Philoſophy;</hi> to which
I the leſs ſcruple to refer you,
becauſe I do not remember what I
have there written many years ago, ſo
perfectly, as not to fear that I might
by enlarging this Section, put you to
the trouble of reading ſome things
here that you have met with there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:49353:93"/>
And yet I am ſomewhat
incouraged both to mention to you
that Book, and to preſent you
ſome other Receipts in this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per;
becauſe it has pleas'd God
ſo far to bleſs divers of the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines
I have there recommended,
or do there mention, that they
have been proſperous to many
Patients, and not altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſeful
to ſome noted Phyſicians;
and have procur'd me from both
more thanks than I pretended
to; beſides inviting Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to further Communications.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="5" type="section">
                  <head>§. V.</head>
                  <p>THE laſt thing in order, but not
in importance, that induces
me to wiſh, that Phyſicians would
imploy Simpler Medicines as much
as conveniently may be, is, that 'tis
one of the likelieſt ways, (and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
little leſs than abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary)
to promote the Practical
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:49353:93"/>
knowledge of the <hi>Materia Medica.</hi>
For, whilſt in one Receipt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of Ingredients are mingl'd, if
not confounded, 'tis almoſt impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to know with any certainty,
to which of the Simples the good or
bad Effect of the Remedy is to be
attributed, or whether it be not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
by a Power, reſulting from the
particular Quality's of all of them,
united into one Temperament, and by
its means acting conjointly, and, as
the School men ſpeak <hi>per modum unius.</hi>
So that by this way of heaping up
or blending Simples into one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
Remedy, I ſee not how in
many Ages Men will be able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the true qualities good and
bad, of the particular Bodies, that
are compris'd under the name of the
<hi>Materia Medica;</hi> whereas, when a
Phyſician often imploys a Simple, and
obſerves the Effect of it, the relief
or prejudice of the Patient, may
very probably, if not with medical
certainty, be aſcrib'd to the good
or bad Qualities of that particular
Remedy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="170" facs="tcp:49353:94"/>
And this difficulty of diſcerning,
what Ingredient it is of a very
compounded Medicine, that helps
or hurts the Patient, is much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd
to thoſe that affect to write
Bills, wherein ſomething is preſcrib'd,
which tho, becauſe it goes under
one name, paſſes but for one Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient,
is yet a very compounded
Body; as is evident, in thoſe many
pompous Receipts wherein Treacle,
(that alone conſiſts of above ſixty
ſeveral Simples) Methridate, and
divers other famous ancient compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions;
that each of them conſiſts
of good ſtore of Ingredients. I had
once thoughts of drawing up a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of the Difficulties of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal
Art; and had divers mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials
by me for ſuch a work, which
afterwards I laid aſide, for fear it
ſhould be miſimploy'd to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
of worthy Phyſicians. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the difficulties that occurr'd to
me, I ſhall on this occaſion mention
one, which was; That 'tis a harder
work than moſt men think, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:49353:94"/>
fully the nature, or the good
and bad quality's in reference to
Phyſick, of this or that ſingle Plant,
or other Simple, that has a place in
the <hi>Materia Medica.</hi> For beſides
the great difference that there may
be in Plants of the ſame denomia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
according to the Climate,
Soil, the goodneſs of the ſeeds that
produce it, the culture, or the want
of it, the time of the year, the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs
or intemperateneſs of
the weather, the time and manner
of gathering it, how it has been
kept, the parts of it that are, and
thoſe that are not made uſe of, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with other circumſtances too
many to be here enumerated: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
all theſe, I ſay, the unheeded
Textures of parts that are thought
of an uniform nature, and the length
of time during which they have
been kept, without being ſuſpected
to be ſuperannuated, and indeed
without being ſo, may ſo much
vary the nature of a Plant, that I
have ſometimes almoſt in a trice
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:49353:95"/>
ſhewn the curious a notable diſpari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in the parts of the ſame freſh Leaf
of a common Plant: And (NB.)
I have found by Tryal purpoſely
made, that ſome ſeeds of common
uſe in Phyſick (and not putrefy'd)
will, being diſtill'd at one time of
the year, afford an Acid Spirit or
Liquor; but at another time of the
year, tho deſtill'd the ſame way
without any addition, afford not
an Acid, but a kind of urinous Spirit,
that contains a volatile Salt, which
in Smell, Taſt, and divers Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
I found to be of great affinity
to the volatile Salt of Urine, or that
of Hartſhorn. And indeed ſo many
things may be pertinently and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
propos'd to be inquir'd into,
about this or that particular Plant
made uſe of by Phyſicians, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
they would be leſs inclin'd to
compound numbers of them in one
Receipt, if they were aware how
much uſeful employment the inda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of the Quality's of ſo much
as a few ſingle Plants would give
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:49353:95"/>
them: and yet without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of the properties of the ſeparated
Ingredients, a Phyſician preſcribes,
it will be ſcarce poſſible for him to
know, with ſufficient certainty, how
the compound made up of them, will
be qualify'd and operate, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection,
I the leſs ſcruple to propoſe,
becauſe I am conifirm'd in
it by <hi>Galen</hi> himſelf,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Galen. de Con. p. Sec. Gen. lib.</hi> 1.</note> who
very Book, where he
largely treats <hi>De Medicamentorum
Compoſitione,</hi> hath this Aſſertion; <hi>In
univerſum, nemo probe uti poſſit medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camento
compoſito, qui ſimplicium vires
prius non accurate didicerit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I preſume you will eaſily allow,
that much of what has been ſaid in
favour of thoſe ſimple Medicines we
owe to <hi>Natures</hi> (or rather to its
<hi>Authors</hi>) Bounty, may be extended
to many of the Remedy's that are
afforded us by the Chymiſts Art.
For without now entering into the
Queſtion, whether the Spirits,
Oyls, and Salts, that are obtain'd
by what Spagyriſts call <hi>Analyſes by the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:49353:96"/>
fire,</hi> are <hi>Principles</hi> in the ſtrict ſenſe
of the word; it will ſcarce be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
but that the Spirit, or the Oyl,
or the Salt of a mix'd Body chymical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reſolv'd, is ſo ſlightly or unequal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
compos'd, that the Ingredient
whence it takes its name, is far
more predominant, than it was
when combin'd with others, in the
entire or not yet Analys'd Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete.
And that ſuch ſuppoſed
Principles, OF Medicines of a ſimpler
Order, may be very efficacious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medys,
may be juſtly argu'd from the
great and beneficial effects of ſuch as
Oyl of Vitriol, Spirit of Urine
(NB.) a Medicine of great uſe both
Inward and Outward, Spirit of Hartſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn,
Spirit of Niter, Spirit of Wine,
and Oyl of Turpentine; of which
laſt nam'd Liquor I ſhall add, that,
beſides the vertues already aſcrib'd
to it in this Paper, whilſt it retains
its ſimplicity, it may in many Caſes
be imploy'd as a <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> and by
being combin'd with an Ingredient
or two, be made to afford divers
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:49353:96"/>
Medicines, which tho but little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,
are not of little vertue.
For I have found it readily enough
to diſſolve Camphire, Maſtick, and
ſome other Gums, of which Balſoms
may be made, and others may be
obtain'd by the help of the ſame Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor,
even from divers Mineral and
Metalline Bodies. I <hi>will not inſiſt</hi> on
ſo known a Medicine as the common
Terebinthinate Balſom of Sulphur;
tho this be a Remedy, with as
much as 'tis peculiarly extoll'd for
Diſeaſes of the Lungs, (wherein
yet its heat requires that it be very
warily given to Patients of ſome
complexions) has vertues that are
not confin'd to the Diſtempers of
thoſe parts; ſince both I and ſome
I commended it to, have found it
very effectual (outwardly apply'd)
in troubleſome Haemorroidal Pains
and Tumors: and (NB.) ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
inclines me to think its ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
may not be much greater in
Pulmonick than in Paralytick Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempers:
in which (laſt) it may be
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:49353:97"/>
us'd, not only Outwardly, but
chiefly Inwardly; and that in a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
large Doſe with a Cephalick, and,
in ſome Caſes, an Antiſcorbutick
Vehicle. <hi>But I ſhall rather take notice</hi>
to you, that perhaps it will be found
worth while to try, at leaſt in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Affects, the uſe of divers Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures,
and conſequently Balſoms that
may be obtaind by the help of Oyl
of Turpentine from divers ſolid Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Body's, upon which I have
found by tryal, that this Liquor may
be ting'd (tho not of the ſame co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
on all of them,) among which
I ſhall name, beſides Crude Zink,
Crude Antimony, and even Crude
Copper (in filings;) a noble Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
Antimonial Cinnabar; from
which, tho I found I could (but not
haſtily) draw a fine Tincture, I had
not opportunity to make tryal of
that promiſing Medicine.</p>

                  <p>ANd as for thoſe other Medicines,
that are not made by bare <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalyſis,</hi>
but by <hi>Syntheſis</hi> or compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<hi>tho</hi> I think an experienc'd

leſs uncertainty than a Galeniſt (who
employs Crude Ingredients of a more
compounded nature) foreſee what
quality the produc'd mix'd Body
may have: <hi>Yet</hi> I could wiſh, that
even the Spagyriſts themſelves were
more ſparing, than many of them
are, in the number of the Ingredients
they imploy to compoſe one Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine.
For moſt of the Arguments,
upon which I grounded my Invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the uſe of ſimple Remedies,
are applicable to Chymical ones, as

I ſhall repreſent two things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt That in many caſes, prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
skilfully diverſify'd, may
be uſefully ſubſtituted to compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:

Since one Body dexterouſly
expos'd to differing Operations, may
acquire as various, or as conſiderable,
Qualities, as would accrew to it by
the addition of ſuch other Bodies,
as an ordinary Chymiſt would in
probability aſſociate with it. Thus,

but with one or two Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,

Medicines numerous and various
enough, almoſt to furniſh a Shop;
or at leaſt to anſwer the Phyſicians
Scope, where he would imploy an
Emetick, a Cathartick, a Diaphore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,
a Deobſtruent, a Diuretick, a
Bezoardick or cordial Medicine; to
name now no other Qualities, that
may be found in ſome Antimonial

Inſtances, and others of the like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:49353:98"/>
I preſume you will allow me to
make uſe of in this diſcourſe, becauſe,
though I do commonly, yet I do not
always, imploy the Term <hi>Simple Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine</hi>
or <hi>Remedy</hi> in the ſtrict and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
ſenſe, but in a comparative
one, that excludes compoſitions of
more than two or three, or at the
utmoſt a very few, Ingredients.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Without bringing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
a <hi>Chaos,</hi> or ſo much as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderabe
number, of Ingredients, one
or two, or at moſt three auxilary
ones, if judiciouſly choſen and skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
manag'd, may oftentimes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
more efficacious Remedies, than
the admirers of pompuous Proceſſes
would expect, or perhaps be able to
make thoſe Proceſſes vye with.
The violently Emetick and purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
vertue of Glaſs of Antimony
made <hi>per ſe,</hi> may be, as I elſewhere
ſhow, more powerfully corrected by
mere diſtill'd Vinegar, than by many
famous Stomachick and Cordial E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixirs,
and other Elaborate Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
And ſometimes a ſeemingly
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:49353:99"/>
improper addition may not only
correct, but give new and unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
vertues to a Drug. Thus, though
<hi>Sublimatum corroſivum</hi> be a mercurial
concrete, ſo fretting, that a very few
Grains of it may be able to kill a
man; yet by adding and carefully
uniting to it about an equal weight
of running Mercury, there is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd,
when they are well united by
Sublimations, a Compound that
is ſo free from being corroſive, that
Chymiſts call it <hi>Mercurius dulcis,</hi>
which though ſome unwary Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners,
as well Galeniſts as Chymiſts,
have too often by their miſimploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of it, diſcredited, yet experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
ſhows that in Skilful hands it
may be uſefully imployed, not only
in ſome venereal affections, but in
divers other Diſtempers. And I
ſhall now add, that being carefully
prepar'd, and well given, it may
not only be freed from corroſiveneſs,
but much allay the Sharpneſs
both of ſome emptying Medicines,
&amp; of ſome peccant humors. To coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:49353:99"/>
the latter part of which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation,
I ſhall acquaint you with
one uſe of it, that perhaps you have
not yet made. I remember, I had an
opportunity to obſerve the Efficacy
of <hi>Mercurius dulcis,</hi> in a ſtubborn
<hi>diſentery,</hi> that had baffled the Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of an eminent Phyſician. But
though a reflection on the vertue, I
knew this Medicine to have, of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying
Sharp humors, and reſiſting
Putrefaction, may juſtly increaſe my
favourable opinion of it; yet not
thinking my Experience competent,
I imparted it to an ancient and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert
Chyrurgeon, that was the chief
of thoſe that belong'd to a famous
and judicious General of an Army;
who thereupon frankly confeſs'd to
me, that this was his great <hi>Arcanum,</hi>
wherewith he had cur'd many ſcores,
or rather hundreds of Souldiers
in this generals Army. Only, where
as my way is to give from 8, or 10,
to 12, or at moſt 15 Grains of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curius
dulcis</hi> for a Doſe, made up
with ſome little <hi>Rhubarb, &amp;c.</hi> Or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:49353:100"/>
Ingredient that would make it
work, once, twice, or thrice with
another Patient, (for the diſentery
it ſelf helps to carry off the Medicine)
he, both to diſguiſe it, and to
make it more eaſily takeable, made
it up with Sugar and Mucilage of
Cum-dragon into Lozenges, whereof
one might contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from
near a Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to half a dram of the <hi>Mercurius
dulcis,</hi> of which he order'd the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
to take one at a time, without
hindering their March; only bidding
them have a great care, that nothing
ſhould ſtick between their Teeth, or
in their Throats.</p>
                  <p>3. But the efficacy of this ſimple
preparation of <hi>Mercury,</hi> is much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
to that more ſimple, although
more tedious, preparation of Gold,
which was made the ſame way in
two differing Countries, by two
dexterous Phyſicians, both of them
of my acquaintance. For though I
had long been prejudic'd (not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſpecious grounds) againſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<hi>Aurum potabiles,</hi> and other
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:49353:100"/>
boaſted preparations of <hi>Gold;</hi> (for
moſt of which I have ſtill no over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>great
eſteem) yet, I ſaw ſuch extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
and ſurprizing Effects of
the Tincture of <hi>Gold</hi> I ſpeak of, upon
Perſons of great note, that I was
particularly acquainted with both
before they fell deſperately ſick, and
after their ſtrange Recovery, that I
could not but change my former opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
or a very favourable one of <hi>ſome</hi>
preparations of <hi>Gold;</hi> and I ſhould
have <hi>thought</hi> that this Medicine (as
little compounded as it is,) could ſcarce
he paid, by a great ſtore of the Noble
Metal that afforded it, if it could
have been made in great quantity,
or without a great deal of pains and
time. I can ſpeak thus circumſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
becauſe by the kindneſs of the
Artiſts, and the pains I had ſpent in
working on the ſame Subject they
make their <hi>Menſtruum</hi> of, I ſo far
knew, and partly (by themſelves invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted)
ſaw, the preparation of it, that
to bring home what has been ſaid,
to the preſent occaſion) I can tell
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:49353:101"/>
you, that there is no Ingredient aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated
to the <hi>Gold,</hi> ſave one, that comes
from above, and is reputed one of
the ſimpleſt Bodys in nature, and of
which one may take two or three
Ounces altogether unprepar'd, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the leaſt inconvenience. And
yet the Doſe of this almoſt inſipid
Medicine, that was given to an old
Courtier, even in a violent Apoplexy,
wherein other Remedies had by
skil'ful men been us'd in vain, was
but ſix or eight drops.</p>
                  <p>In another very ancient and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulent
perſon the Doſe was greater,
becauſe the Tincture was more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripe
and diluted; but the effect was
as ſudden, tho the Patient was not
bled, and tho there was not in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of theſe two caſes, any notably
ſenſible, evacuation made. [Both
theſe recover'd Perſons are yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live]
the ſame Medicine a while
after, ſaved the life of another Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
I know, who, having lain
above two and twenty days ſick of
an ill conditioned Feaver, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:49353:101"/>
by three Phyſicians, whereof
one told me with great grief, that
he would not out-live the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and yet upon the taking of a
large Doſe of this Tincture, he was
preſently reliev'd, and from that
time found a ſenſible amendment
towards a recovery, which he now
injoys; tho he were then reputed to
be about, if not above fourſcore
years old. Some other odd effects
of this. Remedy I could tell you of:
But it has already much ſwell'd this
Section, and yet I thought it not
amiſs to relate theſe things to you,
both, becauſe they are very perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
to the ſcope of it, and becauſe
you may be, as I long was, preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic'd
againſt Medicines made of ſo
fix'd, and, as is ſuppos'd, un-altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
a Metal as <hi>Gold.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. This is not the only Medicine
made of that noble Body, of which
I have known very notable effects.
But, becauſe they belong to another
Paper, I ſhall not particularly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
them in this; but paſs on to
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:49353:102"/>
tell you,<note place="margin">The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſefulneſs of Exp. Philoſophy.</note> that the
Preparation of <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi>
that I have long ſince deliver'd
in another Book, tho' it may ſeem
but ſlight, has been found very effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,
and much us'd, by one of the
eminenteſt Phyſicians of this nation,
to whom I recommended it: and
who acknowledg'd to me, that He
gave it to Patients of very high
Quality, tho' diſguis'd, to avoid
alarming thoſe that are fearful of
Chymical Medicines. And ſince that
I gave it to a great Lady that was Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dropical,
and judg'd to be dangerouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ill, with notable ſucceſs; and
the Cure has already for ſome years
held good. But I confeſs to you,
that I look upon <hi>Copper,</hi> and its Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtery
<hi>Blew Vitriol,</hi> as a much nobler
Subject to make Remedy's of, than
<hi>Silver,</hi> and perhaps than <hi>Gold</hi> it ſelf.
And if I were to make Phyſick my
Profeſſion, there is no Metal which I
ſhould ſo willingly beſtow pains upon
as <hi>Copper</hi> induc'd thereunto by the
excellent and very extraordinary
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:49353:102"/>
Effects, (not all of them to be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
in this Paper, that I have had
opportunity to ſee, of ſome Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
which tho' I could never learn
how to make, I knew were made
of that Metal, or <hi>Vitriol</hi> abounding
in it. [But firſt freed from all cruelti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
violence.] And for appeaſing of
Pains, produc'd even by inveterate Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies,
the <hi>Laudanums</hi>) and other o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate
Preparations, that are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd
and prais'd in Phyſicians and
Chymiſts Books, and much us'd (of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
with good ſucceſs) in their
practice, ſeem to me, bccauſe of the
<hi>Stupor,</hi> and ſome other inconvenient
Symptoms, they are wont more or
leſs to be followed by, far inferiour
to the <hi>Sulphureous Parts,</hi> as a Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt
would call them, of skillfully
prepar'd <hi>Venus;</hi> theſe being much
more harmleſly and friendly <hi>Anody<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous.</hi>
And I remember that an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyrick,
to whom, at his requeſt, I
taught a very uncertain way (for it
rarely hits) of making a kind of
<hi>Sulphur of Vitriol</hi> alone, in the form
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:49353:103"/>
of a Brick colour'd Powder; came
purpoſely to give me ſolemn Thanks
for the Reputation he had gain'd by
that Medicine, of which the firſt
time he had the good luck to make
it, he gave, as he was inſtructed,
four or five grains of it, to a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
that could not ſleep, but had
been for divers months raving mad,
[<hi>Maniaca.</hi>] which ſingle doſe not
only gave her a good Nights reſt,
but brought. her to talk ſenſe when
ſhe wak'd in the Morning. I knew
alſo a Chymiſt, that was much cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
even by learned Doctors, for
an internal Anodyne he us'd, and
could ſell at almoſt what rate he
pleas'd, to take off inveterate Pains in
the Heads and Shins of venereal Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients;
and the ſame Perſon cur'd
venereal Ulcers in a very ſhort time,
only by ſtrowing on them an Indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Powder. And tho he was ſo
ſhy, that he would not let even the
Phyſicians, I recommended to him,
ſee his Medicine, yet having one day
been told of a kindneſs I had done
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:49353:103"/>
him, unknown to him; he took it
ſo well, that he not only allow'd me
to ſee and handle his Medicine, but
when I gueſs'd by the ponderouſneſs
and effects; of it, that it was ſome.
Preparation of <hi>Mercury</hi> fixt with <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur
of Venus,</hi> he frankly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
to me, that, tho it would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
not only Ignition, but a ſtrong &amp;
laſting fire, that in the former part
of my Conjecture (<hi>that the Body of
it was Mercurial</hi>) I was in the right;
and in the latter part I ſhot very
near the Mark; but added, that
that the true <hi>Sulphureous parts</hi> of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
were in his way ſo difficult to be
obtain'd, and requir'd ſo much
time, that he could ſeldom prevail
with himſelf, (who indeed was vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous
enough) to go through ſo
troubleſome a work. And in
effect I found, upon various Tryals,
the conſtituent Parts of that Metal
to be much more ſtrictly united than
the generality even of Chymiſts ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.
For the extraordinary effects
of this Medicine, I can refer you to
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:49353:104"/>
the Teſtimony of very ingenious men
of your own Profeſſion, (and proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
acquaintance too.) And ſince
I know you ſtudy <hi>Helmont,</hi> I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
you will the more readily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
them, if I put you in mind of
that notable Paſſage, where he ſays:
<hi>Nihil, aeque victorioſe in Humidum
Radicale, agit atque primum ens cupri,
vel ad vitam longam Sulphure vitrioli
eſt benignius; ideoque Sulphur Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophorum
indigitat.</hi> But my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Brevity forbids me to inſiſt
longer on this Metal, or to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of more than one other Metal.
And becauſe that of Steel, Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
as well as Chymiſts make great
variety of Remedies, ſome of which
are produc'd by Preparations ſlight
enough; And the like may be ſaid
of Mercury, witneſs the Remedy
formerly commended againſt the
<hi>Worms,</hi> made of nothing but crude
<hi>Quick-Silver</hi> barely decocted in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
water: For this reaſon, I ſay,
I ſhall pitch upon Lead, whoſe <hi>calx</hi>
diſſolv'd in Spirit of Vinegar affords
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:49353:104"/>
as you know, <hi>Saccharum Saturni,</hi>
which tho ſo eaſy and ſimple a prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
is a magiſtery that has more
vertues than every Phyſican knows,
or perhaps ſo much as ſuſpects; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
in mortifying ſharp humours
in the Eyes, which I have known or
made it do ſometimes almoſt in a
trice. [But I do not think it ſafe
to make the Plantain or Roſe-water
'tis to be diſſolv'd in, conſiderably
ſtrong of it.] And for Burns, I
have ſeldom ſeen any thing equal to
it, and therefore have often us'd it
upon my ſelf (barely diſſolv'd in
Common, or elſe Plantain Water.)
But I fear 'tis not ſo ſafe as effectual,
in ſome inward Diſtempers of the
Bowels, that are judg'd to be caus'd
by Acid humours; unleſs it be very
warily and skilfully given. [But as
to its external uſe, I preſume, I need
not tell ſo skilful a Doctor as you
(NB.) how great it is in healing,
and in the mean time appeaſing, the
Pains of divers ſorts of Ulcers. And
therefore I ſhall mention but one
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:49353:105"/>
Particular, which 'tis like you have
not met with; namely, that I know
a very Ancient and experienc'd Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
who, beſides a vaſt practice o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe,
was Chyrurgeon to a
great Hoſpital; who profeſſing much
kindneſs, and owning ſome obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to me, confeſs'd to me, that
amongſt all the Medicines he has try'd
to ſtop Bleeding, and prevent Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
in Amputations, that which
he ofteneſt us'd, and moſt rely'd on,
is a ſolution of <hi>Saccharum Saturni</hi> in
Plantain Water (or for a need in
pure common Water:) for having
diſſolv'd ℥j. of the former in about a
Pint or pound of the latter; as ſoon
as ever the Limb or other part is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
off, he immediately apply's Stupes
drench'd in this Liquor, as hot as
the Patient can well endure; and
having bound them carefully on, he
makes, no haſt to take them off, but
allows the Medicine time enough to
perform its operation: To counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
this I would tell you an odd
experiment of mine, of the efficacy
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:49353:105"/>
of a Saturnine Liquor to reſiſt Putr
faction, in the Bodys of Animals,
but that the relation would take up
too much time.]</p>
                  <p>5. Perhaps I need not tell you,
that I could here mention divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Experiments, as well upon Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
as the other Metals I have
nam'd above; but <hi>that</hi> my Scope
confines me to ſuch Preparations, as
wherein the Metaline Subject is
compounded but with very few o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
and alſo that of thoſe that are
more remote from ſimplicity, you
may meet with ſeveral in ſome of
my other Papers, which I am not in
this to defraud.</p>
                  <p>What has been above noted about
Metals, may be extended to Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals:
namely, that when there is
need to compound them, it may of
tentimes be ſufficient to aſſociate
them with one or two, or at moſt a
very few <hi>Auxiliary Ingredients,</hi> if I
may ſo-call them; this is apparent in
ſeveral uſeful Preparations of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,</hi>
that are vulgarly enough known.
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:49353:106"/>
To which divers may be added that
are made of common <hi>Sulphure,</hi> by
ſlight additions. Of which ſort, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I elſewhere deliver ſeveral, I
ſhall now mention but one, which
though I have many years ago de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd
in the Hiſtory of colours, I
ſhall not ſcruple to take notice of
here, becauſe I there conſider not its
Medicinal vertues, which yet are
very great, eſpecially in <hi>Aſthmas</hi> and
<hi>Coughs,</hi> in which I do not remember
that I ever gave it without benefit
to the Patient; nor was it leſs ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in the hands of Phyſicians, that
were willing to try it for me, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in thoſe of a Perſon, who though
well furniſh'd with choice Remedies
of his own, often came to me for a
ſupply of this Spirituous and pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating
Tincture, with which he
aſſur'd me he did notable things in
<hi>Aſthmatical</hi> caſes; and particularly in
one that was very obſtinate, and had
laſted many years. But not having
had quite ſo many opportunities as
I wiſhed of giving it my ſelf, I ſhall
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:49353:106"/>
be glad, that further Tryal may be
made of it by ſo skilful an Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrer
as you. And therefore leſt you
ſhould not have the Book lately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
to at hand, I ſhall here repeat,
that our Medicine is made of Flowers
of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> exactly mix't with an
equal weight of finely powder'd <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Armoniac,</hi>
and ſomewhat more than
an equal weight of good <hi>Quick-lime,</hi>
ſeparately reduc'd to a Suttle Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
For theſe three Ingredients be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
diligently and nimbly mix'd,
and put into a Retort, to be plac'd
in a ſand Furnace, and fitted with
a large receiver very well luted to
it. This Mixture, I ſay, being duly
diſtill'd in ſuch veſſels, will afford a
Blood red and ſmoaking ſpirit, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
Sulphureous both in ſmell
and oven Mechanical Operations.
And in this Diſtillation the Sulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous
Parts ſometimes came over ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company'd
with ſuch ſtore of ſaline
ones, that a good part of what paſt
into the Receiver ſhot into the form
of a <hi>Volatile Sulphureous Salt.</hi> And I
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:49353:107"/>
remember that having for curioſity's
ſake added to the Fluid Tincture
a due proportion of an Ardent Spirit
(ſuch as that of Wine) exactly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlegm'd,
I had a Mixture (whether
in the form of a Coagulum or not)
which afforded me ſome odd <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena</hi>
not here to be mention'd, and
which we ſubled with a gentle fire to
unite them into a compoſition that
may for diſtinction ſake be call'd <hi>Sa trium
regnorum,</hi> becauſe it contains
<hi>Urinous</hi> Particles, <hi>Vinous</hi> ones, (and
perhaps ſome of <hi>Soot</hi>) and <hi>Sulphure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi>
ones: whereof the <hi>Firſt</hi> belongs
to the <hi>Animal,</hi> the Second to the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable,</hi>
and the laſt to the <hi>Mineral</hi>
Kingdom, as Chymiſts are wont to
ſpeak. But what vertues this Salt
(that would preſently gild <hi>Silver,</hi>)
and the Spirit that may be made to
accompany it, may have in Phyſick,
I had not occaſion to try. But yet I
have mention'd it upon the by, that
you may make uſe of it, if you think
it worth while to do ſo. To whch I
ſhall here preſent you with no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:49353:107"/>
ſince I perceive that the
Particulars above mention'd about
ſimple preparations of <hi>Gold</hi> and other
Metals, have already made this
Section enormouſly great. And yet
I hope you will not be diſpleas'd at
it; ſince to ſo ſugacious a perſon as
Dr. F. theſe paſſages may afford
ſome not altogether uſeleſs hints:
and at leaſt 'tis an Encouragement to
Induſtry, to know that the ſubjects
a man works on are capable of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording
Excellent things.</p>

the frequent uſe of ſimple Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines,
that oftentimes it happens
that a <hi>Diſeaſe,</hi> or a <hi>morbiſick Matter,</hi> is

                  <p>2. But having premis'd this
Advertiſement, I preſume I may
offer you two or three conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that may leſſen the force of the
lately propos'd objection And firſt,
<hi>tho</hi> I readily grant, that there are
Diſeaſes, whereof each may proceed
from differring cauſes, and that a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
may be available againſt it,
When 'tis produc'd by one of thoſe
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:49353:108"/>
cauſes, without being ſo when it
flows from another; <hi>yet</hi> it may alſo
eaſily happen, that in one caſe the
Diſeaſe may be cur'd by one ſimple
Medicine, and in another, by a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
not compounded. Nay, it may
alſo happen, that the ſame ſimple
may cure a Diſtemper, by which ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
OF the two cauſes it is produe'd.
This I have in another Paper endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to make out. And what we
ſee of the Effects of the <hi>Jeſuits Powder,</hi>
as they call it in different kinds of
Agues, as <hi>Tertians, Quartans, &amp;c.</hi> and
<hi>of</hi> pacating Medicines (moſt of which
indeed owe their vertue to <hi>Opium,</hi>
but ſome are Mineral, and have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the <hi>Poppy</hi> in them) in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſing
Pains produc'd by Humours,
and other cauſes very differing; may
keep what has been ſaid from appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
improbable, And, if I miſtake
not, it may divers times happen,
that, whatever it were that at firſt
produc'd a portion of Morbiſick mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that firſt produc'd matter, is the
cauſe of the continuance of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:49353:109"/>
by vertue of ſome peculiar Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
or Noxious Conſtitution, which
if a generous Medicine can deſtroy,
the Diſeaſe will, at leaſt little by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
ceaſe.</p>
                  <p>3. It not unfrequently happens,
that ſeveral Symptoms that ſeem ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
differing, may ſo depend upon
the primary or principal cauſe of the
Diſeaſe, that if a Medicine, how ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
ſoever, be capable to deſtroy that
cauſe, all the various Symptoms will,
by degrees at leaſt, vaniſh of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:
as we often ſee, that when <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi>
tho perhaps but crude, is skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
apply'd, and raiſes a kindly ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livation,
a great variety of Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies
that afflicted a Venereal Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,
and ſeem'd to require many
differing and topical Applications,
are remov'd by the ſame Remedy;
inſomuch that not only frightful <hi>Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,</hi>
but ſuch <hi>Modes</hi> as one would
think ſearce poſſible to be diſſipated
by the ſtrongeſt Plaiſters, are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
happily cur'd by well prepar'd
Quickſilver, taken in at the mouth,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:49353:109"/>
as I have been aſſured by more than
one eminent Phyſician upon his
own Experience, And tho not unfre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
there be <hi>ſeveral,</hi> &amp; ſometimes
very different Symptoms, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
that Diſeaſe of children that
in <hi>England</hi> we call the <hi>Rickets;</hi> (and
of which there dye ſeveral almoſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
week in <hi>London</hi> alone)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet
that Medicine which I have elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
deſcrib'd under the name of
<hi>Ens (primum) Veneris</hi> [made of
ſtrongly calcin'd and well dulcify'd
<hi>Colcothar of Dantſick Vitriol,</hi> and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
with <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> into the
form of a reddiſh ſublimate] has
prov'd, by Gods bleſſing on it, ſo
ſucceſsful, that partly by a Siſter of
mine, (to whom I communicated
it) and partly by my ſelf, and thoſe
I directed to take it, or to give it;
I think I may ſafely ſay, that two or
three hundred children have been
cur'd by it, and that almoſt always
without the help of any other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Medicine, or uſing any Topi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
application at all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="202" facs="tcp:49353:110"/>
4. But the main thing that
I intended, by way of anſwer to the
foreſeen Objection, was, that in a
ſimple Medince nature her ſelf does
oftentimes ſo well play the Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary,
as to render the compoſitions
made in his ſhop unneceſſary. For,
tho we are wont to look upon this or
that Plant or Mineral, as an entire
and ſimple Body, yet we may much
miſtake, if we look upon it as a Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogeneous
one. In ſeveral Plants
that are organical Bodies, this Truth
is manifeſt; as for inſtance, in <hi>Oran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi>
the <hi>Succulent</hi> part is ſoure and
cooling, but the <hi>Yellow Rind</hi> conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably
bitter and hot: and ſo in
<hi>Lemons</hi> the <hi>Pulp,</hi> the <hi>Yellow</hi> part of
the <hi>Rind,</hi> and the <hi>ſeeds</hi> have their
differing Qualities and Medicinal
vertues. And even in ſuch vegetable
Subſtances as are Homogeneous as to
ſenſe, there may be Parts, whoſe opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
may be not only differing, but
contrary; as is manifeſt in the Root,
we call <hi>Rhubarb,</hi> which affords as well
notably <hi>Aſtringent,</hi> as Laxative and
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:49353:110"/>
                     <hi>Purgative</hi> Parts. And ſo in Minerals
themſelves good and clean <hi>Lead-Oar,</hi>
for inſtance, tho an uniform body as to
ſenſe, conſiſts of very diſſimilar Parts,
and affords Sulphureous and perhaps
other Recrements, beſides Malleable
<hi>Lead,</hi> which is it ſelf a compounded
Body. Thus alſo ſhining <hi>Marcaſites,</hi>
tho they appear Homogeneous, will
by barely being expos'd for a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
time to the moiſt Air, afford
an Effloreſcence, that is perfectly vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triolate,
and conſequently contains
an Acid Salt, two kinds of Sulphur,
a Terreſtrial Subſtance, and at leaſt
one Metal, (for oftentimes it holds
both Copper and Iron, tho one pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominate,)
which laſt nam'd Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
themſelves are neither of
them ſimple Bodies.</p>
                  <p>5. And if we admit the Chymical
<hi>Analyſis</hi> of mixts to be genuine, we
ſhall find that almoſt all thoſe that
belong to the Vegetable Kingdom, or
to the Animal, and many that are
refer'd to the Mineral Kingdom, how
uniform ſoever they may appear to
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:49353:111"/>
the Eye, do each of them contain ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
different, and ſometimes hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
Subſtances. Thus <hi>Hartſhorn,</hi>
tho it appears a dry and Homogene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Subſtance, will in diſtillation
afford a volatile Salt, an urinous
Spirit, a wateriſh Liquor, or
Phlegm, a ſwiming Oyl and a ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one, a white and porous Earth,
or <hi>Terra damnata,</hi> and perhaps ſome,
tho but very little, fixt Salt. Thus
alſo in the Vegetable Kingdom, <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi>
for inſtance, may without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
be made to afford, as Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
hath aſſur'd me, a volatile Salt
very like that of Urine, a Phlegme,
an Acid Spirit, another Spirit too
which I have elſewhere given the
name of <hi>Adiaphorous,</hi> two faetid Oyls,
whereof one will ſink in Water, and
the other ſwim on it, an Earth or
<hi>Terra Damnata,</hi> and a fixt Lixivial
Salt, upon which the newly
mention'd Acid Spirit manifeſts
ſuch a hoſtility, that when they
are put together, they tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate
with noiſe and Bubbles, and
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:49353:111"/>
in the Conflict mortify each other.
And thus likewiſe in the Mineral
Kingdom, not to repeat what I late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſaid of the compoundedneſs of
<hi>Vitriol;</hi> Nor confidently to urge
the Opinion of divers Eminent Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians,
that <hi>Mars</hi> (as they call
Steel and Iron) affords parts where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
ſome are Aſtringent, and other O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perative,
becauſe I am not yet ſure
theſe contrary qualitys, do not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from the differing degrees of
Fire, and other Circumſtances of the
preparations of the Metal: We ſee
that <hi>Native Cinnabar</hi> affords by Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillation,
beſides running Mercury, a
dry ſubſtance, whence I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
a Sulphur that would preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
gild Silver, and a Terreſtrial ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
whoſe nature I had not oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to examine. And I the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
take notice of theſe differing
Parts in <hi>Native Cinnabar,</hi> becauſe it
is a Mineral that I much eſteem;
and tho here in <hi>England</hi> it is very
rarely, or ſcarce at all imploy'd as an
inward Medicine, yet I know ſome
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:49353:112"/>
Forraign Phyſicians of ſeveral Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that look upon it, as one of
their chief <hi>Arcanums,</hi> and both uſe it,
and conceal it, accordingly. But I
do not willingly imploy it, till it
has been prepar'd, by grinding it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly,
upon a Porphire, or other fit
Stone, as a Painter would do to
make a Pigment of it, and by freeing
it from certain Salts, that often un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcernedly
adhere to it, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
may be hurtful; which is
done by Firſt waſhing it very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
with boyling Water, and then,
after it has been throughly dry'd, by
burning upon it ſeveral times, one
after another, ſome Vinous Spirits
perfectly dephlegm'd. [The Doſe, if it
be to be long continu'd, may be
three, four or five grains: but when
'tis to be given but ſeldom, and
for an urgent Caſe, it may be
from ſix or ſeven, to ten or twelve
grains.</p>

                  <p>1. WHat has been ſaid in the

manifeſt, that a ſimple, whether Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganical
or not, may notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

contain or afford very,

that being really a compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Body, it may afford Parts dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
enough to anſwer differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Indications, or attain ſeveral
Scopes, that are wont to be look'd
on by Phyſiciaus as neceſſary, or at

judg'd requiſite firſt to evacuate the
Peccant matter, and then to give
Aſtringents, to hinder the immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate

both thoſe Indications, by its

Parts, whereof the former diſpatch
their work firſt, which makes the
Aſtringent operation of the latter
ſeaſonable and ſafe.</p>
                  <p>2. I have divers times obſerv'd, that
ſo common and deſpicable a ſimple
as <hi>Ground Ivy,</hi> has perform'd things
whoſe variety ſeem'd to argue, that
it contains Parts of very differing
vertues (as of opening, contempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating,
healing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
capable of anſwering differing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,
eſpecially in Diſtempers of
the Lungs &amp; Breaſt, &amp; indeed partly
by the Syrup of it, partly by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion
of the Leaves, and partly by
Medicines made of them in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
form; the happy Effects of
this ſimple have procur'd me the
thanks of divers conſiderable perſons,
ſome of which had before unſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
us'd many Preſcriptions of
learned men. And I remember I
knew an Ingenious Perſon, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Maſter of a conſiderable manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture,
which was gainful to him,
whilſt his Servants continu'd tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:49353:113"/>
well, was very much incommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated
and perplex'd, to find them ſo
obnoxious to violent <hi>Colicks,</hi> (which
he imputed to the Copious Steams
of the <hi>Vinegar</hi> his Art requir'd,) that
he was forc'd almoſt weekly to allow
them ſome days of ceſſation from
working, to preſerve or recover

from this Inconvenience, he was at
length, as himſelf confeſs'd to me, in
great part freed by making his work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
frequently uſe a ſtrong Infuſion
or Tincture of the Leaves of our
<hi>ground-Ivy</hi> made with (not pure or
dephlegm'd Spirit of Wine, but)
good unrectify'd <hi>Nants</hi> Brandy.</p>
                  <p>I could here add divers other uſes,
both Internal and External, of this
ſeemingly deſpicable Plant, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſcarce any one Engliſh Herb
known to me, of which, for its
manifeſt vertues, the Experience of
others and my own have given me a
greater Eſteem. And I am apt to
think, that the Efficacy which this
and ſome other Simples, that the
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:49353:114"/>
fear of Prolixity makes me ſilently
paſs by, would be found both grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and more various than they are
commonly thought, if Phyſicians in
preſcribing Medicines would more
often either ordain Simple ones, or at
leaſt aſſociate but very few together,
and compenſate the ſmall number of
Ingredients, by the greater quantity
of thoſe that are the moſt appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
or operative, and by perſiſting in
their uſe for a competent time.</p>
                  <p>Tho 'tis not every efficacious Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
or but lightly compounded

about the Proof of what I am now

ſubjoyn ſuch Inſtances, as will, I
hope, ſuffice for the preſent Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                  <p>Mineral Waters, as well <hi>Acidubae,</hi>
as the <hi>German Spaw,</hi> our <hi>Tunbridge,</hi>
&amp;c. as <hi>Thermae,</hi> ſuch as thoſe of <hi>Bath,</hi>
&amp;c, tho but Natural Medicines;
and ſome of them but outwardly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred,
are notoriouſly known
in their native ſimplicity to be able
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:49353:114"/>
one of them ſingle, frequently to
cure ſeveral Diſeaſes, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to take off a good number of differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Symptoms, that afford various
Indications. It may help much to
make it probable that the ſame Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
may compriſe Qualities fit to
anſwer differing Scopes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
cure differing Symptoms, if it be
conſider'd, that there are ſeveral
Poyſons that do each of them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
Symptoms not only very fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
but very various, and yet all
theſe have been oftentimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd
by a Specifick Antidote, that
is perhaps but a ſimple Herb or other
uncompounded Drug. I had once,
(and but once) the opportunity of
making a Tryal, whereof I ſhall
now give you a brief Account, of
the vertue of a ſtone taken out of the
Head of an enormouſly great <hi>African</hi>
Serpent; which ſtone was affirm'd to
the Poſſeſſor of it, Governour of
the famous Engliſh <hi>Eaſt India Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,</hi>
to be highly available againſt
the Bitings of all venemous Animals.
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:49353:115"/>
The ſubſtance of the Experiment (to
give it you in ſhort) was this, I caus'd
a young Cat to be bitten by a fierce
and highly irritated Viper, which ſo
inrag'd the Cat, that in revenge he
endeavour'd to bite off her Head,
which he took in his Mouth, and
did not let go, till, as the Spectators
concluded, ſhe had bit him again,
at, leaſt by the tongue; ſoon after
which venemous Hurt, the Cats
Head ſwell'd very much, and tho he
ſoon grew ſo weak, that he was not
able to ſtand on his Legs, but lay along
on the ground, yet he ſeem'd to be
grown quite mad, for he foam'd at
the Mouth, and ſnapt at the end of
a Wand, or ſuch like things, that
were but held near him; and,
which was more, in his rage bit one
of his own Legs, that lay not far
from his Mouth, much to the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe
of the Spectators. But, <hi>tho</hi> in
this deſperate condition it ſeem'd in
vain to attempt any thing for his
Reſcue, becauſe one could make him
take nothing, and every one was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:49353:115"/>
to come near him; <hi>yet</hi> having
mix'd a little of the powder'd ſtone
with ſome ſponfuls of fair Water,
it was by the help of the neck of a
glaſs Retort, that we imploy'd in
ſtead of a funnel, pour'd by degrees
upon the Cats Mouth; which lying
open, tho he endeavour'd to ſhake
it off, yet ſome of it was concluded
to have got in; and within one
hour or two after, if not leſs, he did,
to the no ſmall wonder of the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanders,
get upon his Legs again,
and not only ſeem'd to have much of
the Tumidneſs of his Head, but
readily enough took the Medicine I
caus'd to be given him; and would
probably have ſcap'd very well, if,
whilſt I was at dinner with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
ſome unruly People had not
hurt him more mortally than the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
had done.</p>
                  <p>Phyſicians and others have obſerv'd
in the Plague a great variety of Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms,
among which there are divers,
whereof each, if ſingle would pſas
for a particular Diſeaſe. And this
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:49353:116"/>
diverſity of Symptoms may be not
unfrequently obſerv'd, not only in
Peſtilences that happen at times, or
in Countries diſtant from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but in the ſame Plague reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the ſame Place. And yet 'tis
poſſible, that a ſimple Remedy may
be available againſt this ſo multifa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
or manifold (if I may ſo call
it) and violent a Diſeaſe. Of
Which Obſervation (to omit what
might be alledg'd out of ſome other
Authors) I ſhall give one inſtance out
of <hi>Galen</hi> himſelf, who, treating at

(<hi>Bolus Armena</hi>) which I ſhould
gueſs by his manner of mentioning
it to have been little, if at all, known
to Phyſicians till his Time. This
Earth, that appears a Body ſo ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

for ſevearal Diſeaſes, as ſpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

<pb n="275" facs="tcp:49353:116"/>
and even Ulcers of the Lungs; but

apply'd, in the latter part of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
about Specificks: For this
Reaſon, I ſay, I ſhall add a couple
of other remarkable Inſtances, of the
Efficacy of even Dry and Solid Bodies,
tho but externally apply'd in Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
attended with ſeveral, and divers
of them uncommon Symptoms,
whereof, whatever many think of
the harmleſsneſs of our Engliſh Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
I have here known ſeveral In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
in Men as well as Brutes.
And yet in theſe dangerous Caſes,
many that come from <hi>Eaſt India</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol
the great Efficacy of ſome of thoſe
Stony Concretions, that are ſaid to
be found in the Heads of a certain
kind of Serpents about <hi>Goa,</hi> and ſome
other Eaſtern Countreys: for <hi>tho</hi>
moſt Phyſicians reject or queſtion the
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:49353:118"/>
Power aſcrib'd to theſe ſtones, for
curing the Bitings of Vipers, and <hi>tho</hi>
I do not wonder at their diffidence,
becauſe in effect many of the ſtones
brought from <hi>India</hi> are but counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit;
and of thoſe that were really
taken out of Serpents, ſeveral, for a
Reaſon I muſt not ſtay to mention,
are inſignificant; (and ſuch perhaps
were thoſe that the learned and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<hi>Redy</hi> made his Tryals with) <hi>yet</hi>
there are others, whoſe vertues are
not well to be deny'd. For, not to
build on vulgar Traditions, which
are but too often deceitful, one of
the eminenteſt Doctors of the <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
Colledge</hi> aſſur'd me, that he had,
with one of theſe ſtones, done, tho
contrary to his expectation; a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Cure, which he related to me
at large. And one of our chief
Engliſh Chyrurgeons affirm'd to me,
that he had done the like upon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
perſon; both of theſe Cures
being perform'd by the bare appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the Stone, to the Place bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by the Viper or Adder. And a very
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:49353:118"/>
intelligent perſon, who had the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of a conſiderable Company
of Traders in <hi>Eaſt India,</hi> where he
long liv'd, aſſur'd me that he had
with this Stone cur'd ſeveral perſons
of the Hurts of venemous Animals,
But, this Teſtimony is much leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable,
as to the number of Cures,
than that of a great Traveller into
the Southern parts of the ſame <hi>India,</hi>
who, tho he were bred by a famous
Carteſian Philoſpher, and were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
enough to diſcredit vulgar Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
about the Countreys he had
long liv'd in; yet being for thoſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
ask'd by me, what I might ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
believe of the Stones I ſpeak of,
ſeriouſly affirm'd to me, that he had
cur'd above threeſcore perſons of the
Bitings or Stings of ſeveral ſorts of
poyſonus Creatures; and that he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
moſt of thoſe Cures, by the
outward Application of one Stone;
becauſe, finding it excellent, He was
invited to keep to it, eſpecially in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult.
caſes. And this ſame Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
of my own, made with a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:49353:119"/>
Stone of this kind, upon the
Bodies of Brutes, much inclines me
to give credit to. But, becauſe
this Stone is afforded by an <hi>Animal,</hi>
I ſhall add the vertues of another,
that properly belongs to the <hi>Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi>
Kingdom; in a Diſeaſe, whoſe
Symptoms, tho not ſo various, are
ſometimes dangerous, and too often
mortal.</p>
                  <p>To ſhew you then, that in ſpite
of great Cloſeneſs and Hardneſs, a
ſimple Remedy outwardly apply'd,
may be a very effectual one, I ſhall
inform you, that tho the Solid I am
ſpeaking of paſt for a <hi>Bloodſtone,</hi> yet
by its colour and ſome other viſible
qualities, I ſhould rather have taken
it for an <hi>Agat.</hi> It was but about the
bigneſs of a ſmall Nutmeg, and had
in it a Perforation, by which a
ſtiring paſt through it, to faſten it to
the Part affected. This Stone had
been long kept in the Family that
poſſeſs'd it, when I ſaw it, being for
its rare vertues left by one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
But, to omit the reports that
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:49353:119"/>
went of it, the notable caſe, that
makes it pertinent for me to menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it here, was this. An ingenious
Gentleman, that was a man of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and when I ſaw him, was in the
Flower of his Age, and of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion
ſo highly Sanguine, as is not
uſually to be met with, was from
time to time ſubject to Hemorrhages
at the Noſe; ſo profuſe and ſo diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
to be reſtrain'd, that his Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,
tho a Perſon famous and very
well skill'd in his Art, told me he
often fear'd he ſhould looſe his Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
and that he would be carry'd
away by this unbridled Diſtemper<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
But when good method and variety
of Remedies had been try'd, without
the deſir'd ſucceſs, this Stone was at
length obtain'd from an ancient Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman
of the Gentlemans, to tye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
his Neck, ſo as to touch his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
Skin. This when he did in the
Fits, it would ſtop the Bleeding;
and if he wore it for ſome conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
time together, he all that while
continu'd well, as both his learned
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:49353:120"/>
Phyſician and himſelf inform'd me.
And, becauſe I was apt to aſcribe
ſomewhat of this effect to imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
on, the Patient told me, that a while
before one of the chief Women in
the City, (whom he nam'd to me)
fell into ſo violent a Bleedings, that,
tho' it brought her into a Swoon,
yet that it ſelf, which is ſomewhat
ſtrange, did not hinder her to Bleed
on, till the Stone, having been ty'd
about her Neck, made her ceaſe to
do ſo, tho' ſhe knew nothing of its
having been apply'd to her. And this
it ſelf is leſs ſtrange than what the
Gentleman affirm'd to me of the
Power of this <hi>Gem,</hi> as it may deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
be called. For his complexion
inclining him, as was above intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
to breed great ſtore of Blood, his
Doctor thought fit to order him, for
prevention, to breath a Vein, from
time to time, which when he was
about to do, he was obliged to lay
aſide the Stone for a while, becauſe,
whilſt he kept it on, the Blood would
not iſſue out, at leaſt with the requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
Freedom.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="223" facs="tcp:49353:120"/>
But how far have I already paſt
beyond the deſigned Limits of this
little Tract! wherein I at firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
but to lay before you the
five chief advantages I had obſerv'd,
mere ſimple Remedies to have of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
compounded ones; and briefly
to propoſe the main grounds, on
which I aſcrib'd thoſe advantages to
ſuch Remedies. But tho' the better
to keep this writing from being
prolix, I deſign'd that it ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
chiefly of ſuch particulars, as I
could beſt ſpare from other Papers;
And <hi>tho'</hi> for that reaſon I have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely
omitted many parable, and
other but little Compounded or Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate
Medicines: Yet I now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that, ſo many new particulars
having offer'd themſelves on ſeveral
occaſions, whilſt I was writing, my
Pen has ſlipt into the mention of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
more Receipts, and Hiſtorical
paſſages, than were at firſt intended.
But believing the ſubject to be very
uſeful, and not deſpairing but that
the things deliver'd on it may not
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:49353:121"/>
be altogether uſeleſs; I dare hope
you will pardon ſuch faults, as only
my deſire of making the Parts of this
ſmall writing, rather ſerviceable than
Methodical or well proportion'd,
drew me unawares into. But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
were the cauſe of my Prolixity,
the bulk which I ſee this Paper has
already ſwell'd to, admoniſhes me,
that I ought to put a ſpeedy period
to it, without ſpending time ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſly
to declare in what ſenſe I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
the Medicines deliver'd in this
Invitation, For by recalling to mind,
what I have formerly wrote (in a
Treatiſe you have been pleas'd to
peruſe<note n="*" place="margin">See the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix to the I Section of the II Part of the uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Exper. Philoſophy. p. 389-390 And of the 2d. Edition.</note>) about the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations,
with which I
would have the praiſes I
give of Tome Remedys
underſtood, and the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
with which I would
have them adminiſtred;
you will eaſily be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded,
that looking upon them but
as fit Tools in a skilful Workmans
Hands, I do not pretend that any of
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:49353:121"/>
them ſhould do the Offices both of
Phyſick and Phyſician too: and that
I propoſe not the Medicines men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
in this ſhort Paper, as ſure
Specificks, but as inſtances that there
are Remedies, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their being but ſimple ones, may
be very good ones.</p>
