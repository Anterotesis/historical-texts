         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>LAſt <hi>Thurſday</hi> night the <hi>Bonaventure</hi> Frigat arrived here from Major-General <hi>Kirk</hi>: This Frigat was ordered to cruiſe on the <hi>Scotch</hi> Seas ; and returning to the Fleet, ſhe met the <hi>Deptford</hi> coming hither with Letters to Duke <hi>Schomberg</hi>: But, being Admiral, ſhe ſent the <hi>Bonaventure</hi> with them. They were on board each other: The Chaplain is now at my Lodging here, from whom I had the following Account both of <hi>Londonderry</hi> and <hi>Iniskillin,</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi>)</p>
            <p>That Major-General <hi>Kirk</hi> finding that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army had withdrawn themſelves from the Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and had ſormed themſelves into three cloſe Bodies; One before the Iſland <hi>Inch</hi>; the other to hinder the conjunction of the <hi>iniskillin</hi> Party with the Engliſh; and a third before <hi>Londonderry,</hi> did reſolve to attempt ſending Ships thither; and accordingly on <hi>Friday</hi> laſt was ſeven-night ordered two Ships laden with Proviſions, under the Convoy of the <hi>Deptford,</hi> to fail up; who coming to the Boum, found it broken by the Tide, and freſh: Whereupon the two Ships failed up to the Town, without ſo much as a Gun fit'd at them. The <hi>Deptford</hi> then return'd. The Gariſon had on the 16th of the laſt Month acquainted the Major-General, That they had but a Fortnights Proviſions; but now, thanks be to God, they are ſupplied. Leather is ſo ſcarce in the Town, that the Soldiers are bare-foot for want of Shoes; however they are in good heart, and value not the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army, and daily fally out with great Succeſs. Sometimes they do not ſuffer the <hi>Iriſh</hi> to bury their Dead; the ſight of which ſtrikes ſuch dread in their Soldiers, that often on their Approaches, ſeeing the Dead Bodies, they retreat, without attempting any thing. A ſtrong Body of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army attempted to fall upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in <hi>Inch</hi>; but were beaten back with great loſs. This is the Frigat that was ſent with Arms and Ammunition to <hi>Iniskillin; viz.</hi> 70 Barnels of Powder, 2000 Arms, with Match, &amp;c. and four ſmall Pieces of Cannon; all which was delivered as <hi>Killebegs</hi> to Colonel <hi>Floyd,</hi> and guarded from thence to <hi>Iniskillin</hi> by 400 Horſe, and as many Foot. The Major-General ſent not only this, but Commiſſions to all the Officers of the Gariſon, and offered to make Colonel <hi>Floyd</hi> and Colonel <hi>Hamilton,</hi> the Governours, Baronets for their good Services. That Place is in very good Heart and Condition : They do generally ſcour the Countrey 20 miles round, and ſometimes they go 40 miles. They have taken and brought thither vaſ numbers of Cattel: They have plenty of all things but Bread, which is ſcarce amongſt them. Colonel S<hi>arsfield</hi> has formed a Camp of 4000 Men at <hi>Bondrewis,</hi> within 12 miles of <hi>Bally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhannon</hi> and 24 of <hi>Iniskillin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Frigat has retaken at the iſle of <hi>Mull</hi> the two Ships that were taken by the <hi>French</hi> Frigats, laden with Proviſions: There were ſome Iriſh Soldiers on board them, but quitted on ths <hi>Bona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture</hi>'s approach. Some of the Victuals were taken out ; but they left ſome Cloaks, Coats, a few Arms, and ſeveral Portmantua's.</p>
            <p>I left <hi>Cheſter</hi> yeſterday, from whence on <hi>Thurſday</hi> and <hi>Friday</hi> laſt there marched towards <hi>High-Lake</hi> the following Regiments, in order to be ship'd: The two <hi>Dutch,</hi> three <hi>French,</hi> Colonel <hi>Wharton</hi>'s, Earl of <hi>Kingſton</hi>'s, Lord <hi>Drogheda</hi>'s, Lord <hi>Lisburn</hi>'s, Sir <hi>Henry Ingoldsby</hi>'s, and Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Herbert</hi>'s: They are encamped, and only wait a fair Wind. Duke <hi>Schomberg</hi> and Count <hi>de Solms</hi> went thither to ſee them in Camp. There is 120 Sail of Ships at <hi>White-haven,</hi> and the Horſe embark there, Orders being ſent to diſpatch them away. Colonel <hi>Earl</hi>'s Regiment is here, and takes Shipping in this place.</p>
            <p>Yeſterday morning the <hi>London</hi> Fleet of Ships arrived at <hi>High-Lake,</hi> under the Convoy of ſix Men of War and two Yatchts: ſo that, with the <hi>Portland</hi> and <hi>Bonaventure</hi> Frigats, and the two Frigats, fitted here, make Ten, two Yachts, and the Fireſhip is ready, and will ſpeedily fail.</p>
            <p>There is here, at <hi>High-Lake,</hi> and <hi>Neſſon,</hi> near 200 Sail.</p>
