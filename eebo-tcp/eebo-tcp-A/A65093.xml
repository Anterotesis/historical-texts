         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>Epicurus</hi> granted
there was a God; but one that was

                  </note>
                  <hi>Anaximander</hi> ſuppoſed the gods
to be born, and not to dye, till after
many ages. The <hi>Egyptians,</hi> becauſe of
the Anceſtry of their linage, feign the
gods to have begun among them, and
that they were but two, and everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
the Sun, whom they called <hi>Oſiris;</hi>
and the Moon, that was named <hi>Iſis.</hi>
Notwithſtanding <hi>Lactantius</hi> writeth,<note place="margin">Saturnus fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the gods.</note>
That <hi>Saturnus</hi> was the firſt Father of

ſhewed to their Subjects, they were
deified.</p>
               <p>But in ſuch variety of opinions, it is
a thing difficult to determine the firſt
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45258:4"/>
off-ſpring of their gods, both becauſe
they be but vain, and alſo ſprung out of
mortal humanity. And again, to ſpeak
of God,<note place="margin">To ſpeak of the nature of God is dangerous.</note> as he is in his ſupernatural eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
is a thing dangerous, becauſe we
can neither behold the reſplendent
brightneſſe of his Majeſty with our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
eyes, nor with any quickneſſe of
wit, comprehend his infinite might, as
the Poet <hi>Symonides</hi> did declare very
well:<note place="margin">Simonides.</note> For when he was required of
King <hi>Hiero,</hi> to ſhew him what thing,
and of what ſort God was, he deſired to
have one day reſpite; when he asked
him the next day, he prayed to have two
dayes: and as often as the King requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of him an anſwer, he increaſed the
number of the dayes of deliberation:
the King marvailing that he doubled ſo
many times the dayes, inquired why he
did ſo? For the more (ſaid he) that I
conſider the thing, and muſe on it, the
more obſcure and intricate it ſeemeth
to me. Which thing if the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
(which like to blind warriours,
wandring in darkneſſe) had done, they
would not have deviſed ſo many lies to
offend or diſpleaſe their Creator. For it
is better to be ignorant in the truth,
then to teach error. Therefore to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude

(as <hi>Macrobius</hi> writeth) There is
but one God,<note place="margin">One God.</note> ſubject to no mutability,

who ſaith by his Prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi> I am

ſpeak the truth, (as Scripture teacheth)
the beginning of man was in <hi>Jewry.</hi>
For God, when he had finiſhed the

of the Earth of the field of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> as
ſome think. Thus <hi>Adam,</hi> made by
God, marrying his Wife <hi>Eve,</hi> was au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour,
and beginner of the whole Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and Linage. But for as much as
God formed but one man, and indued
him with one kind of ſpeech onely, to
utter and declare the things that he
contained in his mind: men perchance
will marvail, what the cauſe ſhould be,
that there be at this day ſo many diverſe
languages,<note place="margin">Diverſity of ſpeeches.</note> that according to the variety
of Countries, there be ſundry ſpeeches.
And therefore I thought it convenient
to ſhew the occaſion of the ſame. When
<hi>Nimrod</hi> the ſon of <hi>Cham,</hi> that was ſon
to <hi>Noe,</hi> after the univerſal floud, went
about to withoraw men (which feared

ſhould not be able to overflow it.<note place="margin">Babylon.</note>
Whileſt they were thus earneſtly occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied

their ſpeeches in ſuch ſort, that
not one of them could underſtand ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
by reaſon of the diſcord and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeing
of their languages. And thus
began the diverſity of tongues that we
uſe now. The ſame was the occaſion
that the poſterities of <hi>Noe</hi> were diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
and ſcattered abroad.<note place="margin">Diviſion of Nations.</note> For when

there was a certain Kings daughter of

ſhe began by ſuch daily dalliance, to be

ſuppoſing one to be within, preſſed no

they were all together in the Court,
one of them departed from the other,

               <head>CHAP. VII. The Invention of Grammar.</head>
               <p>NExt the Letters, the invention of
grammer ordinarily ſucceeds, both
becauſe it is the foundation and ground
whereon all other Sciences reſt: and
alſo foraſmuch as it taketh the name of
letters; For <hi>Gramma</hi> in <hi>Greek</hi> ſignifieth
a Letter in <hi>Engliſh.</hi> Grammar is an Art
that doth conſiſt in ſpeaking &amp; writing
without fault, ſo that every word
have his due letters, and (as <hi>Quintilian</hi>
ſuppoſeth,<note place="margin">Two parts of Gramm</note> is divided into two parts: the
way to ſpeak congruouſly, and declaring
of Poets. As <hi>Tully</hi> writeth, there is
required in Gramarians, the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Poets, the knowledg of Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
expoſition of words, and a certain
utterance of pronunciation. It had the
beginning of marking and obſerving
what was moſt fit or unfitting in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,
which thing men coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeiting
in their ſpeech, made this
Art, even as Rhetorick was perceived.
For it is the duty both of Grammari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
and Oratours to have a regard and
reſpect, how to ſpeak. <hi>Hermippus</hi> ſaith
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:45258:16"/>
that <hi>Epicurus</hi> firſt taught the Art of
Grammer,<note place="margin">Epicurus taught Grammer first. Crates taught Grammer in Rome.</note> and <hi>Plato</hi> eſpyed and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
firſt the commodity and profit of
it. In <hi>Rome,</hi> it was nothing eſteemed
till one <hi>Crates Malotes</hi> was ſent by King
<hi>Attalus</hi> to the Senate to teach it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the ſecond and third battels of
<hi>Punicks,</hi> a little before the death of <hi>Enni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
the Poet. It is of all other Sciences
the moſt ſpecial, for it ſheweth a means
to attain all the reſt of the liberall Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.
Neither can a man come or
attain to any excellency in any Art, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
he have firſt his principles of
Grammer, perfectly known, and

               <p>Therefore in old time Grammarians
were called judges and allowers of all

it fortuned by reaſon that they

there was a law made, that no man

all ſorts of people, with nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

as they read to have been
done by their Anceſtors; and alſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courageth
and dehorteth wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons

deeds or crime, knowing, that ſuch acts
ſhall be regiſtred in perpetual memory,
to the praiſe or reproach of the doers,
according to the deſert of their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours.
<hi>Pliny</hi> writeth, That <hi>Cadmus

of <hi>Cyrus</hi> King of Perſia. Albeit, <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi>
ſuppoſeth it to be made probable,
that Hiſtories were begun by the old
Writers of the Hebrews; as in the time
of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which wrote the lives of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the eldeſt Hebrews,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Moſes</hi> did write the firſt Stories.</note> and the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

that their Prieſts were appointed
for that purpoſe, of putting in writing

                  <hi>Phereſides,</hi> a Syrian, wrote

For it is no doubt, but he that wrote
Hiſtories, wrote alſo Proſe firſt; and
<hi>Phereſides</hi> was long after <hi>Moſes,</hi> which
was 688 years before <hi>Joatham</hi> King of

                  <hi>Titus Livius,</hi> and
<hi>Caius Criſpius Saluſtius,</hi> with divers
other, were had in high eſtimation.
Before that time they uſed Annals or
Chronicles, which contained onely the
actions and facts of every day ſeverally.
The firſt office of an Hiſtoriographer,
is to write no lye. The ſecond, that he
ſhall conceal no truth for favour, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure
or fear. The perfection of an
Hiſtory, reſteth in matter and words.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:45258:21"/>
The order of the matter requireth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance
of times, deſcriptions of places,
the manners and lives of men, their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviours,
purpoſes, occaſions, deeds,
ſayings, caſualties, atchievings, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing
of things. The renour of the
words asketh a brief perſpicuity and
ſincere truth, with moderate and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
ornaments.</p>
               <p>We may be ſure,<note place="margin">Rhetorick.</note> that by and by after
men were formed, they received of God
the uſe of ſpeech, wherein when they
perceived ſome words to be profitable,
and ſome hurtfull in uttering of them:
they appointed and compiled an art of
ſpeech, or communication, called Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick.
Which (as <hi>Diodorus</hi> ſaith) was
invented by <hi>Mercury:</hi>

had in ſuch eſtimation; and ſo many,
partly for their defence, partly for glory

in it with ſuch endeavour, that very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

into the degree of Senatours, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieved

among the Grecians: among the
Romans,<note place="margin">Cicero.</note> 
                  <hi>Tullius Cicero</hi> had no fellow.
Now as touching the effect and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of it,<note place="margin">Parts of Rhetorick.</note> there be in it (as <hi>Cicero</hi> writeth)
five parts; firſt, to invent matter to
ſpeak; then, formally to order his devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
next, to poliſh it, and furniſh it
with elegant terms, and choyſe words,
and to have it in perfect memory: and
laſt of all, to utter it with a comely ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture,
in ſuch ſort, that it delight: for the
convenient treat ableneſſe thereof, doth
teach, and plainly declare the thing, and
move affections of pitty and favour, in
the hearts of Judges; or if the cauſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,

In terms of this faculty, we have
this difference; we call him that defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
matters, and pleadeth cauſes, an
Oratour. A Rhetoritian, is he that
teacheth or profeſſeth to be a School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter

all theſe (as I ſuppoſe) were

firſt the Science of the Stars, and for
as much as they feared leſt their Art
ſhould periſh, before it came to the
knowledg of men, (for they had heard
their grand-father <hi>Adam</hi> ſay, that all
things ſhould be deſtroyed by the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal

preſerve the letters whole and perfect,
and iu theſe Pillars they graved all that

it ſpread abroad in other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;

               <head>CHAP. X. Who found Truce, Leagues, ſundry kinds
of making Triumphs and
Ovations.</head>
               <p>TRuce (that is called a Covenant
of Peace for a ſeaſon) was inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
by <hi>Lycaon;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Truce.</note> it was taken
ſometimes for years,<note place="margin">Truce for Years.</note> as the Romans
took truce with the Veientes for fourty
years;<note place="margin">Hours.</note> with the <hi>Cerites</hi> for an hundred:
ſometimes Truce was made for hours,
as <hi>Caius Pontius,</hi> a Samnite, required
of the Dictator of Rome, truce for ſix
hours. Leagues of peace, <hi>Theſeus</hi> did
ordain in Greece; but <hi>Diodorus</hi> aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it to <hi>Mercury.</hi> Nevertheleſſe, they
were in frequent uſe long before that
time in Aſſyria and Egypt, and name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
among the Hebrews. For <hi>Jacob</hi>
made a league with <hi>Laban.</hi> And <hi>Moſes</hi>
offered conditions of peace to the
Princes of the Countries, by whom he
paſſed: and after him, <hi>Joſhua</hi> confirmed
a bond of peace with the Gibeonites.
Therfore it is a great difficulty to know
the inventor of it. There were divers fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions
of making Leagues, as the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:45258:52"/>
manner was thus; The Herauld
of Arms at commandement of the
King, took a hogg appointed for that
purpoſe, and ſmote him, ſaying; So
let <hi>Jupiter</hi> ſmite him, that diſannulleth
this holy league. But <hi>Polybius</hi> writeth,
that the Herauld took a ſtone in his
hand, and ſaid; If I p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rform and ſtand
to the Covenant of this league, without
guile or fraud, the gods give me all
things proſperous. If I either do o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
think the contrary, I pray God that I
alone be deſtroyed and caſt away, as I
caſt this ſtone from me; and forthwith
he threw down the ſtone. When the
Arabians made a league of peace, there
ſtood one between the two parties,
that did cut it with a ſharp ſtone, the
hollow of the hand of the confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates,
and with the blood that iſſued
out, he anointed ſeven ſtones that
ſtand between them, with raggs taken
out of their garments, and invocateth
<hi>Dionyſius</hi> and <hi>Urania</hi> their gods: then
the Sollicirer giveth ſurety for the
ſtranger or Citizen that was of his part.
The like order was uſed in Amities
made among friends.</p>
               <p>The Scythians made Leagues after
this manner: They filled a bowl of
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:45258:52"/>
Wine, and mingled it with the bloud
of him that ſhould enter the bond of
peace, and then they wet their Arrows,
Axes, Halberds and Darts in the bowl:
that done, they with many words vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and curſed themſelves, and ſo drunk
the Wine, both they, and all the Nobles
preſent. The ſame uſe was among
traytors in their Conſpiracies at <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Barceans</hi> conſented on their
leagues thus:<note place="margin">Barceans League.</note> they made their day of
Confederacy, over a cave very privy,
and ſo long as the earth continued, ſo
the pact endured. <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> which
was repleniſhed with the ſpo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Nations, as the Captains of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi>
when they ſped well, trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phed.
In Rome, <hi>Romulus,</hi> after he had
conquered <hi>Acron</hi> King of <hi>Cenineus</hi>
crowned with Laurell and carryed in a
Chariot with four horſes, entred into
the City triumphantly. And dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

chains and Fetters about their necks.
And the Senate going before into the
Capitol of <hi>Jupiter's</hi> Temple, where they
offered a white Bull, and then return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
It was lawful for none to triumph,
but ſuch as were Dictator, Conſul, or
Pretor. Albeit, <hi>Cneius Pompeius,</hi> being
but of the Order of Knights, triumphed,
as <hi>Cicero</hi> telleth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ovation</hi> is a leſſe Royalty then

as had ended any battel, or atchieved
any Feat without blood-ſhedding; or
when the battel lacked any of the due

came into the City with that pomp,
were crowued with a garland of Myr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till;
And went on foot into the Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol,
all the Senate following him, and
there offered a ſheep. The firſt that

of more antiquity then <hi>Bacchus.</hi> For
<hi>Moſes;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Moſes.</note> that was many years before him,
made many Crowns and Garlands of
gold. At the firſt, the manner was,
in all Playes and Sacrifices, to make
Garlands of boughs of Trees. And
after they were garniſhed with variety
of flowers among the <hi>Sicionians,</hi> by
<hi>Pauſias,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pauſias.</note> and <hi>Glicera</hi> his leman. Not
long after, Winter Garlands, that be
called Egyptian, which are made of
wood or Ivory, did with many colours,
began to be had in uſe. And in proceſs,
they made Crowns of braſen plates gilt
or covered with ſilver, called for their
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:45258:54"/>
thinneſs, garlands. Laſtly, <hi>Craſſus</hi> the
Rich did firſt ſet forth, in his Games and
Shews, Crowns with ſilver and golden
leaves. And conſequently there were
invented many manner of Crowns.
As the triumphant Crown, that the
Emperour or grand Captain ware in his
triumph; this was firſt made of Olive,
and afterward of gold. The murall or
wall crown, that was given to him
that ſcaled firſt the Walls. The Camp-Crown,
that was the reward of him
that entred firſt in Arms, into the Camp
of his enemies. Naval or Sea-Crown,
which was ſet on his head, that firſt
boarded his enemies ſhip. And all
theſe were of gold. The Obſidionall
Crown, that was worn of him that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
a City beſieged, and was made
of Graſſe. There was alſo a Civill
Crown, which was a Sovereignty that
a Citizen gave to him, that had valiant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
preſerved him from his enemies;
this was made of Oaken branches. And
this manner of Crown the <hi>Athenians</hi>
did firſt deviſe,<note place="margin">Pericles.</note> and gave it to <hi>Pericles.</hi>
There were moreover Crowns of
Pearls, Trench Crowns and Garlands,
compoſed of the ears of Corn, which
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:45258:54"/>
as <hi>Pliny</hi> witneſſeth, was firſt in uſe
among the Romans. But Garlands
made of Cynamon, woven and imboſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with gold, <hi>Veſpaſianus</hi> did firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate
in the Capitol, in the Temple of
Peace.</p>
               <p>In ſome ſpace of years, the exceſſe of
Crowns was ſuch, that the Grecians
in their Banquets, crowned both their
heads and Cups alſo,<note place="margin">Cups were crowned.</note> whereof the <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
were authors. By this ſort of
Crowns, <hi>Cleopatra</hi> empoiſoned <hi>Antonie,</hi>

Crowns of Garlands in his Feaſts: to

is a fable not to be credited. The uſe of
Rings and precious ſtones is of great

gave his daughter in Law <hi>Thamar</hi>
a Ring, and broches, as pledges of his

of the Ark and veſtures of <hi>Aaron,</hi>
as Oriches and Smaragdus, or Emrode.
In <hi>Rome</hi> at the firſt they uſed Rings of
Iron every man ſaving the Tribunes.
It was long before the Senatours had
any Rings of Gold,<note place="margin">Rings ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to Seal Letters.</note> and as <hi>Macrobius</hi>
writeth, they uſed them, not ſo much
for trimming and decking of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,

that it was not permitted to
any man to have more then one, and
that was allowed to none but Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.<note place="margin">Aman might have but one Ring</note>
Afterwards they began to grave
Seals in precious ſtones. And leaſt they
ſhould be broken with ſtreſſe,<note place="margin">Rings were worn on the left hand.</note> they ware
them on the finger of the left hand, that
is next the little finger, becauſe the left
hand is not put to ſo much labour as
the right hand, or elſe (as <hi>Macrobius</hi>
ſaith) becauſe there goeth a Vein from

               <p>IN <hi>Phoenice,</hi> which is a part of <hi>Syria.</hi>
at the foot of the Mount <hi>Carmel,</hi>
there is a Pool called <hi>Candebea,</hi> whereof
the River <hi>Belus</hi> ſpringerh, in the which,
Glaſſe, as <hi>Pliny</hi> writeth, is ingendred.
For it is reported that on a time when
a Merchants Ship, that was fraighted
with Salt-peeter (for ſo ſome expound
<hi>nitrum</hi>) arrived there; and as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
their meat on the ſands and Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banks:
It fortuned that becauſe they
had no ſtore of ſtones to bear up their
Veſſels, wherein they ſod their meat,
they took great pieces of Nitre out of
their Ship to ſet their Victuals on,
which after they chanced to be on fire,
and mingled with the ſand, there ran
bright flakes of this precious Liquor.
By this River is <hi>Menon's</hi> Tomb, and as

               <p>The ſacrifices that were offered to

<hi>Hercules</hi> as he paſſed through <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
when he had conquered and ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Gerion,</hi> advertiſed them to change
that unlucky ſacrifice into fortunate

Images of heads of men to <hi>Pluto:</hi> And
to light Tapers of Wax in honour of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.
Lactantius</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Prometheus made Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</note> 
                  <hi>Prometheus</hi> made

               <p>Notwithſtanding I find that Images
were long before that time: For <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel,</hi>
when her Husband fled out of

And ſome think that men took occaſion

in ſundry places to attribute to
him hands, feet, eyes, and ears, which
be parts and members of men. And by
this means men received the manner
of making Images of God, becauſe to
keep him in freſh memory. And this
is the true Original of Imagery. <hi>Spuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
Caſſius</hi> made in <hi>Rome</hi> the Image of
<hi>Ceros</hi> in braſſe.<note place="margin">Ceres Image of Braſſe.</note> Afterwards ſtatues of
men were made, to excite and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
valiant hearts to high enterpriſes.
And for that cauſe the <hi>Athenians</hi> ſet up
the Images of <hi>Hermodius</hi> and <hi>Ariſtogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
that ſlew and expulſed the Tyrants.
<hi>Leontinus Gorgias,</hi> made himſelf an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
of pure Gold, not hollow, firſt;
and ſet it in <hi>Delphos</hi> the 78th Olympi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad.
<hi>Pharnaces</hi> cauſed one to be made

Attilius Glabrio,</hi> made the firſt ſtatue of

               <p>The manner of the <hi>Romans</hi> was to

                  <hi>Grecians</hi> uſed to form them naked, and

and <hi>Laban,</hi> after he knew him to be

cuſtome was to kiſſe their kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk,
but afterwards it was extended to
further familiarity, and is now frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
very laſciviouſly. Albeit, in <hi>Rome</hi>
it was an Ordinance, that Women

               <p>The uſe of dedicating Churches,<note place="margin">Dedicating of Churches.</note> is of
great antiquity: for <hi>Moſes</hi> did ſanctifie
the Tabernacle; and <hi>Solomon</hi> conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

hallowed the Temple new again. Of

               <p>Fire was kept continually on the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar
by the Prieſts; for without it and
ſalt, could no ſacrifice be duly made, or
ordinarily offered; and we in our Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
have ever a Taper of Wax burning.
And the Emperours of Rome had Fire
born before them, and the Veſtals had

they ſerved <hi>Vesta.</hi>

Chriſt all deſtroyed. For when he was
carried into Egypt, which is a Country
full of ſuperſtition and Idolatry, all the
Idols of that Region were overthrown,

thither. And in the time of <hi>Adrian</hi>

were aboliſhed, and alſo the Oracles of

at the beginning inſtituted; that men

               <p>Alms, in like manner, ſprung of the

<pb n="225" facs="tcp:45258:114"/>
and ſuch other calamiries, as be in
our mortal life, they were conſtrained
to deſire ayd and ſuccour of other men,
as of alms. Albeit <hi>Moſes</hi> was the firſt
that ever preſcribed any law of giving
alms, as appeareth in the book of <hi>Deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teronomy.</hi>
Charitable alms muſt be ſo
freely given, that we exempt none from
the uſe and part-taking of it; and, as the

faſted with repentance.</p>
               <p>The Jews alſo in their law, ſo oft as
they either asked any benefit of God, or
would pacifie his wrath, or render
thanks for his benefits, or kept any ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn

And certainly he keepeth not the true

Albeit the other is a coadjutor to that

for their Wines. The other <hi>Robigalia,</hi>
for all their grain, leſt it ſhould be

<hi>Silveſter</hi> the firſt, Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi>

Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, and Saturn,
ſhould be called the firſt, ſecond, third,

as the Jews counted their dayes from
the Sabbath day. He did alſo call the
firſt Ferie, <hi>Dominicus Dies,</hi> that we name
Sunday, and called Saturday <hi>Sabbatum</hi>
of the old holy day, and reſt of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews:</hi>
all theſe things were done at the

ordained the Eaſter to be kept on the

did but onely renew the ſame Act of
the Sunday. It was the invention of
the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> that the dayes were firſt
named after the 7 Planets, as <hi>Diodorus</hi>

               <p>The manner to read a part of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
at dinner time, hath been of long
continuance, and did proceed of the
Godly doctrine, that Chriſt inſtructed
his Diſciples in, at all times, but namely
at his laſt Supper, wherein he treated of
the perfection of all the Myſteries of
our Religion. And thus our fathers, to
keep in memory ſuch an wholeſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,

<hi>Plutarch</hi> writeth that the Women in
their mourning layed a part all Purple,
Gold, and ſumptuous apparel, and were
cloathed both they and their Kinsfolk
in white apparel, like as then the dead
body was wrapped in white cloths.</p>
               <p>The white colour was thought fitteſt
for the dead, becauſe it is clear, pure
and ſincere, and leaſt defiled, and when
the time of their weeping was expired,
they put on their other veſtures. Of
this Ceremony, (as I take it,) the <hi>French</hi>
Queens took occaſion,<note place="margin">French Queens in their Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow-hood wear white cloathing.</note> after the death

that Corn ſhould be conſecrated on

burned in the Hebrews Synagogue, and
that Decree remaineth ſtill in effect in
ſome places. But the Prieſts vertue is
ſo old, and mens devotion waxeth ſo
cold, that inſtead of the firſt-fruits, now
adayes the people uſe to bring, on the
Sundayes, a few loaves of bread; in ſome
places two or three, as they be diſpoſed,

they eat this bread hallowed in memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial

               <p>

Others there be, that ſay one <hi>Redo,</hi> Earl

               <p>As concerning the Channons Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,

in this rule and form of living, wherein
they have been ſo long trained and nuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

either the inventour of the Sect,

                  <pb n="261" facs="tcp:45258:132"/>
The Channons cloathing was a white
Coat, and a linnen rochet under a black
cope, with a Scapular to cover their
head and ſhoulders: The Hermites have a
contrary veſture, a black coat with a ſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular,
and another coat of white, and a
Lether Girdle. Of theſe there were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
other orders. As the order of St.

                  <note place="margin">The Order of Cannons or Hermites.</note> which were

the 11th, by his conſent, confirmed them

               <p>The <hi>Friſonaries</hi> is another Order,

that repaired thither at ſuch ſolemn

ſacrifices, <hi>Stations,</hi> becauſe they were
celebrated on certain dayes limited and
preſcribed by Statute. <hi>Bonifacius</hi> the

the year of Jubilee, or grace, to
be kept every hundred year with clean
remiſſion <hi>à poena et culpa,</hi> to all them
that viſited the Temples of the Apoſtles
<hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul.</hi> And this was taken
up of the example of the Hebrews, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
they did keep it every 50. years; or
elſe, as ſome think, he aſſigned the years
according to the old Feaſts of <hi>Apollo</hi> and
<hi>Diana,</hi> which the Romans Heathen ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnized
every hundred year; and of
that they were called <hi>Ludi ſeculares.</hi>
About fifty years after, <hi>Clement</hi> the
ſixth decreed, That it ſhould be celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
every fifty years, as the Hebrews rite
was, becauſe no man was able to attain
the old Jubilee of an hundred years.
Laſt of all, <hi>Sextus</hi> the fourth reſtrained
the year of grace to the 25th year, and
he himſelf kept it at that day, which
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:45258:143"/>
was in the year of Gods grace ſhewed
by his Son Jeſus Chriſt to the World, a

fifteen. About the ſame time, Pardons
were much uſed, but who was the firſt

a thing worthy of conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

               <p>The moſt noble and rich men had
their Buttons made of Gold.<note place="margin">The ſeveral materials of Buttons.</note> The men
ſort of people uſed Silver. The pooreſt

Souldiers (as <hi>Vopiſcus</hi> teſtifies). Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
had the ſummity or top of their
Buttons made of Jewels, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the whole Button it ſelf. The
Emperour <hi>Leo</hi> commanded that ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
ſhould uſe ſuch Buttons as were one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

rewards, were wont to give a Golden

fought with a generous and ſtout cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
as <hi>Livy</hi> often mentioneth.</p>
               <p>The Antients uſed to wear a ſhort

wear a purple Coat called <hi>Latus-Clavur?</hi>
For they faſtned the ſides of it together,
with Godlen Buttons, which were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:45258:152"/>
in <hi>Latine, Latos Clavos,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they did not gird their Coats. This
kind of Garment was the token of Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours.</p>
               <p>When it was cold,<note place="margin">Cloaks.</note> they did wear a
Cloak under their Gowns which was
fringed, and Knights moſt commonly
uſed it, as <hi>Iſidore</hi> declareth.</p>
               <p>In Rainy weather, (as <hi>Martial</hi> ſaith)
they did put on a Cloak made of Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
or skins, which they did wear above
their Coat. They went without Hoſe
to cover their legs, and for that cauſe
when the duſt remained on them, they
waſhed them every day (as <hi>Quintilian</hi>
aſſerts). <hi>Pompey</hi> having a ſwelling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his ſhin, covered it with a binding of
linnen, and a Bracelet, ſo that a certain
man ſaid in ſport, that he ware that on
his leg, which Kings did bear on their
heads. Footmen did wear hoſe or leg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>harneſſe,
which the <hi>Latines</hi> called <hi>Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge,</hi>
whence the Souldiers were called
<hi>Caligati.</hi> Likewiſe they had ſhort-Cloaks
or Caſſocks, which faſtned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their Chin, and when they were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to fight, they caſt it upon both their
ſhoulders; and, that they might be nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler
to reſiſt their enemies, they girded
it about them, (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> doth recite)</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="302" facs="tcp:45258:153"/>
Noble-men and horſemen, did put
on Boots made of Hides, that came up
to their knees; and from thence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
they were armed with Iron.</p>
               <p>There is a great doubt riſen, whether
the Ancients uſed a covering for their
heads or no: ſeeing that it is neither
manifeſt in ancient coins nor ſtatues.
Certainly they uſed not a Hat, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
the one half of an Egg ſhell,
when it was cut in the middeſt, for that
was given to ſuch that were manumit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from their ſervitude. Moreover,
<hi>Suetonius</hi> relates, that <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi>
having found that the deformity of
baldneſſe was obnoxious, becauſe of the
jeers of detractors, he accuſtomed to
turn back the hair which grew behind
his Crown to cover the baldneſſe of his
head: but when he could not hide it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
by this means, he uſurped the
cuſtome of wearing a Crown of Laurell
continually; which care had been ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous,
if any covering for the head
had been in uſe.</p>
               <p>But this may be ſaid that the inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Hats was uſed to defend the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
againſt the Sun. And on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<hi>Plutarch</hi> writes that <hi>Sylla</hi> did riſe
to no man, nor uncover his head, but
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:45258:153"/>
when <hi>Pompey</hi> came. <hi>Varro</hi> affirms,
that according to the inſtitutions of the
Ancients, every one was to uncover
his head to any Magiſtrate paſſing by,
and that more for health then honour:
which Controverſy I will not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
but leave this field to others,
wherein they may exerciſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>It plainly appears, that in the year
one thouſand one hundred and ſeventy,
there was a certain ſort of Hats, that
was black, and aſcended ſmaller to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the top, like a <hi>Pyramide.</hi> And
<hi>Nicetas,</hi> in the life of <hi>Alexius Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenus,</hi>
writeth, that when the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<hi>Andronicus Comnenns</hi> was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
a certain Hat which he had, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
taken off, in the place thereof there
was a Purple or red Mitte put upon

But I believe that it is very ancient; for

when <hi>Jaſon</hi> went to take away the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den

then a certain book, that taught to turn

               <p>Many things were ingeniouſly inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in this our Age, which were totally

a means to make a <hi>Saphyr</hi> white,<note place="margin">A Saphyre made white.</note> ſo that
it may ſeem to be Adamant: And ſo it is
wont to be faſtned in Rings, that no man,
though never ſo skillfull, can diſcern it

as were skillfull in this Art, ſaid that
that Saphir could not be diſtinguiſhed

               <p>Alchymiſts alſo produce a certain kind
of Tin,<note place="margin">Tin like Silver.</note> which you would think were
true Silver, which being ſtruck with a
Hammer, remains firm and conſtant the

many other notable inventions.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe they have found out ſtrong
waters,<note place="margin">Aqua-fort is</note> wherewith they ſeparate Braſſe
from Silver and Gold, which could not

the Lawyer affirms in <hi>lib.</hi> 5. §. 3. <hi>ff. De

Braſſe were mixed with Gold, it could
not be deducted. Thoſe ſtrong waters
do wonderfully trouble the ſight, when
they ſeparate Gold from Silver. For
the Silver may be ſeen to aſcend through
the middle, as if it were ſome certain
Column; and it is changed into green,
red, and other colours, and at laſt it is
ſcattered in the water, ſo that the Silver
can be ſeen no more, but all is full of
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:45258:156"/>
water, the Gold remaining in the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Cupella</hi> was lately found; that

conſent; that though at the firſt ſight it
may ſeem to be concluded negatively,
foraſmuch as it belongs to God alone
to change one ſubſtance into another,
becauſe no man though of never ſo great
fame, can perform that; And therefore
the Devill when he tempted Chriſt, as if
he were in doubt, whether he were the
Son of God, or no; ſaid, <hi>If thou art the
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:45258:156"/>
Son of God, cauſe that theſe ſtones may
be made bread,</hi> that is, <hi>Do ſomething
which onely belongs to God to do.</hi> Yet
they concluded at laſt, that <hi>Alchymy</hi>
was lawfull. And upon this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,
viz. becauſe all mettals pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
out of Sulphur and Quick-ſilver,
which the Alchymiſts call <hi>Mercury,</hi>
which if they receive Ayre, Water, and
Heat ſufficient, are turned into Gold, but
if they want a fit temper, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be brought to that perfection, then
they make Silver, Tin, Lead, or Braſſe,
according to the influence and diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Elements. Therefore humane
Art doth not turn one ſubſtance into
another, but heat and temperament;
Sulphur and Quickſilver having the
force and power to turn into Gold, and
if it cannot be done by reaſon of ſome
defect, then the Alchymiſts do ſupply
that heat and temperament by their Art,
which will bring the Sulphur into the
ſubſtance of Gold, as well as if it had
been natural. <hi>John Andrea,</hi> a noted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter
of the Pontifical Law; writeth,
that <hi>Arnoldus de villa nova,</hi> turned Braſs
into little Rods of Gold, in the Roman
Court, many Cardinals being preſent;
and preſently departing, he left it to any
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:45258:157"/>
ſort of trial. The Art may be true, but
I believe that there are very few, yea,
ſcarce one that is expert in it. For thoſe
that profeſſe it, are either Fools, or much
inclined to poverty. Therefore it is an
ancient Proverb, <hi>I never ſaw a rich
