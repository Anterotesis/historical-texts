            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>MY Idle Muse that long hath bin at ease,</l>
            <l>Not daring to lanche forth into the seas</l>
            <l>Of these distemper'd times, doth now at last</l>
            <l>Her former sluggishnesse quite fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her cast,</l>
            <l>And with earnest desiers which are not weake,</l>
            <l>Wisheth she might one word unto you speake:</l>
            <l>But not to jeere your Lordship; No not I,</l>
            <l>It is a thing I alwayes did defie;</l>
            <l>But in plaine honest termes, let me begin,</l>
            <l>A soule-convincing song to you to sing.</l>
            <l>What was the cause! O thou that sate so high,</l>
            <l>To steare the sterne of our prosperity:</l>
            <l>That thou so plainly to the world did'st show,</l>
            <l>Thou sought'st to guide us to our overthrow?</l>
            <l>What was the reason! may I be so bold</l>
            <l>To aske the question, was it store of Gold</l>
            <l>Thou did'st aime at, for to gratifie,</l>
            <l>Thy vast desiers, and to satisfie</l>
            <l>Thy covetous and carnall appetite,</l>
            <l>And by that meanes to raise thee up delight?</l>
            <l>Then hadst thou thy desiers, gold good store</l>
            <l>Came in unto thee, dayly more and more;</l>
            <l>Thousands, yea many thousands was the rate,</l>
            <l>Which came in yearly thee to satiate;</l>
            <l>Thy lands and livings which are large and great,</l>
            <l>Thy Courts, wherein was thy judicall seat,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:54118:2"/>Thy fees, thy fines, thy Incomes every way,</l>
            <l>Still brought thee store of gold both night &amp; day,</l>
            <l>Yet was all this too little, that thou must</l>
            <l>Seeke still for more, by wayes which were unjust?</l>
            <l>Must thou take bribes? Nay, which me thinkes is more?</l>
            <l>Sell justice to augment thy boundles store,</l>
            <l>Yea sell judiciall places too, which were</l>
            <l>Misused by them, that bought them for to reare</l>
            <l>Their summes of money up againe and so,</l>
            <l>Injustice from thy Courts did daily flo?</l>
            <l>Or was it honour, that thou sought'st to gaine?</l>
            <l>Did that vaine shadow flote upon thy braine?</l>
            <l>Did thy desires strive to pluck that floure,</l>
            <l>Which wither will, thou seest in halfe an houre?</l>
            <l>Why then thou had'st it in a large degree,</l>
            <l>No man in all the land exceeded thee.</l>
            <l>Thy place and person both adorned were:</l>
            <l>With titles which did store of honours beare?</l>
            <l>Thou was't <hi>Archbishop</hi> of old <hi>Canterbury</hi>;</l>
            <l>Which title for to grace it, grace did carry;</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Primate</hi> and <hi>Metropolitan</hi> of all</l>
            <l>Those large Confines, which we doe <hi>England</hi> call,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Oxfords</hi> chiefe Chancellor thou wast also,</l>
            <l>And ruld'st that place, from whence great Arts do flo?</l>
            <l>Yet all this was too little to content,</l>
            <l>Thy large desiers, which were daily bent,</l>
            <l>To be some body greater then all this,</l>
            <l>Some say thou hop'st that men thy toe shal kisse:</l>
            <l>For thus they say, but 'tis a lye I hope,</l>
            <l>Thou look'st to be a Cardinall or Pope:</l>
            <l>And yet tis evident thou faine wouldst be</l>
            <l>Something above the pitch of thy degree:</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:54118:3"/>Or else thou wouldst not have us guided all</l>
            <l>By Lawes which onely did thee maker call.</l>
            <l>Was it a small thing in thine eyes to be</l>
            <l>Rais'd to a place of so much dignitie:</l>
            <l>From such a meane and low degree as thou,</l>
            <l>Made Lord of them, and they to thee must bow,</l>
            <l>Which did deserve the place better then thee,</l>
            <l>Except that thou might'st use such tyrannie</l>
            <l>Over thy brethren, as to make them yeeld</l>
            <l>To what thou pleasedst, or to flye the field:</l>
            <l>Or else both soules and bodies beare the thrall,</l>
            <l>Which from thy sterne austeritie did fall?</l>
            <l>What was the cause, J pray thee let us know,</l>
            <l>(And now at last in plaine tearmes to us show:)</l>
            <l>Thou soughtest for to lead us in a way,</l>
            <l>Which God hath not commanded to obey?</l>
            <l>What didst thou make thy selfe? a God on Earth?</l>
            <l>Hast thou forgot the place of thy meane birth,</l>
            <l>That thou so proudly shouldst upon thee take,</l>
            <l>New duties, and new Doctrines for to make:</l>
            <l>And by thy strict command inforce us all,</l>
            <l>Thy wayes, the wayes of God and truth to call?</l>
            <l>And to that end didst many men exalt,</l>
            <l>Which 'twixt thy waies, &amp; Gods did alwais halt,</l>
            <l>And gav'st them store of <hi>worldly wealth</hi> and places,</l>
            <l>Still favouring them in their base sinfull cases:</l>
            <l>That so they might preach thee not <hi>Christ</hi> to men,</l>
            <l>Nay many thou exaltst, which with their pen;</l>
            <l>And in their preaching too, did much disgrace</l>
            <l>The name of <hi>Christ,</hi> and sought for to deface</l>
            <l>That glorious name, by which we saved are;</l>

               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:54118:3"/>And if a zealous Pastor did desire,</l>
            <l>To doe that which his calling did require:</l>
            <l>Which was to tell the people of their sinne,</l>
            <l>And shew them the true way for to walke in</l>
            <l>Then presently, he must suspended be,</l>
            <l>And quite deposed of his Ministery;</l>
            <l>Though ne're so antient, learned, grave, and wise:</l>
            <l>Yet all this seemed nothing in your eyes?</l>
            <l>Though wife and children should a begging goe,</l>
            <l>You did not care, you did not feele their woe,</l>
            <l>And some base Fellow then his place must take,</l>
            <l>Which never any Conscience yet did make</l>
            <l>Of what he taught, or how he lived, onely</l>
            <l>To please your grace, he alwayes had an eye,</l>
            <l>And would at your command, both cringe &amp; bow</l>
            <l>And sing a Masse, if you would it allow:</l>
            <l>They were the men you did so much esteeme;</l>
            <l>And those that lik'd the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, you did <hi>Christians</hi> deem:</l>

            <l>That best could preach over their <hi>Taverne pots</hi>?</l>
            <l>No! though your grace thought ignorance to be</l>

            <l>What! did you rule the King, or he rule you?</l>
            <l>Surely I thinke the former to be true;</l>
            <l>For he good man put all his trust in you,</l>

            <l>Alas! you know, that <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> came downe,</l>

            <l>They did him and his Office typisie,</l>
            <l>And he once come, they all must straightway die;</l>
            <l>And yet, you needs must set them up again,</l>

            <l>
               <hi>Christ</hi> did all <hi>Altars</hi> utterly deface,</l>
