            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THere was formerly a <hi>Narrative</hi> publiſhed, giving thee an Account of the <hi>Chooſing, Comming together, Secluding of ſome,</hi> and <hi>Sitting of the reſt</hi> of the late <hi>Parliament</hi> (ſo called,) as alſo of the things that did attend them, and the <hi>Acts</hi> that were <hi>paſſed</hi> by them: The goodneſſe of which <hi>Acts,</hi> with their tendency to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave and Oppreſſe the Nation, is ſadly experienced (to the Coſt and Sorrow) of not a few; For inſtance, Firſt, that Wicked, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt, and Oppreſſive <hi>Act</hi> for <hi>New Buildings,</hi> under which many a Soul hath groaned; ſome though having in the laſt <hi>16,</hi> or <hi>18</hi> Years paſt, paid twice the value of their Houſes in <hi>Taxes,</hi> have thereby been forced, unleſſe they will be plundred or caſt into Priſon, to pay a Years Rent more; in the cruell proſecution of which <hi>Act</hi> many ſad Caſes have fallen out. Secondly, the <hi>Act</hi> for the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe,</hi> impoſing it for ever (with the <hi>Cuſtoms)</hi> as a ſtanding Revenue to the <hi>Crown,</hi> and letting it out to Farm, to the horrible Oppreſſion of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſetting up Patentees to Rule them at pleaſure. Thirdly, An <hi>Act</hi> for a three Years Tax to pay the Souldiers, where the Great ones get all, and the Inferiours very little, but are behinde near a year; many of them living on Tickets, whileſt their great Leaders ruffle in their Gallantry: And as if that were not enough, did then Order a Three Moneths Tax to be paid twice over. And to name but one more (for brevity ſake) Fourthly, an <hi>Act</hi> for a <hi>High Court</hi> (ſo called) of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> for the Preſervation of the Protectors Perſon, as if the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Souldiers</hi> were not as ſufficient to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect him now, as when he was <hi>Generall,</hi> but an <hi>Arbitrary</hi> and <hi>Illegall Court</hi> muſt be erected in a time of Peace, to take away the Lives of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons at their pleaſure.</p>
            <p>There is likewiſe in that <hi>Narrative</hi> a Catalogue, or an Account given of One hundred eighty two of the Members of that unworthy Aſſembly, who were Sons, Kinſmen, Servants, and otherwiſe engaged unto, and had Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Profit, Offices, Sallaries, <note n="*" place="margin">Which amounts unto in the whole, one million ſixteen thouſand three hundred and ſeventeen pounds ſixteen ſhillings and eight pence <hi>per An.</hi> according to the favourableſt computation by the former Narrative, or Book of Rates. As it was ſaid there, ſo here: If there be any miſtakes, they are deſired who beſt know, to rectifie them; if not, then what is here mentioned may be taken for granted. <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did not eat the bread of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venor; why muſt ſo great Sallaries be continued to them who have gotten ſo much already. The Taxes raiſed from the people to pay this, doth ruine thouſands.</note>and Advantages under the Protector, (ſo called) whereby it doth appear, what fine Suckers they are of the Riches and Fatneſſe of this Commonwealth, and how unlikely they were, being ſo pack'd for his Intereſt, and ſo well ſeaſoned with the Salt of his Palace, <hi>(Ezra 4. 14.)</hi> to bring forth the ſo much <hi>Prayed, Engaged, Fought,</hi> and <hi>Bled for</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:51844:3"/>
Rights and Liberties of the People. After ſome Queries propoſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, follows a Catalogue of the <hi>Kinglings,</hi> or the Names of thoſe Seventy perſons, (moſt of them being the Protectors Kinſmen, and Sallary-men) that voted for <hi>Kingſhip,</hi> with the Counties for which they ſerved, that ſo they may be remembred, and called to an account hereafter. After this, there is mentioned, how that the Now Government, of the <hi>Humble Petition</hi> and <hi>Advice,</hi> pretended by them to be then ſettled, was carried in the <hi>Houſe</hi> but by three Voices, fifty three againſt fifty; as alſo that it was contrary to the Deſires of the good People of the Nation, but not being able at that time to get the Names of thoſe fifty three perſons, who alſo highly deſerve to be taken notice of, they were not therein mentioned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>You have alſo thoſe Members of that Aſſembly, who though they gave not their Vote either for King-ſhip, or the then Government by the <hi>Humble Petition and Advice,</hi> but protended to be againſt, and diſſatisfied with both, ſharply, and juſtly reproved, for betraying the <hi>Truſt</hi> committed to them by the People. Firſt, for being ſo Sneaking, and Cowardly in their Spirits, as to ſuffer their Fellow Members to be Secluded from them; and the Council, who had nothing to do with it, ſo to intrench upon their Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, as to let none ſit but whom they approved of. <hi>Secondly,</hi> For being ſo ready to comply to <hi>Sit,</hi> or <hi>Adjourn</hi> at the Protectors pleaſure, as if they were his Servants, and not he theirs. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That when they ſaw the Liberties of the People endeavoured to be violated afreſh by the <hi>Kinglings,</hi> and alſo really given away by the afore-mentioned fifty three perſons, who petitioned and adviſed the <hi>Protector</hi> (ſo called) to take the <hi>Government</hi> upon him, and to chuſe his Succeſſour; they did not Cry out; Proteſt, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare againſt, and withdraw from them, which being their duty they ought to have done; in doing whereof, thoſe unparallel'd wickedneſſes would of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity have fallen to the ground: but inſtead thereof went on with them, ſtifeling their own Conſciences, and endeavouring to ſatisfie their oppreſſed Brethren, by ſaying, <hi>He had not the Title of King;</hi> as if all the Evill, Oppreſſion, and Arbitrarineſſe lay in that; when as at the ſame time, he hath the ſame, and no leſſe power, then if he had the Title, and were called King. Yea, a far greater Power then what coſt ſo much Blood and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, to oppſe in the late <hi>King;</hi> and that theſe ſlight Pretences would not be Plea ſufficient to excuſe them, in the day of their Account for ſo doing. After which, ſome general Queries being ſoberly propoſed as a cloſe to the whole, is the Concluſion of that <hi>Narrative.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now here thou wilt finde related ſome of the moſt remarkable Paſſages which occur'd in their ſecond Seſſion, with the end, and diſſolution of the whole, after two or three Weeks ſitting. As alſo ſomething of another <hi>Houſe,</hi> (though Nameleſſe yet) covertly intended for a <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Lords,</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:51844:3"/>
with a Deſcription of forty three of them, by all which thou mayeſt be able in ſome meaſure to reſolve thy thoughts concerning the change of the <hi>Cauſe</hi> and <hi>Principles,</hi> which theſe great Maſters formerly carried on, and profeſſe to do ſo ſtill. It is notoriouſly known how even the chief of them ſometime ſaid, <hi>It would never be well, neither ſhould we ever ſee good Dayes, whileſt there was one Lord left in</hi> England, <hi>nor untill you</hi> (ſpeaking ſo to him) <hi>my Lord of</hi> Mancheſter <hi>be called Mr.</hi> Montague: yet now new Lords muſt be made by the dozens. What Declaring, what Fighting hath there been, and how much Bloud and Treaſure ſpent againſt a <hi>Negative Voice,</hi> in the King and Lords? Yet now, not onely the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector</hi> himſelf, forſooth, but all his new upſtart Lords, ſuch as were our equals, or it may be below us, muſt Lord it over us, with their No, to our I. Is not the world growne mad? were there ever ſuch wonders before? To fancy what after Ages will think of theſe men, who pretend to be of the Saints of theſe times, will never make a perſon melancholy that ſhall be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in it. Not to trouble thee further, eye God more, and Men leſſe, and that will ſtay and quiet thy Spirit: and ſay to thy ſelf as the Pſalmiſt did, <hi>(Pſal. 62. 5, 9.) My ſoul wait thou onely upon God, for my expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is from him. Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lye.</hi>

            <p>The Other Houſe, who would fain have the Honour to be called <hi>Lords,</hi> or rather a <hi>Houſe of Lords,</hi> did likewiſe in their Houſe pray at the ſame time with much Devotion, and did afterwards agree to ſend to the Parliament, (or as they would have them again called, <hi>the Houſe of Commons)</hi> by Baron <hi>Hill</hi> and Serjeant <hi>Windham,</hi> (after the manner of the Houſe of Peers formerly) to declare their Meſſage, <hi>viz.

Which Meſſage begat very high Debaets, and ſharp Speeches from many that were not at the making this lame and imperfect Modell, ſo as the aforeſaid Meſſengers were fain to wait a long time; but at length got this Anſwer, <hi>viz. That they would return an Anſwer by Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers of their own.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Houſe filling daily, and many of thoſe that had been ſecluded in the former Seſſion coming in, the Face of things in the Houſe were in a great meaſure changed, another Spirit appearing in them then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, inſomuch, that many made queſtion of the things that were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly done; ſome ſpeaking at a high rate in behalf of the <hi>Rights</hi> of the Engliſh Free People, and againſt the Wrongs and Injuries that had been done unto them. This being done day by day, and the <hi>Houſe</hi> not agreeing what to call that <hi>Other Houſe,</hi> which was as it were a nameleſſe Infant, and fain would be named the <hi>Houſe of Lords,</hi> was the greateſt part of their work, ſave that now and then, ſome little Matters came under Debate, as the Reviving and perfecting their Committees, and Reading ſome former Bills. The Lord <hi>Cravens</hi> Caſe alſo was taken in, and the Councill on both parts heard at the Bar of the Houſe, with ſome other little Matters that paſſed; but the greateſt part of time that was ſpent in the Houſe, (whileſt ſitting) was in Conſidering and Debating what they ſhould call the <hi>Other Houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Towards the end of their ſitting, there came another Meſſage from the <hi>Other Houſe,</hi> after the ſame manner as before, <hi>Deſiring their joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them, in moving the Protector to Order, that the Papiſts, and ſuch as had been in Armes under the late King, might be exiled the City, and put out of the Lines of Communication,</hi> &amp;c. This Meſſage being alſo deſigned as ſhooing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>horn, to draw on their owning of them, received a like Anſwer as did the former.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Other Houſe</hi> (who called themſelves the <hi>Houſe of Lords)</hi> they ſpent their time in little Matters, ſuch as chooſing of Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees, and among other things, to conſider of the Priviledges and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of their Houſe, (good wiſe ſouls) before they knew what their Houſe was, or ſhould be called.</p>
            <p>About which time alſo, a Petition was preparing, by ſome faithfull Friends to the good <hi>Old Cauſe,</hi> in, and about the City of <hi>London,</hi> which was afterward Printed, and ſigned with many thouſand Hands: which Petition makes mention of the ſeverall Particulars that were the Grounds of Conteſt between the late King, and Parliament, and the good People of the Nation.

to the Parliament (in a peaceable way) by the hands of about twenty in the name of the reſt, deſiring to ſubmit the iſſue thereof to God, and the Wiſdom of that Aſſembly. The Court hearing of it, were ſo affrighted, as they began to conſider how they might quell and put a ſtop to that honeſt Spirit, which ſo appeared againſt them; the Protector (in the mean while) calling them <hi>Traytors, and Seditious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <hi>Babel</hi> be conſidered of.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Whether thoſe ſo very wiſe Gentlemen, who ſaw it ſo neceſſary, and ventured ſo high, and took ſo much pains, to bring in again, and anew reſtore fallen <hi>Monarchy</hi> and <hi>Kingſhip</hi> in theſe Lands, could according to the rules of common reaſon and underſtanding of men, imagine and conclude, That the Gentlemen who had formerly been ſo wronged, abuſed, and exaſperated by them, in being kept out of the Houſe, would be ſo eaſie and tame, as preſently, without any more ado, addreſſe themſelves to lick their new <hi>Golden Calf,</hi> and nurſe up that <hi>Babyloniſh, Antichriſtian</hi> Brat, they had no hand in, but were againſt the begetting of?

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Whether the good people of this Nation have not cauſe for ever as to abhor the Memory of the afore-mentioned back-ſliding perſons, ſo that Parliament (ſo called) in the firſt Seſſion of it before their Adjourning, that of their own Heads, and contrary to their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement to the <note n="*" place="margin">The firſt Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not hereby owned, but abhorred as much as the latter, though I thus ſpeak.</note>Inſtrument of Government; by vertue whereof they ſate at firſt, and without conſulting the reſpective Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for whom they ſerved, or ſo much as one Petition delivered to them for that purpoſe, changed the Government, and made one worſe, harder, and more grievous to be born, then that they put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; ſo faſtening their new Iron yoke upon the Necks of the good People of this Land, ſettling great <hi>Taxes,</hi> with the <hi>Cuſtomes</hi> and <hi>Exciſe</hi> for ever, to keep this Yoke upon them?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Whether thoſe Gentlemen kept out in the firſt Sitting, when thoſe hard things were tranſacted, and afterwards comming in, and being preſent in the ſecond Meeting, notwithſtanding the ſo great Reproach and Dirt caſt on them by the Court, are not highly to be honoured and eſteemed, for appearing and ſtanding ſo far as they did, for <hi>Right,</hi> and <hi>Freedom,</hi> and againſt the Bondages, which contrary to <hi>Ingagements, Covenants,</hi> and <hi>Promiſes,</hi> were put upon the good People of this Land? As well as to be blamed, not onely for not declaring at their firſt Secluſion, to inform the People of the wrong and injury
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51844:6"/>
done unto them; But alſo, when afterward they whre ſo Arbitrarily and Tyrannically diſſolved, with the reſt of their unworthy Brethren, they took it ſo patiently, and went ſo tamely home, and did not in the very time of the Action, Proteſt and Declare againſt the Tyrant, and then retire into their places, (from whence they ought not to have ſtirred at firſt) and call him to the Bar, or otherwiſe proceeded againſt him for ſo doing? Had it not been ſutable to, and well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming that noble Commonwealth Spirit (ſo much pretended to) thus to have aſſay'd, though they had fallen in it? And whether the Army in Honeſty, Conſcience and Duty, their former Declarations and Ingagements conſidered, ought not to have aſſiſted them therein, as well as they did the long Parliament againſt the <hi>King</hi> and his <hi>Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,</hi> upon the like account? Doth not the loud Cryes of the Souls of the Saints <note n="*" place="margin">Rev. 6. <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

If ſo? Ought not this honeſt word of Reproof for what is paſt, and of excitation for the future to take place?</p>
               <p>Fifthly, But ſince things were as they were, and as it ſeems could be no better, Whether all good People in theſe Nations, have not great cauſe exceedingly to bleſſe and praiſe the Lord? (though they owe little to the Inſtrument) who <hi>(Aſhur</hi>-like had other ends) that the late Parliament (ſo called) was diſſolved; who were many of them, ſuch Mercenary, Sallary, and ſelf-intereſted men, as in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, had they continued much longer, would have over-voted the Lovers of Freedom, and ſo have perfected their Inſtrument of Bondage, and rivetted it on the Necks of the good People for ever by a Law, and thereby made them Vaſſals and Slaves perpetually. But hitherto the Lord hath in a great meaſure fruſtrated their wicked De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, bleſſed be his holy Name.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Whether the Protector (ſo called be not a great deſtroyer of the Rights and Liberties of the Engliſh Nation? For hath he not in groſſed the whole power of the <hi>Militia</hi> into his own hand? The Right alſo of Property? Power of judging all matters of the higheſt and greateſt Concernment? And doth he not take on him to be ſole Judge of <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>War,</hi> of Calling and Diſſolving Parliaments? Raiſing Money without Conſent in Parliament? Impriſoning perſons without due form of Law, and keeping them in Durance at pleaſure; uſing the <hi>Militia</hi> in his own hand againſt the good People, in theſe fore-named things, and aginſt their Repreſenters in Parliamenr.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, Whether the Protector, and the Great men his Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51844:6"/>
be not rather to be termed <hi>Fannattick, Whimſicall</hi> and <hi>Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brain'd,</hi> then thoſe, (who remaining firm to, and being more refined in their former, good, and honeſt Principles, and will upon no account be drawn to deſert the good Old Cauſe) they account and call ſo? And whether this unſettledneſſe in their Government, and changing both it and their Principles, in ſo ſhort a time; and going ſo diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trically contrary to their former honeſt Proteſtations, Declarations, Sermons, and Actings, doth not in the view of all the world, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare them ſo to be?</p>
               <p>Eighthly, Whether the Protector (ſo called) be not that himſelf which he untruly charged upon the Members turned out of the Little Parliament (ſo called) <hi>viz. A deſtroyer of Magiſtracy and Miniſtery?</hi> Of Magiſtracy, in breaking four Parliaments in five Years; and pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling up by the roots, what in him lieth, the very Baſis and Foundation of all juſt Power, to wit, the Intereſt of the good People of this Commonwealth; making himſelf, and his own Will and Luſt, the Baſis and Foundation thereof? And doth he not at his pleaſure ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe and deſtroy all Military and Civill Power, and Governours that ſubmit not thereunto? Is he not likewiſe a great deſtroyer of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, in taking from them their Religious, or Divine Capacities, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them into that of <hi>Lay</hi> or <hi>Common?</hi> and accordingly, in a profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed way, preferring them to places of Advantage by the Tryers?</p>
               <p>Ninthly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Whether the Protector be ſo wiſe and underſtanding, ſo tender and carefull of the Common Intereſt (as is pretended to) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all others whatſover? yea, above and beyond the four Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he hath diſſolved? And may it not be enquired how he came to this great height of Knowledge and abſolute underſtanding, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there are very many worthy Patriots, ſometimes his Equals (at leaſt) of as high a Deſcent, of as good breeding, of as great Parts, of as fair an Intereſt, as alſo as well verſed in Government as himſelf? Whether it may not be wondred at, that he ſhould be ſo exceeding wiſe, and tender above all, even above Parliaments themſelves.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, Whether Sir <hi>Henry Vane,</hi> Major Generall <hi>Harriſon,</hi> the late Preſident <hi>Bradſhaw,</hi> Sir <hi>Arthur Haſlerigg,</hi> Lieutenant Generall <hi>Ludlow,</hi> with hundreds more of worthy Patriots, that have ventured far in their Countreys Cauſe, for Juſtice and Freedom, may not rationally be thought to be as carefull and tender of the good of their Countrey as the Protector?</p>
               <p>Eleventhly, Whether it doth not rankly ſavour of high Pride and Arrogancy in the Protector (ſo called) to ſet up his Senſe and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as the ſtandard for the whole Nation, even Parliaments them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves?
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51844:7"/>
And whether thus to do, be not the ſad fruit of Enthuſaiſme, one of the great Errours of this day and time?</p>
               <p>Twelfthly, Whether the Potector being ſo highly conceited of his own underſtanding, ſo changeable and uncertain in his Principles and Reſolutions, ſo given up to his Paſſion and Anger, as againſt all Advice and Counſel, in a condition near unto Madneſſe, to ſwear <hi>by the living God</hi> he would Diſſolve the late Parliament, and accordingly did ſo, though the doing of it tended to the hazard of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth? Whether he according to Reaſon, can be thought a perſon capable, and fit to Rule and Governe this ſo <hi>Great,</hi> ſo <hi>Wiſe,</hi> and <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> a People?</p>
               <p>Thirteenthly, Whether ſince the Protector aſſumed the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the ſtate and condition of this Nation be not very greatly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired? Their Land Forces waſted and conſumed at <hi>Hiſpaniola, Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica, Mardike,</hi> and elſewhere? Their Shipping leſſened and dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed; their Stores and Proviſions for Sea and Land expended and conſumed without profit; their Magazines emptied; their Treaſures waſted; their Trade in a great meaſure loſt and decayed; and very great new Debts contracted, little of Old being ſatisfied? And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all this be not the bitter fruit of Apoſtacy and Treachery, and ſetting up a ſingle perſon, as Chief Magiſtrate, contrary to Ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: And the caſting away of that Righteous Cauſe of Freedom, Juſtice, and Righteouſneſſe, this Land was ſo engaged in?</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Whether the Protector (ſo called) will not in all likelihood diſſolve the next Parliament alſo, if they begin to queſtion and make Debates of former Tranſactions, and do not preſently without any diſputing, proceed to perfect the new Modell, of the <hi>Humble Petition and Advice?</hi> What aſſurance ſhall be given to the Countries and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that ſhall chuſe, or to the Gentlemen choſen, that they ſhall not be ſerved as thoſe before were? And whether, if the honeſt Citizens ſhall begin to make ready their former ſober, and very worthy <hi>Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> or one of the like nature, it will not be looked at again, as a Crime little leſſe then Treaſon at the Court, and become a means of ſudden Diſſolution to the next Parliament alſo? Alas for poor <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land!</hi> What will become of thee in the end? How haſt thou loſt thy ſelf and thy good Old Cauſe? And whither will theſe Maſters of Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage carry thee?</p>

               <p>Firſt, Whether if it ſhould come to paſs (as how ſoon we know not) that that noble ſpirit ſhould (like a Lyon raiſed from ſleep) riſe again in the Engliſh people, ſuch as it was in forty one or forty two, or about that time, whether theſe Champions with their <hi>Feathers in their Caps,</hi> and their <hi>Wooden Daggers,</hi> and thoſe fifty three perſons who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſettle the Government by the <hi>Humble Petition and Advice,</hi>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:51844:19"/>
would be able to fight with, ſtand againſt, and overcome the ſame any otherwiſe then their Predeceſſors the Lords Temporal, and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops the Lords Spiritual did then? And whether it would not in all likelyhood fare with them and their Dependents the Patentees of the Exciſe, and all others employed by them, that ſo oppreſs and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſh the Nation, as formerly it did with them, if not far worſe? They may pleaſe to think of it at their Leaſure.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Whether in theſe five years now paſt of the Protectoral Government, that bleſſed Reformation which the Protector (then General) and other Grandees of the Army ſo often promiſed, and for not bringing forth of which they pretend they diſſolved the old Parliament, hath ſo been ſet upon as to make any the leaſt proceed therein? Or rather, hath there not been a gradual and an apparent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſing into thoſe very Evils and Enormities formerly ſo greatly ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and in ſome degree broken, but now healed again of their wound, and flouriſhing afreſh with open face; the ſpirit of wickedneſs and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneſs being riſen very high, even among Profeſſors, like the unclean ſpirit caſt out, and entring again? And in particular, that abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable corruption and abuſe in the Law, and Adminiſtration of Juſtice, touching which the Protector (ſo called) ſometime ſaid, <hi>It was not to be endured in a Chriſtian Commonwealth, that ſome ſhould ſo enrich and greaten themſelves in the ruine of others.</hi> So likewiſe that often complain'd of Grievance of Tythes, touching which he alſo ſaid, (as was lately atteſted in an open Court of Judicature, ſeveral ſtanding by to witneſs the truth thereof, to whom the words were ſpoken) <hi>That if he did not take away Tythes, by the third of September next,</hi> (to wit, 1654) <hi>or ſuch a time, they ſhould call him the greateſt Juggler that ever was, and would juggle in all things elſe.</hi> Yet is there any thing done in either of theſe? or any thing gone about tending thereunto, now in theſe five years? as if it were ſo, that no fruit would ever grow upon ſuch a tree, <hi>(viz.</hi> the Monarchical Foundation) which the Lord hath pulled up and curſed, as <hi>the barren Fig-tree</hi> was: onely there is one goodly amendment, to wit, a confirmation of the Act for <hi>treble damages,</hi> to the undoing of many an honeſt man that upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious grounds do ſcruple the payment of them. And as for the Law and the Lawyers, they are as before, if not much worſe; and is there any ground of hope that the next five years (ſhould he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue ſo long) will produce any better fruit then the five that are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready paſt?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Whether this Calculation of theſe ignoble Lords of the new Stamp, being of ſeveral complexions, and ſtanding in the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Capacities and Relations, having alſo ſuch dependence upon, and lying under ſo great Engagements unto the Protector, (ſo
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:51844:20"/>
called) as his Sons and Kindred, Flattering Courtiers, corrupt Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, degenerated Sword<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>men, and a ſort of luke-warm indifferent Country Knights, Gentlemen and Citizens, moſt of them ſelf-inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted Salary-men, be not likely (according to the very ſpecious pretence) to prove a brave Balance of Government? And whether the good people of this Land are likely to have their juſt Rights and Freedoms, or religious men the Liberty of their Conſciences by this Conſtitution, any otherwiſe, then according to the pleaſure of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector and the Court? Or then they had in the time of the late King? And whether this Calculation were made to any other end then ſo?</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Whether all things ſoberly weighed and conſidered, the times be now ſo happy and bleſſed as ſome do londly beſpeak them to be? And whether for the future we are likely to have ſuch proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, ſucceſs and good days as ſome ſo largely promiſe themſelves? and others it may be expected? Or whether ſuch ſmiling upon old wickedneſs, and frowning and turning the back upon Righteouſneſs, ſuppreſſing its growth, be any comfortable ground of ſuch hope and expectation? Or whether upon the whole Series of things, as they now appear, there be not rather to be expected ſome ſadder matter, if the LORD in mercy prevent not? Let the wiſe in heart conſider.</p>

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:51844:20"/>
the Nation, and the righteous cauſe on foot therein; but the Lord having in anſwer to the earneſt deſires and prayers of ſome of his faithful remnant, and in great mercy to the Nation and the good people therein, and the righteous cauſe, removed and taken him out of the way, it was thought fit however to publiſh it for the ſake of his aſſociates and confederates he hath left behind him, who may happily make ſome uſe of it; as alſo that the ſtanders by, yea, the whole Nation, might likewiſe ſee and judge of what hath lately fallen out in this our day.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid of <hi>Jeroboam the ſon of Nebat,</hi> That he not onely ſinned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but made <hi>Iſrael</hi> to ſin; and there were thoſe of his confederates that then ſinned with him, and after he was dead and gone, of whom it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, <note place="margin">1 Kin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 15. 34 compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with 2 Kin. 17. 21, 22.</note>That <hi>they walked in the ways, and departed not from the ſins of Jeroboam the ſon of Nebat who made Iſrael to ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The parallel hereof we have in <hi>England</hi> in this our day: <hi>Oliver</hi> the late Protector (ſo called) who <hi>(Jeroboam</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>like) ſo greatly appeared with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for Juſtice and Freedom againſt Oppreſſion, highly profeſſing and declaring for the ſame, hath ſinned in the breach of thoſe Proteſtations and Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, in building again thoſe things he had been ſo greatly inſtrumental to deſtroy; therein ſurpaſſing not onely the deeds of the wicked who were cut off upon the like account, but alſo of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> who never made ſuch Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Declarations as he had done.</p>
               <p>There alſo are of his confederates (as the confederates of <hi>Jeroboam)</hi> that ſinned with him in his Apoſtacy and Revolt, and do yet continue in thoſe ſins, and walking in his ſteps now he is dead and gone, as if they took no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the diſpleaſure and wrath of God revealed from Heaven againſt him, in cutting him off for his unrighteouſneſs. <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſmarted ſorely for their evil, and at laſt were carryed away Captive: <hi>England</hi> hath likewiſe ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and is brought very low, as tradeſmen of all ſorts, ſhop-keepers and others both in City and Country find by ſuch ſad and woful experience as they never did before, nor in the memory of man was the like ever known or heard of; and what may further ſuffer, the Lord (who will not be mocked) onely knows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For how unworthy are the people of this Generation, not onely the more dark and ſordid, but too many who profeſs to be Saints, and are Paſtors and Members of Churches, nay, ſome who are Mercurial and more high flown, that once ſpake the Language of</hi> Zion, <hi>and highly appeared for the Good Old Cauſe, who notwithſtanding they have ſeen the mighty Arm and Power of God diſplayed, in bringing down the unrighteous, oppreſſive, high and lofty ones (with their foundation) for their unrighteouſneſs and oppreſſion, yet have ſo far forgotten the Good Old Cauſe ſo ſignally owned from Heaven, and are ſo beſotted and degenerated, into a ſelf-ſeeking, ſlaviſh and enſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpirit, as they not onely juſtifie, but ſtrengthen their hands, who (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of preſſing forward mith more refinedneſs in that work and cauſe, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
