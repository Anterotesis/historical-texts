            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>ANIMADVERSION I. THe <hi>Obſervator</hi> hath contracted his Maieſties words, but hath kept the ſenſe in more generall termes, and ſeemes (though but faintly) to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the <hi>Poſition,</hi> by approving (I know not whoſe anſwer) That this Power can reſt no where more ſafely, then in Parliament. He meanes the Parliament without the King; If he had allowed the King his place in Parliament, I know no underſtanding man but will eaſily ſubſcribe, That the King in Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, or the Parliament with him, have an abſolute undiſputable power, both to make and declare Law; and to end all Suites of what kind ſoever, determinable by humane law within the Kingdome. And here is the moſt ſafe reſting of this Power (and here it hath ever reſted) and not in the King alone (who claimes not that Power, but is willing to governe his Subjects according to the knowne Lawes) and much leſſe in any inferiour Court. But that ſuch an abſolute undiſputable Power of declaring Law, as hath lately bin aſſumed, by the <hi>Major</hi> part of the preſent ſitting Parliament, ſhould be reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in them, is neither neceſſary for the ending of Suites, nor can be ſafe, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for King or Subject. If they may declare that for a Law, a fundamentall Law, which never yet was Enacted, or had any being; and deny the plain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Lawes that have beene Enacted, or fruſtrate them by ſome unheard of interpretation, (as if ſuch interpretation had been ſome mentall (or rather Parliamentall) reſervation laid up within the Parliament walles, to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced upon emergent occaſions, by their ſucceſſors) they will have ſo full an

Arbitrary power, that the right and ſafety of King and People muſt wholly depend upon their Votes. Which power can never be ſafe, either for King or People, nor can they produce one preſident that may warrant ſuch a Power. But they are not bound or limited by ſuch preſidents. Thats the ſecond <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</hi>

               <p>ANIMAD. 2. If Statutes be not binding to them, there is no reaſon that preſidents ſhould be. And he ſaith true, Statutes are not binding to them, that is, <hi>de facto,</hi> they are not (for they in ſome things goe directly againſt them) but <hi>de jure,</hi> they are; that is, they ought to be binding to them, till they be repealed by the ſame power they were made, that is, by Bill orderly paſſed both Houſes, and ratified by his Majeſties Royall aſſent. And unleſſe they can ſhew better reaſon then their bare Aſſertion: Preſidents (as they are the beſt warrant, ſo) they are, and ought to be the limits and bounds of their procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings. He might have ſaid as truly, That Oathes are not binding to them: and therefore neither Statutes nor Preſidents. But the <hi>Obſervator</hi> tells us (Pag 44.) That the Oathes of Supremacy and Allegiance are not endange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, by making the Kingdom, and not the King, the proper ſubject of Power, And he yeelds reaſon for it. <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>hee that aſcribes more to the whole Univerſality, then to the King, yet aſcribes to the King a true Supremacy of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and Honour above all particulars.</hi> I wonder what he meanes by a true Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie of Power and Honour above all particulars. Surely, he meanes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but priority of place, and height of Title; for he is allowed little po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer over ſome particulars, namely, over the Members of either houſe, and whom elſe they pleaſe to exempt (as they did Serjeant Major <hi>Skippon</hi> for his Power and Commands.) But this diſtinction helpes them: The Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of either Houſe are ſharers in that Supremacie which is in the Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality and above his; and by the power of that Supremacie they can exempt whom they pleaſe from the power of this, Inferiour (pardon the ph<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

But, in good ſober ſadneſſe, doth the <hi>Obſervator</hi> thinke this diſtinction was thought on by the Framers and enjoyners of that Oath, or that the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Houſe, at their entring the Houſe, did take their Oath to the King, as to the Supreame over all, with exception of themſelves, or reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of an higher Supremacy to themſelves, when they ſhould be entred? It is hardly credible; Nor doe all (that deſire to tender all due honour to the Parliament) beleeve that they are ſo the Vniverſality, or the Kingdome, as the <hi>Obſervatour</hi> preſumes. They are truſted by the Vniverſality and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and wee pray, that they may diſchardge that truſt, not knowing, but that a multitude of men ſubject (every one of them) to errour, may faile in their judgement, and being not exempted from the common condition of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:63421:2"/>
the ſinfull Sonnes of <hi>Adam,</hi> may poſſibly, not rightly diſchardge the truſt committed to them, as well, as the King, who is blaſted with foule ſailings, anderrours, and judgement. Mee thinkes, men that ſo much deteſt Popery, ſhould not borrow the grounds of their reaſoning from them: and I ſhall as ſoone beleeve the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> telling us that they are the Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall Church, and therefore cannot poſſibly erre, as that the Parliament is the Vniverſall unerring and unpervertibly juſt body of the Kingdome. And ſurely, the Spirit of declaring muſt needs reſide in a ſtrangely large meaſure in them, who have power, thus to declare not onely Law, but Oathes too; a greater, then which the Popes flatterers never gave him; and hardly ever any Pope aſſumed ſo great: <hi>Quo te conſtringam mutantem protea nodo?</hi> How ſhall theſe men bee bound to doe right, who ſo eaſily unty the knots of theſe ſacred bookes of Law and Oathes? why, yes; There is a bond that will doe it; The obligation of the Iuſtice, and honour of a Parliament. But can any man bee ſure, that they whom neither Law, Cuſtome, and Preſidents of their Anceſtours, nor Oathes can bind, will bee alwayes held in by the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of Iuſtice and Honour? Is it not poſſible, that they may (in time) find a power in themſelves of declaring that obligation void, as well, as have done the other? The ſame obligation of Iuſtice and Honour, is as ſtrong upon Kings, (and hath ever beene held more powerfull and obſtrictive in them, then in any ſtate mannaged by a Community; and yet they dare not truſt his Majeſty, though ſo obliged. The <hi>Obſervatour</hi> then muſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don mee, if I deſire, they may rather bee held in, (and hold themſelves ſo to bee) by the old obligations of Law, Preſidents, and Oathes, rather then that the Kings liege-people ſhould bee put wholly to confide to that ſingle obligation of the Iuſtice, and Honour of a Parliament.</p>

propriety in his goods, that without Law, they cannot bee taken from him, though to be employed for the publike good. And though the ſafety of the people, be the higheſt Law, and that doe (many times) give a power above other Lawes, and againſt them, to the ſupreme Magiſtracy in a State, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of private mens eſtates, yet the unchangeable rule of Iuſtice, muſt have place, even in that higheſt Law, and that requires a compenſation to be made to thoſe, whoſe ſtates or goods are ſo diſpoſed of; and never gives power to uphold the publike good with private injury. Nor can it bee imagined, that a State upheld, by ſuch helps, ſhould not be able to make a juſt compenſation to thoſe, by whom it was upheld. But let us heare our <hi>Obſervatour.</hi> They may not (ſaith hee) deſert the King. Gramercy, for that; I am glad to heare they have yet any obligation upon them to tie them to the King. Yet I know not well what he meanes by deſerting the King: if he mean it in that ſenſe, which he doth the Kings deſerting of them, which (out of queſtion) is his not aſſenting to whatſoever they ſhall think fit; Then in reaſon, they ſhould not, by their diſallowing all his Propoſals, have driven him to diſſent from theirs, and ſo to have diſſerted them. Well; But being deſerted by the King, when the Kingdome is in diſtreſſe, they may judge of that diſtreſſe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it. Al their power then is upon ſuppoſition of the Kings deſerting them. So that if it appeare, that His Majeſty hath not deſerted them (as many good men beleeve he hath not, in the redreſſe of any real grievance,) then they have no ſuch power. And however, they claime this power only when the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is in diſtreſſe; but how, if the Kingdom be not in diſtreſſe, or (at leaſt) that diſtreſſe be onely or principally, cauſed by their claiming of that power which cannot conſiſt with the Honour and Royall Eſtate of His Majeſtly; which all men (by their late Proteſtation) are bound to defend. If it beſo, we may eaſily diſcerne how far they may ſtretcht this power, which they claim onely in order to diſtreſſe; and that they may make as much uſe of it, as the Pope doth of his power in temporals; <hi>In ordine ad ſpiritualia.</hi> He claimes no more, though (ſome have ſaid, hee hath right to more;) and the Parliament will need no more, to doe as much as hee takes upon him to doe with Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Princes and States. But they muſt have a right to their power in this caſe of diſtreſſe; whence have they that? why, they have it as the whole body of the State, and that they are, and muſt be ſo accompted, by vertue of repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation very good. But let us conſider his words a little more. There is no underſtanding man, but muſt and will acknowledge (unleſſe he wilfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate from them,) that the Parliament repreſents the body of the State, for thoſe ends, for which they convene, as an Ambaſſadour doth the Prince that ſends him, in the mannage of that buſineſſe for which hee is ſent; But this is not an abſolute repreſentation to all intents and purpoſes. Beſides, whom do they repreſent? The Body (ſaith hee) of the State. Bee it ſo: but it is onely the body, without the head. And if they were not by repreſentation onely, but really, the whole body of the People (if it were poſſible, they ſhould
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:63421:3"/>
convene together) they are all but an aſſembly of Subjects, of men to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned, not to rule, to be commanded, not to command their Head and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne: and then there can be no vertue of repreſentation that can advance them to the power, which the <hi>Obſervatour</hi> aſcribes to them, when ſuch pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was never in the whole body, which is repreſented. No? never ſuch po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer in the whole body? I know the <hi>Obſervatours</hi> ſtomack will riſe here. Did not the Peoples conſent, at firſt make Kings and conveigh power into their hands? Truely Sir, not ſolely; but grant it, what then? Marry, he ſaith then it is a principle in nature. <hi>Quic quid efficit tale eſt magis tale;</hi> In Engliſh, <note place="margin">Pag. 2.</note> If the People make a King, they are more King themſelves, or if they give power, they have more power: and may reſume and exerciſe that power when they pleaſe. Excellent learning, and well applied, I believe hee lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this piece from <hi>Suarez</hi> the Ieſuite. But the <hi>Obſervatour,</hi> may know, that that rule admits many limitations; and ſurely, it holds onely <hi>in cauſis to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talibus,</hi> which the People are not in the conſtitution of Kings. But ſuppoſe their conſent, did at firſt give power to Kings; when their conſent is given for them and their Succeſſours to a King and his Heires, can the ſucceeding People cut off the entaile, and retract the conſent their Anceſtours have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? By what right? with what juſtice? I know not, but the People may contract for them and their Succeſſours in the conveyance of Soveraigne power (if ever they had it in their hands to give) as any man may in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance of his lands or goods: and that ſuch conveyance may be as bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Succeſſours in the one as in the other: and then I am ſure, they cannot have power at all times, and in all ſucceeding ages, to reſume what they have ſo given. Our Kings right (ſo farre as it is derived from the People) is of this kind. And if he had no other grounds for his claime of Soveraignty, (as it is moſt certaine, that he hath) ſuch a conſent once granted, were ſufficient to bind the People, that it cannot ever bee lawfull for them; by a major part of them (comming in with their <hi>Nolumus hunc regnare ſuper nos)</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive him of that right.

               <p>ANIMAD. 6. I Thought this Poſition ſo ſtrangely Paradoxall, and ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently contrary to reaſon, and common ſenſe, that no man would have appeared in the defence of it. Yet this <hi>Obſervator</hi> never bluſhes, nor blinks at it, but affirmes it ſtoutly. But for all that, I ſhall beleeve very ſlowly. That the Kings Perſon can at any time be without the King, or without his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: Or that they may deſtroy the Kings Perſon, to preſerve the King. My Faith is not ſtrong enough to beleeve theſe ſublime points, and myſteries of State: I ſhall ſubſcribe thus farre, That warre againſt the Kings Authority, (though in the abſence of his Perſon) is warre againſt the King: But that the King and his Perſon ſhould be in two places, will never (I feare) downe with me.

If he have the people on his ſide, and a prevailing Major party, I thinke the <hi>Obſervator</hi> (ſtanding to his owne Principles) will not deny that he hath Soveraigne power with him, and that it is unnaturall to thinke the Community ſhould deſtroy itſelfe.

Well, But good Sir, may not the people withdraw the power of repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation, which they granted to the Parliament; was their grant ſo abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, and ſo irrevocable, that they diſpoſſeſt themſelves wholly of taking or exerciſing that power, their owne proper perſons?
