            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE RIGHT HONO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable his singular good Lord, William Lord Cobham, L. warden of the Cinque ports, knight of the most noble order of the Garter, and one of her Maiesties most honourable priuie counsell: long continuance of health, with much increase of honour, and prosperitie.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Orasmuch as being vnknowne to your good Lordship, otherwise than by report, yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding I haue tasted of your good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and fauour, to my great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in my troubles, of the which vvhen God vvil I hope I shall be vvell discharged: I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge my selfe more bound vnto your honour, than any seruice or abilitie of mine can extend vnto. And therefore to testifie my thankfull and dutifull mind towards you, I haue presumed to dedicate this my labour to your Lordship. And because it is a thing ingreffed by nature, special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in those that are of best and noblest dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to take delight in the hearing and reading of such things, as are most proper and incident to
<pb facs="tcp:6660:3"/>
their owne callings, as whereof they haue best skill, &amp; wherein they most excel, &amp; therfore may most iustly chalenge to themselues the censure and iudgement of them: I persuade myself that this my presumption wil not be vnacceptable, or at leastwise will not seeme vntollerable, in the sight of your good Lordship, and of the residue of your most honorable sort &amp; calling, both for the matter, &amp; for the author therof. For the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, is the due administration of state, and chiefly of a kingdom both in peace &amp; war, at home and abrode: on the one side through the politike and vertuous gouernment of the partie that holds the scepter of soueraigntie, with the loiall linking in of his magistrates and offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers vnder him: and on the otherside through the seruiceable, willing, and faithfull obedience of those whom God hath put in subiection to him: a matter, as of verie great importance and behoofe, so also greatlie beseeming those whom GOD hath set in authoritie. For of all the states and degrees which GOD hath ordeined for the well maintaining of this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall life, like as in highnesse of dignitie and honour, and woorthinesse of preheminence, none is comparable to the state of gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, specially which is well and orderlie dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed: so of all the formes of gouernment
<pb facs="tcp:6660:3"/>
that haue beene in the world, the Monarchie or Kingdome hath euer (as well by common and continuall experience, as also by the grounded iudgement of the best practised politicians, and by the graue censure of the wisest men, yea and euen by the ordinance &amp; approbation of God) bin alwaies deemed and found to be most anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and sufficient, most beneficial and behoofful, most magnificent and honourable, most stable and durable, and consequently most happie and commendable; as vvhich (besides many other most excellent prerogatiues which I omit here) doth most resemble the highest soueraigntie of God, the onely one vniversall Monarch of the whole world, and is most agreeable to the first originall patterne of souereigntie on earth, I meane <hi>Adam,</hi> whom God created but one, to haue the dominion and lordship of all creatures vnder the cope of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The which being iustly forgone by that first mans disobedience, God thought good in his wisdom to repair and set vp againe much more large and magnificent than afore, in the person of one other man, namely of our Lord Iesus Christ, whom he hath made heir of all things, giuing vnto him all power both in heauen and earth, to reigne in glory euerlasting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly world without end. Who whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was to come into the world, in the last temporall Monarchie
<pb facs="tcp:6660:4"/>
of the world, did thus much further beautifie and commend the state of Monarchie by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, in that he vouchsafed not to come, afore such time as the state of Rome was brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Monarchie, and setled in the gouernment of one sole soueraigne. Such and so excellent is the matter whereof this booke doth treat. The which was written in French by one <hi>Iaques Hurault,</hi> lord of Vieul and Marrais, an honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable personage, and (as may wel appeare by his handling of the matters here treated of) of great learning, iudgement, experience, and policie. Who for his prudence, grauitie, and loialtie, was admitted to be of the priuie counsell to his soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne lord and master the French king. Wherby he had fit occasion and meanes, to see into the states and forms of gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as well of forrein countries, as of his owne, and therefore might be the better able to discerne the truth of things, and to deliuer his censure the more soundlie, concerning the managing of publike affaires and matters of state.</p>
            <p>But now to come home out of Fraunce into England, and to applie the case more particularlie to our selues: I am fullie resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that if wee list to looke vpon things with right iudging eyes, and to consider them with well aduised minds, we shall plainlie see
<pb facs="tcp:6660:4"/>
there was neuer anie nation vnder the sunne, more bound to yeeld immortall thanks vnto God for their state, Prince, and soueraigne, than we be for ours; or to magnifie him more for the innumerable benefits receyued by that means, than we be. For first our state is that state which is most iustly deemed the best and most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, namely a Monarchie or kingdome, wherein one sole souereigne assisted with a most graue Senat of prudent and sage counsailors, reigneth by wisedome, and not by will, by law and not by lust, by loue and not by lordlinesse. And vnlesse we will denie the thing which the world seeth and gladly honoureth, and which we our selues haue continually found and felt in experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence now by the space of xxxvi years and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, to our inestimable good and comfort: we must needs confesse that God hath giuen vs a prince, in whose sacred person (to speake the truth in as few words as so great a matter may permit) there wanteth not anie heroicall vertue or gift of grace, that may beseeme or adorne the maiestie of a kingdome, the which thing is so much the more glorious and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull in her highnesse being both a woman and a virgin. By whose means God hath also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored vnto vs the bright shining beames of his most holie Gospell, late afore eclipsed
<pb facs="tcp:6660:5"/>
with the foggie clouds of superstitious ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and humane traditions, and the true ancient and catholike religion, borne down and in maner o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerwhelmed with the terrible stormes of cruell persecutions: a benefit wherunto none other can be comparable in this world. Of the which reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion her Maiestie hath continually shewed her self, not a bare professor, but a most earnest and zealous follower, and a most lightsome example to her subiects: directing al her studies, counsels and proceedings, to the setting forth of Gods glorie, as well by aduauncing and maintaining the same religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vncorrupted; as also by her most prouident &amp; motherly gouerning of hir people with all iustice &amp; clemencie, to their greatest tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quilitie benefit and welfare. Wherupon hath also ensued Gods most mightie and miraculous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of her mastiesties most roiall person, her realms dominions and subiects, from exceeding great perils, both forreine, ciuil and domesticall, such and so fitly contriued by the sleights of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan &amp; satanicall practisers, as but by the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and extraordinarie working of the diuine prouidence, could not haue beene found out, and much lesse preuented, auoided or escaped: an assured token of Gods speciall loue and fauor towards both soueraigne and subiects. To be short, so many and so great are the benefites
<pb facs="tcp:6660:5"/>
which we haue receiued and still receiue, by and from our most gracious soueraigue lady Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> that I know not how to conclude her Maiesties most iust deserued commendation, more fitly than with the verses of a certaine aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Poet, written long since in commendation of that renowmed prince of Britaine the noble king <hi>Arthur,</hi> the which verses I haue put into English, with small alteration of some words, but no alteration at all in matter and sense, after this maner:

our obedience to her gratious maiestie with all submission faithfulnes and loialtie, not grud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging or repining when any things mislike vs, but alwaies interpreting all things to the best; not curiously inquisitiue of the causes of hir will, but forward and diligent in executing her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, euen as in the sight of God, not for feare of punishment, but of verie loue and conscience.

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:6660:10"/>
at large, in what things euery mans dutie consisteth. For (as he saith) there is not any part of our life,<note place="margin">Our life can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Dutie.</note> be it in matters publicke or priuat, that can be without Dutie, as wherein consisteth the whole honour of our life, and likewise the dishonour through the forslowing therof;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cicero</hi> in the ends of good and euil men.</note> insomuch that an honest man will rather put himselfe in danger and endure all maner of aduersitie and paines, than leaue his Dutie vndone. And therefore, afore we speake of princes, it wil be good for vs to decide what a Duty is, to the end that men may vnderstand wherof we treat.<note place="margin">The definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Dutie.</note> We call that a Dutie, to the doing whereof we be bound, as to a thing that our vocation or calling requireth: as for example, The dutie of a Til-man, is to till the ground well; the dutie of a Iudge, is to iudge mens causes vprightlie, without accepting of persons; the duetie of a housholder, is to gouerne well his house; like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the duetie of a prince or king, is to gouerne well his people, to minister good iustice vnto them, and to keepe them from ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king wrong: and generally the duetie of man (according to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle</hi> in his first booke of Morals) is the inworking of the mind conformed vnto reason, or at least wise not alienated from rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; as when the crafts-man hauing purposed some peece of worke, employeth his skill and labour to bring his worke to a perfect end, so as the end and vtmost point of his honest and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous action, is his Dutie.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Two sortes of Duetie.</note>
                  <hi>Cicero</hi> in his booke of Duties, maketh two sorts thereof; the one he termeth right and perfect, which is matched with true vertue, and is peculiar to the discretion of the wise; as when it is demaunded what is wisdome, iustice, valeantnesse, or tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, or what is profit, or what is honestie. The other he tearmeth meane, which consisteth in precepts, whereby a man may stablish an honest trade of life; as when it is demaunded, why one thing should be done rather than another, and what dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference there is betwixt one thing and another, because the thing that well beseemeth a yong man, doth ill beseeme an old man; and that which well beseemeth a magistrate, or a prince, doth ill become a priuat person; and that which becommeth well a priuat person, doth ill become a prince. But these two sorts may be reduced into one, euen by the saying of the same
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:6660:10"/>
                  <hi>Cicero,</hi> who confesseth that these two sorts of duties tend both of them to the soueraigne good, and aime not at anie other end than that, sauing that the one belongeth to the wise, who aime not at any other law than onely vertue: and the other serueth for the directing of the common conuersation, in respect wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it needeth the helpe of lawes &amp; precepts. And as touching vs that are Christians, we may well say, that all our dueties tend to the soueraigne good, and are perfect, vnlesse ye will exact that exquisit perfection, which our Sauiour taught the yoong man whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he said vnto him, That if he would be perfect, it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him to sell all that he had, and to deale it vnto the poore, and to follow him. Therefore to know what is the duetie of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man, both prince and priuat, noble and vnnoble; our law-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker teacheth it vs in two precepts: whereof the first consisteth in the worshipping of God, and in the louing of him with all our heart: for it is reason that we should yeeld him faith and allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance for our creatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,<note place="margin">

                        <hi>Cicero</hi> in his second booke of the nature of the Gods. The louing of our neighbor is the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the law.</p>
                  </note> and for the great number of so many good things which we receiue dailie at his hand, seing that we peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of all other liuing wights, are beholders of the heauenly things that are aboue. The other is, for the instruction and stablish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the common conuersation; wherein consisteth the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of a christian, which is to loue his neighbour as himself. For (as saith S. <hi>Paule</hi> to the Romanes) it is a fulfilling of the law of God, and a confirming of the law of nature, which will not haue a man to doe that to an other, which he would not haue done to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. And he that keepeth this precept cannot do amisse. For it is very certaine, that no man hateth his own flesh, ne procureth any euill to himselfe, and therfore he vvill not do any such thing to his neighbour. Now then, we need not to be taught what is Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightnesse, Valeantnesse, and Staiednesse: for he that keepeth the said precept, will not do any vnright. But forasmuch as our own nature, by reason of the corruption thereof, maketh vs to step out of the right vvay; if vve will come into the true path a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, it be houeth vs of necessitie to peruse the law and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements, and to treat of the vertues which are termed Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall, namely, Wisedome, Vprightnesse, Valeantnesse, and Temperance, or Staiednesse; and of the branches depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

                  </note> It is the first and chiefest law of nature, that he which is vnable to gard and defend himselfe, should submit himselfe to him that is able and hath wherewith to do it; and such a one doe we tearme a chiefe man,<note place="margin">The prince is as a God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men.</note> or a prince, who ought to be esteemed as a God among men, (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith in his third booke of matters of state) or at least wise as next vnto God (as <hi>Tertullian</hi> saith vnto <hi>Scapula</hi>;) and such a one ought all others to obay as a person that hath the authoritie of God, as saith S. <hi>Paule.

                  </hi> signifieth to commaund. And albeit that in their armies, the Romanes had captaines whom they called Emperors, which commaunded absolutely, and were obayed as kings, yet did not any man v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpe or take to himselfe that title of Emperor, vnlesse he had done some notable exploit of warre. Insomuch that <hi>Crassus</hi> was counted a man but of base minde and small courage, and of slender hope, to atchieue any great or haughty matters, that could finde in his heart to be named emperor, for taking a silly towne called Zenodotia. Afterward when the state of the common weale was chaunged, by reason of the ciuill warres, and reduced into a Monarchie, the successors of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Caesar,</hi> knowing how odious the name of king was to the Romanes, would not take that title vnto them, but conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themselues with the effect therof, they named them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues Emperors, which among vs is as much to say, as chiefe leaders or Generals of an armie or host of men. <hi>Plato</hi> in his booke of Lawes, teacheth vs seuen sorts of ruling or comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; the first is, that the father commaundeth his children; the second, that the valeant &amp; noble-minded commaund the weake and baseminded; the third, that the elder sort com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the yoonger; the fourth, that the maisters commaund the seruants; the fift, that the mightier commaunds the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler; the sixt, (which is the greatest dignitie) is, that the wise commaund the ignorant; and the seuenth, is that which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth by lot and by the grace of God; so as he that is chosen by lot, commandeth and raigneth, and he that faileth of it, is bound to obay.</p>

                  <hi>Cicero</hi> speaking of <hi>Pompey,</hi> saith, that a good emperor (that is to say, a good Generall of a field) must haue the skill of chiualrie and feats of arms, vertue, authoritie, and felicitie. He must be painfull in affaires, hardy in daungers, skilfull in deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing things, quicke in performing, and of good prouidence to foresee. <hi>Titus Liuius</hi> saith, that the great Captaine <hi>Hanniball</hi> was wonderful hardy in putting himselfe to the perils of warre, and very resolute in the middest of danger; that neither his
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:6660:12"/>
body nor his minde were fore-wearied with trauel, that he pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently abode both heat and cold alike, that he measured his eating and drinking rather by naturall appetite, than by plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; that for sleeping or waking<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he made no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene day and night; but looke what time remained vnto him from doing of his businesse, he bestowed it in taking his rest, not vpon a soft featherbed in some place far from noise, but ordinarily lying vpon the ground couered with a souldiers cassocke, among the warders, &amp; the whole troops of the men of armes. When he went among the horsemen or the foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, he marched alwaies formost, and was the first that gaue the onset, and when the fight was ended, he was the hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most in the retreit. <hi>Plutarch</hi> treating of <hi>Sertorius</hi> saith, that in matters ciuile he was gentle and courteous, and in matters of warre he was of great fiercenesse and forecast. He was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer seene surprised with feare or ioy, but like as in most perill he was void of feare, so in his prosperity he was very mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. He gaue not place in hardinesse to any of his time, nor for valiantnesse, in fighting, nor for setled resolution in all sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine aduentures. When any enterprise was to be done that required good aduise, or skill to choose the aduantage of some place of strong scituation to lodge in, or to giue battell, or to passe a riuer, or to shift off some mishap, &amp; that for the doing thereof there behoued great sleight, or the working of some policie, and the giuing of some gleeke to the enemie, in due time &amp; place, he was a most excellent crafts-maister. Besides all this, he was liberall &amp; magnificent in rewarding honorable deeds of arms, and meeld and mercifull in punishing misdeeds. He was not subiect to his bellie, neither did he drinke out of measure, no not euen when he had no businesse to do. In time of most vacation he was wont from his very youth to put himselfe to great trauell, to make long iourneis, to passe many nights together without sleepe, to eate little, &amp; to be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with such meats as came first to hand. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was at leisure, he was alwaies either riding, or hunting, or running, or walking abroad in the fields. I haue inserted this the more at
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:6660:13"/>
length, to the intent it may serue for a patterne to Princes that intend to prosper, and to performe their charge happily. Now let vs come to a king. The Latine word <hi>Rego,</hi> (whereof com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth <hi>Rex,</hi> which betokeneth a king) signifieth to rule or go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne. And so a king is nothing else but a ruler or gouerner of people. Likewise <hi>Homer</hi> termeth him sometime the Garni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sher, and sometime the heardman or sheepheard of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, because he ought to be carefull for his people,<note place="margin">Kings are heardmen and sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards of their people.</note> as the sheepheard is for his sheepe, and to watch ouer them as the sheepheard doth ouer his flocke, that no man doe them wrong. And (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> saith) a good prince is like a sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards dogge, which is alwaies in feare, not for himselfe, but least the wolfe should fall vpon the sheepe, and so is a good Prince in feare, not for himselfe, but least any euill should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall his subiects. <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his third booke of matters of State, saith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> There are foure sorts of kingdomes, the first is, where the king hath no soueraigne authoritie, further than in matters of warre, and in sacrifising; of which sort, were the kings of Sparta, or Lacedemon: and this maner of kingdome is as a perpetuall captaineship, matched with souereigne au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of life and death, such as <hi>Agamemnon</hi> had, who did put vp iniuries when he sate at counsell, but had power to put whom he listed to death when he was in armes. And of such kingdomes some goe by inheritance, and other some by ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. The second sort of kingdomes are those that goe both by inheritance and election, the which notwithstanding ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procheth vnto tyrannie, sauing that the keeping thereof is king-like, that is to say, the kinges are garded by their owne subiects, whereas the tyrants are garded by strangers. And the kings commaund by law, and are obayed with good will: wheras the tyrants raigne altogether by constraint. Insomuch that the one sort are garded by their owne citizens or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimen, and the other by strangers, against the countrimen. The third is Barbarous, not for that it is against law, but for that it is not in custome, of which sort was the gouernment of the Mitylenians, which chose <hi>Pittacus</hi> against their bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:6660:13"/>
perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. And the fourth sort is that which was vsed in the time of the noble princes, whom the Greeks called <hi>Heroes,</hi> who vsurped not dominion by force, but had it bestowed vpon them by the people, of good will, deliuered ouer afterward lawfully to their successors. They intended to the warres, and to church-matters, and therewithall iudged matters of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie. Of these foure sorts of kingdomes he maketh a fift, which is, when one commaundeth absolutely. This kind agreeth most to our time, specially in this country, where the king commaundeth absolutely, howbeit without infringing the law, for then were it not king-like, but tyran-like. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Aristotle,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">What a king is.</note> when a Prince reigneth without law, it is all one as if a wild beast reigned. A King then is a soueraigne Prince that reigneth ouer a people, not seeking his own pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar profit, but the profit of his subiects. This maner of reigning is like to houshold gouernment; for although the maister of the house do ouer-rule his traine and his seruaunts at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, yet notwithstanding he regardeth aboue all things the welfare of his familie: euen so a good king is to haue an eye most principally to the welfare and benefit of his houshold, namely of his subiects. For vpon them dependeth his owne welfare, as the welfare of the maister of a household depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vpon his meiny and seruants.<note place="margin">A king must commaund his subiects as a father doth his children.</note> One being asked vpon a time what a prince was to doe, that he might raigne wel; said, He must commaund his subiects as a father commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his children; for the father commaundeth not his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren any thing, but that which is for their welfare. In this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect <hi>Homer</hi> called <hi>Iupiter</hi> Father of Gods and men, according to the saying of our Lord, who hath taught vs to call the soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Monarch, (I meane the aeternall God) Our father; and not our king and our Lord: whereby he teacheth vs, that the true soueraigntie is that which resembleth the soueraigntie of fathers, and that the true subiects are those that resemble chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. <note n="*" place="margin">The iust co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

obedience of the subiects. And if either of them both faile, it is like the separation of the soule and the body, in the life of man; as king <hi>Francis</hi> the first, right excellently declared to the men of Rochell, in the yeare of our Lord, fiue hundred forty three. <hi>Isocrates</hi> in the instruction which he giueth to <hi>Nicocles,</hi> saith thus; It is to no purpose for you to haue faire horses, and faire hounds, if ye take no pleasure of them, ne loue them: so is it also to no purpose for a prince to haue such subiects as he desireth, if he take no pleasure in dealing well with them. And as the same author saith; Those kingdomes and states of gouernment continue long, which are charie ouer the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of their people. The treasure of a good prince that loueth his subiects, is in the houses of his subiects; and it is a common saying, That the pouertie of a prince appeareth by the pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of his subiects; but when they be well at ease, and weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie, then is the prince to be deemed rich.<note place="margin">The marke of a tyrant.</note> Therefore the marke of a tyrant, whom <hi>Homer</hi> termeth, A deuourer of his people, is to be seene in the pouertie of the subiects, for that he fleeceth them to enrich those that are about him, namely the ministers of his pleasures, and of his euil lusts; which thing causeth all men to hate him, and to shun him as a witlesse beast, so that for his reward he hath the indignation of God, and hatred of man, a short life, and a perpetuall shame: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the reward of a good Prince, that keepeth the laws, hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vprightnesse, and iudgeth according to iustice, is to liue and raigne long time, as <hi>Moses</hi> affirmeth. Which thing <hi>Philo</hi> laying foorth at large<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> saith, That although a prince die in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, yet liueth he still for euer by his vertues, which cannot be abolished or defaced by death.<note place="margin">A Kingdome.</note> A kingdome therefore is a publike state, wherin one only commandeth, hauing respect to the common-weale.<note place="margin">Tyrannie.</note> The contrary whereof is Tyrannie, which is a monarchie that respecteth alonly the profit of the monarch.

and in that respect is not ordinarily beloued of his people, nor of any good men, therefore he is faine to keepe a gard of strangers about him, to make men feare him and obay him by force, which force of his maketh him the more behated. For the maintaining of which guard, he is faine to be at great char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, which is a cause that he becommeth the more odious, by his charging and greeuing of the people.<note place="margin">The way to winne loue.</note> And therefore a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Gymnosophist of India being asked of <hi>Alexander,</hi> by what means he might make himselfe most beloued, answered wisely: By being very good, and by dealing so as men should not stand in feare of him. For feare is an ill preseruer of the thing that is to continue. And it is apparent, that such men en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure but a little while, for as soone as the patience of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple beginneth to faile, by and by those princes loose their children and their state: as it befell to <hi>Denis</hi> the tyrant of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racuse, and diuers other like.<note place="margin">Vniustice is the cause of the alteration of states.</note> For (as saith <hi>Ecclesiasticus</hi>) a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is transferred from one nation to another, for the vniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, the iniuries, the extortions, and the fraudes that are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted. <hi>Paulus Iouius</hi> speaking of <hi>Ismael Sophie,</hi> saith, That after he had recouered his gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dfathers kingdome, by the fauor of the prouinces that were greatly affectioned towards him, he released the tribute inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinently; being alwais of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that the good will of men (which is easily wone by libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality &amp; iustice) was the surest strength of a kingdome; and (to his seeming) it was not the part of a good king, but of a proud Potentate and new vpstart, to raigne lord-like ouer the only goods of his people, when the hearts of them all were estran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from him by the grieuousnesse of tributes.<note place="margin">The king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome that is maintained by friendly dealing, is stronger than that which is vpheld by force.</note> Therfore I will conclude, that the kingdome which is maintained by fauora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble means, is much more strong and durable, than that which is vpheld by force. Which thing <hi>Philip</hi> king of Macedonia perceiuing, sought by al means he could, to continue in friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with the Greeks, notwithstnading that he was often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times constrained to vse force, in bereauing them of their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. And vpon a time when he was councelled by his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullest seruants, to set Garrisons in all the cities of Greece that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:6660:15"/>
he had conquered, he would not take knowledge of it, saying, he had leuer to be esteemed a good man for a long time, than to be king or a lord for a short time, because he thought that the soueraigntie which is held by loue is durable, whereas the soueraignty that is held by violence &amp; terror, cannot continue any long time. At another time, hauing gotten the possession of a certain place in Peloponnesus, he deliberated a long time whether he should keepe it, or leaue it to the Messenians, wherein he asked the aduice of <hi>Aratus</hi> and <hi>Demetrius.</hi> The opinion of <hi>Demetrius</hi> was, That he shuld hold fast the Oxe by both the hornes; meaning, that he should easily keepe the country of Peloponnesus, if he had the said towne which was called Ithomata, together with Acrocorinth, which he had already. But <hi>Aratus</hi> after long thinking vpon the matter said thus, Sir, the Phocenses haue many cities, and so haue also the Acarnanians, all wel fortified, as wel in the firme land, as vpon the Sea-cost: of all these you shall not enioy any, and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding they faile not to doe whatsoeuer you commaund them, without compulsion. The outlawes are in the rocks and mountaines,<note place="margin">No castle so strong as good will.</note> and there they hold themselues strong: but vnto a king there is no castle more strong and sure, than good will. Also counsell was giuen to <hi>Antigonus,</hi> to place a good garison in Athens, to keepe it from reuolting any more, and to make it as a bulwarke against all Greece, but he answered, That there was not a better bulwarke, than the loue of the people.<note place="margin">The best Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warke is the peoples loue.</note> And as <hi>Plutarch</hi> saith in the life of <hi>Aratus,</hi> The surest guard that a great lord can haue, is the true and constant good will of his subiects. For when the nobilitie &amp; communalty of a country are wont to be afraid, not of him, but for him that gouerneth them, then doth he see with many eies, and heare with many eares, and perceiueth a far off, whatsoeuer is done. And therfore there is more profit and more honor also in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a king, than in being a tyrant. And as it is Gods commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement and will, that the prince should haue a singular care and regard of the welfare and benefite of his people, because he is chosen to be vnto them a defender and protector: so on
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:6660:15"/>
the contrarie part, he is forbidden by the mouth of <hi>Salomon,</hi> to pill and oppresse the poore, because they be succourlesse. For the Lord (saith he) will take their cause in hand, &amp; will deale roughly with such as haue dealt roughly with them.</p>

               <head>CHAP. III. Of the three sorts of Gouernment, and which of the three is the best.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Orasmuch as we treat of the state of gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we must not suffer a very co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon thing to passe in silence, which yet (to my seeming) ought not to be omitted, namely, that there be three sorts of ciuill gouernments appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the world; whereof the one is called by the generall name of a Publike-weale, wherin all men as wel poore as rich, noble as vnnoble, are admitted to gouerne by turne. Another is called Aristocracie, which is compacted of some smal num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of noblemen, and men of reputation, who beare all the sway. And the third is the Monarchie, or Kingdome, wherin al things are at the commandment of one alone. These three sorts of gouernment, because they tend all to the welfare of the whole state, are all allowable, and many like well to be vnder them, some vnder one, and some vnder another, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the humors of people be diuersly disposed. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, The Aegyptians could not abide to be without a king, and the Athenians could not endure to haue a king. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries to these three sorts of gouernment are faulty and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; namely Democracie, the contrarie to a Publike-weale: wherin the people beare all the sway alone, and carrie all the credite, without calling the nobilitie and gentlemen to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel. Oligarkie, the contrararie to Aristocracie; which is the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of some few men, that conuert all things to their
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:6660:16"/>
owne profit: and tyranny the contrarie to a kingdome, which is the gouernment of one alone that doth all things at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, without refourming himselfe to law and reason. To say which of the said three good states is the best, it is a hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;<note place="margin">The praise of Arist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cracie.</note> yet notwithstanding many men prefer Aristocracie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Kingdome, because it is not ruled by the discretion of any one transitorie man, vpon the valour whereof the welfare of the whole state might depend, but it is gouerned by the immortall counsell of an euerlasting senate. For it is a rare matter to find any one man so fully perfect &amp; worthie to raign. And as <hi>Nicholas Foscarin</hi> of Venice said,<note place="margin">Kings do not so easily res<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>st their lusts as priuat per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons doe.</note> Kings doe not easily resist their owne lusts as priuat persons do; because that in as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as they be customably honoured in their kingdomes, and are heard and obayed in the twinckling of an eie, they be not only high-minded and insolent, but also impatient if they obtaine not whatsoeuer seemeth iust vnto them; and to their seeming, all things is iust that they desire; bearing themselues in hand, that with one word they can put away all impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ouercome the nature of all things; nay, they thinke it a shame for them to shrinke from their inclinations, for any difficulties; taking counsell, not of discretion &amp; reason, but of their own will &amp; statelinesse. And as <hi>Soderin Gonfalonier</hi> of Florence said; (when he moued the Florentines to take a parte, and not to be newtors any more) Princes thinke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged when they be denied their requests, &amp; flie vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on euery man that followeth not their will, and hazardeth not his state together with theirs.<note place="margin">The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the state of a kingdome.</note> But if they be such as they ought to be, vndoubtedly it is the greatest good turne that can befall to a realme, and most resembling God, who by his euerlasting prouidence, raigneth alone ouer the whole world. And it is also conformable and drawing neere to our nature, wherin we see one that ouer-ruleth all the rest; for if we consider our body, we see it is ouer-ruled by a soule, which giueth mouing to all the members, without the which, the body is but as a blocke. Among our members we haue a heart, which is (as you would say) the Prince and king of all the rest. And in the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:6660:16"/>
mind, reason beareth chiefe rule. The Bees haue their king. In an armie there is a generall that commaundeth, and in a ship there is a Pilot that guideth it. Rome could not abide two brothers raigning together. <hi>Esau</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> stroue euen in their mothers wombe. In the church-gouernment one only bishop or Metropolitane commaundeth. In a house there is but one maister, the residue are but seruants, obaying the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements of the maister of the house. And therefore he that would haue altered the kingdome of Sparta into a popular state, came short; insomuch that <hi>Agesilaus</hi> said vnto him, It was meet that he should first stablish a popular state in his owne house: doing vs to vnderstand, that that forme of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment which a man would be loath to haue in his house, is not meet to be in a citie or country. For (as saith <hi>Aristotle</hi>) A citie is nothing else but a great houshold. To the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose did <hi>Homer</hi> say, That the gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of many was nothing woorth, and that mo than one gouernor needed not. After the death of <hi>Cambises,</hi> when the Princes of Persia had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsed the Magies, who had inuaded the empire, they as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled together, to consult how they might thensforth go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne the State. In this meeting there were three sundry opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. One was of <hi>Othanes,</hi> who said there needed no king to be chosen, but that the affaires of the realme were to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged by all men in common, and euerie man ought to be left at his owne libertie, without subiection to any one, because it is ordinarily seene,<note place="margin">Sole gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment maketh men insolent.</note> that a sole soueraign becommeth insolent, and that if he be displeased, he may satisfie his insolencie to the full. <hi>Megabysus</hi> was of the contrarie opinion, saying that such libertie is more dangerous than Tyranny, because that if the noblemen and cities should be without a soueraigne lord, they might abuse that libertie at their pleasure. And therefore he thought it good, that neither the cities them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, nor the whole multitude of the nobilitie, should haue the managing of the publike affairs; but that the doing therof should be committed to some certaine number of good and vertuous Princes, which should haue the gouerning of the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:6660:17"/>
State, and be obeyed as a king of all the rest. But <hi>Darius</hi> liked none of both those aduises, because that if all men should be at libertie, without obedience to anie, it could not continue long, forsomuch as it was not possible, that a multitude of free lords could any long time agree among themselues; and to take any small number of them to rule the State, it was also vnconuenient, because there would rise innumerable matters, wherein the princes would not be all of one mind; and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, there would alwaies be some one or other that would attempt to controle the rest, which thing would breed dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among them, and finally the ruine of the State. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was of opinion that of all the kinds of gouernment, ther was not a better than the Monarchie. The which aduise of his,<note place="margin">Kingdomes haue passed al other states of gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, both in largenesse of dominion, &amp; in length of time.</note> all the rest of the princes followed. Of a verie truth we see, that neither the State of Aristocracie, nor the State of Democracie, haue atteined to like greatnesse as kingdoms haue, sauing onely Rome for the largenesse of empire, and Venice, for continuance of time. For, as for Lacedemon and Athens, their dominions extended but a little way, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that the one of them made their power to be seene in the lesser Asia, and the other became terrible to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians. But aboue all other,<note place="margin">A commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the popular state<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> the popular gouernment is most vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weeldie, because it is full of ignorance and confusednesse of people; whose nature (as said <hi>Bellifarius</hi>) is to moue by rage, rather than by reason; and who (as saith <hi>Guicciardine</hi>) groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding themselues vpon deceitfull and vaine hopes, &amp; being fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in their dealings, when danger is far off, and quite out of courage when peril doth approch, are not in any wise to be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led or restrained. And (as <hi>Philip</hi> of Nauar was wont to say) there is not any certain stay in a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munaltie; &amp; for that cause he would not trust the Parisians, nor come within their citie, what shew of good will soeuer they were able to make; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suading himselfe that he could not be in sufficient suretie, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong so great a number of people of so diuers humors. Which thing the Senat of Rome considering, chose rather to giue their people Tribunes, than to giue vnto them the reines of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:6660:17"/>
authoritie without a magistrat.<note place="margin">People are more tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hauing a head, than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without a head.</note> For although the power of the tribunes was ouer-great, yet thought they it better than the ouer-vehement and boistrous power of the people; who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more tractable when they haue a head, than when they be without one; For a head considereth the danger, but the people cast no perill at all. The popular gouernment is hard to be dealt with; for it is a beast with many heads, which doth good vnto them that would it euill, and requite euill to them that doe it good.<note place="margin">The reward of such as serue in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular state.</note> As the Athenians did to <hi>Miltiades,</hi> whom in recompence of the good which he had done them in deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering them from a dangerous siege, and in vanquishing ten hundred thousand Persians, himselfe hauing but ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand men, they amerced at a great fine, keeping him in prison till he had fully paid it, and finally banished him out of the country. They did as much to <hi>Themistocles, Aristides, Alcibia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> and other good captaines of their citie, whereof anon after ensued their owne decay. We know how <hi>Iames</hi> of Arteuill go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned the people of Gaunt in his time, and what power and authoritie he had ouer them, and how he was beloued of all; and yet neuerthelesse they put him to death vpon a small sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition, and would not so much as heare his reasons. They did as much to <hi>Iohn Boulle,</hi> one of their captains, because that without cause and without likelihood, they had wrongfully surmised of him, that he had brought them into an ambush, vpon secret compact with the earle of Flaunders; and he was not permitted to shew his reasons and excuses. For with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hearing him, they drew him out of his lodging into the street, and there hewed him into small peeces, euerie man ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying away a peece that could come by it. Therefore <hi>Demost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henes,</hi> who was banished Athens as others had been, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring how Athens was dedicated to <hi>Minerua,</hi> said; O <hi>Pallas,</hi> what meanest thou to enterteine so wicked and foule beasts, as a night-owle, a dragon, and a popular gouernment? for vnto <hi>Pallas</hi> were these things dedicated. And <hi>Aristides</hi> the best man of life that euer was in Athens, vpbraided the Athenians with their rashnesse, who had condemned him for excecuting
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:6660:18"/>
his charge faithfully, in not suffering the common treasure to be robbed &amp; spoiled, and had had him in great loue and esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, when he winked at the pilfries which he saw commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as though he had then worthily &amp; faithfully discharged his duty. For a multitude is hard to be ruled, and other counsel is there none with them, than such as they bring of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, misconceiued, misvnderstood, misiudged by passions; neither is there any thing so vnequall in a common-weale, as that is which they call equalitie of persons. All is there equall and euen, sauing their minds, which are as farre at oddes as may be. And yet notwithstanding, because things goe by the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of voices, without weighing them otherwise, they passe alwaies with the most number, that is to say, with the fooli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shest opinion.<note place="margin">In the citie of Athens, wise men propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, and fooles iudge.</note> By reason whereof, <hi>Anacharsus</hi> said, that in the citie of Athens, wise men propounded matters, and fooles iudged of them.

As touching the common-weale of Rome, albeit that the Romanes had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered the whole world by battell, yetnotwithstanding they were oftentimes ill gouerned, for all their good policie. For after that the kings were once expulsed, the citie was neuer without quarels, some while against the ten co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>missioners; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther while the people against the Senat, and the Senat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the people; one while against the tribunes, and another while against the consuls: and nothing did euer vphold and maintaine the citie so much and so long, as the forreigne wars, which caused them to compound their quarrels at home, without the doing wherof they could neuer haue continued; for as soone as they had any vacation from forreigne warres, by and by they lost their libertie, and found from that time forth, that the opinion of <hi>Scipio Nasica</hi> was grounded vpon great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, when he would not that Carthage should haue been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:6660:18"/>
that it might haue kept Rome stil in hir rigo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t wirs, for in very deed, their couetousnesse and ambition bred cruell dissentions among them, which in the end did bring the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of their State.<note place="margin">Whether dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sention be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite in a common weale or no.</note> And therefore I will not say but that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreements are often times necessarie in a house, a kingdome, or a coimmon-weale, and that (as <hi>Onomademus</hi> said after the rebellon of the Island Chios) it is not behooffull to make cleane riddance of ell enemies, for feare least there should be dissention among friends. I am fully persuaded it is not amisse to suffer some enemies to spight one another, as well for the reason aforementioned, as also for that the enemies by their crossing one another, doe discouer their owne lewdnesse, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetousnesse, and ambition, to the benefit of the prince and of the common-weale; and yet notwithstanding are afraid to doe euil, least men should espie their doings and behauior. And (as saith <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the life of <hi>Pompey</hi>) the disagreement of two mightie citizens that are at variance among themselues, vpholds the common weale in equall ballance, like a staffe that is equallie charged at both the ends, so as it cannot sway one way or other. But come they once to ioine in one body, &amp; to knit themselues together in one, then it maketh so great an inclination or sway, as no man can withs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>and; insomuch that in the end,<note place="margin">The friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Pompey</hi> was the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of the common<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>weale.</note> they turne all things vpside downe, &amp; therfore vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to such as went about, complaining that the quarrell &amp; enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> had ouerthrowne the common-weale, <hi>Cato</hi> said that they ouershot themselues very greatly in saying so, because it was not their discord and enmitie, but rather their friendship and good agreement that was the first and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall cause therof. When Pope <hi>Iuly</hi> had made a league with the Venetians and the king of Arragon, against the French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, many men commended his dealing, as wherby he meant to driue away the Frenchmen at the costs of the Spaniards, in hope to driue away the Spaniards afterward, when they had bin tired already by the Frenchmen. But the best adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed sort found this counsell to be pernicious vnto Italy, saying; that sith it was the hard hap of Italy, to haue both the ends
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:6660:19"/>
thereof possessed by straungers, it was better for the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie to haue them both continue there still, (because that as long as the one king was able to weigh euen with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, those that were not yet entered into bondage, should be able to maintaine their owne libertie) than that the Italians should be at warres among themselues, by means whereof so long as such warres continued, the parties that were yet whole and sound should be torne in pieces by sacking, burning, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther miserable inconueniences, and finally he that gained the goale, would punish the whole country with the harder and irkesomer bondage. That was the cause why Pope <hi>Clement</hi> turned to the French kings side, bearing himselfe in hand, that as long as the emperour and the king continued both in Italy, the Apostolike sea should be vpheld by the power of either of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; and therfore he would not suffer the kingdome of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and the duchie of Millan to fall both into one hand. Small dissentions forasmuch as they be intermingled both with perill and profit, cannot ouerthrow a state, but when the dissention is great,<note place="margin">Great dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between ouer-great personages is dangerous to a state.</note> and betweene great persons, it maketh strange tragedies, as did the dissentions betweene <hi>Marius</hi> and <hi>Silla, Pompey</hi> and <hi>Caesar.</hi> For hauing once gained and drawne vnto them the whole citie of Rome, and hauing weapon in hand, and men of warre at commaundement, they could hardly eschew, that their discord should not procure the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of the state. The enmitie that was betweene <hi>Aristides</hi> and <hi>Themistocles,</hi> had like to haue ouerthrowne the state of Athens: and when vpon a time they had nothing preuailed in an assembly by their quarelings, <hi>Themistocles</hi> returning thence in a great rage, said; that the common-weale of Athens could not continue in good state, vnlesse that he himselfe and <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stides</hi> were both cast downe. The enuie that some citizens bare vnto <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> was a cause of the destruction of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens. Likewise the state of Florence was in short time ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne by such partakings. The Romanes in time of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger chose a dictator that had soueraign authoritie; but he was not to continue any long time, for feare least his ouer-great
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:6660:19"/>
authoririe should turne into tyranny. When <hi>Cicero</hi> was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sull, there was giuen vnto him a greater authoritie than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie, in these words namelie, That he should haue a speciall care of the common-weale, that it incurred not any danger; and this was at such time as they perceiued the conspiracie of <hi>Catilin</hi> to hang ouer their heads. <hi>Cicero</hi> in this his time of authoritie, did put many noble men of Rome to death, being first atteinted and conuicted of high treason, which thing he could not otherwise haue done. The Senat perceiuing that the magistrats of Rome did not their duties, and that all went to hauoke, determined to chuse <hi>Pompey</hi> to be Consul alone, to reforme the common-weale: and of that mind also were <hi>Bibulus</hi> and the yonger <hi>Cato,</hi> howbeit that they liked not of <hi>Pompeys</hi> behauior and trade of life, saying it was much better to haue a Magistrat, be what he be may, than to haue none at all.<note place="margin">The absolute gouernment is best and most certain.</note> And this their vsing of the absolute maner of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment by one alone in the times of danger, doth shew that they liked better of it, and esteemed it to be better and more certaine, than the maner of gouernment that was in Athens; and that they abhorred not so much the thing it selfe, as the name thereof. Also <hi>Mithridates</hi> king of Pontus said, That the Romanes hated their kings, because they were such as they were ashamed of, as namely Shepheards, Bird-gazers, Sooth-sayers, Outlawes, Bondmen, and (which was the fairest title of all) Vain-glorious and Proud. The Carthaginenses like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise had but one Generall captaine of warre, whom they changed oftentimes.

longer time. As for example, the kingdome of Assyria had mo Kingdomes and countries vnder the dominion thereof, than euer had the citie of Rome. The Romane empire lasted part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at Rome, and partly at Constantinople, about fifteene hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares. The Empire of Almaine (which began vnder <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho</hi> the second, about two hundred yeares after the coronation of <hi>Charlemaine</hi>) hath continued vnto this day: but yet in some things it sauoreth of the Aristocracie. The kingdome of France hath endured about a twelue hundred yeares. As for the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of Venice, the gouernment wherof is an Aristocracie, is the Paragon of all Common-weales in the world, as which alonely may vant that it hath maintained his state the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est time of all others, howbeit with such good lawes as were able to preserue it, as they well shewed vnto one of their ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, whom they dispatched out of his life without speaking any word vnto him, only because he was of authoritie and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to appease a certaine sedition or mutinie among the men of warre in their citie. And to say the truth, the thing that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrew the state of Rome, was the ouer-great authoritie which they suffered their citizens to beare.</p>

And (as sayd <hi>Othanes</hi>) he peruerteth the lawes and the customs of the countrie, he rauisheth women, and he putteth folke to death without sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of condemnation. If ye commend him modestly, he is discontented that ye doe it not excessiuely: and if you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend him out of measure, he is offended as though ye did it of flatterie. <hi>Policrates</hi> the tyrant of the Isle of Samos, made warre vpon all his neighbours without any respect; saying that he pleasured his friend the more in restoring to him that which he had taken from him, than if he had not taken ought from him first. Neuerthelesse, it behoueth a Prince to thinke that if he forget himselfe and doe not his dutie, ne performeth

Whereunto his sonne an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered him, that he had not had a king to his father: neither shall you (quoth his father) haue a king to your son, except you doe better. And as he had said, so it came to passe. <hi>Peter</hi> king of Castile, for his tyrannie and wicked demeanor towards his subiects, was first driuen out of his realme by his bastard-bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, aided with the helpe of such as hated <hi>Peter</hi>; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward when he had recouered it againe, by the means of the blacke Prince, as soone as his brother the bastard came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine with any force, all the countrie reuolted from him to the bastard, and the Spaniards that were with him would neither put on armor nor mount on horse-backe at his commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; by reason whereof, he was faine to craue succour of strangers, and yet notwithstanding he lost the battell, &amp; with the battell, both his kingdome and his life. <hi>Alfons</hi> the yonger, king of Naples, hauing done many tyrannicall deeds, fled di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shonorably out of his kingdome at the comming of <hi>Charles</hi> the 8. king of France; and (as <hi>Guicciardine</hi> reporteth) being tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the sting of his owne conscience, found no rest of mind day nor night: for a night-times, those whom he had wronged appeared vnto him in his sleepe; &amp; a day-times, he saw his people making insurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> against him, to be reuenged.

Of that opinion is <hi>Cicero</hi> in his bookes of Duties, saying that Kings were chosen at the first, for the good opinion that men had of them. And in another place he saith, That when folke found themselues harried and troden vnderfoot by the richersort, they were constrained to haue recourse to some man of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent prowesse, to defend them from the oppression of the mightier sort, and to maintaine both great and small in a kind of equalitie. Of the same opinion likewise is <hi>Aristotle.</hi> Because the men of old time (saith he, were benefactors to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munaltie, either by the inuention and practise of arts, or by making warres in their behalf, or by assembling them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether into corporations, and by allotting them their terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories; the multitude did willinglie create them Kings, &amp; so they conueyed their kingdomes ouer by succession to their
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:6660:21"/>
posterities. <hi>Plinie</hi> saith, that the Athenians were the first that brought vp the popular gouernment, which neuerthelesse had been vsed long afore by the Iewes, as <hi>Iosephus</hi> witnesseth in his books of their antiquities. Indeede <hi>Thucidides</hi> in his first booke of the warres of Peloponnesus, saith, that when the countrie of Greece was become rich by reason of the nauigations, there stept vp euerie day new tyrants in the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, by reason of the greatnesse of their reuenues. For afore that time, the kings came in by Succession, and had their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities, prerogatiues, and preheminences limited. Whereby he doth vs to vnderstand, that kingdomes were afore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weales, as indeed there is great likelihood that the state of a king was the foremost. And it is not to be doubted, but the first men that were after the the floud, when the earth was repeopled againe, did rule the lands which they possessed, first in their owne housholds, and afterward (when they were increased) in gouerning the whole off-spring that came of their race, as we see was done by <hi>Sem, Cham, Iaphet, Ianus, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, Samothes,</hi> and such others, of whom some reigned in the West, and some in the East. And <hi>Nembroth</hi> of <hi>Chams</hi> linage,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Nembroth</hi> the first King.</note> was the first that troubled his neighbours, by making warre vpon them, and the first that made himselfe a king, as S. <hi>Iohn Chrisostome</hi> affirmeth vpon the ninth of Genesis. For afore that time time there could be no king, because there were no store of people to be subiects. Also <hi>Abraham</hi> hauing a great houshold, tooke three hundred and eighteene of his owne men, and pursuing those that had spoiled <hi>Lot,</hi> discomfited them. The fathers of old time therefore hauing many slaues and seruants, which were multiplied afterward with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of their issue, had them at commaundement as a King hath his subiects. And of this opinion seemeth <hi>Iustine</hi> to be, in his abridgement of <hi>Trogus Pompeius</hi>; who saith in his first booke, That at the beginning euery nation and euerie citie was gouerned by kings; and that such as had none of their owne, did chuse one, either for the good opinion which they had of the person whom they chose, or for some good turne

which they had receiued at his hand, or else for that they felt themselues misused by their head, whom they themselues had set ouer them, as it befell by the sonnes of <hi>Samuel,</hi> whose vniust behauior caused the Iews to demaund a King.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ome there are that demaund, whether it be more behoofull and expedient for the welfare of a people, to haue a king by Election, or by Succession. For if ye proceed by Election, it is to be presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that ye will choose the best, namely such a one as hath made good proofe of himselfe, and is knowne to be wise, fortunat, and valeant. Or if ye let it goe by Succession, it may be that the king shall be yoong, of small experience, and of little vnderstanding. And therefore <hi>Alexander</hi> knowing the dutie of a king, said; He would leaue his kingdome to the worthiest. <hi>Pirrhus</hi> being as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of his children to whom he would leaue his kingdome, answered, To him that of you all hath the sharpest sword; as if he should say, to him that is the most valeant. Whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer would maintaine this opinion, should haue reasons enow to vphold and defend it. Yet notwithstanding we ought to rest vpon the custome of the country, and not to swarue from it. Such as are wont to choose their king, do well and worthily therein. And yet the granting of a kingdome to goe by Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesion, which also is a very generall custome in most coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,<note place="margin">Elections are causes of great warres.</note> is not to be misliked. For oftentimes it falleth out, that
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:6660:22"/>
Elections are a cause of many warres, as we haue seene in the Romane emperors.<note place="margin">In the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome that goes by inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance there is no cause of warre.</note> On the other side, when the kingdome goeth by succession, there is no quarrell or ciull warre, because it is knowne who ought to be king. For that cause did <hi>Ge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rike</hi> appoint by his will, that his children should exceed one another in the kingdome, so that after the death of his eldest sonne, dying without issue, the eldest next him should suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede. And as long as that order was obserued among them, the kingdome continued in the race of <hi>Gensrike</hi>; as witnesseth <hi>Iordane</hi> in his historie of the Gothes. Moreouer, a father is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to leaue all things in best order to his children, the which thing tendeth alwaies to the publike commoditie. Contrariwise they that are chosen, endeuor rather to dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish than to enlarge their kingdomes, because they shall not leaue them to their heires; and therefore they labor to draw all things to their owne peculiar profit, that they may leaue to their familie some frute of the kingdome wherto they were come; and therwithall they be bound to fauor and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence their Electors, which cannot be done without expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and charges to the common-weale. And it will not serue the purpose to say, that oftentimes it falleth out, that kings are yoong and vnder age, and consequentlie without authoritie, and without abilitie to gouerne themselues, and much lesse their people; or else that they be witlesse, or out of their wits, which is worse. For it is well knowne, that nothing is so well ordered in this world, nor any law so well stablished, which may not admit some inconuenience. But in this case the incounenience is such,<note place="margin">A King that is vnder age ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth by his counsell.</note> as may easily be remedied. For if a king be yoong, he hath a Counsell, by whom oftentimes he ruleth better than some old man that will needs do all things on his owne head; as we read of <hi>Iosias,</hi> who was crowned at se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen yeares of age, and raigned forty yeares, in which time he did not any thing which was not to be done; so as the mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of his age, made him not to be the lesse honored &amp; regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Herof we haue record in little <hi>Europus</hi> king of Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, the presence of whom (notwithstanding that he lay in his
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:6660:23"/>
cradle) caused his subiects to win the battell; and the Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians said all with one voice, That when they fled afore, they wanted not corage, but their king; in whose presence they fought as manfully, as if he had beene of discretion to haue marked them that did well. And although we haue somtimes had warres by reason of the minoritie and debilitie of our kings as it happened in the times of S. <hi>Lewis,</hi> of <hi>Charles</hi> the sixt, and lastly of the late king <hi>Charles</hi> whom God pardon; yet may we well avow, that we neuer had so much harme therby, as the Romans had by their wicked emperors, that came in by Election, yea euen by the best taught of them, as <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> was, who being trained vp in all duties of honor and godlinesse, by <hi>Varia Mesa,</hi> did neuerthelesse become one of the wickedst creatures vnder the sunne.<note place="margin">Wicked kings are sent of God for the sins of the people.</note> And therefore we may well say, that it commeth of Gods will, who according to his threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Israelites in old time, sendeth vs babes or fooles to be our gouernors, when he listeth to punish vs, and oftentimes princes well brought vp, but yet abiding in their wicked and il-disposed nature, such as were <hi>Tiberius, Nero, Caligula,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit other mo. Neuerthelesse there is this difference, that the king which is of tender yeares, or simple-witted, hath his counsell, which notwithstanding that they be oftentimes at ods among themselues, omit not for all that, to giue him good counsel in most things. But as for the Prince that is of a froward nature, he beleueth nothing but that which is of his own head; neither giueth he himselfe to any thing else than to do mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheefe. I know wel that the minoritie of a prince is oftentimes the cause of many dissentions &amp; partakings for the gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t:<note place="margin">The state of the time and of affaires, causeth ciuill warres.</note> and that men stand not in so great awe of him, as of an elder person, that is well aduised. But yet the state of the time and of affaires, doth more in that behalfe, than all other things. For if they happen vnder a prince that is yong or simple-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they procure great tragedies; and yet for all that they faile not to step in also euen vnder a king that is man-growne and well aduised. If <hi>Robert</hi> of Artois (who was the cause of all the misfortune that we had in France, by the Englishmen)
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:6660:23"/>
had beene in the time of a young prince, men would haue said, that the small regard which he had of the princes age, had made him to despise him. And yet neuerthelesse, hauing to do with a king of full age and well experienced aforehand, he forbare not for all that, to make open warre vpon him, and to cause the English men to come into France, vpon a cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler and despite, for that <hi>Philip</hi> of Valois had adiudged the earledome of Artoys to his aunt. The king of Nauar had to do with a king of sufficient years, &amp; with such a one as had not then tasted of such misfortune as he felt afterward by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and yet notwithstanding hee forbare not to giue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny proud attempts against him, to slea his constable, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to be at his commaundement, vntill the king had giuen him his sonne the earle of Aniou in hostage. At such time as <hi>Charles</hi> the fift was regent of France, the same king of Nauar, being vnderpropped by certain seditious persons of Paris, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare not to make warre vpon the said <hi>Charles,</hi> for all his wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, puissance, and good gouernment. In the time of <hi>Charles</hi> the sixt,<note place="margin">Priuat quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels caused the wars vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Charles</hi> the sixt.</note> no such distresses &amp; aduersities had befaln in France, but for the iarres that were betweene the houses of <hi>Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die</hi> and <hi>Orleans.</hi> And therefore we must not impute the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, so much to the vnskilfulnesse of the king, as to priuat quarrels, and to the troublesomnesse of the time wherein he raigned, which was such, that if they had had neuer so sage a prince, he should haue found himselfe very sore cumbred. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that <hi>Charles</hi> the seuenth had recouered all France, he was not so greatly redouted, nor so setled in peace, but there remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto him some small ciuill warres. <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleuenth was a prince of sufficient wisdome, forecast, and age, to guide himselfe; and yet he could not turne away the warres from the common weale, which had not hapned vnder princes of vnripe years. For the gouernors of a yoong prince durst not to haue despised the greatmen openly, nor to haue defeated the antient officers, as he did; whereof insued euill vnto him. What would haue been said of the war in Germanie, if it had happened vnder a simple witted Emperour, seing it befell vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:6660:24"/>
a prince of gouernment, fortunat, puissant, and well adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed? Men haue imputed our warres to the minoritie of the late king. But had he been much elder than he was, he could not haue preuented them, seing that to the discontentment of most men, the case stood vpon the state of religion, a matter sufficient (being so intermedled both with matters of state, and with priuat quarrels) to maintaine the tragedies that we haue seene. Therefore it behoueth vs to yeeld vnto custome, and to say with S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The hearts of kings are in the hand of God.</note> That the power of a king commeth of God; and likewise with <hi>Salomon</hi> in his Prouerbs, That the heart of a king is in the hand of God; as is the course of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and that he inclineth them which way he listeth.

Among the authors of our time, <hi>Francis Petrarch</hi> hath written very largely therof, teaching of the nursing of a prince, of his keeping of company, of his tutors and teachers, of the maner how to make him a god horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and consequently of good horses; of running, of wrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and of other exercises of the body; of shooting, of hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, of hawking, and consequently of the nature of hawkes; of playing at tennis, and other pastimes; of husbandry, of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ographie, and of Cosmographie. But my intent is not to traine
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:6660:25"/>
vp a prince from his cradle to his tombe; but to gather such doings of theirs, as may serue them for good example, to the well gouerning of their people. Therefore as touching their bringing vp, I referre me to the things which are written by the said <hi>Petrarke,</hi> and afore him by <hi>Zenophon, Isocrates, Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch,</hi> and many others. Only thus much I say, That the prince which hath children ought to be carefull to bring them vp well in lerning and vertue.<note place="margin">Good bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vp mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateth mens affections..</note> For (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> affirmeth in the comparison of <hi>Agis</hi> and <hi>Gracchus</hi>) good Education modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and stayeth a mans mind, not only in things of pleasure, by keeping him from passing the bounds of honesty and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, in word or deede, but also in matters of anger; and in the greatest heats of ambition and of desire of honor. <hi>Philip</hi> king of Macedon vowed his sonne vnto <hi>Aristotle</hi> as soon as he was borne, and afterward did put him happily into his hands; and he trained him vp in Philosophie. For good Education not only fashioneth a man,<note place="margin">Good Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion altereth a mans euill disposition.</note> but also altereth his nature, as we read of <hi>Socrates,</hi> whom a professor of Phisnomie deemed to be full of all vices: and when the man was blamed for his misdee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming; <hi>Socrates</hi> answered, that he had not failed in his Art, for by nature he said he was such a one as he reported him to be, but diligent heed and good Education had made him altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther another man. The schoolemaister of <hi>Themistocles</hi> behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his ready and quicke wit, told him aforehand, that he should one day doe either some great good or some great harme to his common-weale. And in very deede, at the first he was of a wauering mind, troublesome, and fleeting. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward there was such a change in him, that when men asked him the cause of it, he answered, That fierce &amp; rough horses become good if they be well taught &amp; wel and orderly hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the breaking.<note place="margin">Wild horses become good by well hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</note> Therefore the man that should be a princes tutor, ought to be a man of skill, and in any wise very honest, to keepe from him all flatterers, and to restraine him in his youth, from haunting the company of any other chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, than of such as are honest and feare God; in which case men commonly faile. For they teach them to haue a good
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:6660:25"/>
grace, to entertaine strangers courteously, to daunce well and to ride well: but after this geere there must be no speech of learning. I say not that tutors of sufficient skill to instruct, are not giuen vnto them: but that they stand them in no steed, And yet most commonly tutors are giuen them at the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of such as sue for it to the Prince, who grauuteth it vnto his minions, without respecting the sufficiencie of the person: wherein, as saith <hi>Plutarch,</hi> they deale in like sort, as if a sicke man to gratifie his friend, should leaue the good and skilfull Phisition that could heale him, and take one whose igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance would rid him out of his life. Now then, it behooueth a prince to make his choise of the greatest personage, and of best estimation in his realme. For it is no small matter to draw youth to a custome,<note place="margin">Good Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in youth is the root of all goodensse.</note> when it is tender. For as saith <hi>Plutarch,</hi> Good Education and instruction in youth, is the fountaine and roote of all goodnesse. And like as Gardeners do sticke vp proppes by their young graffes, to hold them vpright; euen so doe wise teachers plant good instructions and wholsome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts about yoong princes, to direct their maners vnto vertue. Therefore <hi>Salomon</hi> in his Prouerbs, commandeth vs to traine vp a child at the first entrance of his way, that he may not goe backe from it when hee is growne old. And in the seuenth chapter of Ecclesiasticus, If thou haue children, saith he, bring them vp in learning, and bow them while they be young. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, in the thirteeth chapter, Bow downe his necke, saith he, in his youth, and smite him on the side while he is a child, least he wax stubborne and herken not vnto thee: for he that nurtureth his child, shall haue ioy of him, yea and be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for him among his houshold folke.<note place="margin">A young prince of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so good a nature shall hardly doe any great thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being not trained vp in vertue.</note> For how good nature so euer a young prince be of, yet shall he hardly do any thing of valour, if he haue not beene trained and inured to vertue: as a horse that is not well broken, how good soeuer he be otherwise, becommeth stubborne and cumbersome, and contrariwise a iadish and restie colt becommeth a good horse, by well handling. My meaning is not to giue him such a tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of skill and vertue, as dareth not giue him a crosse word,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:6660:26"/>
nor make him to stand in aw of him, and to obay him in all friendly maner. For it were as good to haue none at all, as to haue a tutor that is vnprofitable, that shall sing to one that is deafe, and point vnto one that is blind, which yeeldeth not his heart to his teachers intent, and his eares to the words of wisdome, as <hi>Salomon</hi> saith in his Prouerbs. One demaunded of a Philosopher, What was the cause that yoong men were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done? Because (saith he) their teachers forbore to compell them to doe well. <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his booke of the Education of princes, saith; That kings learne to doe nothing well, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ride: and that is, because their schoolemasters which teach them, doe flatter them, and not correct them: whereas the horse discerning not who it is that sitteth on his backe, and therefore making no difference betweene a prince and a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uat person, spareth him not, but inforceth him to performe his charge, if he will not be in danger to be cast vpon the ground. But as for the schoolemaster that teacheth a prince, he neither can nor will compell him to any thing, but letteth him doe what he listeth; by reason whereof, a prince cannot be so well taught, as a man of meaner degree, that submitteth himselfe to correction.<note place="margin">By what means a yong prince is to be drawne to learning and vertue.</note> Neuerthelesse my meaning is not that the schoolemaister should vse the rod towards him, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than as a searing-iron is vsed in surgerie, namely in cases of extreame necessitie, when all other remedies faile; but that he should deale with the yoong prince by all kind of gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, &amp; assay to draw him by fauor, rather than by force; as by praising him when he doth well, &amp; by dispraising him when he doth euil, which are more auailable means towards childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that are borne in fredome, as wel the one to draw them to wel doing, as the other to withdraw them from doing ill, than all the whipping and scourging that can be. Neuerthelesse, when being yet young, he is wilfull and stubborne, the schoolmaster is to be dispensed withall, to vse that remedie. For as <hi>Salomon</hi> saith in his prouerbs,<note place="margin">The rod, and correction giue wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</note> Folly is commonly tied to the heart of a child, but the chastisement of the rod riddeth him thereof; for the rod and correction giue wisdome. Correct thy child,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:6660:26"/>
(saith <hi>Salomon</hi>) and he will giue thee rest, yea and pleasure to thy heart. And in an other place, Withhold not chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from thy child, (saith he) for if thou smite him with the rod, he shall not die: if thou smite him with the rod, thou deliuerest his soule from hell. Therefore it behoueth to giue him good instruction in his youth, that his nature may bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed if it bee euill, or maintained if it be good. A certaine Philosopher being asked vpon a time,<note place="margin">Why many princes begin well and end ill.</note> What was the cause that many princes begin wel, and end ill? Princes, quoth he, begin well, because they bee of good disposition by nature; and they end ill, because no man gainsaieth them. Whereof we cannot haue a better record than <hi>Nero,</hi> who behaued him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe like a good prince so long as <hi>Seneca</hi> was about him: but as soone as <hi>Seneca</hi> was sequestred from him, by and by he gaue himsefe ouer to all vice, for no man gainsaied him, and his flatterers soothed him in all things that he said; which kind of people,<note place="margin">Children are to be kept from the company of flatterers.</note> princes ought to shun as the plague. And as <hi>Plutarch</hi> saith, Children must be kept farre from the company of euill persons, and especially of flatterers, for there is not a more pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilent kind of men, or that more corrupteth youth, marring and vndoing both the fathers and the children, making the old age of the one, and the young age of the other, most mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, by offering to them in their wicked counsels, a bait that cannot be auoided, namely, Voluptuousnesse; wherwith they allure them. When the flatterers are driuen away from the young prince, the tutor must haue a carefull eye, that those which are giuen him to be his playfellowes, be well borne. For with the good thou shalt bee good, and with the euill thou shalt be peruerted.<note place="margin">The hating of lies.</note> And aboue all things let young princes be accustomed to speake truth, and to hate lying, be it in earnest or in iest. For as <hi>Plutarch</hi> sayth, Lying is a slauish vice worthie to be hated of all men, and not to be pardoned euen in bond-slaues, who haue least honestie. Ye see then that the profit which a yoong child that is a prince by birth, reapeth, by being vnder a tutor that flattereth him not, is, that by keeping com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with young children that are vertuous, he shall learne to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:6660:27"/>
doe as they doe; and by his masters instruction he shall learne vertue, and therfore hauing chastisement and good bringing vp, and continuall exercise vnto vertue; it cannot be but he must hold himselfe to that education all his life after, and be worthie to commaund.<note place="margin">The best way to learne rule is first to obay</note> But let him further assure himselfe, that nothing doth so much teach him, both to doe well and to rule well, as to haue obayed. And surely the thing that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth most princes, and maketh them loath to take in good worth the good counsell that is giuen vnto them, is, that wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as their schoolmasters ought to commaund them, they haue obayed them, and haue left them to do what they list at their pleasure. It is reported, that the thing which made <hi>Agesilaus</hi> a perfect gouernor, was, that from his infancie he had learned to obay. By reason wherof, he could better skill than any other king, to apply himselfe to his subiects, &amp; to beare himselfe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right among them, forsomuch as vnto the royall maiesty and stately behauior of a prince, (which he had learned of nature) he had added courtesie and familiaritie, which he had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by Education.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>L men in this world doe chuse in this life some certaine vocation, some to earne their liuing, (as Tailors by making apparell, Shoomakers, by making Shoes, Masons by building, and so foorth of other handicrafts;) some for delight that they haue to do some seruice to the common-weale, and therby to purchase praise, as the Orators, Iudges, and Lawyers did in old time, and some for both togither; as Phisitions. Some giue themselues to matters of state,<note place="margin">Euery man is desirous to be the chiefe of his professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> and some to Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualrie, and euery man is desirous to excell in his own trade, that he may receiue the gaine thereof, which is, to see, say, and esteme himselfe to be the cheefe of his profession.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:6660:27"/>There is not so simple a painter, ingrauer, or caruer, which is not desirous to match <hi>Polycletus, Lisippus, Appelles, Protogenes, Zeuxis, Phidias, Praxitiles,</hi> and such others, because they see that such men haue bin esteemed in the world, and haue pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased fame by their cunning. This maketh them to take as great paines as they can, to find the means to attaine to the sayd perfection, and not to spare either labour or cost to learn. The Physition looketh incontinently to his marke, which is to heale the sicke man; the Surgion looketh to the well laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of a wound; and as for to know the anotamie of a mans body, there is not that thing which he doth not: he vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to touch a dead corse, and to handle it, and to cut it in peeces, to see the cheefe parts, and to behold the veins, the muscles, the flesh-strings, and the knitters, to the end he may attaine to the full knowledge of his science. The end of the Orator is to plead well, and all his doings tend therevnto. He exerciseth himselfe in well pronouncing, and laboreth to haue a good gesture and countenance, as we read of <hi>Gracchus</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Orators, and especially of <hi>Demosthenes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The pains that <hi>Demosthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> tooke to become an Orator.</note> who to frame himselfe to a good gesture, would resort into a Cabinet which he had purposely made in the ground to that end, where he abode two or three whole months, causing the one halfe of his head to be shauen off, that he might not for shame goe abroad in that plight. And to abate the impediment of his toung which was thicke, he amended it by putting little stones in his mouth, and by pronouncing some orations so with his mouth full. And to strengthen his voice, which was small and feeble, he vsed to run vp against rough hils, pronouncing some verses which he could by hearte. In old time wrestlers and sword-players tooke no care, but how they might harden themselues to indure trauell, dietting themselues thereafter, and absteining from delicate fare, that they might obtaine the honor of one day. Euen so after their example, a good prince ought not to spare himselfe a whit, for the obteining of a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter commendation than theirs, by making himselfe worthie of his charge. For it is a strange sight to see such a one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:6660:28"/>
as ought to be commaunded, and can no skill how to gouerne folke; for it is all one, as if a man should see one made a Pilot of a ship, which can no skill at all of sayling. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Dauid</hi> willeth kings to learne, seing they be iudges of the earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The way to learning is to descend into a mans selfe.</note>Now to learne wel, a man must first descend into himselfe, as saith <hi>Persius,</hi> that is to say, he must examine and trie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, that he may know himselfe. And of knowing a mans selfe, there are two sorts; the first consisteth in contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when a man beholdeth his owne being as in a mirrour, that is to say; when he considereth what he is in very deed, that hee fall not into ignorance the mother of all euill. Now the very being of a man indeede, is his soule, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the bodie belongeth, as a garment that is made for the bodie. Hardly therefore shall we discerne what is ours, vnlesse we first know our selues. And most requisit is this contemplation for kings, who haue their soueraine authoritie from God. For it will make them both fortunat and wise in gouernment, as well of houshold, as of publike state, as I will declare more at large hereafter.</p>
               <p>The other kind of knowing a mans selfe, (as <hi>Plato</hi> in his Philebus hath right well noted) is, when hauing first considered the very man it selfe, which is the soule, we after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward also behold the shadow and figure thereof, that is to say, the bodie, with the goods and abilities which God hath distributed vnto vs in this world. For we cannot vndertake any goodly or great things, vnlesse the goods both of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and of fortune, be aunswerable vnto the goods of the mind. And (as saith <hi>Menander</hi>) Thou knowest thy selfe if thou take heede to thy dealings, so as thou doest what thou oughtest to doe.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">A prince ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider his owne abilitie.</note>Therefore it behoueth a prince to know his owne abilitie, and what he hath wherewith to make warre, whether it be in assailing or in defending. For whosoeuer should enterprise a warre without monie, might haue this saying ver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fied of him, which <hi>Quintius</hi> the Romane captaine said of <hi>Phil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>pae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:6660:28"/>
namely, that he had arms and legs, but wanted a bellie; meaning that he had store of men both on foot and on horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe, but he wanted money. And as it is to no purpose to haue men, without money, which is the sinewes of warre; so is it nothing worth to haue money, without men of warre.</p>
               <p>Also we may say,<note place="margin">A prince must be affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, retaining the maiestie of his person and state.</note> that a king knowes himselfe, when he behaueth himselfe according to his degree, yeelding himselfe gentle and affable to all men, howbeit retaining that which belongeth to the maiesty of a king, least his ouer-great fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaritie ingender contempt. That was the cause why, <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> refused to runne at the gamings of <hi>Olimpus,</hi> though he was esteemed one of the best runners in that assembly; answering his father (who had moued him to put forth himselfe into the lists to obtaine the honor of winning the reward of so ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable a wager) I would willingly doe your commandement, if I had kings or kings sons to run and wrestle with me: estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming it an vnseemly thing for him, being the sonne of a great king, to meddle with such as were not his matches. For the king that abaseth himselfe too much, is counted to dishonour himselfe as much as he that is proud; like <hi>Nero</hi> who plaied the Wagoner, the Minstrel, and the Iester; for doing wherof he was so far off from being loued or esteemed, that he was rather hated and despised for it of all men.</p>
               <p>Now then, after that a prince hath throughly viewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe both within and without; he cannot but vnderstand what his charge is, the which consisteth in two things, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in matters of peace, and in matters of warre; both which parts are so necessarie for him, that he cannot seperate the one fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other. For (as saith <hi>Thucidides</hi>) Peace is established by warre; neither is a man sure to be out of danger, when he is at rest and without warre. It is not inough then to haue good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for the gouerning of his country, vnlesse he also haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in a readinesse to succour his friends, to resist his enemies, and to subdue rebels. As touching ciuil gouernment, I will speake inough of it throughout all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this discourse;<note place="margin">A prince ought to be a Warriour.</note> and as touching the case of warre, I say that a prince ought to

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lualrie, as much as possibly he can, and that if he doe not so, he shall be subiect to contempt of his neighbours, and consequently be constrained to haue warre whether he will or no. Therefore it standeth him on hand to be a warrior himselfe, and to haue his people trained to the warres, and sometimes also to make warre that he may haue peace; and contrariwise in warre to mind peace. For as the Emperor <hi>Traiane</hi> said,<note place="margin">The enemies of peace are ouercome by warre.</note> God suffereth none to be vanquished in battell, but such as are enemies of peace. And we see by experience, that those which are eagre in seeking warre, doe commonly worke their own ouerthrow, as <hi>Pirrhus</hi> did in old time, and as <hi>Charles</hi> duke of Burgoine did a little while ago. But if a prince be compelled to enter into warre, it behooueth him to let the world vnderstand, what skill and cunning he hath in feats of armes, and what delight he hath in repulsing wrongfull warre, whereinto hee must enter with a braue courage, vnastonied; as <hi>Plutarch</hi> writeth of <hi>Sertorius,</hi> whom he reporteth to haue beene meeld and gentle in matters of peace, and dreadfull in preparatiue of warre against his enemies. Wherefore a prince ought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meane himselfe in such sort,<note place="margin">Warre must not be made but for to establish peace.</note> that knowing the means how to carrie himselfe vpright in both the times, he may be disposed to warre if need require, and yet vse it but to the attainment of peace, which ought alwaies to be preferred, as rest is to be preferred before trauell. For some loue warre too much, and some againe doe shun it too much. In the one point <hi>Marius</hi> made default, and in the other <hi>Perseus.</hi> For <hi>Marius</hi> being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to liue in peace, as one that could no skill of ciuill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires; sowed dissention the seed of warre without purpose. Insomuch that when he was at Rome in peace, he had not the grace to entertaine men amiably, and to gather them to him by courtesie, for want of gifts and qualities requisit for ciuill affaires. By reason whereof, men made no further account of him, than of an old harnesse, or of a toole that was good for nothing else but only for warre. On the contrarie part, <hi>Perseus</hi> suffered his state to goe to wracke for want of intending to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:6660:29"/>
warre-matters, and for that he loued better to keepe his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny for the Romans, than to lay it out in waging men of war for his own defence. For he loued not war, nor defended himselfe but very sleightly; and therefore was he bereft of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and vtterly spoiled of all his treasures.</p>

The thing that made <hi>Vindex</hi> and <hi>Galba</hi> to conspire against <hi>Nero,</hi> was the contempt which they had of him, for his giuing of himselfe wholy ouer vnto voluptuousnesse, and for his despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the exercise of warre.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pepin</hi> durst not to haue set his princes diademe vpon his owne head, if <hi>Childerike</hi> had loued armes as well as he. But for as much as <hi>Pepin</hi> had weapon in hand, and men of warre at his deuotion, and whatsoeuer else was requisit for a good captain, it was an easie matter for him to bring his enterprise to passe. <hi>Francis Sfortia</hi> by his valiancie in armes, rose from a simple souldier to be duke of Millan; and the children of princes and dukes,<note place="margin">Captains des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pise them that loue not chiluarie.</note> haue become meane gentlemen.

And therevpon it commeth to passe, that the prince which knoweth his neighbour to be vnfit for warre, and vnprouided of sufficient force to withstand him, doth easily setforth into the field to ouercome him, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly he carrieth away the victorie.<note place="margin">It is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that the man that is well armed should yeeld to him that is vnarmed.</note> For it is no reason that the man which is well armed, should obey him that is vnar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. My intent is not to inferre hereupon, that a prince should make warre without cause, or imagine that he ought not to enter, but by force of arms. For as <hi>Cicero</hi> sayth in his booke of Duties, a prince ought neuer to resort to weapon, but when no reason can otherwise be had, or when he is to defend himself, which is the law of nature.</p>
               <p>For as for him that maketh warre vnder pretence of some smal profit, he is like to him, who (as <hi>Augustus</hi> said) doth angle
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:6660:30"/>
wirh a hooke of gold, the losse whereof is greater than the gaine of the fish that is to be caught, can be woorth. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a prince ought, not to make war without aduisement; but yet must he put himselfe alwaies in a readinesse, if hee should chaunce to be enforced thereto. For if war be not foreseene and well prouided for, with men and armour, it worketh small effect in time of need.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The things that are to be done in war, are to be lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned afore ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d at leisure.</note>A man of warre (saith <hi>Cassiodorus</hi>) must learne aforehand the things which he hath to do when war commeth. And as <hi>Xenophon</hi> saith in is Education of king <hi>Cyrus,</hi> It is no time for a prince to make his prouision, when necessitie is come vpon him; but he must lay for his matters afore-hand, afore necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie come. Now, that he may be the readier in all things, and especially in men of warre; it behoueth him to haue a good number of men well trained aforehand, after the manner that the Macedonians had their Siluer-shields, the Romans their Legionaries, the Souldans of Aegypt their Mamelukes, the Turks their Ianissaries, <hi>Francis</hi> and <hi>Henrie,</hi> kings of France, the old bands of Piemount, and the emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fift the Spaniards.<note place="margin">Princes must inure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues &amp; their subiects to the exercise of arms.</note> Besides this, a prince ought to inure himselfe and his subiects together, to all exercises of armes; as to run well with a lawnce, to mount on horseback handsomly, and to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage him cunningly, to traile the pike, to shoote in long-bow, crosse-bow, and gun, to vault, to leape, to wrestle, and to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle all manner of weapons, so as they may serue their turne in time and place.</p>
               <p>For such things do not only procure skilfulnesse, but also make mens bodies the more strong and nimble, and the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter able to endure trauell. And therefore the Romanes could well skill to practise them in a certaine place which was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Mars his field, where all such exercises were put in vre.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Whether the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple be to bee trained to the wars, or no.</note>I know well, that among them that haue the managing of the state in France, it is held for an heresie to say, that the common people are to be trained to the warres; but I find the reasons of <hi>Seissell,</hi> and <hi>William Bellay</hi> to bee of more force,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:6660:30"/>
than the reasons that are commonly alleaged to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; specially in France, where the king behauing himselfe as a king, is honoured, feared, and beloued.</p>
               <p>And we may see plainly, that this people, as vntrained as they be, are so well fleshed one against another, that they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare not to enter into armes, to their owne destruction, and call in strangers to finish this worke, and that with so great losse, that it were much more for the behoofe of the realme, that they themselues were better trained to warre, and more inured to it long afore-hand, that they might forbeare the strangers.</p>
               <p>For if it should happen the king to loose one battell in his realme, he should find what a hinderance it would bee vnto him, that he were not able to make vp his army againe, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than of strangers.</p>
               <p>It is well knowne in what danger the Carthaginenses fell oftentimes, by reason of strangers, who meant to haue ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne their state, by rebelling against them; and that if the Carthaginenses themselues had bene trained to the warres, <hi>Scipio</hi> had not defeated them so easily as hee did, no more than it lay in the power of <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> to defeat the Romanes. For when hee had ouercome them in two battels, hee sayd, he had bene vndone, if he had had one other battell more to win of the like price; considering that his men were so great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diminished by those battails, that hee grew vveake, euen to the view of the eye, because he had no meane to make vp his armie againe with othermen; whereas on the contrarie part, the Romanes did easily supplie their armie with new souldiers whome they caused to come from their citie when need was, as from a quicke spring, whereof they had the head in their own house.</p>
               <p>The Switzers &amp; Almains being called into Italy, one while by the Pope and Italians, and otherwhile by the Frenchmen, ouermastred those that waged the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; through their wilfulnes made them to lose the whole countrie in short space, by their

               <p>There is yet one other kind of exercise which serueth gret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the state of souldierfare; for it inureth the body to paine, and therewithall acquainteth men with the natures and scitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations of places, which is profitable two waies: first, men learn thereby to know their own countrie, and by that mean to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the platforme of any other place that differeth not from it; for the knowledge of one countrie, is a great furtherance to the practise of another. <hi>Plutarch</hi> writeth that when <hi>Sertorius</hi> found any leisure, he rode continually a hunting, and coursed vp and downe the fields, whereby he got great experience and furtherance in skill, to shift himselfe handsomly and readily from shrewd passages, when he was pressed by his enemies: and on the other side, to enclose them when hee had the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage of them, and to discerne where a man might passe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and where not.</p>

Wherein I mind not to follow the Diuines, which place the souereigne good, and likewise the cheefe euill, without the compasse of this life, because this life is turmoiled with so many mischiefs, that it is not possible to find the souereigne good in this world, and to attaine vnto the true felicitie by our own industrie and diligence. For, as the Psalmist sayth, The thoughts of men are vaine; and so doth also S. <hi>Austine</hi> teach vs, in his 19 booke of the citie of God, where he disputeth against all the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers of old time, which placed the souereigne good either in the soule, or in the body, or in both together; in pleasure, or in vertue, or in both together; concluding, That the euerlasting life is the souereigne good, and the euerlasting death the soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne euill; for the auoiding of the one whereof, and for the obtaining of the other, it behoueth vs to liue wel, and by faith to seeke the souereigne Good, which we cannot see now, but we liue in hope to see it hereafter.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:6660:32"/>Now then, for the present time we will omit the true and only perfect blessednesse, and rest vpon the worldly happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, seeking that which is most beautifull, most acceptable, and most happie in this world, which thing some doe place in pleasure, some in profit, and some in both together. For as the Poet saith, That man hath atteined to full perfection, which matcheth pleasure with profit. But the matter is to know,<note place="margin">Wherin the happinesse of princes may consist.</note> what is pleasure and what is profit, and by what means a man may attaine to it, that it may become sound, substanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and durable. So soone as a kingdome is falne to a prince by Succession or Election, by and by he is counted happie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is honored and followed of all men, and may doe his pleasure with his seruants, and take his pleasure of them as much as he can wish.</p>
               <p>In old time, <hi>Cressus</hi> seing himselfe peaceably possessed of a goodly rich kingdome, plentifully stored with gold and siluer, which he tooke out of Pactolus, a riuer of Lidia, gazed vpon himselfe in his fortunatenesse and great riches; and hauing inuited thither <hi>Solon,</hi> one of the seuen sages of Greece, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded of him, if euer he had seene a more happie prince. But <hi>Solon</hi> making no reckoning of his riches, preferred before him an Athenian named, <hi>Tellus</hi>; and in the end told him, That no man could be esteemed happy in deed afore he were dead; because that in this life many mishaps come vpon vs, which disturb our ease, welfare, and quietnesse. And so befell it to that king, for he was taken by <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and lost his kingdome, and was put in danger of being burned quicke.</p>
               <p>This sheweth vs sufficiently, that we cannot stay our selues vpon such maner of blessednesse, seing it accompanieth vs not any longer than while we be in this life. And therefore we must seeke it further off.<note place="margin">To become happy, we must seeke perfection.</note> Al such as haue writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of blessednesse, say, That to be happie we must seeke perfection. For no man can be termed happy, vnlesse he haue throughly attained to the ful measure of al good fortune &amp; blessednesse. And perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as saith <hi>Aristotle</hi> is the thing that is taken &amp; chose for the good that is therin, &amp; not for any other thing; for albeit that
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:6660:32"/>
the desire which we haue to be honored, and to be of a good mind, and to haue vertue it selfe, be things worthie to be desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red without any other stay, yet our wishing of them is cheefly for that we thinke we shall by means of them be come happy. And so blessednesse and faelicitie lie in all actions that are ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous. Therefore to attaine therunto,<note place="margin">Felicitie lieth in all vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous actions.</note> it behoueth a man to be vertuous. Moreouer I say, that in this world there are three kinds of goods, which make vs well contented and happie: The one sort commeth of fortune, as to be rich or honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; another sort is of those which we terme the goods of the body, as beautie, strength, health, and actiuitie. And the third sort is of those which we call the goods of the mind, as scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and vertues. As touching the goods of fortune; for as much as they easily admit change, and we see ordinarilie how rich men become poore, and poore men rich; the happy and blessed state cannot be in them. Besides that, it falleth out of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes, that the richest and greatest lords are neither well contented, nor well at ease. Likewise the goods of the body cannot make vs happy. For what is a man the better for being faire and in good health, if he be a beggar or a vitious person? Therefore it is to be concluded, that forasmuch as the mind is more excellent than the body and all worldly goods, the blessed state consisteth in the goods of the mind: that is to wit, in knowledge and vertue; which neuer forsaking vs, doe yeeld vs continuall pleasure and contentment.<note place="margin">Riches with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out vertue be like a feast without any man to eat it.</note> In respect wherof, <hi>Antisthenes</hi> said, That riches without vertue, yeelded as much pleasure, as a banquet without any body at it. <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius</hi> hauing taken <hi>Megara,</hi> demaunded of <hi>Stilpon</hi> the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher, whether his men of warre had taken any thing of his away or no? and <hi>Stilpon</hi> answered him no: for no man hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reft me of my knowledg. <hi>Bias</hi> one of the sages of Greece, made the like answere when he was demaunded, Why he carried not away his goods, as other of his citizens did at their flee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the citie then newlie taken? I carrie all my goods with me, quoth he; meaning his knowledge and vertue, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he thought all his welfare to consist. <hi>Aristippus</hi> hauing lost
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:6660:33"/>
all that he had by ship-wracke, and being cast vpon the coast of the Rhodes by a tempest, after he had disputed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the schooles of Philosophie there, was forthwith plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rewarded with great store of presents by the Rhodians, and set againe in very good furniture. And because he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to abide among them, he said vnto his friends that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned home, that he could not tell how to doe better, than to bestow such things vpon their children, as might purchase them possessions that might be saued with their persons, if they escaped shipwracke. Meaning, to gather therevpon, that the true riches of this life,<note place="margin">Which are the true ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</note> are those which neither the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie blasts of fortune, nor the change of estate, nor waries can appaire. Also <hi>Socrates</hi> being asked by <hi>Gorgius,</hi> what opinion he had of the great king, (that was a title which they gaue to the king of Persia) and whether he thought him not to be very happie: answered, I know not how he is prouided of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and vertue; meaning, that the true felicitie consisteth in those two things, and not in the slightfull goods of fortune. Hereby ye may vnderstand, that that prince is right happie, which hath his mind well instructed and well giuen to al ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. For of knowledge and vertue, spring sobrietie and wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; and wisdome findeth the way to gouerne well his kingdome, of which gouernment ensueth both pleasure and profit, as shall easily appeare hereafter.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Of profit.</note>And first of all I will speake of Profit as of the lesser; and afterward I will come to Pleasure. Many doe deeme this profit to consist in the enlarging of a mans lordship or domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by seazing vpon the next cities, or by laying an impost by the prince vpon all sorts of impostes. But the things that are gotten by euill means cannot be called Profit. As touching the incroching vpon neighbours, it is not easily to be done, if they be of any power; and oftentimes the sauce costeth more than the meat is worth. And to take more than ordinarie of the subiects, or more than the agreement made by oath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene him and his people will beare, cannot be done with honor. Besides that the impouerishing of his subiects is the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:6660:33"/>
impouerishing of himselfe, because his treasure is in their goods; yea, and in the end, for all his exacting, he findeth himselfe no more eased, than those that content themselues with the meane. <hi>Nero, Domitian, Caligula,</hi> and other wicked Emperors, found not themselues any whit the richer for all the charges that they laid vpon their people, neither gained they any thing by it but infamie, with losse both of life and Empire. On the contrarie part, <hi>Traian, Antonine,</hi> and other good emperors, liued in honor and loue of their subiects, left behind them immortall praise, and got more reputation than those monsters of mankind. Those good princes loued their people, and kept themselues well from incroching vpon their neighbours; and yet they could well skill how to chastise them, when they durst enterprise any warre against them. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit that <hi>Augustus</hi> was the happiest prince of all the world; yet would he not make any warre, or put his fortune in triall all his life long. For after he had once obtained to sit in peace, he busied not his head about the getting of one foot of land more, mocking at great <hi>Alexander,</hi> whom it greeued to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what he should doe, when he had conquered the whole world; as who would say, there were not as much paine or more in the well keeping of things, as is in the getting of them. King <hi>Pirrhus</hi> got inough, but he lost as fast as got; and his couetousnesse was not so strong and gaping after the things that he hoped for, as he was forgetfull to set sure guard vpon that which he had gotten. In respect whereof, <hi>Antigonus</hi> likened him to a plaier at dice, whom the dice fauored verie much, but he could no skill to make his hand of his good chaunce.</p>
               <p>The good husbandrie that <hi>Augustus</hi> and other good em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors vsed, was to entertaine men of warre, to pay them well their wages, to make them obserue the law of arms, to doe iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice to the people, to ease them of their subsidies &amp; impositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to beautifie the citie of Rome with temples &amp; goodly buildings. The wise king of France did the like, amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g whom by the common voice of the people, <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleuenth did
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:6660:34"/>
beare away the bel, as who by the common consent of al men was called, The father of the people. The great warres which he had in Italy for his duchie of Millan, could not make him to ouercharge his people; he demaunded not any subsidies of them, to inrich perticular persons; he encreaced not his talla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges for all the warres he had; to be short, he esteemed notary riches, or any conquest to be greater, than to win the good will of his subiects, and to see them rich: whereby he left a woon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull treasure to his successor, wherwith he could wel helpe himselfe in his affairs. Thus ye see wherein consisteth a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces profit, namely, in keeping and defending well his lands and subiects, and sometime in enlarging his bounds, when hee is driuen to enter into armes for his owne defence.<note place="margin">Of Pleasure.</note> Wherein if there be profit, surely there is also no lesse pleasure. For the commendation that is gotten by well gouerning, doth woon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully content a noble-minded prince; whereof I am now to speake, as of the thing that most rauisheth our minds, and draweth vs most vnto it. I wil not speake here after the maner of the Stoiks, who hauing no regard to our maner of speech, vphold by many good reasons, that the thing which is good, is faire; and that the thing which is euill, is foule; and that there is not only other good, or any other pleasure, than vertue, which of it selfe alone sufficeth to the making of a happie life, as <hi>Cice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi> hath proued in his Paradoxes. But I will speake after the maner of the Academiks, who vnto the goods of the mind haue added the goods of the body and of fortune, as helpes to lead a happie life.</p>
               <p>But all the difficultie is to find this pleasure. For the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous man deemeth it a great pleasure, to be shut vp alone in a chamber with a great heape of monie. The ambitious estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth it a great pleasure, to haue a great traine of men follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him. Another thinks it a pleasure to sit at banquet, laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing incessantly, and making good cheare: To be short, euery man measureth this pleasure after his owne fancie, howbeit that that vvhich is pleasure to some, is displeasure to other some.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:6660:34"/>And that is, because this pleasure proceedeth not from the fountaine of vertue, but from the well of voluptuousnesse, which ingendreth deceitfull lusts in vs, after the manner of such as haue the hungry disease, and the consumption, who are alwaies hungry by reason of a certaine sharpe and biting humour, which causeth hunger, and an vnordinate appetite. And like as some women, when they be with child, delight to eat naughtie meats, euen so the diseased mind, by reason of the voluptuous humour that is therin, seeketh the things that are noisome to it, and whereof they be soone wearie. Insomuch that whosoeuer looketh neerly into the matter, shall find that the things which are commonly esteemed for pleasure, doe oftentimes turne to displeasure. This caused <hi>Plato</hi> to say, that we must behold pleasure,<note place="margin">Pleasure is to be considered by hir going away.</note> not at hir comming towards vs, but at hir going away from vs. For when we looke vpon hir at hir first comming in sight, nothing is so beautifull; but at hir going away, shee is as foule and loathsome to behold as is possible.</p>
               <p>And as <hi>Varia Mesa</hi> said vnto the emperor <hi>Heliogabalus,</hi> Naturally vice delighteth the body when it is in committing; but by and by after ensueth repentance in the necke of it. But as for vertue, besides that it displeaseth not the bodie, it lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth alwaies a good tast and contentment behind it, which endureth perpetually. And how much soeuer a prince would plunge himselfe in all manner of worldly pleasure, he could not haue the aduantage thereof, so much as a subiect of his that were of some meane wealth. For such a one may haue as great pleasure as a king, in eating and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, in apparell and lodging for his owne person, in hunting at his pleasure, in musicke, and in all other delights.</p>
               <p>Againe, because a prince hath greater conceits than a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon person, hee taketh no great pleasure in such thinges, but serueth is turne with them as we doe with sleepe, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh and recreat his spirits, that haue bene ouerstrained in matters of state, and for that cause hee laugheth, hee plaieth, he daunceth. But if he should bee demaunded vvherein
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:6660:35"/>
he taketh most pleasure; I beleeue he would answer with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander,</hi> That he could not find a finer song or a pleasanter musicke, than to heare the singing of his owne praises; nor haue a more goodly exercise or a more delightfull pastime, than to gouerne his kingdome well: and as <hi>Plutarke</hi> sayth in his treatise intitled, Whether an old foreworne man ought to deale in matters of a common-weale: let vs graunt to <hi>Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon</hi> that there is not a sweeter thing, than to heare a mans owne praises.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The pleasure that commeth of the behol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding of the things that are done in a Common-weale.</note>But in my iudgement, there is no present sight, no memorie of things past, no delightfull conceit, that yeeldeth so great pleasure, as the contemplation of the things that are done in a publick-weale, as in an open spectacle. The pleasure then of euery gentlemanly heart, and especially of a prince, te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth to honor, to glory, to reputation, that his name may be spread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad with renowne ouer all the earth, and that he may be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed wise and vertuous.<note place="margin">A good name is a sweet sent or sauor.</note> And to shew that the pleasure of a good renowne passeth all other things, <hi>Salomon</hi> saith, That a good name excelleth all the precious ointments in the world. And in other places, the holy scriptures termeth a good name a sweet sent or sauor; as who would say, there were not a swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or pleasanter thing in the world than that.</p>
               <p>As touching the report to be a good warrior, it cannot bee common to all, because it dependeth vpon fortune, and is got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten oft times by doing wrong. But as for the renowne of being vertuous, the more certaine and rare it is, the more also is it to be sought. Euery man cannot haue the good fortune of <hi>Sylla</hi> and of <hi>Augustus,</hi> nor be a conqueror as was <hi>Alexander,</hi> but eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man may be vertuous, that will take paine to attaine vnto it. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> king of Naples,<note place="margin">The wise say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of king <hi>Ferdinand.</hi>
                  </note> was woont to say, That to be a king, is a thing that most commonly dependeth vpon Fortune; but to be such a king as may be reported in all respects to bee the welfare and felicitie of his people, that dependeth alonly vpon himselfe, and vpon his owne vertue. <hi>Plutarch</hi> saith, that <hi>Lucullus</hi> did more esteeme &amp; desire the praises that proceded of goodnesse, iustice, and cleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie, than the praises that sprang
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:6660:35"/>
and proceeded of hault and great deeds of chiualrie, because that in these, his armie had one part, and fortune had another part, as well as he; but the other were peculiar to himselfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</p>
               <p>Againe, in them he receiued the fruit he had deserued, so winning the hearts of his enemies by his behauior, that many of them did willingly put themselues and all their goods into his hands.<note place="margin">All princes are iealous of their honor.</note> We see how <hi>Alexander</hi> was curious in procuring himselfe that report; and that all princes both good and bad without exception, couet the reputation of good and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men; but the euill princes cannot obtaine it, because they be not the same that they would be taken to be, whereas the meane to atteine to perfect praise, is (as <hi>Socrates</hi> saith) to be such a one in deed, as a man would be esteemed to be. And <hi>Antisthenes</hi> saith, there is but one way to attaine to immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall fame, and that is to liue vprightly and religiously. For how faire a face soeuer a man setteth vpon the matter, in the end he is discouered, and nothing is so hidden which shall not be laid open. And like as a Phisition is not the more esteemed for being a doctor in phisicke, if he haue no skill in phisicke, nor an Aduocate for his doctorship in the law, if he want know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, experience, and practise in the law: euen so it is not to be thought, that a prince can be had in estimation if he be not a good man, and such a one as endeuoreth to rule his people well.<note place="margin">Men must be such as they would seeme to be.</note> For if a prince be not the same that he would seeme to be, it is all one (as <hi>Cirus</hi> said to <hi>Cambyses</hi> his sonne) as if one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no good Tilman, no good Phisition, no good Musition, nor skilfull in any other art or trade, will neuerthelesse needs seeme to be such a one. For besides the paine that he shall procure to himselfe in practising with his friends to giue him commendation and renowne, and in prouiding the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments fit for euerie of these Arts, he may perchance deceiue the world for a time; but in the end when he commeth to the proofe of his skill, he shalbe laughed to skorne as an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant boaster. <hi>Nero</hi> and <hi>Tiberius</hi> were counted vertuous prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the beginning of their raigns: but in the end, they were
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:6660:36"/>
taken for vnkindly monsters, wicked, and vnworthie to be had in remembrance among men. Wherefore if a prince will haue pleasure, it behoueth him to be vertuous; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise he will loose his pleasure, that is to say, his honor, wherof he is so zealous, and which is preferred by <hi>Salomon</hi> before all the things in the world. There is store inough of euill princes, which haue intitled themselues Fathers of the people, good, vertuous, and such other like, and which haue caused those stiles of theirs to be grauen in stone and brasse, against whom their people taking iust displeasure, haue neuerthelesse defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced those titles of theirs: but the memorie of their wicked dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings haue abidden ingraued in the hearts of their posteritie. On the contrarie part, such as were good men, haue not only beene esteemed, but also worshipped as Gods, as <hi>Theseus, Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules</hi> and others. Insomuch that <hi>Plinie</hi> saith, That the God of men is a helper of men, and that to doe good vnto men, is the way to attaine to endlesse glorie, the which way the greatest personages of Rome walked; and that the name of the other Gods came of the deserts of men. And afore him, <hi>Cicero</hi> in his first booke of the nature of Gods saith,<note place="margin">A doer of good to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, is estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med as a God.</note> that because much good and much hurt commeth of man vnto man; and it is the propertie of God to doe good: therefore if a man doe vs any good, or rid vs out of any great danger; because in so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he resembleth God, he is commonly said to haue beene a God vnto him whom he hath so gratified: and he conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, that the very beasts were canonised for the pleasures that they had done vnto men; as for example, the Aegypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans worshipped the Storke, and diuers other birds and beasts. And <hi>Iuuenall</hi> esteemeth a benefactor as a God, saying; If some God, or some like vnto God, or some man better than the Gods, should giue thee a thing. Likewise the Shepheard in the Eglogues of <hi>Virgil,</hi> maketh <hi>Augustus</hi> a God, because he gaue him leaue to feed his cattell where he would. In the same respect, the oath which the Scithians made by the wind and the sword, was as great among them, as if they had sworne by God; because the wind giueth breath to liue by, and the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:6660:36"/>
sword cutteth off life. And to shew that nothing pleaseth a gentlemanly heart so much as praise. Let vs consider what <hi>Themistocles</hi> did to attaine therunto. Aforetime he had bin vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and had no care either of vertue or of feats of arms. But when once he had heard the praise that was giuen to <hi>Miltia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> for the battell of Marathon; he neuer ceased after vntill he became the chiefe of all Athens. And one day, when his companions asked him, What had so altered him, and what had made him so vigilant? he answered, That the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes of <hi>Miltiad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s</hi> victorie, suffered him not to sleepe or take rest. Afterward being himselfe at the gamings of <hi>Olimpus,</hi> when all the standers by did cast their looks vpon him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regarding to behold the companions, and pointed him out with their fingers vnto strangers; he was so glad of it, that he confessed to his friends, that at that time he receiued the fruit of all the great trauels which hee had endured for Greece. <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> wept at the image of <hi>Alexander,</hi> finding fault with himselfe that he had not done any thing worthie of memorie, being come to the age wherin <hi>Aelxander</hi> had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered the whole world. And <hi>Alexander</hi> deemed <hi>Achilles</hi> right happie, in that he had such a Poet as <hi>Homer</hi> to register his praises.</p>
               <p>Thus you see how the pleasure of princes consisteth whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in honor and reputation;<note place="margin">The pleasure of princes consisteth in honor.</note> the which cannot be acquired, whether it be in ciuil matters, or in matters of warre, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by vertue. Which thing <hi>Marcellus</hi> intending to make knowne to posterities, builded in Rome a temple to Honour, hard by the temple of Vertue; and he made it in such sort, as men could not come into it, but through the temple of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; doing men to vnderstand, that honour and reputation can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be acquired, but by vertue.</p>
               <p>Therefore we must conclude that a prince can haue no sound and substantiall pleasure, if he be not vertuous. And (as saith <hi>Philo</hi> the Iew in his Allegories) Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise is (by a figure) called Vertue, and the place proper to Paradise, is called Eden; which signifieth pleasure. For
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:6660:37"/>
ioy and peace, being the things wherein the true pleasure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth, agree very well vnto vertue.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Et vs speake now of Vertue, as of the thing that is most fit and beseeming for a prince, and wherin he becommeth most like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God. For as for those foolish emperors, which to resemble <hi>Iupiter,</hi> made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to be painted with thunder &amp; light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in their hands: they were not esteemed for all that, but rather mocked of the world, and made abhominable vnto God.</p>
               <p>For as saith <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his booke of the Education of princes, God is angrie with those that imitate and counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fait him, in following his lightenings and thunders; but he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth well such as conforme themselues to his likenesse in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie and honest dealing, by imitating his Vertue. And such are his elect, to whom he imparteth of his vprightnesse, of his iustice, of his truth, and of his meeknesse, than the which there is not any thing more diuine. For God is not so much happie for his immortalitie, as for that he is the prince of all Vertue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his Morals saith, That Vertue is an habit of the mind, wherby a man becommeth good, and doth his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; the contrarie whereunto is vice.<note place="margin">A definition of Vertue.</note> So that to eschew vice, is to be vertuous; or els we may say, that Vertue is an habit or hauing of the thing that is beseeming and of dutie to be done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Cicero</hi> saith in his Tusculane questions, That Vertue is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine constant affection or disposition of mind, which maketh the possessors thereof to be praised, from whence proceed all honest deeds, and determinations. And in his booke of lawes,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:6660:37"/>
hee saith, That Vertue is the very perfection of nature. With him also accordeth S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> in his third chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter concerning faith, following a principle of the Pithagori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who hold opinion that al things are perfect by the vertue of their owne nature: as for example, the vertue of a horse is that which setteth him in his perfection; the vertue of eyes, is the good sight of them; the vertue or perfection of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of feet, is to go well and lightly. There are three things whereby vertue is perfected, Skill, Power, and Will. Skill ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth for conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plation and iudgement, out of the which spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth discretion; Power is a strength whereby we stand fast in our purpose of well-doing. And Will is as it were, the hand of the soule, whereby we take in hand the thing that we intend to doe.</p>
               <p>Some diuide vertue into two parts,<note place="margin">A diuision of Vertue.</note> that is to wit, Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>platiue, and Morall; we cal that vertue Contemplatiue, which consisteth in well vnderstanding, and well considering, that is to say, in the inward minding and reasoning, whereout spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth discretion and wisedome. And we call those vertues mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, which belong to manners, and not alonely to vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. As for example, when we speake of the manners of some man, we say not that he is wise, but that he is meeld, liberall, and kind-hearted.</p>
               <p>For Wisedome is a certaine hauior of vertue, which consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth in the wit and vnderstanding; but Temperance belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to a mans actions and manners, and in respect thereof wee terme it Morall. <hi>Philo</hi> the Iew saith in his Allegories, that ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is Contemplatiue, and Actiue; because it vseth contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation by the discourse of reason, and therewithall hath acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons also. For Vertue is the Art of our whole life, containing all actions.<note place="margin">Vertue is the Art of al our whole life.</note>
               </p>
               <p>That is the cause why <hi>Moses</hi> sayth, that the Tree of life which betokeneth the generall Vertue, which we cal Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, is faire to see too; whereby is signified, the Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and that the fruit thereof is good to eat, whereby is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tokened the vse, and action.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:6660:38"/>Others make foure principal vertues, the which they terme Cardinall, vnder which, all other vertues are comprehended: namely, Wisedome, which teacheth what is to be done; Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse, or Valeantnesse, which teacheth what is to be indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; Temperance, which teacheth what is to be chosen; and Iustice, which teacheth what is to bee yeelded vnto euery man. Othersome do lodge wisdome in the vnderstanding and the wit; Iustice, in the will; Hardines in that part of the mind which conceiueth anger; and Temperance, in the lust of the sensitiue appetite. And for the better vnderstanding hereof, ye must co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider that we haue two sorts of appetits,<note place="margin">Two sorts of Appetites.</note> the one, of the mind, the other of the sence. The mindly appetite followeth the conceit of the vnderstanding; the sensitiue followeth the conceit of the sence. This sensitiue is diuided againe into two, that is to say, Lustfull, and Irefull. We call that the Lustfull, whereby we shun the things that mislike vs, and follow the things that are delectable. And by the Irefull we assayle the things that may disappoint vs of the foresayd good, and of the foresaid pleasure. As for example, a lion by his lustfull appetit, runneth after his prey, as a thing pleasaunt vnto him; and by his Irefull appetit, he assaileth such as go about to disappoint him thereof. So that the lustfull appetit tendeth to rest and pleasure; and the yrefull tendeth to a harder point, namely, to resist euill, and whatsoeuer else annoieth vs. There are others which diuide all vertues into three. For Vertue doth either direct reason aright, and is altogither grounded therupon, and that we call Wisedome: or else it is the effecter and bringer to passe of good reason, and is grounded in willingnesse, to doe that which is wisely set downe in conceit, and that is it which we cal Iustice: or else it maintaineth the good vpon good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and that is the vertue which we affirme to consist in the sensitiue appetit. And out of this vertue proceed Hardinesse, and Temperance,<note place="margin">Of the reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, Irefull, and Lustful parts of the soule.</note> two cardinall &amp; principal vertues; &amp; more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, Magnanimitie, Liberalitie, Magnificence, Soothfastnes, Mildnes, Meeknes, &amp; Affabilitie. <hi>Philo</hi> the Iew doth likewise diuide Vertue into three parts, according to the three parts of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:6660:38"/>
our soule; namely, Reasonable, Irefull, and Lustfull. The first Vertue is that which sheweth it selfe in the chiefe part of the soule, that is to say, in the reasonable part, which Vertue we call wisdome. The second is, the force or strength that lodgeth in the second part of the soule, namely in the Irefull. The third is Temperance or Staiednesse, which is imployed about the Lustfull power. And when these three are of one accord, then doth Iustice or Rightfulnesse shew it selfe. For when the Irefull and the Lustfull obay the commaundement of the Reasonable; then doth Rightfulnesse vtter the fruit of that accord &amp; harmonie. <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith, that Vertue is a meane, &amp; as a white in the middest of a butte, wherat all men ought to leuel, and whoso euer swarueth neuer so little from it one way or other,<note place="margin">Vertue hath hir bounds: but vice is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit.</note> misseth his mark. And as it is far more hard to hit the white, than to goe round about it, so is it more hard to be ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, than to be vitious. Vice is infinit, and therfore hath not any meane. Contrariwise, Vertue hath hir bounds, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be passed, but into vice. Let vs for example take Hardines, which is a meane betweene Fearfulnesse &amp; Ouer-boldnesse, of which two this latter is the excesse of boldnesse, in offering a mans selfe to danger, and the other is the default or want of boldnesse in the same case, when Boldnesse is requisit or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient. And therfore he that through ouer-great Boldnesse thrusteth himselfe into dangers vnaduisedly, and rusheth into them like a wild Boare, cannot be deemed hardie or valiant, but rather rash; and he that through Fearfulnesse dareth not shew his head before his enemie, is accounted a Coward. The measurable meane in giuing &amp; taking, is called Liberalitie, the excesse wherof in taking is Couetousnesse, and the excesse in giuing is Prodigalitie, &amp; the meane between them cannot be in the vice. For too much or too little cannot make vice to be Vertue. As for example, a theefe or a murtherer faile not to sin, for stealing or murthering too much or too little. Whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer is a theefe, a murderer, or an adulterer, in what sort soeuer it be, he doth alwaies sin; and because a man may sin many waies, it is easier to sin than to doe well.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:6660:39"/>Let vs ad that which <hi>Philo</hi> sayth in his Allegories, that the thing which is good, is rare, and the things which are euill, be ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e; in so much that for one wise man, you shall find an infinit multitude of fooles. Furthermore, to attain vnto Vertue, there needeth but reason: but to the compassing of vice, men applie mind, sence, and body: and we see that the way of vice is the larger and easier.<note place="margin">Why the way of Vertue is not so large as the way of Vice.</note> And in that respect, doth <hi>Hesiodus</hi> say, that the first enterance into the way whereby men ascend vnto vertue, is rough, combersom, and steepe, but very smooth and easie, when a man hath ouerpast the little crabbednesse that was at the first entrie of the way. But the hardnesse thereof must not discourage a man; for it is a generall rule, that (as the Greeke Prouerbe sayth) The attainment of all goodly things is painfull; because (as <hi>Epicharmus</hi> sayth) God felleth his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits vnto vs for pains and trauell,<note place="margin">God selleth his benefits vnto men for trauell.</note> according to the first curse that God gaue vnto man, namely, that he should eat his bread in the sweat of his browes.</p>
               <p>And as <hi>Synesius</hi> saith, It is peculiar to the Godhead to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe any great matter without pains-taking. But among men, not only the vertues, but also euery other excellent thing, is gotten with the sweat of the body. Truth it is, that in all great things nature hath purposed a certaine difficultie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so as the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie that will liue happily, must needs take pains. For as <hi>Sophocles</hi> sayth, a man cannot haue the thing that is great and excellent, without paine; for without that, the noble captains had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer obtained the fame which is dispersed of them through the whole world. To attaine vnto that, <hi>Hannibal</hi> forwent an eye, lay oft vpon the hard ground, watched infinit times when others slept, and endured hunger and thirst with great cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse. <hi>Pyrrhus, Alexander, Iulius Caesar, Epaminondas, Themi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stocles, Alcibiades,</hi> and all the noble captains that euer were, haue done the like.</p>
               <p>A Poet maketh not a good verse, nor an Orator a good o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, without paine. And seeing it is so, that God hath made all goodly things rare, we should not spare our pains to acquire the thing which of all others is most beautifull. Surely a prince
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:6660:39"/>
ought most specially to doe it; assuring himselfe that it is the thing wherein he most resembleth God. For as touching a princes strength and power, it is nothing in comparison of the power of fire, or of the sea, or of a streame, against the which nothing is able to stand.<note place="margin">Men esteeme not princes but for their goodnesse.</note> And although he haue all our liues in his hand; yet doe we not esteeme him so much for that, as for his righteousnes and goodnes, after the maner of the men of old time, which called God first, most Gratious, and secondly most High and most mightie. For Gods gratious goodnesse is the cause that men loue him, honor him, and worship him: and his power is the cause that men feare him; and so they made vertue to goe alwaies before might and power. And this word, Good, was in so great estimatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, that he would not haue so glorious a title vsurped of men affirming that there was none good but the one only God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plutarch</hi> saith in the life of <hi>Aristides,</hi> that God surmoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth all other things, chiefly in three points, that is to wit, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie, mightinesse, and goodnesse: of which three, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse or vertue, is the most honorable, and most peculiar to the Godhead. For incorruption and immortalitie (at least wise according to the opinion of the auntient Philosophers) is as well in the elements, and in the wast Chaos, as in God; and as for might or power, there is very much and great in the winds, in thunder and lightnings, in streams, and in water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flouds. But as for iustice, vprightnesse, and equitie, nothing can be partaker of them, but that which is diuine, by means of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and vnderstanding. And therefore that men deeme the Gods to be happie, it is in respect of their goodnesse; that they feare them it is because of their almightinesse; and that they loue, worship, and reuerence them, it is for their iustice sake. And if we will beleeue <hi>Aristotle</hi> in the first booke of his Morals, we shall say, that what king soeuer will become worthie of immortalitie, must inure himselfe, as much as is possible, vnto vertue, because it is his charge to make his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects honest and obedient vnto lawes.</p>

Insomuch that euen enemies doe praise their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies that haue vertue, and euen robbers and outlaws haue it in admiration. Whereof we haue a notable example in <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio,</hi> who being all alone in his house in the countrie, was beset with a great number of robbers, and when he prepared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:6660:40"/>
to resist them, they threw down their weapons, and prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to open them the gate, saying they were come of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to obtaine the fauor to see so vertuous a noble man as he was. The thing that procureth loue, (saith <hi>Cicero</hi> in his booke intituled <hi>Laelius</hi>) is the consideration of the goodnesse and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beralitie of him to whome a man resorteth; so that vertue causeth him to be beloued and esteemed. And as the same <hi>Cicero</hi> saith in his booke of Duties,<note place="margin">Men make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of those whom they take to be vertuous.</note> We highly commend and make great reckoning of those whom we take to be ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, and we despise those that haue neither power nor ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. And in his Tusculane questions he saith, That there is not any thing comparable to vertue, and that vertue dispising all things, regardeth not the chaunces of the world, but is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient of hirselfe to lead a good and happie life, without the aid of any other thing. Furthermore, praise and honor doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily follow vertue, as a mans shadow followeth him by the light of the sun or of a candle, and for that cause <hi>Marcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> made his te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of Honor insuch wise, as no man could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into it but by the dore of the temple of Vertue, as I haue declared afore. Our Lord Iesus likeneth the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, vnto one that sold all that he had to buy a goodly pearle withall; as who would say, A man would not sticke to spend his mony &amp; his goods to purchase a thing that is beautiful and rare, and wherein there is great gaine. Therefore he that will purchase vertue, the fairest and greatest thing of price that can be as whereby we mount vp to heauen) ought not to spare any thing.<note place="margin">A wise man being armed with vertue cannot be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed</note> 
                  <hi>Antisthenes</hi> said, That Vertue is a good and sure wal, &amp; a kind of armor that cannot be taken away: be a man ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so valiant, he may haue his sword taken from him, and he may de disarmed; but a wise man being armed with ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue cannot be disarmed or ouercome. Also he affirmeth, that the wise man liueth not by law, but by the rule of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. As who should say, no good man ought so much to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect the commaundement of the law, as the direction of reason, which wil haue vs to follow the thing that is good and honest, and to eschew whatsoeuer is shamefull and vnhonest.
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:6660:41"/>
The which reason caused the emperour <hi>Theodosius</hi> to say, that it most highly beseemed the maiestie of a king, to bind him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to law; and that the authoritie of the empire depended vpon lawes, vnto the which he also submitted himselfe. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwise, <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> the peerelesse patterne of all wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, said it belonged to none but to himselfe alone to stablish lawes at his pleasure, without being bound to maintaine them longer than he listed.</p>
               <p>One demaunded of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> what profit Philosophie brought with it? Very great (quoth he) for it teacheth me to doe the things vncommaunded, which other folkes doe for feare of lawes. The same is it that makes a king conform him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to the law. For the prince being the defender, maintainer and vpholder of the law, cannot doe any thing against law, without doing wrong to the state, and without giuing an euill example to his people. And for as much as hee hath none a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue him but onely God, and therefore may transgresse the law without punishment, and without feare of man, hee ought to haue the bridle of reason and vertue before his eies, as well to keepe the lawes himselfe, as to make them to be kept of his people.</p>
               <p>And as it is a great shame for a scholemaster, when his scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler knoweth more than he: so is it a great dishonor to a prince, when his subiect is better than he. And therefore vertue is much more needful in a prince,<note place="margin">The priuat person is to do well by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint of laws, but the prince by the directio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Vertue.</note> than in a priuat person. For the priuat person doth good of force, by constraint and rigor of the lawes: but the prince can haue none other constraints than vertue, religion, and hope of reward at Gods hand. According whereunto, <hi>Chilo</hi> the Lacedemonian being asked, Wherein vertuous men passed other men? In good hope (quoth hee.) Whereby he meant the reward that we looke for after this life. And therefore I say for a conclusion, that Vertue is the law and rule of princes, according whereunto, they ought to direct all their actions and doings, for the well gouerning of their people, and that they may haue a happie reigne.</p>

                  </note> For whereas Phisicke discusseth what is sicknesse, and Musicke, what is a discord; that is but casually and by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, for the better doing of the contrarie; that is to wit, for the preseruing or recouering of health, and for the making of good harmonie. Euen so temperance, iustice, and wisdome, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the perfectest of all vertues, do giue vs knowledge not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the thing that is iust, honest, and profitable: but also of that which is vnhonest,<note place="margin">It is Ignorance not to know euill.</note> vniust, and hurtfull. For it is a brutish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse not to know what is euill, and to be ignorant of the things that are most principally requisit, in such as intend to liue vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly among good and honest men. The passions therefore, are Ignorance, against which, <hi>Mercurie</hi> opposeth the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God; Slothfulnesse, against the which he opposeth Cheerefulnesse, exempted from all voluptuous delectation; Inconstancie or vnstedfastnesse, wherevnto he opposeth Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie, or Stedfastnesse; Vnrighteousnesse, whereagainst he setteth Righteousnes; Incontinencie or vnchastnesse, against the which he matcheth Continencie or chastnesse; which is the vertue that ouermaistreth lusts, and is the first degree and foundation of all righteousnes: Riottousnes, or excesse, against the which he opposeth Sparingnesse; Deceitfulnesse, which he countermatcheth with Soothfastnesse; and consequently Enuie, Frawd, Rashnesse, &amp; Malice. <hi>Virgil</hi> following the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:6660:42"/>
of the Stoiks, setteth downe foure passions of the mind, sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng thus, Hence proceed the restreints of their longings, disli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings, ioies, and feares, which are as the welsprings of al the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidue. For enuiousnesse, slaunderousnesse, sorrowfulnesse, ruful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, carke, and despaire, come of disliking or discontentment. Slothfulnesse, bashfulnesse, and amazednesse of mind, come of fearefulnesse: Iollitie, boasting, and skorning, come of vnmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured gladnesse or ouer-ioifulnes. Wrath, rancor, suspition, and such other, come of longing or desirousnesse. Othersome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide the passions of the mind into Loue and Hatred, Longing and Loathing, Gladnes and Sadnes, Hope and Despaire, Fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse and Foolehardinesse, Choleriknesse and Coldnesse, which coldnesse is a vice proceeding of a sillie mind and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble courage, that is not touched with any thing, nor can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked to anger, and is a counterfeiter of the vertue Meeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, which doth so well moderat the affection and passion of the mind, that it keepeth a man from being angrie out of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. All these passions haue their being in the sensitiue appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite;<note place="margin">The one halfe of the Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons follow the Lustfull appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tit, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Ireful</note> the which I diuide into Lustfull, and into Irefull or Wrathfull. Six of the Passions, namely Loue and Hatred, Longing and Loathing, Gladnesse and Sadnesse, do follow the Lustfull appetite. The other six, that is to say Hope and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire, Fearfulnesse and Foolehardinesse, Cholerikenesse and Coldnesse,<note place="margin">This going before and comming af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is not in respect of time and place, but of order, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.</note> doe follow the Irefull part. I place Loue foremost, because the hating of one thing presupposeth the loue of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: as for example, a man would neuer hate vice, vnlesse he loued vertue.</p>
               <p>Likewise Longing, which is an appendant of Loue, goeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Loathing, which ensueth Hatred. Also Hope goes before Despaire, for if we haue a mind to any good thing, it is a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter matter to obtaine it, than to go without it. Therfore Hope (which tendeth to the good) goeth before Despaire which letteth the good go. Again, feare goeth before foole-hardines, because the good goeth alwaies before the euill, and we shun the euill to obtaine the good. In like case is it with gladnesse, which goeth alwaies before sadnesse, because the sadnesse
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:6660:42"/>
tendeth to the euill. As touching choleriknesse, some put it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore coldnesse, &amp; some after. They that put it after do follow the generall rule, saying that the good is alwaies formost, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the euil presupposeth a good, as I haue said afore. They that put it afore, say, that coldnesse is not properly a passion, but rather a default or want of passion: and therefore that in the matter of passion choleriknesse, anger, or wrath, ought to goe before coldnesse, which is a disposition void of passion and feeling of choller. Neuerthelesse it seemeth that this want of passion, may be deemed a passion and an euill thing in man, for as much as through such vndisposednesse of the soule, a man is so sheepish, that he cannot be angry when need is. For where both the extreams be faultie, they cannot be without passion, that is to say, without euill affection of the mind. Now in order of passions, loue and hatred doe hold the first place, as passions of most strength, vpon whom all the rest depend. Next vnto them do follow longing &amp; loathing, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendants to loue and hatred. For of loue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth longing, and of hating loathing, when as we be loath to see the thing that we hate. Then ensue hope and dispaire, &amp; so forth of the rest. Now it is to be seene after what sort a man is to rule himselfe in these passions, and by what means profit may be drawne of them.<note place="margin">That the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions being well taken are not euill.</note> First as touching loue &amp; hatred, it seemeth that both the one &amp; the other may be in the mind of a prince, &amp; gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in all gentlemanly minds, without blame. For we say that loue is a desire of the thing that is faire, goodly, or beautifull. Therfore hatred being the contrarie, must needs be a lothing of the thing that is foule and ilfauored.<note place="margin">Of loue.</note> Many haue misliked of loue as though it were a hinderer of vertuous deeds. But they that haue waded deepely into the matter, haue not rested vpon that kind of loue, which is ingendred in our hearts by the beholding of a faire &amp; beautifull countenance, or of some excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t beautie, but mounting vp higher &amp; seeking to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wels head, they haue found, that all that is in this word, is conceiued and ingendred by loue, as <hi>Plato</hi> teacheth vs, hauing perhaps drawne that doctrine out of the bible, as we may see
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:6660:43"/>
by <hi>Salomons</hi> song, which discouereth Gods loue towards men, vnder the persons of two louers, the which song is learnedly interpreted by <hi>Origen.</hi> This loue is not alwaies a well liking of the body; It is of another sort, liking wel of nothing but of the soule that is clad with innocencie, chastitie, righteousnesse, and tempera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. S. <hi>Austin</hi> in his xiiij. booke of the citie of God, saith that the will which is rightly disposed, is good loue, and ill dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed will is euil loue, The loue then which is desirous to haue the thing that is beloued, is called longing; possessing and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioieng it, it is called gladnesse. The fleeing or shunning of the contrarie vnto it, is feare; and the feeling thereof when it is come, is called sadnesse. And therefore these things be euill, if the loue be euill, and good if the loue be good. In considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whererof, we say that loue respecteth the good. By which reason, a prince ought to loue that which is most beautifull, that is to say, God; the which thing he shall do by being reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, and by being afraid to displease him.<note place="margin">A prince must loue the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like-weale.</note> Secondly after the example of God our souereigne monarke, he must loue the common-weale, as God loueth the world: yea, and by very natural reason, the publike case is to be preferred afore the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uat. And this only way made the Romans, Athenians, and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonians great, who feared not any danger, so it were for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-weale. Accordingly as we read that <hi>Codrus</hi> king of Athens, vowed his life for the safetie of his countrie, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the Romane <hi>Deciusses. Lacena,</hi> in steed of mourning for hir dead sonne, reioiced when she heard he was slaine in the wars, in defence of his countrie. <hi>Leonidas</hi> a king of the Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, holding it for certaintie that himselfe and all his souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers should be slaine, because they were not of sufficient num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to withstand the power of the Persians, sayd vnto his men, Let vs dine my good fellowes, as those which shall this day go suppe with them that are deceassed. In so much that the prince that hath the loue of God and of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-weale afore his eies, cannot faile but haue the vertues wherof I hope to speake hereafter. But if he neglect the common-weale, and haue regard but onely to his owne peculiar profit;
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:6660:43"/>
then in steed of hauing some vertues, he shall be replenished with all vice, so as he shall doe nothing but pill his people, and be catching of all things as well holie as vnholy. Wherby a man may know him that is a louer of men, from him that is not so; and a tyrant from a king. For a king aimeth wholly at the common profit, and a tyrant at his owne peculiar profit.</p>
               <p>Againe, the king in doing for the publike weale, doth for himselfe: for that is the thing that vpholdeth him. On the contrarie part, the tyrant in doing all things for himselfe, doth by that means ouerthrow himselfe.<note place="margin">What hatred becomme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h a prince.</note> And euen as loue is very requisit in a prince, so say I also that hatred doth well beseeme him. I meane not the hating of any perticular person, or of all in generall, after the maner of <hi>Timon</hi> of Athens, who na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally did hate all men, or of <hi>Mison,</hi> who neuer laughed but when he was alone: for such kind of hatred is dangerous in a prince, by reason of his ouergreat power, which would be the cause of the destruction of infinit men. For so soone as he commaundeth a thing, so soone is it done, as I will declare hereafter when I speake of anger. But I speake of the hatred which is the countermatch to loue. For if the louer loue the thing that is beautifull, the hater hateth the thing that is ouglie. Vertue is the beautifullest thing that we haue; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore must vice needs be the ougliest; and so must a good prince needs hate both the vice and the vicious. Which thing <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> perceiuing very well, saith in the twelfth chapter of his Prouerbs, That a wise prince scattereth the wicked, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the wheele to turne ouer them. And in the same chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he saith, That the king with his only looke driueth away all euill. As if he would say, that a king (who ought to be an example of vertue) is a terror to the wicked. For as the sun disperseth the clowdes and mists; so doth the countenance of a veruous king driue away all vice and all naughtinesse. For the wicked dare not come neere him, for feare of punishment. By speaking thus of loue &amp; hatred, we see what a king ought to desire, and what he ought to eschew: wherwith he ought to be pleased, and wherwith he ought to be displeased: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:6660:44"/>
that he ought to desire the good, as the end wherto he tendeth, and to abhorre the euill, after the example of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who in his Epistle to the Philippians, desireth to be let loose and to be with Christ. And <hi>Dauid</hi> in the Psalme 118, My soule longeth for thy iudgements.<note place="margin">In what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner a prince may be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and glad.</note> Likewise a prince ought to reioice and take pleasure in the welfare of his subiects, and to be sorie when they fare amisse. For it is permitted vnto him to be merry, so it be in things vertuous, accordingly as we be commaunded to reioice in the Lord, and to be sory for the misery and aduersitie of our neighbours.<note place="margin">Psal. 15. Psal. 22.</note> Reioyce ye righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous (saith <hi>Dauid</hi>) yea leape ye for ioy. And againe, Ye haue made my heart merry. And in the ninth Psalme, I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse thee and praise thee O Lord, and my heart shall reioyce in thee. But the beastly and voluptuous mirth is reproued, such as belongeth (as <hi>Dauid</hi> saith) to the horse and mule, which haue no vnderstanding, but giue themselues ouer to their owne sensuall lust. As for sorrow or sadnesse, it ought to be farre from vs,<note place="margin">Of sadnesse, sorrow, and heauinesse.</note> because that (as <hi>Salomon</hi> saith) A sorrowfull heart drieth vp a mans bones; except it be so that we sorrow for our misdeeds, according to this saying in S. <hi>Mathew,</hi> Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed are they that weepe and mourne: his meaning is, for their sinnes. For as saith S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the Corinthians, The godlie sorrow ingendreth repentance vnto saluation, whereof a man shall neuer repent him. But the worldly sorrow ingendreth death. And in his Epistle to <hi>Timothie,</hi> he findeth fault with such as are affectionlesse. And in the three score and eight Psalme, I looked (quoth <hi>Dauid</hi>) if there were any that would be sad with me, but there was none. For as <hi>Cicero</hi> saith in his Tusculanes, It is an vnnaturall and vnkindly thing, for a man to abide in such vnagreeuednesse. <hi>Socrates</hi> made <hi>Alcibiades</hi> to weepe, for that he shewed him by liuely rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, that he was of lesse estimation than a torch-bearer, if he had not vertue: and that sorrowing was behoofful to him. To rid vs of the worldly heauinesse, we haue two remedies; the one is vertue, and discretion. For a vertuous and discreet man, is not dismaied for any losse, neither is he out of quiet
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:6660:44"/>
for any thing,<note place="margin">Of friendship.</note> but for his misdeeds. The other remedie is Friendship. For as <hi>Chilo</hi> said, The sorrowes and incommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities of this life, must be ouercome by stoutnesse of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and by communicating them with our friends. And in truth there is not any thing that doth so greatly assuage hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinesse, as to haue a friend into whose bosome a man may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the griefe that lies vpon his heart. For that cause doth <hi>Homer</hi> giue <hi>Achilles</hi> a <hi>Patroclus:</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> an <hi>Achates</hi> vnto <hi>Aenaeas: Alexander</hi> had his <hi>Ephestion: Darius</hi> his <hi>Zopyrus: Scipio</hi> his <hi>Laelius:</hi> and generally all good princes haue had some spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall friend, vnto whom they might vnburden themselues of their griefes. My meaning is not, that I would a prince should haue a friend, but to serue his delights: for such friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships last not. As for example, if a prince loue some pleasant conceited person, because he taketh pleasure in him; the friendship that is so sought for pleasure or for profit, is but counterfait, and is easie to be broken, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith in his eight booke of Morals, The perfect friendship is among good men that loue vertue:<note place="margin">A prince ought to be very precise in chusing his friend.</note> and that friendship is durable. And such men ought a prince to be carefull to find out, for feare it be said vnto him, as <hi>Aristippus</hi> vpbraided some saying, When we buy a thing at a porter, we looke neerly vnto it, but when we be to chuse a friend, we be carelesse in examining his life; notwithstanding that there is no comparison betweene moua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble goods and a friend. For a friend may helpe a prince both with counsell and comfort, and also greatly aduance his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, as <hi>Zopirus</hi> did vnto king <hi>Darius,</hi> vnto whom he recouered Babilon. And therefore <hi>Darius</hi> said, That he had leuer haue one <hi>Zopirus,</hi> than to take tenne Babilons; and that he wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed hee had as many <hi>Megabisusses,</hi> as there be kernels in a Pomgarnet.</p>
               <p>For this cause were <hi>Pilades</hi> and <hi>Orestes,</hi> exalted to the skies by the Poets; and <hi>Damon</hi> and <hi>Pithias,</hi> Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagorians, by the Historiographers.<note place="margin">Many exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Also there were a couple of Lacedemonians, which offered to goe to the king of Persia, to be put to torture for the rest of their countriemen, who had killed the kings Embassadors. But yet the loue of certaine Frenchmen towards their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, shall put to silence the fables of <hi>Orestes</hi> and <hi>Pilades,</hi> and whatsoeuer is reported of the <hi>Curtiusses</hi> and <hi>Deciusses</hi> of Rome. When the king of England refused to take Callis to mercie, except they would deliuer him six Burgesses of the towne, with halters about their necks, to doe his pleasure with them; the people being assembled into one place, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this sentence, fell to weeping. Then stept vp among them one <hi>Eustace</hi> of S. <hi>Peters,</hi> one of the richest men of all the town, and told them that he would not suffer such a number of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to perish, but would rather giue himselfe to the death for their safety, than see them die for hunger, or be slaine with the sword. After him followed another named <hi>Iohn Daire,</hi> and foure mo of the richest in Calis, who vowed themselues eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rychone to the death, for the safegard of their people.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> in his second booke of Virgins, reporteth a notable storie of a maid and a young souldier, who offered themselues to die either for the other. The maid was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned either to doe sacrifice to the idols, or else to be made a brothel in the stewes. She vtterly refusing to doe sacrifice to the idols, was led forthwith to the stewes, where after she had made hir praiers vnto God, there was brought vnto hir a young souldiour, who altering his former purpose which he
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:6660:45"/>
had to haue defiled her, praied her to take his apparell, and he would put on hirs, that by that means shee might go hir waies vnknowne, and so be saued. When she was departed out of the brothel-house, there came in other yoong men in hope to haue had their pleasure of that faire damsel. But in hir stead they found the man, and thought shee had bene turned into that shape by miracle. In the end, when the conueiance was discouered, the yoong man was carried to be punished; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the mayd hearing, presented hirselfe to baile him, body for body, that he might escape: but the yoong man would in no wise heare of that, affirming that iudgement was giuen against him, and not against hir. The maid replied, that he was there but as a pledge, and that the sentence which was giuen against him, ought to be executed vpon hirselfe. To conclude, they disputed so wel the one against the other, that with their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents, they were both put to death. Let this be spoken as by the way, because occasion thereof was offered. He that is desirous to see more, let him read <hi>Aristotles</hi> Morals, <hi>Lucians</hi> Toxaris, and <hi>Ciceros Laelius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now let vs proceed to Hope,<note place="margin">Of Hope and Despaire.</note> which is an affection wel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeming a Prince. When <hi>Alexander</hi> hauing of a bountifull mind giuen all to his friends, was asked what should remaine to himselfe; Hope (quoth he) because he hoped to get much more. And this Hope is grounded vpon a certaine noblenesse of courage.</p>
               <p>I know well inough that some Hope is but the dreaming of a man when he is awake: for commonly we misse of the thing that we behight our selues. Neuerthelesse, I say that the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant and well aduised prince sildome fayleth of his hope, when it is grounded vpon reason and good fortune. <hi>Philo</hi> sayth, that Hope is the fountaine of all sorts and trades of life. The merchant traffiqueth in hope of gaine, the marener in hope to benefit himselfe by his sayling; the ambitious in hope of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and honour: and to attaine to these ends, euery of them doth take maruellous pains. The hope of the happie state draweth men to vertue. But indeed the true and only hope, is
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:6660:46"/>
to hope in God, as in him that is our Creator, and is sufficient of himselfe alone to keepe vs safe and sound.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Despaire, or Distrust.</note>Afterward commeth Despaire, or Distrust, the contrary to Hope, which may bee taken doublewise, either as when a prince hauing lost a battell and broken his force, letteth all go without consulting or taking aduice what to do, &amp; through Despaire seeketh no remedie, which oft befalleth for want of courage; to maintaine the which, nothing is comparable to stoutnesse of mind. The other sort is not properly Despaire, but a behauior proceeding of humilitie, which maketh vs that we be not ouer-hastie in hoping for great and high things, the which is conuenient enough for a prince, for it restreineth him from hazarding himselfe, and from vndertaking too great and hard things, after the maner of <hi>Dauid,</hi> who reioiceth that hee had not enterprised things ouer-great, and exceeding his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer. In this case, both Hope and Distrust are well befitting a king. For the one maketh him to enterprise great things, &amp; the other to moderat them in such sort, as he vndertake not any thing aboue his abilitie, or aboue that which he ought; for to do so, proceedeth either of vndiscreetnes, or of rage, or of some other inordinat passion.<note place="margin">Of Fearfulnes and Foole har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse.</note> Fearfulnesse, and Foole-hardinesse, are the two faultie extremities which inclose Prowes, or valeant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of courage, wherof I will speake more largely hereafter. For whosoeuer through the greatnes of his courage doth put himselfe in perill, yea euen of certaine death for a good cause, he is to be esteemed hardie, valeant, and manly-minded. And surely, the Fearefull is worse than the Foole-hardie. For as <hi>Thucidides</hi> saith, Feare doth not only bereaue a man of his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie, but also of his strength, and impeacheth the execution of the thing that he had determined. Neuerthelesse, the feare to do euil is euermore wel-beseeming, according to this saying of <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

S. <hi>Paul</hi> willeth vs to go through with our saluation, with feare and terror, and he would not haue vs to be too skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. And in the xj. of <hi>Esai</hi> it is written, that the spirit of the feare

of God shall rest vpon the blossome of the roote of <hi>Iesse.</hi> And in the lxvj. chapter, Whom shall I regard (saith the Lord) but him that is meeld and gentle, and standeth in feare of my words. And in the xxvj. At the feare of thee we haue conceiued and brought forth the spirit of saluation. And in the xxxiij Psalme, Ye righteous feare ye the Lord. And in the xviij Psalme,<note place="margin">The true way is to feare the power of God.</note> The feare of the Lord endureth for euer. And as S. <hi>Ierome</hi> saith, Feare is the keeper of al vertues, and the true way is, to feare the power of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Homer</hi> in his Iliads bringeth in <hi>Helen,</hi> vsing these termes to king <hi>Priam,</hi> Surely deare Lord and father in law, I doe both feare you and honor you, because we ordinarily reuerence those whom we feare. And therefore neere to the common hall of the Ephores in Sparta, there was a chappell dedicated to Feare; for feare doth alwaies accompany shame. Also it is a very commendable thing to be affraid of vnhonesty, and yet not to be afraid to be counted vnhonest. As for example, when one vpon a time vpbraided <hi>Xenophanes</hi> the son of <hi>Lagus,</hi> that he was fearefull and durst not play at dice; I confesse (quoth he) that I am not only fearefull, but also exceeding fearefull, but that is but in things vnhonest. For honourable is that feare that restraineth a man from doing euill.</p>
               <p>As touching meekenesse or meeldnesse, it beseemeth a prince very well. For it maketh him gentle, courteous, and affable. And it is one of the three vertues which <hi>Dauid</hi> would haue in a king. For in the xliiij Psalme, Ride on (saith he) and raigne, because of thy meekenesse, iustice, and truth. And this vertue is contrarie to choleriknesse, hasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, or fumishnesse, which ought to be far off from a prince, as the which doth too much blind him, and bereaue him of reason and iudgement.<note place="margin">A man ought to be angry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at sinne.</note> But to be angrie with leaudnesse and leaud persons, is very well done, prouided that it be not in such sort as it extend to sinne; according to this saying of the Psalmist, Be angrie, but sinne not in your hearts.</p>
               <p>And for as much as I will treat hereof more largely when I come to speake of anger or wrath, and of meeldnesse

               <p>If <hi>Brutus</hi> that conspired against <hi>Caesar,</hi> had not bene too spice-conscienst, saying it was not lawfull to kill any other than a tyrant, but had beleeued the counsell of <hi>Cassius,</hi> he had not left <hi>Antonie</hi> the tyrants friend behind, by whose death, the common-weale had bene discharged of al danger.

When <hi>Cabades</hi> king of Persia was cast in prison by his subiects that

                     </gap>o the necessitie of the time.</note> 
                  <hi>Theophrast</hi> reporteth of <hi>Aristides</hi> that in priuate cases betweene man and man, he was a perfect, vpright, and iust-dealing man; but in matters of gouernment concerning the common-weale, he did many things, according to the necessitie of the time.</p>
               <p>The Athenians in the conference which they had with the Melians, said that the Lacedemonians vsed much vertue among themselues, and in the things that concerned their lawes and customes at home: but in their behauior towards strangers, they were a people that esteemed that to be most honest and reasonable, which was most for their profit. <hi>Euphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meus</hi> an Athenian, said to the Camerins, that the man which raigneth by tyrannie, and a citie that hath an empire, deeme nothing vnhonest that may be for their profit, nor account a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>any thing theirs which is not safe guarded; and in all cases they esteeme others to be their friends or foes, according to the occasion of time and dealings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plutarch</hi> speaking of <hi>Marius,</hi> saith he made reckoning of iustice when it was for his owne behoofe, and tooke profit
<pb facs="tcp:6660:48"/>
both for iustice and honor, not considering that truth is more strong and mightie than falshood, but measuring the valew of them both by the profit that might rise thereof, and saying that when a lions skin will not sted a mans turne,<note place="margin">The skin of a fox must be matched with the skin of a lion.</note> he must take vnto it the skin of a fox. This hath bin the cause, that the best aduised which haue written of gouernment, and they also which haue practised it, haue not stood so much vpon ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, as vpon the occurrence of matters; insomuch that they haue said, That a prince oftentimes for the compassing of his affaires, must be faine to behaue himselfe contrarie to faith, contrarie to charitie, contrarie to humanitie, and contrarie to religion. But this opinion, notwithstanding that it be followed of the most part of the world; yet doe I find it farre distant from our religion, and from all that an honest man ought to doe. For God putteth no difference betweene a prince and a priuat person, in cases concerning vertue or vice. <hi>Antigonus</hi> the great, whom men would haue made to beleeue that all things are lawful for kings; Ye say truth (quoth he) for barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous kings; but vnto vs, that which is iust of it selfe, is alwaies iust; and that which is euill is alway euill. And to say tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>th, we see not that writers doe make two kinds of vertue, the one peculiar to princes, the other to priuat persons. For were it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for a prince or for a common weale, to doe euill for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits sake; it ought as well to be permitted also to the priuat person: for at least wise by the example of his prince, he will dispence with himselfe for doing good. But God will not haue vs to doe euill, for any good that may come thereof, no not euen though it be for the benefit of a whole realm. Therfore the foresaid proposition cannot be avowed of a christian with a safe conscience, seeing it is disallowed by the heathen. And to root it out of the hearts of princes, I am faine to set downe word for word (howbeit briefly) the same things that <hi>Cicero</hi> in his third booke of dueties setteth downe at large, leauing the rest to diuines, who match their reasons with the word of God, the only thing that is able to captiue a louely and right meaning mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:6660:48"/>Now then, it is not only by our religion, that we be war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thereof, but also by the wise Infidels, according to this saying of <hi>Socrates,</hi> the wisest of them all, namely, That those haue done amisse, which haue seperated honesty and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue from profit; seeing they ought of nature to goe iointly together. For a man can not bee said to profit himselfe, when he offendeth against nature. And there is not any thing more against nature, and against the lawe of man, than to take from another man, wherewith to profit a mans selfe: for nature can-not abide, that we should encrease our wealth by the spoiling and robbing of other men.<note place="margin">It is better to be poore than to doe wrong.</note> So that the man which obayeth nature, and followeth kindlie inclination, cannot find in his heart to hurt his like, but will rather chuse to be poore and to endure hardnesse, than to do another man harme, especially considering that the hurt of the soule, (which is vice or sinne) is an hundred fold worse than the hurt of the body.</p>
               <p>By the law of nature we should doe good one to another, and they that doe otherwise, doe take away societie from among men, the taking away whereof maketh goodnesse, iustice, and liberalitie to be laid a-water. And therfore when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer profit steppeth before our face,<note place="margin">If profit be mingled with sinne, we must let profit goe.</note> it is hard for vs to es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape prouocation: but when we haue bethought vs of it at leisure, then if we find that the profit is intermedled with vice, we must let the profit goe, and persuade our selues, that wheresoeuer sinne is, there can be no profit indeed. And seeing that there is not any thing more contrarie to nature, than sinne is; because nature requireth nothing but that which is good, neither is any thing more agreeable to nature than profit; it is very hard for vice &amp; profit to match together in one ground. And for as much as vertue surmounteth and sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passeth all things; it is very behooffull and needfull that the soueraigne good should consist in vertue. Now as that which is good is behoofful &amp; profitable; so that which is honest is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable also. The wicked beholding an outward shew of profit, doe run after it, not perceiuing into what inconuenience they
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:6660:49"/>
fall by doing euill: by reason whereof they peruert the lawes both of God and man, which thing he that liueth after the law of nature doth not. Yet notwithstanding oftentimes there happen cases which put euen the best to their shifts,<note place="margin">A case where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit is followed.</note> by reason of the profit that offereth it selfe vnto them. Not that they consult whether honesty and vertue be to be left; but whether the thing that is profitable may be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sinne. As for example, To the intent to wipe the name of the <hi>Tarquins</hi> cleane out of Rome, <hi>Brutus</hi> caused <hi>Tarqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius Collatinus</hi> the husband of <hi>Lucrece,</hi> to bee discharged of the dignitie of Consulship, and to be put out of the citie. This seemed a peece of wrong, because this <hi>Collatinus</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe had helped to expulse the kings. But for so much as it was found vpon good aduise, that the very remembrance of that so odious name, was to be vtterly abolished: the thing being profitable for the common-weale, imported also so much honestie, that <hi>Collatinus</hi> himselfe ought also to thinke well thereof; and so profit preuailed for honesties sake, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the which it had bin no profit in deed.</p>
               <p>There is another case, wherein profit and honestie seeme to encounter one another, by reason of the rigour, and yet notwithstanding, the chiefe regard is to be had of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, because it fighteth not against nature. As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, It is permitted you by the law of nature, to repulse the iniurie that is done vnto you, and for performance thereof, some-times a prince is driuen to doe rigourous executions, and such as may seeme too too cruell; as <hi>Thomiris</hi> queene of the Massagets did, who hauing vanquished king <hi>Cirus</hi> in battel, slew him and two hundred thousand men with him; so as not any one escaped the sword.</p>
               <p>This or the like execution were euill in a captaine, that should doe it vpon cold blood, or quiet deliberation, as <hi>Silla</hi> did at Rome. But when a prince, whom God hath armed to defend himselfe, repelleth iniurie by force, and putteth his enemies to the sword;<note place="margin">Crueltie in defending, is not vnhonest.</note> although it seeme a cruell deed, yet is it not altogether against honestie and honor. For the death
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:6660:49"/>
of the enemies is the welfare of the common-weale, against whom as a prince ought not to vse any treason or treachery wherby to kill them: so if in assailing the prince, they chance to fall into his hands, it is at his pleasure to do what he findeth behooffull for his owne safety, according to the law of arms, for it is not vnmeet that they should fall into the same net which they had laid for him. Had the Samnits vsed the way of extreame crueltie against the Romanes,<note place="margin">Enemies must either be won by some sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, or dispat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</note> when gentlenesse would not serue their turne, they had done the better for themselues, and they should haue learned by the effect, that the counsell of <hi>Herennius Pontius</hi> was verie good. For his son being captaine generall of the Samnits, set vnto him to haue his aduise, what he should do to the Romans, whom he held enclosed betwixt two mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tains. <hi>Herennius</hi> sent him word, that he should send them home to Rome, without doing them any displeasure; thinking that for so notable a benefit, they would of enemies become thensfoorth good and faithfull friends. And when he saw that this counsell liked not the Samnits, he counselled them to put them all to the sword, without sparing any one of them, for he thought that so great a losse would so greatly weaken the Romans, as they shold not be able to recouer themselues a long time after.</p>
               <p>This opinion seemed also ouer-cruell, and so they chose a meane way, which was to saue the Romanes liues, and to bereaue them of their armour and weapon, and of their stuffe, with some other conditions: which afterward was the confusion of the Samnits. Likewise the Euthalibians committed a great ouersight, in that they dispatched not the Persians, when they had them shut vp almost after the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said maner; or sent them not home in friendly sort, but did neither of both. For they sent them away without hurt; but they compelled <hi>Perosas</hi> the king of Persia, to adore their king, and to promise them vpon his oath, neuer to make war on them afterward. Neuerthelesse, as soone as <hi>Perosas</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered of the danger, he made sharper warre vpon them, than he had done afore, in reuenge of the iniutie and disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:6660:50"/>
that they had done vnto him. For in matter of state a prince must either deserue well of his enemies, by some singular courtesie, or make cleane riddance of them, if it lie in his hand to doe it. I would alway counsell him to follow courtesie.</p>
               <p>But yet he may haue to doe with such kind of men, that it shall stand him on hand, to vse rigour rather than gentlenes, as is to be seene in the deed of queene <hi>Thomiris,</hi> where al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit that the reuenge of hir sonnes death prouoked hir to kill <hi>Cirus:</hi> yet was it moreouer expedient also for hir state, to doe it in such sort as she did.<note place="margin">Crueltie is to be vsed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers that come to make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest.</note> For a prince that commeth out of a farre countrie, to conquer a realme, whereunto hee cannot pretend any right, will not lightly be paied with such clemencie. For his intent is to possesse himselfe of it by some means or other, and oftentimes for the bringing ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to passe, to make vtter slaughter and destruction of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants thereof, as the children of Israell did, when they came into the land of Promise.</p>
               <p>Well might <hi>Charles Martell</hi> haue done all the courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies that could be vnto the Sarsines; but yet would not that haue made them forbeare to inuade the realme of France. And therefore the best way was to fight it out with them, and to ouerthrow them vtterly. If <hi>Aetius</hi> being aided by the Frenchmen, had not fought with <hi>Attila</hi> to the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance in France, it had beene vnpossible for him to haue got him thence by faire means; and yet because he made not cleane riddance of him, a man may see what mischiefe came of it.</p>
               <p>It is noted as a fault in <hi>Constantine,</hi> that when he had van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished the Vandales, Sweuians, and Alanes, he pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not his victorie in putting them all to the sword, but gaue them respit to resemble themselues againe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they became as strong as he. <hi>Darius</hi> offered <hi>Alexander</hi> his daughter, a very beautifull Lady, with six millions of monie, and the one halfe of Asia; but <hi>Alexander</hi> would not admit that honourable offer, because his couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse

For they that are so vanquished, are alwaies mindful of the courtesie that hath beene done vnto them, and of the means to requite it, whereof in the fourth booke of Kings, the sixt chapter, we haue a notable example' in the king of Israel, who by the aduise of the prophet <hi>Elizeus,</hi> in steed of putting the Assyrians his enemies to death, which were come to seeke him, caused them to be entertained with all kind of good cheere, and sent them home without doing them any harme; by means whereof, whereas they had bin his sworne enemies, he made them his good friends. So also did <hi>Ptolomie,</hi> who hauing ouercome <hi>Demetrius,</hi> and put his host to flight at the citie Gaza, restored him his treasure and all his stuffe, with eight thousand prisoners, saying that he stroue not with him, for honour and empire.

The case standeth otherwise with him that commeth a farre off, to make conquest of a countrie. For his intent is to dispossesse them against whom he maketh warre, and to make cleane riddance of them, as we haue seene in the Saxons, Englishmen, Burgonions, French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Turks, Gothes, and Lumbards, who haue continued owners of the lands which they inuaded.

               <p>Now to come againe to our matter, like as God gaue the victorie at that time to the aforesaid duke <hi>Charles</hi>; so at another time he made his heire the prince of Salerne to loose the field, and to be taken and condemned to haue his head stricken off, as the said <hi>Conradine</hi> had had afore. And when this sentence was pronounced vpon him, which was on a Friday; he answered he was contented to take his death with patience, for the loue of him which suffered death on the like day.<note place="margin">The mercifull dealing of queene <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</hi>
                  </note> But when <hi>Constance</hi> the queene heard of this his answer, she said, that for the loue of him which had suffered death for vs, she was determined to shew mercy to the prince; and without doing him any further harme, she sent him to Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loine to the king hir husband, full sore against the peoples will, who would haue had him put to death. In which action we haue to consider one notable thing; namely, that <hi>Charles</hi> who had slaine <hi>Manfred</hi> in battell, and put to death both <hi>Conradine,</hi> and his cosen the duke of Austrich, vnder forme of iustice, could not keepe his kingdome so long time to his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steritie, as the heire femall of <hi>Manfred</hi> did by vsing fauor and mercie. But when a stranger hauing no former quarrell, comes with a great number of men to inuade a countrie; I beleeue it shalbe well done of him that getteth the victorie, to let none of his enemies escape, least their inlargement prouoke them to set a new voyage abroche, as the Frenchmen did in Gallia, and the Gothes in Italy.</p>
               <p>Againe, there is no loue or kindnesse to be hoped for at such folks hands. But out of that case,<note place="margin">Crueltie is not to be vsed for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teinance of a state.</note> I see not that crueltie ought to be vsed for the maintaining of any state; and as for to leaue vertue for profit, it ought not to be so much as once thought. <hi>Augustus</hi> for the better assuring of his state, caused <hi>Cesarion</hi> the sonne of <hi>Iulius</hi> and <hi>Cleopatra</hi> to be slaine. It may be perchance that in so doing, he delt for his profit, but surelie
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:6660:52"/>
he delt not vertuously. Contrariwise, <hi>Sextus Pompeius</hi> who had the staffe in his owne hand, to haue killed <hi>Augustus</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonie,</hi> his enemies, delt honorably in letting them goe, but to his owne destruction, which thing he chose rather to doe, than to falsifie his faith, as I will declare anon more at large, I could alleage many mo examples of euill princes, which haue finished their daies in wretchednesse, and lost their king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, or at the leastwise their children after them, whom I will omit for briefnesse sake,<note place="margin">Of <hi>Caesar Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia.</hi>
                  </note> speaking but only of <hi>Caesar Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia</hi>; that we may see whether such a prince can be had in estimation. I am well assured that to lay the foundation of his principalitie, (which came to him but by fortune as they say) he had many things to do, the which he brought al to passe by his wit. But yet can I not allow that maner of dealing. For he caused the <hi>Columnians</hi> to be destroyed by the <hi>Vrsines,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward dispatched the <hi>Vrsines</hi> too, for feare least they should take part against him. He vsed the helpe of the Frenchmen, to get possession of Romania, and afterward draue them out when he was peaceably setled in it. To purchase the peoples fauour, he executed rigorous iustice vpon theeues, robbers, and extortionors; and for the doing thereof, he set vp a very good and seuere Iusticer, named <hi>Remy Orke.</hi> Afterward percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that his ouer-rigorous iustice procured him some hatred; to root that conceit out of their imaginations, and to shew that that came not of him, but of his officer; he made maister <hi>Remy Orke</hi> to be cut in two pieces, and to be laid in an open place with a bloodie knife by him. I see not wherein this duke <hi>Valentine</hi> is to be allowed; I beleeue he was well aduised what he did, and assaied all the means he could to make his owne profit; but that profit was vtterly seperated from vertue.</p>
               <p>What policie was it to kill folke by trecherous sleights and treason, which had neuer trespassed him either in word or deed? What a reward was that for a iudge to receiue, for doing his duetie, and for seruing him faithfullie? If such princes may bee allowed, then shall murther and frawd
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:6660:52"/>
be no vice, so it bring profit. And then let vs take <hi>Socrates</hi> his saying the contrary way, and say that vertue ought to attend vpon profit. And so should it follow of consequence, that whosoeuer could deale most for his owne profit, should be the best and honestest man. But all the paine that this wretched prince tooke to stablish his state, stood him in small steed. For he vtterly forwent it, and was deceiued himselfe, as he had deceiued others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thucidides</hi> in his historie, interlaceth a notable saying of the Corinthians, which was spoken to the counsell of the Athenians, If a man will say (saith he) that that which we say is very reasonable, but that the opinion of the other side is the more profitable, if there be warre; we answere, that the more vprightly men walke in all things, the more is it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly for their profit.<note place="margin">There is no profit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out vertue.</note> Therefore it is most expedient for a prince that wil not faile of his purpose, to fix his eye continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>n vertue, and to set it before him as his marke to shoot at, and to assure himselfe that he cannot haue profit without vertue.</p>
               <p>Vpon a time <hi>Themistocles</hi> told the Athenians, that he had a way to make them great, yea and lords of all Greece, but that the same was not to be imparted to any mo than one, least it should be knowne. Hereupon the Athenians chose <hi>Aristides</hi> to take notice of his deuice. Vnto whom <hi>Themistocles</hi> declared, that the nauie of the Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans might easily be set on fire, whereby it would be an easie matter to vanquish them. When <hi>Aristides</hi> had heard the counsell of <hi>Themistocles,</hi> he went vp into the pulpit with great expectation of the Athenians, and told them that <hi>Themistocles</hi> had giuen a woonderous behoof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and profitable counsell, but it was not honest, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Athenians, without hearing any further what it was, disallowed the counsell of <hi>Themistocles,</hi> as not good.</p>
               <p>At such time as <hi>Pirrhus</hi> made warre with the Romans, one of his people came to <hi>Fabritius,</hi> being then Consul at Rome, &amp;
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:6660:53"/>
proferred him to poison the king. <hi>Fabritius</hi> without taking any further counsell, sent backe the traitor vnto <hi>Pirrhus:</hi> and this his deed was allowed and commended of the senat.</p>

And as touching that which <hi>Theophrast</hi> saith of <hi>Aristides,</hi> That hee did ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thinges acording vnto the necessitie of the time; we find not so much as any one deed of his that may bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted vniust, sauing that when the citie of Athens wanted money, he propounded in counsell whether they should take away the gold that had bin laid vp in store in the temple of <hi>Apollo,</hi> at Delphos in the isle of Delos, contrarie to an article of the league that was concluded by oath, among all the Greeks; and therevpon gaue his aduise, that it was behoofful, but not rightfull. As much said he of the counsell of <hi>Themi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stocles,</hi> which I haue declared alreadie. Neuerthelesse, in the first, the Athenians followed vprightnesse, and in the later they followed their profit, or rather necessitie, which hath no law. But to say the truth, neither the one nor the other was to be imputed vnto <hi>Aristides,</hi> but to the Athenians themselues, in that they resolued themselues vpon the counsell that was giuen them, without following any other opinion, than that which liked them best. But as for <hi>Marius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The blame of <hi>Marius.</hi>
                  </note> there is no recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at all to be made of him, no more than of a man that was ambitious, without law and without conscience, as he shewed in many things, and specially in this fact following; namely that being at Rome about his affaries, whereas he ought to haue spoken well of <hi>Metellus</hi> his captaine generall, he gaue him very euill reports to the people, as though he had prolonged the warre of purpose, saying that if he himselfe were made consul, he would dispatch the matter out of hand, and bring them <hi>Iugurth</hi> either quick or dead.

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:6660:53"/>
slaundered a man of great honour. But <hi>Silla</hi> paid him with the like measure; for he challenged to himselfe the honour of the taking of <hi>Iugurth</hi> prisoner, wherevpon sprang all the bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die quarrels that ensued afterwards betwixt them. Thus yee see how the wicked are oftentimes paid with the same coine which they gaue vnto others.

thing, and afterward the Romans placed the image therof in the Capitol, nere vnto the image of the great God <hi>Iupiter,</hi> to the end that no man should be so bold and presumptuous, as to violat so sacred and holy a thing. In so much that the holiest and greatest oath that they could skill to make, was to sweare by their Faith, as the thing which they accounted most diuine, and (as <hi>Cas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>iodorus</hi> saith) most beloued of God, and most reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced of men. For how could mans frailtie be vpheld among so many waues and storms, if there were no firmenesse in the doings and saiengs of princes? Among fellowes, faithfulnesse maintaineth friendship. It maketh seruants to obey their mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters with all integritie. It maketh vs to serue God, and to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship his diuine maiestie with deuout beleefe: and to conclude in one word, whatsoeuer we see to be well done, commeth of vnchangeable faithfulnesse. And yet for all that, we see that those which are best able to keepe it, doe make least account of it, specially in matters of state, because (say they) a prince is faine to promise many things for the maintaina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nce of his estate, which he being once out of those dealings, is not bound to performe. And as <hi>Plutarch</hi> saith in the life of <hi>Pirrhus,</hi> Princes vse the two termes of Peace and War,<note place="margin">Princes vse the termes of Peace &amp; War, as they doe monie.</note> as they do their coine; namely, as it may best serue their owne turne, not for duties sake, or for iustice sake, but for their owne profit: and they be better men when they confesse roundly that they make war, than when they cloke the surceassing or intermitting of their wicked intent, with the holy names of Iustice and Friendship. And as saith <hi>Paulus Iouius,</hi> the Faith of some kings is such, that they stick not to violat and breake the most sacred couenants of accord, at their pleasure; specially when they haue once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued themselues to intend to nothing but their owne present profit, and to applie themselues only to the time. <hi>Archidamus</hi> being desirous to make the Athenians to breake the league of peace, that had bin made with <hi>Antigonus,</hi> and perceiuing they stack at it for their promise sake; told the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there was difference between a man and a sheepe, for a sheepe had but all one kind of voice, but a man had diuerse sorts, so as he might change his
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:6660:54"/>
voice continually, vntill he had brought to passe what he would. As who would say, Faithfulnesse was but for fooles that could no skill to dissemble, as hauing but one maner of speech for all turns; but men of wit altered their maner of doing and speaking, according as occasion or need required. When <hi>Lisander</hi> was blamed for breaking the peace that had bin with the Milesians,<note place="margin">Men be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by oathes.</note> he answered, That children were to be beguiled with little bones, &amp; men with othes. The tyrants <hi>Deuis</hi> and <hi>Policrates,</hi> said as much in that behalfe. <hi>Marius</hi> esteemed it a point of vertue and high courage, to be skilfull in cosenage, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> reporteth of him in his life. There is an Italian author,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Machiauel.</hi>
                  </note> who in his booke of a Prince, saith that in his time the princes that haue made none account of their faith, haue become great, and haue passed those that haue grounded themselues vpon faithfulnesse. And he will haue a prince to be of two natures, the one of beast, the other of man; and that when the nature of man will not preuaile, he should haue recourse to that of the beast. And that of the beasts, he should chuse the fox his nature, to discerne snares; and the lions, to put the woolues in feare. And therfore (saith he) a wise prince cannot keepe his faith, if this obseruation be turned the contrarie way. And because there be wicked men which keepe not their promise, neither ought he also to keepe touch with them. Among the examples of the princes of his time, he alleageth pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the sixt, who made no bones or conscience at al to deceiue men. Neuer was there any man (quoth he) that assured things with greater force of words, or affirmed them with greater othes, and that meant lesse good faith, or lesse perfourmed them: &amp; yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his packings came alwaies to passe as he would wish, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he gaue his mind to it.

And it were better for him to follow the counsell of <hi>Cicero</hi> in his books of Dueties, who
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:6660:55"/>
sayth, That no good man will euer lie for his owne aduantage. For if he that dealeth altogither by frawd, be had in estimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; I see not in comparing the lesser with the greater, why either a shamelesse person or a theefe should be blamed, of whom neuerthelesse the one is hanged, and the other is poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at with folks fingers, and baited out of all good mens com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies. For their doing so, is but to auoid pouertie, and to find the means to liue vpon other mens purses, as the prince that is a deceiuer, is desirous to doe his affairs at the cost of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. True it is, that because he is a great lord, men say of him as a certain pyrat said of great <hi>Alexander,</hi> namely that because he himselfe roued but with one gallie, he was counted a rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and because <hi>Alexander</hi> went with a great number of ships, therefore he was counted a king, but in effect they were both of one trade, sauing that the one of them was rich, puissaunt, and well attended; and the other was poore and meanly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied.</p>
               <p>And as <hi>Plutarch</hi> saith in the life of <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> kings and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces must not blame priuat persons, though now and then they step aside, as opportunitie fitteth them for their profit; for in so doing, they doe but imitate their souereigns examples, and follow the footsteps of them that are their ringleaders, in all vntrustinesse, trecherie, and vnfaithfulnesse: as who would say, that he dispatcheth his businesse best, which least lifteth to obserue law and vprightnesse. But although some vnfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full prince doe happen to prosper, it dooth not therefore fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that a faithfull prince cannot prosper. <hi>Titus, Traian, Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine</hi> the meeke, <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>After the battell of Cannas, which the Romanes lost vnto <hi>Hannibal,</hi> there were ten prisoners, who vpon safe conduct gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen them by <hi>Hanniball,</hi> tarried still at Rome contrarie to their promise giuen vnto him, but they were all denounced infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, and one of them was sent backe againe vnto <hi>Hannibal,</hi> to doe what he would with him. The consul <hi>Regalus</hi> did not so, for he perfourming his promise, returned at the time which he had set, notwithstanding that he was sure to go to exquisit torments, that were prepared for him. The Carthaginenses hauing lost a battell vpon the sea against the Romans, sent <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milcar</hi> &amp; <hi>Hanno</hi> to treat with them for peace. <hi>Amilcar</hi> would not put himselfe into the Romanes hands, because he had a little afore taken <hi>Cornelius Asina</hi> the consull prisoner, whome the Romanes had sent embassador thither. But <hi>Hanno</hi> sticked not to proceed foorth; and when he had begun to declare his message, a certaine Romane captaine sayd threatningly vnto him, that as much might befall him as had bene done to <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius.</hi> But the consuls putting the captaine to silence,<note place="margin">The noble an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer of the Romane Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls.</note> told <hi>Hanno</hi> that the Faith of the empire of Rome, should deliuer them from that feare.</p>
               <p>At such time as <hi>Tissaphernes</hi> brake the truce which hee had made with the Lacedemonians, <hi>Agesilaus</hi> sayd, he thanked the gods that <hi>Tissaphernes</hi> had angred them and offended them, and thereby made them gracious and fauourable to the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonians; esteeming it a thing very displeasant vnto God for a man to falsifie his faith. And therefore <hi>Mimus Publianus</hi> saith, That he which hath lost his credit, hath no more to lose, because the whole welfare and honour of a man dependeth thereupon.<note place="margin">He sustains greater losse which looseth his credit, than he that loseth the thing that was promised him.</note>

                  <hi>Bias</hi> said there was no excuse for a man that brake his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, because he that looseth the credit of his word, looseth more than hee that looseth the thing that was promised him. <hi>Cinna</hi> hauing sent for <hi>Marius,</hi> made it a matter of consultation whether he should receiue him or no. <hi>Sertorius</hi> was of opinion
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:6660:56"/>
that he should not send for him; but <hi>Cinna</hi> told him, he could not with his honour refuse him, hauing sent for him. When <hi>Sertorius</hi> heard him say so, he told him he did amisse to make it a matter debateable whether he should receiue him or no, seeing he was come at his commaundement.

                  <hi>Sextus Pompeius</hi> was aduertised by his admirall <hi>Menodorus,</hi> that now it was in his hand to be reuenged of the death of his father, and of his brethren, hauing both <hi>Augustus</hi> and <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie</hi> at supper with him in his gallie: and that if <hi>Pompei</hi> would giue him leaue, he would vndertake to cause them to be drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and it should neuer be perceiued how. But <hi>Pompei</hi> sauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the antient honour of the Romans, answered the mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger thus, Tell <hi>Menodorus</hi> that he might well haue done it without me, seeing he maketh none account of periurie: but it cannot beseeme me to giue my consent vnto it, seeing I haue not bene woont to falfifie my faith.

               <p>The Samnits hauing warred long time with the Romans, and being almost vtterly destroied, would needs for their last refuge put the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues once more to the trial of fortune (whome they had found so contrarie vnto them) and hazard all in one battell.

This oath had such force, that neuer any people were seene to fight so desperatly and valeantly, as they fought at that time.

After the example of whome, christian princes ought to bee well ware, that they violat not their faith, nor see light by the oth which they take for performance of their promises.<note place="margin">An example of the despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of oths and vowes.</note> Wherof we haue a notable example in the fourteenth chapter of the first booke of <hi>Samuel,</hi> where God is very sore angrie, for that <hi>Ionathas</hi> the sonne of king <hi>Saul,</hi> in chasing his enemies, had tasted a little ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie; which was in respect of the oath which <hi>Saul</hi> had made, that neither he nor any of his people should eat any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore night, and afore hee had bene fully reuenged of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.

               <p>And in the one and twentith of the second booke of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,</hi> because <hi>Saul</hi> being moued with a good zeale had slaine certaine of the Amorrhits, contrarie to the promise made vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them by the Israelits of old time, that they would not hurt them; God sent a famine among the Israelits, which ceassed not vntill they had deliuered seuen of <hi>Saules</hi> children to the Amorrhits, to take vengeance of them.</p>
               <p>These examples shew how greatly our God abhorreth periurie, to the intent no man should excuse himselfe vnder pretence that no touch is to be kept with him that breaketh his promise; or, that one co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panion is to keepe touch with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but not the master with his seruant, nor the christian with the infidel.

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:6660:58"/>
that did put all to the sword, pretended to be strangers come from a farre countrie, of purpose to ioine in league with them: and <hi>Ioshua</hi> beleeuing them to haue said truth, made a league with them. And by and by after, when their frawd was dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, the people would haue serued them as they serued the rest: but <hi>Ioshua</hi> would not for his oths sake, but chose rather to keepe promise with the fraudulent, &amp; to let the mis-beleeuing infidels liue, notwithstanding that God had commanded him to root them out, than to violat his promise giuen, in reuenge of their frawd. Whosoeuer deceiueth his brother (saith the sonne of <hi>Syrach</hi>) his sin shall be vpon him: and if he dissemble, he sinneth double; and if he sweare in vaine, he shall not bee iustified, but his house shall be full of tribulation. And in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, Cursed (saith he) is he that is double-minded. And in the 59 Psalme, <hi>Dauid</hi> praieth God to shew no mercie or fauour, to such as deale maliciously of deceitfull purpose. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the best reputation that a Prince can haue,<note place="margin">Good princes ought to keep well their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises.</note> and best be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeming his maiestie, is to keepe his promise, yea though hee haue not sworne vnto it. For good princes (said <hi>Traian</hi>) are more bound to performe their promises, than to accomplish the things that they themselues desire.</p>
               <p>And therefore a prince ought not to falsifie his promise vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of profit, nor to say that his counsell willeth it, or his estate requireth it. For he ought not to do any euill for the maintainance of his state. And hee that hath so discredited himselfe, shall not often recouer it, because he shall be taken and esteemed as a faithlesse prince; and if hee fortune to bee driuen to make any accord or league, it will be hard for him to be admitted into it, for the opinion that shall go of him: for as sayth <hi>Cicero,</hi> When a man is once periured, he may sweare by all the Gods, and no man will beleeue him.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Guichiardine</hi> sayth, there is little sinceritie and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full dealing to be hoped for at that Princes hand, of whome men haue conceiued opinion, that he is a double and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full person. Whereby it may come to passe, that hee shall lose more by shewing himselfe to be a periurer, than he can gaine

by any profit whatsoeuer it seeme to be.<note place="margin">Euill counsell turneth to the hurt of him that counselleth it.</note> Besides that, it falleth out that oftentimes the deceiuer himselfe is deceiued, and that (as saith <hi>Hesiodus</hi>) euill counsell turneth to the hurt of him that giueth it. <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleuenth was a deepe dissembler, and of great forecast; but his dissimulation was like to haue cost him his life. For the Duke of Burgoine detecting his trains, tooke him prisoner at Perone, and compelled him to graunt him whatsoeuer he required. <hi>Charles</hi> the seuenth who draue the Englishmen victoriously out of France, auailed more by his plaine dealing, than his sonne did by all his sleights and subtilties. Therefore whosoeuer will leaue a good and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable remembrance of himselfe to posteritie, will rather forgoe some piece of wealth, than willinglie be counted a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table deceiuer, periurer, and liar. And yet such doth <hi>Machia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell</hi> tearme the princes of his time, that compassed their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires well. But yet for all that, he shall find the foundations which this cunning cosener and wilie beguiler laid of his house, by his subtill sleights, were such as ouerthrew it imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly after his death. Neither is it for a man (when he hath sworne or promised a thing) to excuse himselfe, or to shift it off with captiousnesse of words, whereby he may seeme to haue accomplished his promise,<note place="margin">Not what men say, but what they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, is to be regarded.</note> when he hath not; For (as <hi>Cicero</hi> saith) Not what a man saith, but what he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth and pretendeth to doe, is to bee regarded. As for example, when a prisoner that is let goe vpon promise to returne againe, faineth himselfe by and by to haue forgotten somewhat behind him, and thereupon comes backe againe, and after being cleane gone, returneth no more to his maister; saying that he had performed his promise, in that he had returned afore. Or as he that hauing made a truce with his enemies for eight daies, did war vpon them in the nights.</p>

ouerlayd with timber well seasoned, and couered it ouer with earth in such sort, as no man could suspect any trench vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath it.

               <p>Vpon the concluding of the league in this maner, the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceans came to the campe of the Persians, and the Persians went into the citie, the gates wherof were set open vnto them. But suddenly he caused the timber to be pulled away, and so the earth sunke downe to the bottome of the pit, wherupon the Persians fell immediatly to sacking of the cittie; as who would say, they were discharged of their promise, because the earth there was not in like case as it was at the time that the peace was sworne.</p>
               <p>The Flemings vsed the like cautell to couer their periurie; for at such time as the king of England dealt with <hi>Iaques</hi> of <hi>Arteuil,</hi> to get the Flemings to take his part, whereunto they would haue condescended, but for the oth which they had made to the king of France.

To dissemble in time and place, is great

wisdome. It is as much to say, as that a man must strike saile, and apply himselfe to the wind like a good pilot, &amp; take good heed to the seasons. For sometimes it behooueth a man to be sterne, and somtimes to be meeld, and after a sort to abay the people, (at least wise so it be with some maiesty) to heare and see disorders, &amp; to put vp wrongs, without saying any thing to them, and to say as <hi>Antigonus</hi> said to his sonne; Art thou ignorant my son,<note place="margin">To raigne is but a kind of honourable bondage.</note> that our raigning is nothing else than a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine glorious bondage?</p>
               <p>Among the sumptuous he must be bountiful, and with the moderat hee must vse moderation, as <hi>Alcibiades</hi> could well skill to doe, who by applying himselfe vnto the behauiors of all men, and to the customes of all nations, did purchase to himselfe their friendship. <hi>Brutus</hi> plaied the disard, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that men should haue no mistrust of him, nor be priuie to the greatnesse of his courage. <hi>Clowis</hi> in not punishing a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine souldier out of hand, that had denied him the vessell of S. <hi>Remy,</hi> did wisely, for feare of a mutinie among the men of warre; but yet he punished him afterward, howbeit after a barbarous fashion, in that he slew him with his owne hand. <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleuenth did now and then heare himselfe il spoken of, and wisely dissembled it. Such dissimulation is needfull for a king, and is expressed in the first booke of the Iliads of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> vnder the person of <hi>Chalcas</hi> the soothsayer, who durst not tell the truth before king <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> nor from whence the plague proceeded that was as then in the campe of the Greeks, vntill <hi>Achilles</hi> had vndertaken to warrant him. For when a king (quoth he) is angrie, although hee make no outward countenance thereof, but dissemble it for the present time, yet will he not faile to be auenged af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward.</p>

               <p>It is another maner of thing to pretend to be a man of honestie, and to promise that which he intendeth not to performe, for that is called guile or deceit, and not dissimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I know well that a prince for want of aduisement and consideration,<note place="margin">A prince is not to keepe his promise made by oth, if it be against the dutie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene man and man.</note> may make some oth which it were much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for him to breake than to keepe. As for example, <hi>Herod</hi> at the feast of his birth-day, sware that he would giue his daughter whatsoeuer she would aske: and she by hir mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers counsell, asked the head of S. <hi>Iohn Babtist.</hi> The king be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sory that he had sworne, but yet daring not falsifie his oth, caused his head to be smitten off. But had he bin a good man, he would in that case haue broken his oth. For in swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to giue her any thing of how great value soeuer it were, he meant not to giue hir the life of any good man.

And therfore he should haue answered the faire lady, as <hi>Agesilaus</hi> answered a friend of his, that charged him with his promise in an vnreasonable thing that he deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; who refusing to graunt his request, said, If the thing that you require be rightful, I promised it; if it be vnrightful, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised it not.<note place="margin">A subiect ought not to require any thing that is vnreasonable.</note> And when it was replied that a prince ought to performe whatsoeuer he promiseth; no more (quoth he) than the subiect ought to demaund any thing that is vnreasonable. <hi>Herod</hi> therfore was no more bound by his generall promise, to deliuer <hi>Iohn Baptists</hi> head, than <hi>Agetus</hi> was to deliuer his wife to his friend <hi>Ariston,</hi> vnder pretence of his oth.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Or as much as I haue spoken of falshood and deceit, against the which <hi>Mercurie</hi> the great opposeth truth; to the intent we may be the more prouoked to keepe our faith, and to performe our promises: This place inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth me to speake a word or twaine by the way in commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Truth, the which <hi>Plato</hi> termeth, The wel-spring of all good things. For as <hi>Plato</hi> saith in his Timaeus, Like as without being, there is no generation; so without Truth, there is no faithfulnesse. And therefore <hi>Dauid</hi> doth ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narilie take Truth for that same stedfastnesse which we haue in keeping our promise, which wee call Faithfullnesse. My meaning is not to speak here of the original truth, for that resteth alonly in God, accordingly as our Lord told the Iews, That he was the light and the truth. And this truth cannot be known of any, but only of the father of Truth, who is the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting God, as saith <hi>Origen.</hi> For none but the father know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the son, neither doth any but the sonne know the father. And <hi>Mercurie</hi> in his chapter of Generation, saith, That the truth is a thing vncumbered, vnwithered, vnpainted, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disguised, vnmovable, vnueiled, apparant, comprehensible of it selfe, vnchangeably good, and spiritual. Wherin the antient Philosophers agree with vs, saying that we haue but a shadow of the Truth, &amp; that the pure Truth is in heauen. Truth (saith <hi>Menander</hi>) is an inhabitant of heauen, and dwelleth with the gods. And the Persians worshipped a great God, which in body resembled the light, and in soule the Truth, as who would say, that God was light and Truth. Therefore of all the things that are on earth, none (as saith <hi>Mercurie</hi> in the xv. of his Pimander) can be called truth, but only an imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:6660:61"/>
of the truth. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the wit receiueth influence from aboue, then doth it imitate the truth: for without inworking from aboue, it abideth in vntruth; like as the shape of a man in a painted table, representeth a very bodie, but is not a body indeed as the eye imagineth it to be, in so much that although it seeme verily to haue eyes and eares, yet it neither seeth nor heareth at all: euen so the things that men behold with their eies are but leasings. Men beare themselues on hand that they see the truth, but in very deed they be but lies. For truth can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be vpon earth; but yet it may be, that some men to whom God hath giuen power to see diuine things, do vnderstand the truth: howbeit, that is not the truth of speaking and vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding things as they be indeed. For the very truth is the soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne Good, and true things are the effects thereof, which are the off-springs or imps of truth. In so much that the truth which remaineth with vs in this world, is but a countershape and shadow of the very truth, the which we follow when wee forbeare frawd, lying, and deceit, and proceed in good &amp; faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full dealing, truth, and loialtie; according to this saying of the Psalmist, The works of Gods hands are truth and vprightnes, that is to say, Faithfulnesse; his commandements are made in truth, that is to say, in substantiall Faithfulnesse: which kepeth truth euermore, that is to say, which alwaies keepeth promise. The beginning of his word is Truth, that is to say, his word is a grounded stablenesse. And in another place, All thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements (sayth he) be Truth.<note place="margin">To be true, is the beginning of all Vertue.</note> For (as sayth <hi>Pindar</hi>) to be true of heart is the ground and foundation of all vertue. And therefore <hi>Dauid</hi> praieth God, not to take the word of Truth out of his mouth. And in the fourteenth Psalme he sayth thus, Lord who shall dwell on thy holy hill? he that dealeth iustly with his neighbour, and speaketh the truth from his heart, and beareth true witnesse. Wherein we haue to consider, that hee matcheth Righteousnesse and Truth together, as who would say, he esteemeth a soothfast man to be a righteous man, and a righteous man to bee a soothfast man; and hardly indeed can they be seuered, according to this saying of <hi>Dauid,</hi> in the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:6660:62"/>
119 Psalme, Thou hast commaunded vprightnesse and truth aboue all things. Thou shalt haue folke at thy commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, because of thy meekenesse, vprightnesse, and truth. The kings throne that iudgeth folke with truth, shall be stablished for euer. And <hi>Salomon</hi> in his Prouerbs sayth, That he which speaketh the truth, vttereth righteousnesse. And in another place he saith, That meeldnesse and truth, vphold and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a king.<note place="margin">Tbe mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vpon truth.</note> When <hi>Iethro</hi> councelled <hi>Moses</hi> to disburden himselfe of the paine of iudging perticular cases, he aduised him to chuse such men as were wise, true of their word, and fearing God; as who would say, that the maintenance of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice depended vpon truth. After which maner, <hi>Marcus Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relius</hi> said, That in an honest woman, truth &amp; chastitie ought to be matched togither; and it was neuer seene but the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that was true of word,<note place="margin">The woman that is true of word, is also chast,</note> was also chast; and that the liar was sildome chast. And as <hi>Varia Mesa</hi> was wont to say, It is no lesse shame for women that are come of good houses to be liars, than to be vnchast. <hi>Socrates</hi> would that a prince should aboue all things be true of his word, to the end that his bare word might be more esteemed than another mans oths. And <hi>Cicero</hi> in one of his orations saith, That he which shrinketh from the truth,<note place="margin">Truth is a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</note> will passe as little to forsweare himselfe, as to make a lie. And in another place he saith, that truth is of so great might, that it cannot be vanquished by any subtiltie or wilinesse whatsoeuer: and that it is a sufficient defence to it selfe, though it haue no man of law to plead for it. <hi>Euripides</hi> saith, That the word of truth is plaine, and needeth no interpreter. And <hi>Salomon</hi> saith, that the lip of truth is euer steadie, but the toung of falshood is euer variable. In all thy works let the word of truth goe before thee (saith the son of <hi>Sirach,</hi> in his third chapter) <hi>Pithagoras</hi> said, That when we exercise truth, we follow the foot-steps of God. <hi>Plato</hi> in his fift booke of Laws, saith, That truth is the guid to all goodnesse, be it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, or towards man; &amp; that whosoeuer wil be happie, must be partaker therof; and that by that means, he shall be worthie to be beleeued; and contrariwise, that he shal be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N handling the fore-said question so well discussed by <hi>Cicero</hi> in his books of Duties, and well debated among such as haue to deale with matters of state. I haue told you heretofore that <hi>Machiauell</hi> held this erronious opinion, That a prince was of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie to deale contrarie to faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and Religion, for the mainteinance of his estate. Of Faithfulnesse I haue spoken sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t alreadie: now remaineth to enquire of Religion, because in some respects it is an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant of our discourse, or to say truly, all that euer we haue treated of hitherto, and all that euer we shall treat of hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth vpon that. For it is the ring-leader of al vertues, &amp; as the but wherat al they do shoot, without the which, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prince nor any other person whatsoeuer, can be wise, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, or happy, or do any thing that shalbe ought-worth; but religion is of it selfe behofful &amp; profitable to al thing, as saith
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:6660:63"/>
S. <hi>Paul</hi> in his epistle to <hi>Timothie.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Nothing can continue in his state with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out calling vpon God.</note> For it is vnpossible that any of the things which are in nature, should continue in their being and state, without calling vpon God, considering that it is through his fauour and goodnesse that all things abide in their perfection, as <hi>Philo</hi> saith in his third booke of the life of <hi>Moses.</hi> In so much that a gouernour of people, cannot haue a greater good thing in this world, nor a thing more beseeming his maiestie, than Religion; and that it is the greatest honour that can be for him, to stand in aw of God: the which dutie vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth it selfe in godlinesse and religion. For thereby he hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth God, and is honored of God, and hath an entrance into all vertues.</p>
               <p>The same author expounding Genesis, saith, that by the tree of life is betokened the greatest of all vertues, namely Godlinesse, the which maketh the soule immortall. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto accordeth S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> in the sixt of his Epistles, where he sayth, that the tree of life is the root of godlinesse, and that to doe due honour and seruice to our Lord and God, is the verie substance of our life. And <hi>Mercurie</hi> saith, that by Religion, man is replenished with all good things, and made to abound in heauenly vnderstanding.</p>
               <p>The emperour <hi>Theodosius</hi> was woont to say, that by Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, peace is maintained, and enemies in war time put to flight. Whosoeuer then will attaine to vertue, and to the souereigne good, cannot come to it but by Religion, and by seeking it at Gods hand, who hath promised to graunt vs whatsoeuer wee aske with a good heart, so it be rightfull. For God liketh well of such as call vpon him with a true heart,<note place="margin">God is nere vnto them that call vpon him with a true heart.</note> (saith <hi>Dauid</hi> in the hundred and foure and forteeth Psalme) bringeth to passe the desires of them that feare and loue him, heareth their cries, saueth them, and keepeth them. Hee that loueth God (sayth Ecclesiasticus) shall be heard when he praieth for his sinnes, so as he shall abstaine from them, and he shal be heard in his dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly praier.</p>
               <p>And as <hi>Plato</hi> sayth in his fourth booke of Lawes, A good man ought that man to bee, which shall offer sacrifice vnto

                  </gap>ing of oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, praiers,<note place="margin">Mans welfare consisteth in Religion.</note> and supplications vnto God, And the same <hi>Plato</hi> saith in his Theetetus, That mans felicitie consisteth in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to Godward, which is the greatest vertue that can be among men. And as saith <hi>Xenophon</hi> in his first booke of the trainment of <hi>Cirus,</hi> It is easier to obtaine any thing at the hand either of God or of man, by honouring them in our prosperitie, than by praying and suing vnto them in our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie. Now then, in treating of vertues, it behoueth vs (as saith <hi>Iamblichus</hi> in speaking of mysteries) to begin at the best and most pretious, which is Religion and the seruice of God, a naturall propertie (as saith <hi>Proclus</hi>) that is incident to al men, and is essentiall in man. Religion and godlinesse are wel neere both one.<note place="margin">A definition of Religion.</note> For godlines, as saith <hi>Mercurie</hi> the great, is nothing els but the knowledge of God; and Religion is the knowledge of the ceremonies belonging to the worship of God. <hi>Plutarch</hi> saith in the life of <hi>Paulus Aemilius,</hi> That Religion is the skill how to serue God. And <hi>Cicero</hi> in his Rhetorike saith, That it is the bringer of the ceremonies concerning the things that belong to the God-head; so as there is no great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the one and the other. According to <hi>Festus Pompeius,</hi> We call those Religious, which can skill what is to be done, and what is to be left vndone. Godlinesse then or Religion, is the seruice which we do vnto God in worshipping him as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togither good, almightie, and the author and creator of all things. In this acknowledgement did <hi>Abel</hi> make his offerings, and <hi>Enos</hi> begin to call vpon God. Afterward <hi>Moses</hi> brought the law of God to the children of Israel, written in two tables, wherof the first concerneth Religion &amp; the honor that ought to be yeelded vnto God; and the other concerneth our dutie towards our neighbour, commaunding vs to beleeue in God only, to loue him with all our heart, to worship him only and none other, to giue no honour to any thing wrought by mens

hands; nor to any other creature, but only to the liuing God; to forbeare to take his name in vaine by swearing by it, and much more by forswearing; and to take one day of rest in the weeke to dedicate the same vnto God, and to cease from all worke, and to intend to the seruing of him. And secondly he commaundeth vs to honor our father and mother, to abstaine from murther, theft, sals-witnessing, whoredome, and the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueting of any thing whatsoeuer.<note place="margin">The Heathen kept the ten commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> Now we find that not only the Israelits, (who had the law written) but also the heathen which had it not, did wholly obserue it, as we shall see by this discourse, chiefly in the case of Religion. We see what is written therof, by such as had not the knowledge of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed vnto them, as namely how diuinely the great <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> hath written thereof, and how his Pimander reuealeth wonderfull secrets vnto him, which are so conformable to our misteries, that they seeme to be drawne out of the same fountaine.<note place="margin">The Trinitie was knowne of <hi>Mercurie</hi> the great.</note> And the thing that is most wonderfull, is that he speaketh of the three persons, as if he had bin instructed thereof, by the writings of the gospell, and specially of the wisdome, whom he calleth the sonne of God, to whom he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributeth the creating of all things, according to that which S. <hi>Iohn</hi> saith therof in the beginning of his Gospell. Next vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Mercurie,</hi> followeth <hi>Plato,</hi> who for that cause is called the diuine. And after them haue followed many other Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, as is to be seen by their writings, &amp; by the things which S. <hi>Austin</hi> of Eugubie hath painfully gathered into his books which he hath made of continuall Philosophie. The Sabines worshipped God in three persons, naming the one Holie, the other Fidius, and the third Semipater. And in their oths they did commonly put Fidius in the middest, as who would say, that vnder that name they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehended al the three persons, wherof came their great oth of <hi>Medius fidius.</hi>

                  <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> king of Romanes, was not of opinion that there were so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny gods as he himselfe forged, after the example of others: For he wrote against such vngodlinesse, which books being
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:6660:64"/>
found after his death were burned by commaundement of the Senate, as contrarie to the worshipping of many gods, which follie there was no way as then to put out of their heads; wherein <hi>Numa</hi> did verie ill, in that he had leuer to sticke to the Superstition of the multitude, than to tell them his mind without dissimulation, how he made idols, neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse the people were forbidden to beleeue that God had the shape of beast or man; insomuch that in those first times, there was not in Rome any image of God, either painted, carued, or cast in mould. And for the space of the first six hundred threescore and ten yeares, they builded vp temples and chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels to their gods, but there was not in them any image or fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of God; as who would say, they thought it sacriledge to haue the mind to resemble or liken the Godhead to earthly things, considering that it is not in any wise possible to attaine to the knowledge of the Godhead, otherwise than by means of the vnderstanding. And that was agreeable to the doctrin of <hi>Pithagoras,</hi> who was of opinion, that the first cause was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a sort conceiuable in vnderstanding, but yet vtterly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisible and vncorruptible.</p>
               <p>As touching an oth,<note place="margin">Of Swearing and of Oths.</note> I haue alreadie shewed in what estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it was among the infidels, and how they abhorred per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie, to our great shame. For surely to take God to witnesse in a lie, is a verie great wickednesse.</p>
               <p>And as touching the taking of one day in the weeke,<note place="margin">Of the sabbat day.</note> to respit both men and beasts from worke and trauell, <hi>Hesiodus</hi> the antient Poet commaundeth it in his booke of Workes and Daies; and <hi>Plato</hi> saith in his booke of Lawes, that the gods pittying men, least they should ouer-worke themselues, haue giuen-them a release of their labor, by leauing them ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li-daies ordained in their honor. Thus ye see how many of the men of old time, at the beginning of the law of nature, did well enough practise the law of God, had not the deuill thrown them into the wretched &amp; abhominable sin of idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, and that some certaine persons had not turned all vpside downe by the inuention of idols, as is written in the xiij and

But in the end, God sending his owne son into the world, hath made vs to know that which many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and especially <hi>Dauid</hi> in his fifteeth and three and fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teeth Psalms hath said, namely, That the true sacrifice is to praise the true and inuisible God, to yeeld him thanks for all his benefits, to lift vp our minds vnto him, to pray vnto him with all deuotion and humilitie, and to offer vnto him in sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, a pure and cleane heart, adorned with feare and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, according to this saying of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> That we must offer vnto him a liuing host; that is to say, our bodies without ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish, and as <hi>Philo</hi> saith, Can there be found a goodlier sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, than the soule that is well minded towards God? Who shall goe vp into the Lords hill, but he that is of pure and cleane heart, considering that not he which saith Lord, Lord, but he that doth the Lords will, shal enter into the kingdome of heauen? For, as <hi>Persius</hi> saith, When we bring vnto God from the closet of our soule, holinesse, and from the bottome of our heart, a pure and obedient mind, and a meeke affection seasoned with goodnesse, vertue, and honestie, then may we boldly offer vp our praiers and sacrifices vnto him; but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it behoueth vs to be well ware that we presume not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him.<note place="margin">God accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not the offerings of the wicked.</note> For the sacrifice of the wicked is lothsome vnto God, saith <hi>Salomon.</hi> And <hi>Plato</hi> in his fourth booke of Lawes, saith, That God accepteth not, ne regardeth not the gifts of the wicked, and that their pains in that behalfe, are in vaine; but that on the contrarie part, he doth willinglie receiue the gifts of the holie. And as <hi>Philo</hi> saith in his third booke of the life of <hi>Moses,</hi> If the person that offereth be euill and vnrighteous, his sacrifices are no sacrifices, his halowed things are vnholie, and his prayers turne to the contrarie, procuring him misfortune in

steed of good. This honouring of God with heart and mind, we call Godlines, and Religion, which is the meane betweene vngodlinesse (wherof alonly we ought not to make mention) and Superstition. Of Religion and Superstition, <hi>Cicero</hi> in his third booke of the Nature of the gods, speaketh in this wise: Our worshipping (saith he) with a pure, cleane, sound, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupted mind and voice.<note place="margin">Of Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> For not only the Philosophers, but also our ancestors haue seperated religion from superstitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For such as praied all the day, that their children might ontliue them, were called superstitious; and they that were diligent in doing the things that pertaine vnto the worshipping of the gods, were called Religious. Of the word <hi>Religio</hi> (which signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth to bind-ouer, because Religion bindeth men to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of their dutie towards God.) And so of the ij. things betokened by the two words of Religion &amp; Superstition, men haue made the one a vice, and the other as vertue. So then, we call those superstitious, which are ouer-religious, and leauing the true vse of the praiers that are to be made vnto God, doe busie themselues in babling, and in requiring vaine things at his hand, as those sillie soules did, which ceassed not to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunat vnto God, that their children might <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

as for example, those that are afrighted at the eclipse of the sun or the moone, at the howling of woolues, at the noise of the Scriech-oule, or of the night-rauen, or at the flying of certaine birds, and such other like things. In all the which the Romanes were too too superstitious, as is to be seene by a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of theirs, wherin they caused the Reliks of their gods to bee borne vpon barrowes on horse-backe through the citie; wherein because the Carter had taken the horse by the reine with his left hand, they appointed the procession to be begun new againe. And sometimes for one poore flie, that is to say, for a thing of nothing, they made some one sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to be begun twentie or thirtie times. Some of the men of old time tearmed this maner of dealing an exact Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, and we call it a fond and foolish Superstitiousnesse; howbeit that wee must needs confesse, that together with those ceremonies of theirs, (such as they were) they had Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion also in singular reuerence and estimation; insomuch that they would rather doe against their lawes, than falsifie their oth, because they deemed it a hainouser matter to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend God, than to offend man. So deeply had they Religion, (that is to say,<note place="margin">Where the feare of God wanteth, the realme must needs decay.</note> The loue and feare of God) imprinted in their hearts, without which, a prince or a common-weale can neuer prosper. For (as <hi>Machiauel</hi> saith in the first booke of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, a little better than he speaks in his booke of a Prince) whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>soeuer the fear of God once faileth, needs must the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom decay. <hi>Paul</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeth vs to honor the king, because he hath his power of God. Now if we ought to honor the king in respect of the power which he hath from God, what ought the king himselfe to doe, to whom God is so gratious, as to place him in that dignitie, and to make so many men obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent vnto him? Certes seeing he is the image of God, the least that he can doe is to lift vp the eies of his mind to behold him whom he representeth, &amp; to worship that heauenly mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, wherin by looking on himselfe, he must needs behold the goodnesse and maiestie of God.

               <p>Which thing <hi>Dauid</hi> acknowledging in the 118 Psalm, saith that he praised the Lord seuen times a day. He had good store of businesse to doe, but yet could they not turne him from the seruing of God. As proud and high minded a prince as great <hi>Alexander</hi> was, yet the first thing that he did euerie day after he was vp, was to doe sacrifice to the gods. There haue bin few princes, which haue not at least wise pretended to be religious, or bin religious indeed. But there is as much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene the one and the other, as there is betweeene truth and vntruth, or betweene the soule and the body. Yet notwithstanding seeing that they which haue not any zeale of religion,<note place="margin">A prince can not forbeare Religion.</note> cannot forbeare the pretence therof; it declareth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, that religion is a thing most requisit for the maintenance of a state, because men are of opinion, that the prince which is religious, is so guided by Gods hand, that he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not do amisse; which causeth them to reuerence him &amp; obay him the more easily. And to say truth, we see, not only that kings haue bin maintained &amp; vpheld by religion,<note place="margin">Religion ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth princes to be obayed,</note> but also that princes haue obtained kingdomes and empires by religion. As for example, <hi>Numa</hi> the second king of Romanes, being a Sabine borne, was sought and sent for by the citie of Rome, to be made king of Romans, because they saw him wholly giuen to religion, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suading the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues that they could not speed amis, if they were gouerned by a deuout and religious prince. And in very deed, it fell out according to their hope. For he did so much, that that people being then barbarous, &amp; altogither giuen to the wars, without law &amp; without religion, attained to that great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of state which we haue seen since, wheras it had bin vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for a warlik nation as that was, to haue escaped fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, had they not bin bridled by religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the only means to hold the cruellest people of the world in peace, and

For wheras his soothsaier had assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him that he should take the citie before the end of that present month, and euery man laughed at it, because it was the last day of the month, and the citie was impregnable: he put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all his forces in a readines for the assault, made proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that that day should be reckoned but for the 28 day of the moneth, &amp; yet notwithstanding gaue present assault to the citie, and wan it out of hand, contrarie to his hope. The empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, vsed the like feat, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he arriued at S. <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencis</hi> in Prouince. For he considered that it was the 25 of Iuly which is S. <hi>Iames</hi> day; and because he had landed in Affrike the same day twelue-month, the yeare before, he made great vaunt of his fortunat and happy lucke and handsell, in arriuing the same day in France, saying that his voiage was miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously guided and directed by the will of God, the disposer and orderer of humane affairs; and that as on the like day he had put the Turke to flight at Argier, so hee hoped to doe as much to the French king, through the direction and fauor of God, seeing they were arriued in France on the same day, and vnder the same head.<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Constantine</hi> made himselfe great by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing the Christian religion, as the Ecclesiasticall historie witnesseth vnto vs. The thing that serued <hi>Pepins</hi> turne most, was that he was reported to be religious, and beloued of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men, because he had caused the churches to be reedified, which had bin beaten down by the Sarzins; and had restalled the bishops of Reines &amp; Orleans in their sees, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which they had bin put by his father; and had restored the tenths to the clergie, that <hi>Charls Martel</hi> had take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away, &amp; giuen to his men

of warre. And to compasse his enterprise with the more ease, he helped himselfe at his need with Religion, that is to say by the Pope, without whom he had come short of his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. For the Pope dispensed with the Frenchmen for their oth which they had made to <hi>Childerik</hi>; &amp; comming himselfe personably into France, did put the realme into <hi>Pepins</hi> hand: Which thing the Frenchmen had neuer agreed vnto, as our histories beare witnesse, if it had not bin vnder the cloke of Religion, and by authoritie of the partie whom they deemed to haue power to dispence with mens consciences. The same Religion made <hi>Charlemaine</hi> emperour, and diuers persons kings of Naples and Sicilie, by deposing the true heirs. Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on gaue the kingdome of Ierusalem to <hi>Godfrey</hi> of Bulleine, and made the Christians to trauell ouer seas and lands to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer the holy land, vnderzeale of Religion. Vnder pretence of Religion, and of an excommunication, the kingdome of Nauarre was wrongfullie seazed by the Spaniards. The kings of Persia lost their kingdome through disagreement in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and the Sophy (because he was found deuout in his Religion) recouered all that his forefathers had lost. We see at this day, how the contempt and disagreement in Religion, shaketh all the states of Christendome, and will yet shake them more, if the dissentious spirits be not reunited againe in the bosome of the church. S. <hi>Lois</hi> got himselfe more glorie in Syria and Aegypt by his holy conuersation, than by his wars, wherein he had not any happie successe; and the churches which we see of his building, doe shew sufficiently how hee was giuen to Religion.<note place="margin">The bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse of <hi>Philip Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus</hi> to the Clergie.</note> 
                  <hi>Philip</hi> the emperor was not so much renowned for his victories, as for that after the battell of Bouvines, he builded the church of Victorie neer vnto Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis, the which he dedicated to the virgin <hi>Marie,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward did great good to the Clergi-men.

which he had gotten and gained by helpe more than hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, and euen by the fauor of God. But now leauing our christian histories, because my chiefe intent is not to speak of them, let vs read <hi>Titus Liuius,</hi> and there we shall see the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion that was in the Romanes of old time, and among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the zeale of <hi>Lucius Albinus</hi> a commoner,<note place="margin">The deuotion of <hi>Lucius Albinus</hi> a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moner of Rome.</note> who hauing his wagon loaden with his wife and yoong children, and with his mouables, and fleeing from the Gauls that were come to Rome; as soone as he espied the Nuns of <hi>Vesta</hi> on foot, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their holy reliks with them; immediatly he caused his wife and children to come downe, and his goods to be vnloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and lent his wagon to the virgins to ride in, and to carrie their Relikes.</p>

                  <hi>Numa Pompilius,</hi> to the intent to make the people atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue to the ceremonies of their religion, made an herald to go before the priest that ministred the ceremonies, and to crie with a loud voice, Do this; which was a commaunding of them to intend wholly to the diuine seruice, without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medling any other action.

                  <hi>Scipio African</hi> was one of the happiest captains of Rome, and best beloued of the people &amp; men of war, because they dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him to doe all things by the counsel of God, for that he vsed to tarry long alone in the capitoll; where their opinion was, that he consulted with <hi>Iupiter</hi> concerning the affaires of the common-weale.</p>
               <p>And generally all princes beeing of any good dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, haue had Religion in singular estimation, as wee read by the answer that <hi>Alexander Seuerus</hi> made to certaine Inholders of Rome, which would haue disappointed the Christians of the building of a chappell to make their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in.

               <p>
                  <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his treatise of Philosophicall discipline, saith, That common-weales, honour and reuerence priests, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they pray vnto God, not for the welfare of themselues and their friends and acquaintance onely, but in common for all men; and yet the priests cause not the gods to doe vs good, but they onely call vpon them as dooers of good.</p>

he saw him come in his priestly ornaments and attire, he not only relented, but also stepped forth alone vnto him, with great honour and reuerence and worshipped God.

But this saying is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to that of <hi>Zosimus.</hi> For there is great difference between being of the colledge of the priests, and the taking of the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie or title of priesthood in way of honour; and betweene dealing with the ceremonies themselues, as the priests of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> and <hi>Quirinus,</hi> whome they called <hi>Flamines,</hi> and the rest of the peculiar priests of the other gods did: for these later sort could not beare any office, or be magistrats. <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> had the high priesthood for honours sake, and chiefly for profits sake: but yet for all that he intended not to the administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ceremonies, but contrariwise was continually occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied in the warres, and absent from the citie. Howbeit that <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Vespasian</hi> would needs expresly haue it,<note place="margin">It was not lawfull for the high priest of the Romans to shead mans blood.</note> to the intent hee might not kill any man, because it was not lawfull for their high priest to shead mans blood, no more than our church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men may now; which point the rest of the emperours that came after him obserued not. Therefore wheras the emperors tooke the priests stole vpon them, it was in way of honour, and not to doe the office in administring the ceremonies.
Among the Iewes, <hi>Aaron</hi> the high priest was of equall authoritie with <hi>Moses</hi>; and after the Iudges and Kings, the greatest dignitie belonged to the high priest. <hi rend="margQuotes">Among vs Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s also, the time hath bene, that men haue yeelded souereigne authoritie to the Pope, as to the Primat of the church; princes haue sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted themselues to him, and not only haue honoured him as the cheefe minister of our religion, but also haue receiued se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere

For it is not vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to beguile men to a good end, &amp; (as saith S. <hi>Paul</hi>) to apply a mans selfe to all sorts of men, to the intent to win them, as he himselfe did in Ierusalem, by the counsell of S. <hi>Iames,</hi> when he made his foure companions to be shauen, and purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himselfe with them in the temple, according to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of law, notwithstanding that he allowed not that cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie.

               <p>I know well that many princes haue made a vizor of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and pretetended to be deuout and religious, only to bring their people to a religion, without the which they could not hold their subiects in obedience to them. But the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that they haue gotten therby, was, that they were euill and deceitfull.

moue laughter, and returne home with their taile betwixt their legs; but good and vertuous men are like those that hold on in running to the end of the race, and are crowned as victors for their labor. For in the end they be had in esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of all men. But as for the wicked and craftie sort, albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it that they conceale their vices for a time; yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding when they come to the end of their race, then they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare what they be.<note place="margin">A prince ought not to be an Hipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crit.</note> It is best therefore as well to God-ward as to man-ward, not to vse any counterfaiting, but to be vertuous in deed. And to attaine the more easily therunto, it behoueth him to doe as good and vertuous princes haue done, that is to wit, he must haue good and religious men about him; For with the good a man shalbe good, and with the wicked he shall be peruerted. He that is conuersant with the wise shalbe wise, (saith <hi>Salomon</hi>) but he that keepeth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with fooles, shall haue sorrow. The prince that hath such good men about him, is councelled and quickned vp by them to vertue and weldoing; and he is afraid to doe euil, when he seeth such neere about him. Besides that, he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaseth to himselfe a good reputation, which maketh all his attempts the more easie. For the people who iudge by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward apparance, are of opinion that their prince is good, when he entertaineth good and religious men ordinarily, and hath them ordinarily about him. Which thing the younger <hi>Denis</hi> could wel skill of, though he himselfe was neither religious, nor a vertuous prince. In his time men made account of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phists, but he himselfe made no reckoning of them at all. And yet for all that, because he would be the better thought of by their means, and win the fauor of the people who had such men in estimation; he had of them ordinarily with him. For it is better that a prince should be an hipocrit;<note place="margin">Time causeth a man to loue the honest things which he did but counterfait at the first.</note> than a despiser of good and vertuous things, because such maner of counterfaiting and countenancing of good things, doth se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly bring with it in time, an affection of louing them, and a willingnesse to accustome himselfe to them in earnest. The emperor <hi>Adrian</hi> had vertuous and wise men, and learned
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:6660:77"/>
Philosophers alwaies about his person, as well in time of peace as of warre, because the wise men taught to liue well, and the Philosophers to gouerne well. For (as <hi>Alexander Seuerus</hi> said) of trusting too much to a mans owne wit, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth commonly labour and losse,<note place="margin">Of taking councell commeth great fruit.</note> but of taking other mens aduise, followeth ordinarilie verie great fruit. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch that whensoeuer hee had any matter to set in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der concerning the common-weale, hee consulted of it aforehand with men of skill and experience, afore he did put it in execution, and such maner of men did alwaies follow him; among whom was one <hi>Vlpian</hi> a Lawier. Yea, and when he went a walking or a hunting, he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer bee without three or foure of the greatest personages and best experienced of his house, to the intent he would not be without counsell, if any matter of importance should come suddenly vpon him, and that the sight of such men neere about him, might keepe him from presuming to doe any vnhonourable fact.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Antigonus</hi> the second was woont to say when <hi>Zeno</hi> the Philosopher was dead, That he was bereft of the Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre and stage of his honourable deeds, because hee was woont to referre all his actions to the iudgement of that good man.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat which I haue spoken of Religion and Superstition is inough, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that it be too little, as in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the things themselues. Now remaineth the winding vp of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and to end this booke withall, I am to shew in few words, what it is that vpholdeth both the prince and his subiects in all honour and honestie,<note place="margin">Example in the prince himselfe ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to make the prince to be obayed.</note> especially in the case of Religion; namely the good Example which the prince giueth vnto his subiects. For it serueth him aboue all things in the world, to make him to be obayed, and therewithal accustometh him to the loue of all honest things, though at the beginning he had no such will, as I haue said afore. And it prouoketh the subiects to follow their princes example, whom they see to be giuen to all vertuous things, and chiefly when he is giuen to religion.<note place="margin">Take away religion, and ye take away obedience.</note> For a prince cannot raigne, if his subiects be without religion; considering that in taking away religion, ye take away obedience to the prince. Therefore to hold the people in religion, there is nothing like vnto Example. And as a certaine Poet saith; Lawes and proclamations haue not so great force to procure o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, as hath the life of the gouernour, because the people being subiect to alteration, doe chaunge with the prince.</p>
               <p>If the prince be deuout and religious, the people will be deuout also; if he be superstitious, they become super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious too; if he be giuen to vice, so will they be also; if he be good, they abide good likewise, because there is not
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:6660:78"/>
any thing that doth so much induce vs to doe well, as the innocencie and goodnesse of the prince or iudge, as saith <hi>Cassiodorus.</hi> For who will be afraid to doe wickedlie, when he seeth his lord doe as himselfe dooth? In vaine doth that prince foad himselfe with suretie of state, who is couetous, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious, and vniust. For men are then afraid to doe amisse, when they thinke that it displeaseth their iudge. And as <hi>Cicero</hi> saith in his third booke of Lawes, A prince doth not so much harme in the very sinning,<note place="margin">A prince doth not so much harme by his sin in it selfe, as by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample thereof vnto others.</note> (although it be a great harme in deed) as he doth in making others to follow the example of his vices. And we see commonly, that looke what alteration soeuer happens in the prince, the same ensueth also in his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. For the change of conuersation of life in great personages, is wont to worke a change in the maners of the people; for that they keepe not their vices alonly to themselues, but doe shead them out vpon their subiects, so as the hurt which they doe, is not only in that they corrupt themselues, but also in that they corrupt others, doing more euill by their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, than by their bare sinne. For as much therefore, as the well-aduised prince is as a cresset vpon a bushell or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vpon a high towre, to giue light to all parts; hee ought to shine among his subiects, and to excell them in all deeds of vertue and godlinesse. For (as saith <hi>Cicero</hi> in his Inuectiues) he is to applie himselfe not only to their minds, but also to their eies. And like as a small blemish in a mans face,<note place="margin">A small sinne seemeth great in a prince.</note> disgraceth him more than a great scarre in all the rest of his body; euen so a small fault sheweth it selfe great in a prince, whose life men behold in the open light. And as <hi>Saluian</hi> Bishop of Marsels saith, The offence is the greater, where there is the greater prerogatiue. That is the cause why <hi>Dauid</hi> was punished by the death of his sonne, after that God had taken away his sinne; namely as the text saith, For that he caused the enemies to blaspheme the name of the Lord. So great is an offence in a publike person. For he that doth euill without giuing cause of offence vnto others, damneth but himselfe: but he that giueth euill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:6660:79"/>
vnto others, and causeth mo for to sinne, must beare their penaltie, because he is the cause of their euill. <hi>Plato</hi> in his Lawes saith, That nothing doth more easily change laws, than the example of princes, so that a tyrant may in short time alter the lawes. For whether he intend to lead to ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue or to vice, he himselfe must first trace the way vnto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, by allowing the one, and disallowing the other, and by dispising such as obay him not. And therefore he said in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, That such as kings and gouernors are, such are their people; Wherein he agreeth with <hi>Ecclesiasticus,</hi> who saith, That such as the iudge of a people is, such are his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters; and such as the ruler of a citie is, such are his citizens. <hi>Varia Mesa</hi> writing to <hi>Heliogabalus,</hi> admonished him after this maner; To reforme others, it behooueth you first to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme your selfe; and to chastise others, you must first cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stise your selfe.<note place="margin">The prince is a mirror to all his subiects.</note> For euerie person be he of neuer so meane de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, doth commonly take example at that which he seeth done by his superiours, and especially by the prince, who is a looking-glasse to all his subiects. And in deed, we see how the Aegyptians gaue themselues to the Mathematicall sciences, because the most part of their kings loued those sciences. Because the kings of Asia gaue themselues to all delicacies, the people of that countrie were verie delicat and effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. Because <hi>Nero</hi> loued plaiers of enterludes, singing-men, and plaiers vpon instruments; there was not that Senator whose child studied not those arts. In the time of <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> his house was ful of wise and modest seruants. In the time of his sonne <hi>Commodus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Such as the prince is, such will bee his houshold, his court, and his kingdome.</note> the palace was full of naughty-packs, &amp; folk of lewd conuersation. And the said good empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> was wont to say, That such as the prince is, such will his houshold be; such as his houshold is, such will his court be; and such as his court is, such will his kingdome be. We see in France, how the people haue euermore follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their prince. King <hi>Francis</hi> loued learning, and his people gaue themselues wholy therevnto. He was sumptuous in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell, and much more they that came after him. At this day
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:6660:79"/>
there is not any thing omitted, for the well and rich attiring of folk, and for the delicate entertaining of them with all sorts of the choisest meats. <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleuenth, and the emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, went modestly apparelled, and mocked such as decked themselues in rich attire: and their subiects did the like. That example of theirs did more in their time, than all the statutes of apparell could do, that haue bin made since. And that good time co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued vnto the reigne of king <hi>Francis,</hi> who begun to tread out the way to the inordinate and exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue chargablenesse, which ouerwhelmeth vs at this day. The booke entituled the Courtier, maketh mention of a Spaniard that held his necke awry, as <hi>Alfons</hi> king of Aragon did, (who, setting that aside, was a prince of very good grace) of purpose to follow the kings fashion, and to counterfait him in all that he could. For this cause <hi>Plato</hi> in his Lawes will haue old men (who ought to giue example to yoong men) to behaue themselues discreetly when they be in the companie of yoong folke, and to take good heed that no young man see them doe,<note place="margin">There is not a better way to reforme o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, than to doe the same things which a man would say in that behalfe.</note> or heare them speake, any vnhonest thing. For the best counsell that can be giuen to yoong or old, is not to taunt or checke them, but to shew and expresse the same thing in a mans whole life, which he would haue said in chec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and blaming them. Which order <hi>Cicero</hi> following in his Duties, doth vtterly forbid an old man to giue himselfe to excesse, beause it bringeth double harme; first in that it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureth him shame; and secondly in that it maketh the loose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of yong folk more impudent. For yoong folks should be gouerned by the discretion of the old. And euen so is it between subiects and their princes. For if princes giue them not good example, it wil be hard to amend them afterward.

Wherefore there is nothing to be compared to open walking, without any maner of counterfaiting, and to the giuing of good example throughout, that a prince may be the better followed, and the more beloued and esteemed of his people.<note place="margin">Emperours that were war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors, beloued of their soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like towards them.</note> As for example, <hi>Piscennius Niger, Caracalla Maximine, Alexander Seuerus,</hi> and many other emperors that were warriors, did eate of the same bread that their soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers did; which thing made them beloued of all, and gaue example to euery man to doe as they did. For there is not a better exortation, nor a more effectual way to persuade, than when a prince doth the same things himselfe, which he would haue other men to doe. <hi>Agesilaus</hi> commaunded not his soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to doe any worke to the which he himselfe did not first set his hand And to giue example to yoong men to endure cold, hee was seene to goe all the winter without a cloake, therby to allure the yoong men to do the like, when they saw that their prince being old and readie to passe out of the world, was not afraid of the cold. <hi>Xenophon</hi> in his first booke of the Education of <hi>Cirus,</hi> bringeth in <hi>Cambises</hi> telling <hi>Cirus,</hi> that to be first at worke himselfe, serued greatly to win his souldiers therunto.

Whervpon his men seeing the noblenesse of his courage, cried out aloud vnto him, that he should hardily lead them on still, saying that their owne wearinesse and thirst was quite and cleane gone, and that they thought not themselues to be mortall any more, so long as they had such a king. The like befell to <hi>Cato</hi> of Vtica in Affrik, who being almost at the point to die for thirst, (as likewise all his armie was, being then in the middest of the sands of Lybia) when as the small quantitie of water which was in his host was all offered vnto him, not only refused it, but also spilt it on the ground, to the end that by his example, all the souldiers in his armie might learne to indure the thirst.</p>
               <p>Albeit that <hi>Dauid</hi> longed to drinke of the water of a certaine well, that was in the possession of his enemies, and three of his armie brought therof vnto him, with great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of their liues; yet would he not drinke therof when it was brought vnto him, but vowed it vnto God for the safety of the three that had gotten it for him. On a time, when <hi>Alfons</hi> king of Aragon and Sicilie, was in a place where he could get no victuals, and a souldier of his brought him a morsell of bread and cheese, he refused it, saying that it was no reason that hee should eat, seeing his whole armie had not to eat as well as he. <hi>Plutarch</hi> saith, That the thing that most aduanced <hi>Marius,</hi> was that he neuer refused the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitall of kindnesse, for any paine or daunger that hung thereon; nor also disdained any thing, were it neuer so little; but striued to out-goe euen the meanest souldiers in simplicitie of fare, and in sufferance of labor, whereby he got the good will of euerie man. For it is a great comfort to such as take pains, to haue company that willingly take pains with them; because that to their seeming, it after a sort taketh away their constraint and necessitie. And it is a thing that wonderfully pleaseth the souldier, when he seeth his captaine eating openly of the same bread that he himselfe eateth, or sleeping vpon some pelting pad of straw, or the first man that sets his hand to the worke, when a trench

For they make not so great account of the captains that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour them or reward them,<note place="margin">Souldiers set not so much by them that reward them, as by them that take pain with them as they doe.</note> as of the captaines that takes pains with them, and hazard themselues with them to the dangers of warre; yea, and there is this further, that they set more by those that take pains with them, than by those that suffer them to continue in idlenesse.</p>

                  <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> king of Persia, marching in the countrie of the Cadusians, went foremost on foot, bearing his trusse vpon his shoulder in a skarfe, and his target on his arme, and so trauel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ouer mountaines that were cragged and rough, insomuch that his souldiers seeing the courage of their king, &amp; the pains that he tooke, went so light on the ground, that they seemed to haue had wings.</p>
               <p>The emperor <hi>Iulian</hi> comming to a Marris, which he saw his enemies had drowned with water, to stop the passage of his armie, did put himselfe formost into the Marris, so that his armie being ashamed to refuse that which they saw the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror do, passed all through the Marris, marching in water vp to the knees. Great <hi>Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der</hi> perceiuing at the siege of Nysa, that his souldiers were loth to go to the assault, because of the deepnesse of the water, O wretch that I am (quoth he) which haue not learned to swim! and yet in the end hee passed the riuer, to giue example to his men. Himselfe also was the first that entered into the citie of the Malians, howbeit very vndiscreetly. Neuerthelesse his so doing made all the Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians to come in after him, to saue his life. <hi>Demetrius</hi> being afore the citie of Thebes, went foremost himselfe to the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, to giue example to his men of warre, that they should not spare themselues, nor be afraid to put themselues in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.

                  <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> hazarded himselfe freely to all perill, neuer forbearing to take pains; and therefore his souldiers loued and esteemed him. The marques of Piscaria, to prouoke his foot-men to passe the foord of Brents, did set himselfe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most

As for example, <hi>Macrinus</hi> who went but with a wand in his hand, when he made his musters, or when he visited his men of warre, was despised for it of his souldiers, who sayd that a prince ought not to enter into the senathouse with arms, nor come into an armie without them; because the senathouse was to deale with matters of peace, and the campe with matters of warre. Therefore was he of so small estimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that his men of war forsooke him, and in the end hee was vanquished by a woman.</p>
               <p>Likewise the very presence of a prince in battel,<note place="margin">Of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of a Prince.</note> is a kind of example. For it giueth courage to the souldiers, as I haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in the beginning of this booke, in speaking of the little child <hi>Europus</hi> king of Macedonie, whome they were faine to bring foorth to the souldiers in his cradle, and yet his presence gaue them such courage, that they vanquished their vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shers, and went away with the victorie, though they had bene ouercome afore.</p>
               <p>The Almaris at the iournie of Gwingate, were ignoraunt that the emperor <hi>Maximilian</hi> was comming to them: but as soone as they espied him all armed sauing his head, by and by taking his presence for a good foretoken of victorie, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to welcome him after this maner; God saue thee O em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, God preserue thee good father, God keepe thee O inuincible captaine; we haue alreadie woon the victorie, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that thou our head art here: and it came to passe as they had forespoken.</p>

your saying it should seeme, that the thing which hath bin wont to do most good in a battel, (namely the presence of the Generall) should doe most harme. I perceiue now that my men fight valiantly, and I will be the first at it, to shew that my presence is no impediment to your glorie and good fortune. When <hi>Perses</hi> the last king of Macedonie was to ioyne bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell with the Romanes, he withdrew himselfe out of the field, vnder colour to doe sacrifice to <hi>Hercules,</hi> who could not find in his heart to accept the offerings of a coward; and so he fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led not to lose the field. But the great captaines, as <hi>Pirrhus, Philip, Alexander, Antigonus, Traiane,</hi> and generally all the great princes,<note place="margin">Whether wars are to bee made by Lieutenants.</note> haue made warre by themselues, and not by their lieutenants. I graunt that some haue made warre luckily by their lieutenants, as <hi>Charles</hi> the fift king of France; and the emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, in the battell of Pauie: but yet there is none to the presence of the prince himselfe, when any goodly exploit is to be done. For as the French prouerbe saith, The sheepe serue to no purpose where the shepheard is away. But after his fortunate incounter at Pauie, the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Charles</hi> of whome I now speake, did neuer enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise any thing, whereat he himselfe was not present, as the voyage of Argier, the voiage of Goulette, the voiage of Prouince, the war in Germanie made in the dead of winter, when he himselfe was diseased with the gout, and ill at ease in his bodie;<note place="margin">The presence of the prince, seruerh great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the victorie.</note> the wars made many times in France, and especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the siege of Mets in the dead of winter.

                  <hi>Antigonus</hi> the second was purposed to giue battell vpon the sea to <hi>Ptolomie,</hi> his Pilot told him that his enemies had many more ships than he. And how many ships (quoth he) thinke you my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence may counteruaile? As who would say, it is a great sway to the victorie, when a valeant prince is present, which can skill how to gouerne. The Numantines had obtained many victories of the Romanes, vntill in the end <hi>Scipio</hi> was sent thither to haue the commaunding of the armie, whose arriual there made the chance of the warre to turne. For euer after
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:6660:82"/>
the Numantines went by the worst, neuerthelesse their cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains bad their souldiers that they should not be afraid, for the Romans were but the very same people, whom they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues had vanquished so oft afore. True it is indeed (said one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them) they be the same sheepe, but they haue another maner of shepheard. <hi>Antigonus</hi> hearing by some prisoners, that <hi>Eumenes</hi> was sicke, (as he was indeed) and therupon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecturing that he should with small adoe discomfit his armie in his absence, made all the hast he could to giue battell. But when he came so neere, that he might well and plainly descry the order &amp; behauior of his enemies, who were so well ranged in order of battell as possibly could be,<note place="margin">The presence of <hi>Eumenes</hi> causeth <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonus</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire.</note> he staied a long while altogether distroubled, and as it were astonished, in the which time he perceiued the horslitter of <hi>Eumenes</hi> passing from the one side of the battell to the other, and therewithall he began to say, Yon same (in mine opinion) is the litter that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vs war, and offereth vs battel. And with that word he caused the retreit to be sounded, and conueyed his men backe into his camp. <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> did put himselfe in great perill, by going to find his armie that was distressed by the Gauls, and by his only presence did rid them of the distresse, giuing them courage to fight; so greatly was his name redouted of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. <hi>Cabades</hi> king of Persia, seeing his men repulsed from the citie Damida, vvhich he had surprised and scaled, and hovv that many of them began to come dovvne the ladders, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the men of the citie made them to leape dovvne from aboue, stepped to the foote of a ladder vvith his svvord dravvne, and threatned to kill as many of them as came dovvne. And so the presence of the king caused many to mount vp the ladders againe, and many that had begun to giue ouer, fell so lustily to scaling againe, that in the end they tooke the citie. The prince of Wales, to giue courage to his men of vvarre, vvas personally at the castle of Remoren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, by vvhose presence the Englishmen gaue such a forcible assault, that they vvhich vvere vvithin vvere faine to yeeld themselues.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N old time, when by Gods suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance Oracles had place, the citie of Delphos was renowned through the whole world, for the prowd and state<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly temple there, which was dedicated and consecrated to <hi>Apollo,</hi> whereunto folke resorted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al parts of the world to aske counsell, and to heare the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers that were giuen by his image. At the enterance of this goodly Temple,<note place="margin">What it is to know ones selfe.</note> were written these words, KNOW THY SELFE. In the interpretation of which words, many haue erred, imagining that a man knows himselfe, when he can skill of the things that concerne his duetie or office, and his mysterie, trade of liuing, or profession; as when a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion can skill to launce a sore, or a Phisition to heale a disease, or a Shoomaker to make a Shoe. But none of all these is the knowing of a mans selfe. And though a man beheld all the parts of his bodie, yet knew he not himselfe the more for all that. For as <hi>Plato</hi> saith, He that knoweth his bodie, kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth that which is his, but he knoweth not himselfe. So that neither Phisition nor handicraftsman knoweth himselfe, but their knowledge is of things that are separated from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. Wherefore to speake properly, none of them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:6660:84"/>
to their art, can bee said to be wise. Likewise hee that hath a care of his owne body, mindeth that which is his, and not himselfe. And vvhosoeuer loueth a man, cannot bee dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to loue his bodie, but his soule. Therefore vvhen we say, a man must know himselfe: it is as much to say, as hee must haue a care of his soule, to prepare it to the knowing of God his maker, after whose image it is created, that hee may, as it were in a looking glasse behold the inuisible Godhead, the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient cause of wisedome, and of all good things; and that by the knowledge of the vertues which God hath giuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, he may consider how greatly he is indetted vnto God, and that he hath not any thing of himselfe, but that all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of God. And when he knoweth what he is, that is to wit a reasonable creature, then lifteth he vp his heart (as is soong in the church); that is to say, he lifteth vp his mind to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of his welfare.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">To know God, it behooueth a man to know himselfe.</note>Now then, to know God, it behooueth to haue the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our selues, that is to wit, of our inward man, which is framed of diuine essences, to the intent we despise not the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly vnderstanding and mind that was giuen to man in his creation, for want of knowing it aright, and for want of consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the vertue and power thereof; least through want of such vnderstanding thereof, in steed of being wise and wel ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised, and in steed of chusing the good way, wee follow the woorser, and (as <hi>Dauid</hi> saith) Become like the horse and mule, for not considering what God hath bestowed vpon man. Therefore it standeth vs on hand to consider from whence we be, and to what end we be created; that by beholding the excellencie which we haue receiued of God, we may submit our selues wholy vnto him, and to his wisedome; which inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vs thereunto, as is to bee seene in fiue hundred places of the booke of Wisdome. Those then which refer al their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the said first cause, we call Wise men, according to the writings both of the Bible, and also of the Heathen authors, specially of the great <hi>Mercurie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The first point of wisedome is to know ones selfe.</note> 
                  <hi>Plato,</hi> and <hi>Cicero,</hi> who affirme, That the first point of wisedome, is to know a mans selfe. And
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:6660:84"/>
by this knowledge a man shall perceiue wherat he ought to leuell himselfe, and so he shall foresee the impediments that may hinder &amp; annoy him. He then which hath not wisdome, cannot discerne what is his, or what is well or ill done; neither can we know what is ours, vnlesse we know our selues. And he that knoweth not what is his, is also ignorant what is another mans; and consequently he is ignorant what belongeth to the commonweale, and so shal he neuer be good housholder, or good common-weales man, because he knoweth not what he doth. By reason wherof, he shall walke on in error, wande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and mistaking his marke; so as he shall not atchieue any thing of value, or if he doe, yet shall he be but a wretch. For no man can be happie or gouerne happily, vnlesse he be good and wise, because it is only he that discerneth good from euill. Now if this saying may be verefied of al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, much more with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out comparison doth it agree to princes than to other men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they haue authoritie aboue all: and to execute authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie well, it behoueth to haue Discretion and Wisedome.

It is they therefore to whom the said goodly precept is chiefly appointed, to the end they should know the being and state of their soule, the force and power wherof consisteth in wisdome, whose ground is truth. For it is the propertie of wisdome to discerne the truth of all things, whereby the darknesse of ignorance is driuen out of our mind, and light is giuen vnto vs. In this respect <hi>Iacob</hi> hauing gotten wisdome by trauel, is said in Genesis to haue had the sight of God: because that to the actiue life, he had also ioyned the contemplatiue.

The wise man shal be replenished with blessednesse, and as many as see him shall commend him. And in the third chapter of <hi>Salomons</hi> Prouerbs, it is said; That the purchace of Wisdome is more worth, than all that euer a man can gaine by the trafficke of gold and siluer; and all that euer man can wish is not comparable vnto hir. For that very cause there was a writing in the foresaid temple of <hi>Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phos,</hi> which commaunded men to honor Wisdome and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, whom <hi>Hesiodus</hi> and <hi>Pindarus</hi> faigned to sit at <hi>Iupiters</hi> side.<note place="margin">Wisdome the mother of all good things.</note> Wherefore we may well say, That Wisdomes is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all good things, and the tree of life that was in the earthlie Paradise, as saith S. <hi>Austine</hi> in his thirteenth booke of the citie of God. And to shew the excellencie therof yet more, <hi>Ecclesiasticus</hi> saith, That Wisdome is a greater aid and strength to a wise man, than ten gouernors are to a country. And therefore in the 16 of the Prouerbs it is said, That Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie is in the lips of a king; which thing is meant of a wise king. After which maner he saith in another place, that the delight of a king is in a wise seruant; which is to be vnderstood of a good and wise king. For commonly els such men are not welcome to princes. But as <hi>Aesop</hi> saith, either a man must please a king, or els he must not come at him.</p>

                  <hi>Bion</hi> was wont to say, That Wisdome goeth before the other vertues,<note place="margin">Wisdome go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth before all other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</note> as the sight goeth before the other sences, and that without wisdome there is no vertue at all. For how were it possible for the iust man to yeeld vnto euery man that which belongs to him, if Wisdome had not taught him what is due to euery man? Therfore afore wee enter into the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:6660:85"/>
morall vertues, it is requisite by the way to speake a word of the contemplatiues; namely of Wisdome and Discreation: because that without contemplation ioyned with skill, a man can doe nothing that is beautifull and good. The Stoiks make no difference betweene these two vertues, sauing that Wisdome consisteth in the knowledge of things belonging both to God and man; and Discreetnesse consisteth only in things belonging to man. For both of them be contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue vertues, proceeding from the mind and vnderstanding. But yet one of them is meerely contemplatiue,<note place="margin">Of Wisdome.</note> that is to wit, Wisdome, which (after the opinion of antient Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers) is occupied but in contemplation of the heauen, the earth, and the stars, respecting nothing but such things as are euerlasting and vnchanged; and because they be not subiect to any alteration, man needeth not to scan of them. And as <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith in his sixt booke of Morals, It behooueth a wise man not only to vnderstand whatsoeuer may be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of principles, but also to vnderstand the principles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues truly,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his treatise of Morall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</note> and to speake truly of them. And as a Geometri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian scanneth not whether a triangle haue three angles made by the meeting and closing together of three right lines, but holdeth it for an vndoubted certaintie;<note place="margin">Wisdome is not subiect to doubting.</note> so the contemplatiue vnderstanding, doth not so much as dreame of any thing that admitteth any alteration; neither is it subiect to consulting and deliberating. But Discreetnesse, which is cumbered with things vntrue, erronious, and troublesome, and is to deale with casuall aduentures, is driuen to consult of things doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and after consultation to put it selfe in action.<note place="margin">All vertue consisteth in action.</note> For as <hi>Cicero</hi> saith, All vertue consisteth in action. Concerning the which, we will hold still the precept which he giueth vs in his books of Duties, where he saith,<note place="margin">A man must not vphold things vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, for knowne.</note> That whosoeuer will be wise, must eschew two vices, one is, he must not vphold things vnknown as known: and to eschew the falling into that vice, he must spend time and labour in considering things aforehand. For if a mans wit be not confirmed and fortified by reason,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the life of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moleon.</hi>
                  </note> he doth easily wauer, and is easily driuen from the discourse wheron
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:6660:86"/>
he was grounded at the first. Therefore it behooueth that the resolution whereto he sticketh be firme, and not subiect to alteration, least he doe things afore he haue well considered and tried the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and so it befal him as doth to liquerous persons, which oftentimes desire some meat with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But the choice that is grounded vpon sure knowledge and firme discourse of reason, dooth neuer alter, though the thing that was vndertaken come not to good end. The other vice wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>Cicero</hi> maketh mention, is, that some men set all their stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die vpon things difficult and needlesse, after the maner of the ouer-profound wisdome of men in old time, to the which wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome <hi>Socrates</hi> would in no wise giue himselfe. Therfore let vs omit that kind of wisdome, as wherof we haue not to treat here, and wherunto we cannot attaine. For the former Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers gaue themselues the title of Wise men; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, those that haue bin wiser than they, would not take that title vnto them. As <hi>Pithagoras,</hi> who said, He was but only a louer of wisdome. And <hi>Socrates,</hi> who confessed himselfe to know nothing. By reason wherof he was accounted the wisest man of his time. And neuer since was there any man so proud and presumptuous, as to take that title vpon him. As for vs that are Christians, we ought to reiect it vtterly, because the name of wisdome is attributed to the sonne of God, and that God only is wise: so that we agree with the philosophers, That wisdome consisteth rather in heauenly things, and in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine contemplation,<note place="margin">Of Discreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</note> than in action. And therfore letting it alone, we will returne to the other contemplatiue vertue, which is called Discreetnesse, and (commonly) Wisdome al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so. But that is an vnpropper kind of speaking, whether we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the tearme to matter of vnderstanding, or to matter of art. As for example, when we say that <hi>Phidias</hi> was a wise in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauer, in so saying we intend to shew the vertue of the art, because wisdome is the perfectest of all skils. Which word
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:6660:86"/>
Wisdome, I shall be faine to vse sometimes, (because it is so vsed in our common speech) not for the wisdome that sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth things diuine, wonderfull and hard to attaine vnto, but for the vertue of deliberating, which we call Discreetnesse, wherewith we haue to deale in humane affaires. For as <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi> saith in his sixt booke of his Morals, No man consulteth of things that are vnpossible, and whose end is not the good that consisteth in action.<note place="margin">Discreetnesse is not gotten but by adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> But Discreetnesse which the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sort call wisdome, and consisteth chiefly in the choise of good from euil, is not goten but by aduised deliberation, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>through we refuse the euill and chuse the good. Which thing cannot be done by a foole, or by a harebraind person. For as <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> saith in his Prouerbs, The foole hath no delight in Discreetnesse, but in the imaginations of his owne heart. <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> the Iew expounding the first chapter of <hi>Moses,</hi> saith, That by the knowledge of good and euill, Discreation is to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, which discerneth and deemeth as a iudge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene one thing and another.<note place="margin">The definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetnesse.</note> Therefore let vs come to the definition of Discreetnesse, the which <hi>Cicero</hi> in his Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miks calleth the Art of liuing, and which we may say to be the way and path that leadeth to the morall vertues. <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> saith, that Discreetnesse is an habit matched with the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reason that is peculiar to action, and discourseth what is good or euil. And in another place he saith, That it is the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the reasonable part, which prepareth the things that pertain to happinesse, meaning the happinesse that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sisteth in the good estate of the soule, and not in the outward euent of things. For the well doing of things is the end of our actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; of our taking of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in hand. And therfore a good housholder, whom we call a good husband, &amp; a good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-weale man, whom we call also a man that hath good skill in matters of state; (of whom the one hath an eye to the things that are good for himselfe,<note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet man, and a wel-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised man.</note> and the other to the things that are good for the common-weale) are esteemed wise and discreet, when they performe their charge well. There is yet another difference betweene a discreet man, and a wel-aduised man.
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:6660:87"/>
For the man which aimeth at some certaine point, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployeth all his naturall wits to reach therunto, if it be for an euill end, is neuerthelesse accounted wel-aduised, wheras (to say more truly) he is subtle and wilie; and if it be for a good end and in a vertuous matter, he is counted wise and discreet. For as <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith in his Morals, It is vnpossible for an euill man to be wise.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cicero</hi> in his Duties.</note> But he that in all thing seeth cleerely what is true, and can by good iudgement and sharpenesse of wit conceiue the reason therof; that man is reputed wise, and therfore men seeke vnto him in all their affaires. And as in sailing (saith <hi>Socrates</hi>) men beleeue the Pilot of the ship; so ought we to beleeue the wisest in al the actions of our life. For the Pilot guideth the ship by his discretion; and as <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> saith in his Iliads, One Wagoner outgoeth another by his aduisement.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cicero</hi> in his <hi>Cato.</hi>
                  </note> It is not by the strength and lightsomnesse of body: but by discreation and well-aduisednesse, that men doe great things. And as <hi>Horace</hi> saith in his Odes, Force without discretion ouerthroweth it selfe. For wisdome is better than strength, saith <hi>Ecclesiasticus.</hi> And <hi>Salomon</hi> saith in his Prouerbs, that the wise man hath great strength; for by discretion is warre made, and by good counsell is victorie obtained. <hi>Phocili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> saith: that a wise man is more worth than a strong man. And <hi>Euripides</hi> saith, That wise counsell is able to vanquish great hosts. And therefore at Lacedemon the captaine that had compassed his matters by policie, did sacrifice to their gods with an Oxe;<note place="margin">The Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonians made more account of an exploit done by poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, than of an exploit done by force of arms.</note> and he that had compassed them by force, sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed a cocke. For although they were a warlike people, yet they deemed that exploit to be greater and more beseeming a man, that was atchieued by good aduisement, skill, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, than that which was executed by valeantnesse and force of arms. And as <hi>Alamander</hi> the Sarzin said, Those that are of most skill in warre, how strong soeuer they be besides, had le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to intrap their enemies by sleights and policies, than to encounter them valiantly at the swords point. And <hi>Blondus</hi> in his triumph at Rome saith, That the chiefe of an armie should fight by discretion and policie, rather than by bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:6660:87"/>
and valiancie, because there is no comparison betweene wisdome and strength of bodie. For he that thinks there is no good to be done but by hand-strokes, is so farre off from being valiant, that he is rather to be esteemed rash, hare-braind, and furious.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cicero</hi> in his booke of inuention saith, That there are of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetnesse three parts, Memorie, Skill, and Fore-cast, Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, whereby things past are called to mind againe; Skill, which knoweth and vieweth things present; and Fore-cast, which considereth what may happen afore it come. Others doe set downe eight parts of discreetnesse; to wit, Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, Fore-cast, Skil, Reason, Quickenesse of wit, Teacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse, Experience, and Warinesse. I count him a discreet man that is sufficient to gouerne others. For the doing wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of foure things are to be considered; first the good wherunto the discreet man leadeth others, wherein it behoueth him to haue remembrance and fore-cast. The maner of gouerning, for the which it behooueth him to bee a man of skill and reason. In his leading of other men he must haue cunning and liueli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of wit, and he must be teachable and easie to beleeue good counsell. And in respect of all those whome hee gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth he must be of good experience, and wel-aduised, that he may refuse the euill and chuse the good.<note place="margin">VVilfull igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</note> The contrarie to discreetnesse, is vndiscreetnesse or wilfull ignorance, when a man neither knoweth nor will learne to know any thing, (which is the thing that most troubleth the life of man;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cicero</hi> in his booke of Lawes.</note> and as <hi>Plato</hi> saith in his Lawes, That man is ignorant which musli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the good, and loueth that which is noughtworth.) And when the will is bent against skil and reason, which naturally beareth chiefe sway.</p>
               <p>Discreetnesse then is a vertue of the mind proceeding from a good vnderstanding and iudgement, which is encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by knowledge and experience, and consisteth in the loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king into things, to the end that men may find them easie and readie to be delt with, afore they goe in hand with them, foreseeing what may or should ensue by things already past.

By wisdome men dispose of things present, &amp; foresee things to come.

And albeit that wisdome be a gift of God, and come of a well disposed mind, and of a good vnderstanding, yea and of a body that is well tempered, as witnesseth <hi>Galen</hi> in his first booke of Temperatures, where he sayth, That the first action of a man of good temperature,<note place="margin">The first actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a man of good tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature, is Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion.</note> is Discretion; yet is it gotten by learning and discipline. For the true desire of discipline is the beginning of wisdome. Also it is gotten by long experience and knowledge of things past, and by continuall exercise in dealing, with sundrie affairs. For as <hi>Afranius</hi> sayd (by report of <hi>Aulus Gellius</hi>) Wisedome is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten by vse, and conceiued by memorie; meaning thereby, that it consisteth in bookes, which put vs in remembrance of things past, and in experience which is the vse and practise of wisedome. In so much that neither he that hath but only lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, nor he that hath but only experience, is able to attain vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to wisdome: but he that will deale perticularly and vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally in all affairs, must haue them both, as well the one as the other. And as <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith, there are three things needfull to the obtainment of Wisdome, namely, Nature, Learning, and Exercise. For it is in vaine to striue against Nature, Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning must be had at learned mens hands, and Exercise is the perfection of learning. And therefore it will not be amisse to treat of Learning and Experience.</p>

In which respect, <hi>Demetrius Phala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reus</hi> counselled <hi>Ptolomie</hi> king of Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, to make diligent search for such bookes as treated of kingdoms, and declared the qualities that are requisit for the well and due executing of the office of a king. And <hi>Alexander Seuerus</hi> neuer sat in counsell vpon any case of importance, or vpon any matter of state and war, but he called such to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell as bare the name to be well seene in histories. <hi>Bias</hi> would not haue any man chosen a gouernour in his common-wealth, but such as were of skill;<note place="margin">The want of skil is cause of great mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe.</note> saieng that the want of skill is the cause of great inconueniences. <hi>Philip</hi> commaunded <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> to obey <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and to be a good student: to the intent (quoth he) that ye do not many things whereof ye shal repent you afterward. <hi>Adrian</hi> as well in peace as in warre, had of the skilfullest Philosophers alwaies about his person; and among others, he had two great lawyers, <hi>Saluius</hi> and <hi>Neratius. Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarke</hi> in the life of <hi>Coriolan</hi> sayth, that the greatest fruit that men reape of the knowledge of good learning, is that therby they tame and meeken their nature, that afore was wild and f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When one asked <hi>Alfons</hi> king of Arragon, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he did so greatly loue learning? Because (qd. he) by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding I haue learned war and the law of arms: acknowledging
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:6660:90"/>
therein, that no wit be it neuer so good, can fashion it selfe wel and become worthie of the charge which it shall vndertake, without learning and doctrine. Like as the fattest ground in the world can beare no corne except it be well tilled: so na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it selfe draweth and prouoketh vs, by giuing vs a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of knowledge and skill, as <hi>Cicero</hi> saith in his books of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; but Ignorance (which wee find fault with, as with the thing that darkeneth and defaceth mans vnderstanding) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be done away, but by learning. My meaning is not to make a prince perfectly skilful in all sciences, but only in that kind of learning which concerneth histories, and precepts of good life, according to the counsell of <hi>Demetrius</hi> and <hi>Isocrates,</hi> who said, that the wisdome which is proper to kings,<note place="margin">The wisedome of a king con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth in lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.</note> consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth in Learning and Experience; of which two, Learning teacheth the way to doe well, and Experience teacheth the meane how to vse Learning well. And albeit that <hi>Traian,</hi> (who was one of the best princes of the world) gaue not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to learning for any commendation therof that <hi>Plutarke</hi> made vnto him; saieng that the gods immortall had not made him to turne ouer the leaues of bookes, but to deale with martiall affairs: yet was he not an vnskilfull person, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther misliked he of learned men, but had Philosophers, Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, and other men of good learning and knowledge neere a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him. And notwithstanding that he was well aduised and discreet, yet in doing many things vpon his owne head, he fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led not to doe some whereof he repented afterward, because the benefit of nature was not sufficiently kiltred by learning, which is the thing wherein princes faile. For if they bee not taught by the dumb scholemaisters, that is to say, by bookes, they will hardly be taught by the liuely voice; because the schoolemaister is afraid and dareth not compell them, but let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them doe what they list at their own discretion, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they cannot learne so well as others that are vnder cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. But the booke although it doe not speake, vttereth what it listeth, without either feare or blushing, and giueth such warnings vnto Princes, as their tutors durst not doe.
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:6660:91"/>
Therefore all their recourse ought to be vnto bookes, as well to vnderstand the truth, as to learne the historie, wherein they shall see a thousand policies of warre, infinit goodly sayings, a thousand inconueniences that haue lighted vpon euil princes, their grossenes, their lewdnesse, and their wickednesse. On the contrarie part, they shall take singular pleasure in reading the praises of good princes; they shall see their wisedome, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and good demeanor in matters both of peace and warre. How they defended themselues fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their enemies, how they wound themselues out of their hands, what they did to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine their states, and what got them their good reputation, and made them to prosper in all things. Which thing the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leantest captains could well skill to put in practise; who not only haue helped themselues by learning in the managing of their affairs, as <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Lucullus</hi> (who had small experience of warre) <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> and infinit other great captains: but also haue set downe to themselues as it were in a looking-glasse, some such personages as they haue liked to follow. As for example, <hi>Alexander</hi> setting <hi>Achilles</hi> before him for his patterne, neuer slept without the Iliads of <hi>Homer</hi> vnder his pillow. The paterne of <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> was <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi>; and <hi>Cirus</hi> was the pattern of <hi>Scipio,</hi> who neuer went without a <hi>Xenophon</hi>: no more did <hi>Alfons</hi> king of Arragon go without the Commentaries of <hi>Caesar</hi>; nor the emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, without the Remembrances of <hi>Philip</hi> of Comines.</p>
               <p>After whose example, all noble-minded princes, ought first to haue the histories of the holy Bible, and (besides them) of the Heathen histories, the liues of <hi>Traian, Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie</hi> the Meeke, <hi>Alexander</hi> the Stern, &amp; such others, by whom they shal learne to order their life aright. And to allure them the more vnto learning,<note place="margin">The praise of Learning.</note> I will alleage the saying of <hi>Salomon,</hi> in the xx chapter of his Prouerbs, There is much gold and store of pearles, but bookes of knowledge are the precious iewels.

For by skill are vvarres made, and vvhere many be that can giue councell, there is victorie. <hi>Cicero</hi> in his oration for <hi>Archias</hi> saith, That learning is the teacher of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, a delighter and refresher of vs vvhen vve be at home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone in our ovvne houses, and a companion that cumbereth vs not vvhen vve goe abroad. It trauelleth vvith vs, it sleepeth vvith vs, it is an ornament vnto vs in prosperitie, and a helpe in aduersitie.</p>
               <p>Many being in prison, many being in captiuitie to their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, many being in banishment, haue borne their misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune vvell by means of learning. <hi>Diogenes</hi> was wont to say, That learning made yong men sober, comforted old men, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched poore men, and made rich men glorious, because lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning restraineth the slippernesse of youth, and supplieth the defects of old age. <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith, that the eies receiue light from the aire about them,<note place="margin">The mind re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth light from lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</note> and the mind from the liberall sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences; and that learning serueth for an ornament in prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and for a refuge in aduersitie. <hi>Aristippus</hi> was wont to say, There is as great difference betweene the learned and vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as is betweene the liuing and the dead. Send them both (quoth he) into a strange countrie, and you shall see what dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference there is. The which appeared well in <hi>Dennis,</hi> who of the king of Sicilie, became a schoolemaster at Corinth, and might haue starued for hunger, had it not bin for his learning. The foresaid Philosopher <hi>Aristippus</hi> was wont to say, That it was better to be a beggar than to be vnlearned; because the beggar hath no need but of mony, but the vnlearned hath need of humanitie; as who would say, that he which wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted knowledge was no man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Socrates</hi> was wont to say,<note place="margin">For the life of man lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is better than riches.</note> That for war, iron was better than gold; and that for the life of man, learning was better than ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. At such time as <hi>Paulus Emileus</hi> was for to encounter with <hi>Perseus</hi> the last king of Macedonie, &amp; that his armie was sore dismaid at the eclips of the moon which then happened; <hi>Sulpicius Gallus</hi> incouraged them by his learning, in that hee
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:6660:92"/>
assured them of victorie by his knowledge in the Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall sciences. By the like knowledge <hi>Archimedes</hi> defended the citie of Syracuse from the force of <hi>Marcellus.</hi> In this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of learning, I will not omit Eloquence,<note place="margin">Of Eloquence</note> which the men of old time termed the Queene of men, as one which euen by force drue vnto her the affections of as many as shee spake vnto. <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the life of <hi>Pericles,</hi> saith that Eloquence is an Art that weeldeth mens minds at her pleasure, and that her cheefe cunning is, to know well how to mooue mens passions and affections to her lure, which are as you would say the Tunes and sounds of the soule, which is willing to be touched by the hand of a good musician. And albeit that a good natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall disposition be very requisit to haue the toung at comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, yet will nature doe but small seruice, if it be not poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed by learning. On the contrary part, the man that is rude of speech by nature, may become eloquent and well spoken, in amending his euill disposition by learning. I meane not that he shal becom as good as <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> but that he may be able to make some breefe oration to the people, or to men of war, that shall be of force to persuade them, as the braue captains of old times did. <hi>Nestor</hi> is commended of <hi>Homer,</hi> not only for his good skill and counsell, but also for his Eloquence, saying that the words issued from his lips as sweet as honie. Notwithstanding that <hi>Pirrhus</hi> was one of the best captains of the world,<note place="margin">

Anon after the expulsing of the kings out of Rome, there fel such debate between the senators and the common-people, that the citie was like to haue gone to vtter ruine by it. But <hi>Agrippa</hi> pacified the whole matter by his eloquence, and brought the people backe to obedience, when they had alreadie banded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in companies. <hi>Pisistratus</hi> handled the Athenians so cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly with the finesse of his toung, that he made himself king of Athens. Such as were sent by <hi>Cinna</hi> to haue slaine <hi>Antonie</hi> the Orator, were so surprised with his eloquence, that when they heard him speake, they had no mind at all to kill him.
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:6660:92" rendition="simple:additions"/>
The eloquence of <hi>Cicero</hi> caused the disanulling of the law for the diuiding of lands, whereof the people of Rome had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued so great liking, and which had bene so often propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; in so much that when they had heard him speake, they vtterly abolished it for euer: whereof <hi>Plinie</hi> maketh a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. The like grace of speech enforced <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don <hi>Ligarius,</hi> whome he was resolutly determined to haue put to death.</p>
               <p>To be short, it is a thing of so great power, that a prince who hath many vnder his charge, can in no wise forbeare it. And if he fortune not to be eloquent inough of himselfe, it would behoue him to haue some good orator about him, as <hi>Moses</hi> tooke <hi>Aaron</hi> to persuade the people, and to preach vnto them, because he found himselfe vnfit for that purpose. For it is to no purpose for a man to haue goodly conceits, vnlesse he put them forth.<note place="margin">A man cannot vtter the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is of such force that it maketh the things to be beleeued that were incredible, and smootheth things that were vnpolished. And as the mind is the beautie of a man, so is Eloquence the beautifier of the mind. The same author in the second booke of the Nature of gods saith thus, A beautiful and diuine thing soothly is Eloquence, for it maketh vs to learne the things we know not and to teach the things we know; by it we persuade and comfort the sorrowfull, by it we encourage them that bee dismaied, by it we strike them dead that are too lustie, by it we pacifie the angrie, and kill folks lusts: that is it that hath drawne vs into fellowship, into societie, into cities, to liue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to equitie and law.</p>

For it is well known,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cicero</hi> in his Duties.</note> that neither Phisitions nor Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals of war, (be they neuer so well instructed with precepts) can well discharge their duties without experience.

And for that cause he preferred <hi>Antonie</hi> to the Empire before <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> as making more account of <hi>Antonies</hi> experience, than of <hi>Marks</hi> lerning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Agamemnon</hi> desired not so much to haue learned and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent men of his counsell, as to haue such as <hi>Nestor</hi> was, that is to say, men of great experience. <hi>Plutarke</hi> saieth that the wise and valeant captaine <hi>Philopemen,</hi> presuming that his skill which he had in ordering a battel vpon the land, would also serue him alike vpon the sea, learned to his cost, what sway experience beareth in matters of chiualrie, and how great aduantage they haue in all things which are well experienced. The skill how to gard and defend a mans selfe, is not learned (saieth <hi>Thucidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi>) by talking, but accustoming himselfe to pains-taking and to handling of his weapon. One asked <hi>Zeuxidamus,</hi> why the Lacedemonians had no lawes written: because (quoth he) they should rather enure themselues to the doing of noble and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable things, than to read of them. <hi>Panthoidas</hi> said the same to the Anthenians, that asked him what he thought of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers, which had disputed before him; assuring them that they had spoken goodly things, but to themselues vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; whereby he meant to doe the Athenians to vnderstand, that they had vertue in their mouths, but not in their deeds. The knowledge that is gotten,<note place="margin">Knowledge without Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise, is a body without a soule.</note> serueth to the ordering of mens affairs; but if it be without practise, it is like a body without a soule. Very vnwise therfore was he, which by his sophistrie would haue made <hi>Iphicrates</hi> beleeue, that the Philosopher is
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:6660:93"/>
the onely good captaine. And we may well say with <hi>Anaxip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus,</hi> that such discoursers doe shew themselues wise in words, but in effect are starke fooles.</p>
               <p>Now therefore we conclude with <hi>Aristotle,</hi> that such as will deale in matters of state, must aboue all things haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, and this experience is gotten by practise and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise, which is the perfecter of Learning. For we see that by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise a weake man becommeth strong, and doth better away with trauell, than he that being strong doth not vse exercise, as <hi>Socrates</hi> sayth in <hi>Xenophon.</hi> Againe, they that bee practised in all things, deeme truly of duties, and vnderstandeth what belongeth to euery man. And (as saith <hi>Musonius</hi>) Vertue is a science that consisteth not only in vnderstanding, but also in action. For euen as in Phisicke or Musicke it is not sufficient to be skilfull of the art,<note place="margin">The skill of gouerning, consisteth more in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise than in speculation.</note> but there must also be a practise of the actions that depend vpon the art and science: so in the science of Gouernment, a prince must be practised in that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth action, rather than in that which concerneth contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation.</p>
               <p>Can he thinke himselfe to be of good skil, which when he is to go in hand with his worke, findeth it cleane contrarie to his imagination? Surely (as <hi>Terence</hi> sayth) there was neuer yet any man so well aduised afore-hand in his determinations, whome age &amp; experience haue not crossed with some strange encounter, so as he hath found himselfe to seeke in the things wherein he thought himselfe most skilfull: and when he came to the execution, hath reiected that which he thought to bee best afore he began to go in hand with it. And that is allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically the very tree of the knowledge of good and euill, after the opinion of S. <hi>Austen</hi> in his thirteenth booke of the citie of God. For in matter of State,<note place="margin">It is dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of state, to take white for blacke.</note> it is very dangerous to take white for blacke, and to thinke a mans selfe to know that which hee knoweth not. Therefore it behooueth a prince to be a dealer in his owne affairs, and to exercise his mind at times in reading of bookes, without forgetting to exercise his body. He must so counterpeise his mind and his body, as the one be not exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:6660:94"/>
without the other. And yet it is not inough for a prince to exercise himselfe, except he doe also make his subiects to be exercised, which thing he shall easily doe, if hee make often wagers with rewards, for shooting in guns, for running, for iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, for fighting at the barriers, and so forth of other like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises, howbeit with least sumptuousnesse, and most profit.

To be short, hee gaue his people so much to doe, that they had no leisure to be idle, neither in time of peace, nor in time of warre. When his men of warre were most in peace, then did hee most exercise them in feats of warre, saying that for his so doing, strangers would stand in feare of him, when they saw him continually accompanied with men of experience in chiualrie. Hee made daily new tournies and iousts to exercise his men of arms, hee made forts, combats of ten to ten, runnings, wrestlings, and such other exercises: saying co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly, That it was no faire or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable sight, to see a man either without a booke in his hand to learne wisdome, or without a weapon in his fist to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend himselfe against fooles and ignorant persons.</p>

If we intend to speake of Temperance, we shall find that it is vnited vnto righteousnesse, and that the Intemperate person which is subiect to his passions, cannot doe any thing aright, so long as he is intangled in that vice, as we read of <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Achab,</hi> who leauing right and righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, caused <hi>Vrias</hi> and <hi>Naboth</hi> to be put to death; and so did infinit others, whome I omit for breifnesse sake.

mercie, and the seruice which we yeeld vnto God. Now then,<note place="margin">Definitions of Righteousnes.</note> Righteousnesse (according to <hi>Aristotle</hi>) is a vertue of the mind, which yeeldeth vnto euery man according to his deserts. Or else it is a certaine hauiour of the mind, which obserueth vprightnesse, and giueth to euery man that which to him belongeth. Or else, it is an affection of the mind which maketh vs apt to doe rightfull deeds, wherethrough we doe and be desirous to doe, that which is good and honest. For they that doe righteously by compulsion of law, cannot bee esteemed righteous therefore. The lawiers define Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes, to be a constant and continual purpose, of yeelding vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to euery man that which belongeth vnto him. <hi>Cicero</hi> saith it is an endowment of mind, which disposeth a man vnto eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one according to his degree; so keeping and maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning euery mans profit in peculiar, as may best stand with the conseruation of the whole.

                  <note place="margin">Righteousnes sinneth not.</note> Righteousnesse is nothing else but the eschewing of sinne, and the eschewing of sinne is the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the commaundements of Gods law. And therefore

                  <hi>Ecclesiasticus</hi> saith thus, Turne away from thine vnrighteous deeds, and turne againe vnto the Lord. And in the Prouerbs, Righteousnesse (saith <hi>Salomon</hi>) exalteth a whole nation, but sinne is a reproch vnto people. And in the fourteenth Psalme it is sayd, Thou hatest Vnrighteousnesse.</p>
               <p>Now then, Righteousnesse is the vertue of the soule, and Vnrighteousnesse is the vice therof, &amp; the procurer of death, And (as <hi>Philo</hi> saith) Vnrighteousnesse is the linage and off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring of vice.

And like as a man is esteemed to be in health when his body is altogether disposed according to the order of nature; and contrariwise to be out of health, when the parts of his body be infected, and all goes contrarie to the order of nature: euen so to doe righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously, is nothing else but to keepe the parts of the soule in such order, as they may both commaund and obey, according to the true rule of Nature. The same author saith in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoras, That righteousnesse and holinesse are both one,<note place="margin">Righteousnes and holinesse are both one.</note> or at least wise they be vertues very like one another. In so much that, such as righteousnesse is, such also is holinesse; and such as holinesse is, such also is righteousnesse.

<pb n="175" facs="tcp:6660:96"/>
in respect of reuenge, &amp; hath also ben put in practise by diuers heathen men. The second is, that we vse co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon things as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and priuat things as priuat. But according to christianitie, Righteousnes consisteth in two precepts, wherof the first is, to loue God; and the second is to loue our neighbor: and on that dependeth al that is written in the law &amp; the Prophets. In the first consisteth the diuine and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>templatiue righteousnes, and in the latter consisteth the distributiue righteousnesse. For it is not inough for a man to honour God, to feare him, and to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine from euill, except he also doe good and be helpefull to his neighbour: and by the word Neighbor, I meane all men, specialy those that are good.<note place="margin">The righteous stranger is to be preferred before the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous kinsman.</note> For, as saith <hi>Pithagoras,</hi> we ought to esteeme more of a righteous stranger, than of a kinsman or countriman that is vnhonest. Which thing our Lord hath told vs more expresly, in saieng, He that doth the will of God, is my kinsman, my brother, and my mother. And also in another place by the parable of the Samaritan, that had shewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to be the wounded Iewes neighbor in very deed, by set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him vpon his horse, and by hauing a speciall care of him, wherein he, and not the priests and Pharisies that made none account of the wounded man, had done the dutie of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse. Wherby it appeareth, the righteous man takes pains rather for other men than for himselfe, and had leuer to forgo some part of his owne goods, than to diminish another mans. Now therefore, when men instruct the ignorant, releeue the poore, yeeld to their neighbors that which belongs vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by helping them with thing at their need; when the great personages oppres not their inferiors, nor the king his subiects, then may it be said that righteousnes raigneth in that cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trie. And if euery man would liue after manner, there should need neither law nor magistrat. For as saith <hi>Menander,</hi> Their owne manners should be as lawes. But for as much as few men doe giue themselues to righteousnesse, there must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie be laws and magistrats to enforce such vnto righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, as will not be righteous for loue: and to that end are kings and rulers ordained of God. For (as saint <hi>Paule</hi> sayth)
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:6660:97"/>
the king is Gods lieutenant on earth, the maintainer of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes, and as it were his chancelor: so as they which require iustice at his hand, resort not vnto him as to a man, but as to the very righteousnes it self, wherof he is the dealer forth, through the wil of God, according to this saieng of <hi>Salomo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> in the booke of Wisdome, By me kings reigne, and counsellors determine right; By me princes rule, and all lords iudge their lands. Not without cause therefore, did <hi>Homer</hi> call kings the disciples of <hi>Iupiter</hi>; as who would say, they learned of God to do iustice. <hi>Dauid</hi> vseth termes yet of more force, and calleth them, Gods which doe iustice; honoring them with the name of their charge, which is of God. And <hi>Philo</hi> calleth them Gods lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants and vicegerents, in cases concerning iustice. And in the 6 chapter of the booke of Wisdome, Vnto you kings do I speake (saith <hi>Salomon</hi>) harken vnto me ye gouernors of people, and you that glorie in the multitude of natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. For your autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie is giuen you of the Lord, and your power co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth from the highest, who wil examin your works, and diligently search your thoughts: because you being ministers of his kingdome, haue not iudged vprightly, nor kept the law of righteousnes. Therefore will he appeare vnto you with terror, and that right soone. For a very sore iudgement shall be executed vpon them that haue ben in authoritie. And in <hi>Ieremie</hi> he sweareth that if princes execute not iustice, their houses shalbe left de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solate. Wherewith agreeth that which S. <hi>Remy</hi> said vnto king <hi>Clowis,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Kingdoms shal continue so long as Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes reigneth in them.</note> namely that the kingdome of France should continue so long as iustice raigned there. Also <hi>Totilas</hi> king of the Goths said, that all kingdomes and empires were easily destroied, if they were not maintained by iustice; and that as long as the Goths delt iustly, their power was had in good reputation; but when they fell once to couetousnes, and to taking more than they ought to haue done, by and by they came to decay through their owne discord among themselues. A prince is called a liuing law on earth because that lawes speake not,<note place="margin">A Prince is a liuing law.</note> ne moue not; but a prince is as a liuely law, which speaketh and moueth from place to place, putting the law in execution, and
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:6660:97"/>
appointing euery man what he should doe; and thereof it commeth that we be said to doe men right. Seeing then that a prince is the law, it followeth that he must be iust, and do iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice to his subiects; in doing wherof the world receiueth ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great good. And as <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith in his mattets of state, the iustice of the prince that raigneth, is more profitable to his subiects than riches are. S. <hi>Ciprian</hi> in his treatise of twelue abuses, saith, that the iustice of a king is the peace of his people, the safegard of innocents, the defence of his country, the foy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon of his hand, the reliefe of the poore, and the hope of bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednesse to come to himselfe. <hi>Salomon</hi> in the 20 of his prouerbs saith, That a king sitting on his iudgement seat, disperseth all iniquitie with his looke. Hereby is nothing els meant, but that he driueth away all naughtinesse by his only shewing of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to his people, &amp; by bearing a good countenance. Howbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it, the meaneth it of a good prince, &amp; such a one as is an execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of iustice, for such a one maketh the wicked to quake euen with his only look; &amp; although this vertue ought to be chiefly and principally appropried to princes, because kingdomes without iustice are but maintena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of mischiefe, according to S. <hi>Austines</hi> saying in his ninth booke of the citie of God,<note place="margin">Iustice is needfull for all sorts of men.</note> yet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notwithstanding it faileth not to be behooffull for all sorts of men, yea euen for solitarie men (as saith <hi>Cicero</hi>) and for such as neuer goe abroad, as well as for them that buy and sell, bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine and couenant, which things cannot be done without vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightnesse, the force wherof is such, that euen they that liue of robbery and leaudnesse, cannot continue without it, in that it assureth the goods of the robbers vnto them. In ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties iustice procureth peace and equitie. For (as saith <hi>Dauid</hi>) Righteousnes and peace imbrace one another. In priuat hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses it maintaineth mutuall loue &amp; concord betweene the man and wife, good will of the seruants toward their master &amp; mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse, &amp; good vsage of the master towards his seruants. <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thias</hi> said,<note place="margin">Iustice ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a happie Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale.</note> that the Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>chmen became great, by being iust, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right and charitable.

enemies; whereas a man may reckon vp a great sort, that haue bin ouerthrowne by vniustice. Of iustice or righteousnes are two sorts, the one of the law, and the other of equalitie. That of the law, is the more vniuersal, as which comprehendeth al sorts of vertue, and is that which in our English toung we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly call <hi>Righteousnesse.</hi> For he that performeth the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements of the law, is Righteous because he doth al the vertuous things commaunded in Gods law, so as he is liberall, lowly, modest, kind-hearted, meeke, peaceable, and so forth. When I say that a man is righteous, I meane not that he is righteous before God, otherwise than by grace, and not by the law as S <hi>Paule</hi> teacheth vs in his epistles to the Romans and the Galathians, saieng, By the law shall no man be found righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous. For the blessed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ife consisteth in the forgiuenes of sinnes, as <hi>Dauid</hi> declareth in the one and thirtith Psalme. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what good so euer we doe, our Lord will haue vs to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count our selues vnprofitable seruants. The other sort of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes is of equalitie, and consisteth in dealing vprightly, and in yeelding euery man that which belongeth vnto him, the which in English we terme properly <hi>Vprightnes</hi> and Iust dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. And this kind of righteousnes is diuided againe into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two sorts,<note place="margin">A subdiuision of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</note> whereof the one concerneth distributing, and the other concerneth exchange. This which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sisteth in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of exchange, serueth to make equalitie where vnequalitie seemeth to be, and is occupied about buieng, selling, bartering, and bargaining betweene man and man. For we see that one man hath monie, that another man wanteth, who hath corne and wine: here doth this kind of righteousnes procure an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitie. For the monied man giuing his monie, receiueth corn for it, that he wanted; and the other giuing corne &amp; wine, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing more than he needed, receiueth monie, where of he had want. Therfore when lending, buieng, interco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moning, hiring, morgaging, &amp; such other things, proceed duly without fraud: then is a realme seene to prosper, because right reigneth there. The like wherof we see in our bodies, the eye by the sight of it, directeth our steps, but cannot go it selfe: the foot is able to
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:6660:98"/>
go, but it cannot see, so as it carrieth the eye, and the eye gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it. The hand wipeth the eye clean, and the eye directeth it; the feet beare vp the head, and the head ruleth them; and without that, the body could not continue. Euen so the body of a common-weale could not endure, if euery man should not succour one another by such interchange. The distributiue iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice which the king vseth toward his subiects, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sisteth chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in distributing honor and promotion vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, according to euery mans desert. Semblably in our bodies there reigneth a kind of iustice, as for example, we see how the heart giues life and mouing to al the members, at leastwise according to most philosophers, who hold opinion that the beginning of life and mouing is in the heart, and likewise that sence is in the braine. Wherefore it is requisit that as the heart for his excellencie, reigneth as king ouer all the other members, so he that is most excellent of al other men, should haue the prerogatiue to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund others, &amp; that if he bee borne to haue gouernment, he should make himselfe worthie of that charge. For as <hi>Cicero</hi> saith in his Duties, Those that at the first were chosen to bear rule, were such as the people had great good opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of. Others (of whom <hi>Francis Petrarch</hi> is one) diuide Righteousnes into 4 sorts,<note place="margin">Another di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision of Righteousnes</note> namely Diuine (which is sister to Wisdom) wherthrough we beleeue in God, and acknowledge him to be the creator of al things, without whom, we cannot do any thing.

doth otherwise, is esteemed an vnkind monster. For as saith <hi>Cassiodorus,</hi> Euen they that are ignorant of law, do neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse acknowledge reason and truth, because that so to doe, is not peculiar to man only, but also is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to the brute beasts, to whom nature hath giuen such inclination. For we see that all kinds of beasts do cherish their yong ones, wherto they be led and taught by nature, and therfore the lawyers call it the Law of nature. The Storke cherisheth his syre and his dam, when they be old, and therfore the acknowledging &amp; recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pencing of kindnesse with like kindnesse againe, is called in greeke <hi>Autipelargia,</hi> as ye would say, A Counterstorking. The brute beast knoweth him that feedeth him, and is mindful of him that doth him good: as appeareth by a certain lion, which could well skill to requite the pleasure that a slaue had done him, in taking a thorne out of his foot. For he fed the slaue a long time in the caue where he had hidden himselfe, &amp; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward when both of them were by chance taken and carried to Rome, and the slaue being condemned to death for rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing his master, was cast vnto the lions to be deuoured by them; this lion being there among the rest, &amp; knowing him, saued him and defended him from hurt, &amp; yet the time was past long afore, that the slaue had done him the said pleasure. Now then it is a naturall thing to do good to them that do vs good. The third kind of righteousnesse is that which we call ciuill, which consisteth in yeelding vnto euery man that which belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth vnto him, in gouerning cities and countries, in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon society, &amp; in such like things. The fourth is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Iudiciall, which belongeth to those that haue charge to iudge of controuersies betweene parties according to lawes. For the maintaining of these lattertwaine, it behoueth to haue magistrats: and therfore they belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g properly to princes, kings &amp; soueraign magistrats, &amp; may be reduced both into one, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering that iudges do but supply the roomes of their soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns. Also the law which serueth for the executing of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, in giuing vnto euery man that which is his right, is called of the lawyers, the Ciuil Law, and not the Iudiciall Law.</p>

Also I will omit the naturall Righteousnes, because it is common to all liuing creatures, but the ciuill and iudicial Righteousnes is peculiar to kings and gouernours of countries, and consisteth, first in well keeping the lawes of their countries, and in causing them to be well kept, secondly in taking good order in cases of controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie and strife between partie and partie, by themselues in their owne persons, or by chusing fit persons to doe iustice.

As touching the first point, which concerneth the maintaining of the written lawes, it is so necessarie,<note place="margin">The maiestie of a kingdom dependeth vpon lawes.</note> that it may well be said that the honor of a countrie dependeth therevpon, according to the wise answere of <hi>Pittacus,</hi> who being demaunded of <hi>Craesu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For the law is the stickler betweene right and vnright, punishing the bad, and defending the good, saith <hi>Cicero</hi> in his xij booke of Laws. And <hi>Plato</hi> saith in his common-weale,<note place="margin">The law ought to rule the magistrats.</note> that that common-weale goes vtterly to wrecke, where the law ouer-ruleth not the magistrats, but the magistrats ouer-rule the law. On the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie part, al goeth well where the law ouerruleth the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrats, and the magistrats are obedient to law. It belongeth to magistrats to keepe the lawes, and to beare in mind, that the lawes be committed to their custodie, saith <hi>Cicero</hi> in his books of duties. <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith in his matters of state, that they which would haue law to reigne in a citie or common-weale, would haue God to reigne there. <hi>Aliamenes</hi> being asked why he
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:6660:100"/>
would not receiue the presents of the Messenians, Because that if I should haue receiued them (quoth he) I could not haue had peace with the lawes. For to say truth, the lawes are as the pillers of a state, vpholding it as pillers vphold a house, so as the casting down of them, is the ouerthrow of the house. Wherefore men ought to take good heed how they breake lawes,<note place="margin">Lawes must not be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</note> which hold one another together like the links of a chaine. For by vndoing one, all the rest follow after. And euen so befalleth it in lawes, when men fal to dispensing with them. Not without good cause therefore did <hi>Adrian</hi> the emperour ordaine, that no man should bring vp any straunge custome in Rome. And as <hi>Plutarch</hi> reporteth in the life of <hi>Paulus Aemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> men forsake the keeping of the chiefe foundations of the state of a publick-weale, when they refuse the care of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent keeping of the ordinances thereof, be they neuer so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and small. And <hi>Plato</hi> in his common-weale, forbiddeth the chaunging of any thing, yea euen of so much as the plaies that young children are wont to vse; because the chaunging of them, changeth the manners of youth without feeling, and maketh folke to make no account of antient things, and to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet and esteeme of new things; a matter very dangerous to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny state. And anon after he saith againe in these expresse words, I tell you that all manner of alteration, except it be in euill things, is very dangerous, both in diet of the body, and in manners of the mind. And I see not but that the yoong folke which are permitted to haue other plaies, games and pastimes than haue bene accustomed aforetimes, will also differ in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauior from the youth of old times, and being come to such difference, they will also seeke a differing kind of life, and by that means desire new lawes, and set their minds vpon all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of innouations. <hi>Sauly</hi> king of Scythia did put <hi>Anacharsis</hi> to death, for offering sacrifice to <hi>Berecinthia,</hi> the mother of the gods, after the maner of the Greeks.

For he said that the obseruing of the rigor of iustice, in matters where friends were to bee tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, was but a cloke wherwith to couer such as lifted not to do their friends good.<note place="margin">The inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sueth of doing wrong.</note> And in very deed he acquitted <hi>Phebidas</hi> who had taken the suburbs of Thebes, and <hi>Sphodrias</hi> who we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t about to haue taken the hauen of Pyrey by stealth, at such time as they were at peace with the Athenians.

And yet euen then also, it ought to bee done so discreetly, as it may not seeme to be touched: accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly as the Lacedemonians did, who when they had lost a great battell, brake the law of <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> in not punishing them with a kind of infamie worse than death, that had fled from the field, because that if they should so haue punished them, they should haue had but few left to defend their countrie.

not breake it directly, but ordained that the offender should be stripped, and that his clothes should bee scourged with rods, in steed of his backe, and that his hat should be striken off in steed of the striking off his head. The Thebans were yet more rigorous, howbeit that in the end they dispensed with the law. For when <hi>Epaminondas</hi> had fortunately begun warres against the Lacedemonians, and saw that he could not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise bring them to end, because that by the law he was to giue ouer his charge, by reason that the time of his commission was expired: he so dealt with his fellow-commissioners, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the law, he made them presume to continue in office yet foure months longer; within which time the Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians were vtterly vanquished and ouerthrowne.

                  <note place="margin">In what cases lawes may be corrected.</note> That at the first making of lawes, there may be some things, which the magistrats that succeede afterward may well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend; vntill that by good aduisement and experience, they see what is best to be allowed. And in another place he saith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, it is not men, but fortune and the enterchange of things, that make lawes. For either nessessitie, or force and violence of war, subuert states and alter lawes; so likewise plagues, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pests, sicknesses, and inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities of many years continuance, do cause very great changes and alterations.

But when a law is once alowed by long experience and custome, it is not in any wife to be chaunged, but vpon extreame necessitie, which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all law.

But the politicall law is to be chaunged oftentimes, as we shall shew hereafter.

Moreouer they be of opinion, that valeantnesse and wisdome come rather of nature than of good will, persuading themselues, that the one is but a quicknes and finesse of wit, and the other but a certaine stout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of heart that commeth of nature; wheras eueryman may be iust, at leastwise if he will.<note place="margin">Two precepts for gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors.</note> Wherefore they that will gouern well (saith <hi>Cicero</hi>) must obserue two precepts of <hi>Platos:</hi> wherof the one is, to haue good regard of the welfare of their subiects, imploying all their deuises and doings to that end, and leauing their owne peculiar profit in respect of that: and the other is
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:6660:103"/>
to haue such a care of the whole body of the common-weale, that in defending any one part therof, the residue be not neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected. For like as a tutorship, so the charge of a kingdome, is to be administred to the benefit of those that are vnder the charge, and not of them that haue the charge. And they that are carefull of one part, and carelesse of another, doe bring se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, quarelling and discord into the kingdome or common-weale; which is the ruine of realmes and common-weales. Wherfore the dutie of a good king, is not only to doe no wrong to his subiects himselfe, but also to restrain others from doing them wrong, and to straine himselfe to the vttermost of his power, to do right either in his own person, or by his substituts, to such as seeke iustice at his hand. For the greatest good that can be done to any people, is to doe them right, and to punish such as doe them wrong. And in that case the king must be like vnto the law, which accepteth no person, ne punisheth for displeasure, but iudgeth according to right: euen so, princes must not suffer themselues to be caried away with fauor, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, or anger; but must minister iustice indifferently to al men.

emperour in many things, but his vertues were blemished and darkned with the vice of couetousnes. For he was so far in loue with mony, that he made great hoords of it, by taking great tributs of the Dacians, by sales of things, &amp; by other exactions. Vpon a time a certaine courtier sued earnestly vnto him, for the gift of an office of great value; pretending that he sought it for a brother of his.

For this cause God commanded <hi>Moses</hi> to take away euill from among the people; that is to say, to punish euill in particular persons, for feare least folke should pay the deerer for the folly, and that he should make the multitude to beare the punishment due to some particular person,<note place="margin">To let sin goe vnpunished, is a consenting vnto it.</note> because it is a kind of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting to the sin, when it is willingly permitted to goe vnpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished.

be mercifull,<note place="margin">It is no mercy to pardon the faults that are committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst other men.</note> and I deny it not. But this mercie consisteth in pardoning the offences that concern but the prince himselfe, and the partie that is hurt by them, and not any other mens that are done against the common-weale; as king <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth answered both Christianly and vertuously, vnto one that whetted him to be reuenged of a certain wrong that had bin done vnto him when he was duke of Orleans; It besemeth not a king of France (quoth he) to be auenged of iniuries done to a duke of Orleance.</p>
               <p>Infinitly was <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> commended for his clemency, and that of good right: For he did easily forgiue the offences that were committed against himselfe. And <hi>Antonine</hi> was woont to say, That there was not any thing which procured greater estimation to an emperour among strangers, than cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie did. And (as saith <hi>Statius</hi>) it is an honourable thing to giue life to him that craueth it.

               <p>Therupon it came that the Thebans, to shew what iustice is, did paint in their courts, the images of iudges without ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, and the images of princes without eyes: to shew that in Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment kings ought not to be surprised with any affection, nor iudges carried with any couetousnes.<note place="margin">Of iustice in cases of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion.</note> And although it be not lawfull for a Prince, to be iudge in his owne cause, for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoiding of all passions: yet is he not forfended, to punnish the wrong that is offred him in cases of treason and rebellion: but rather on the contrarie part, it is a point of iustice to punish re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, as procurers of trouble to the state. The emperor <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milian,</hi> espieng in a certaine vprore that was in his campe, how a souldier strake vp a drum without commaundement, of his captaine, slew him with his own hand, because the danger of his host being on a rore, required the remedie of speedie and present crueltie.</p>
               <p>Neuerthelesse such manner of dealing is to be done with great discretion; for sometimes things may happen to bee in such case, that dissimulation shall auaile more than punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as it did with <hi>Pompey</hi> after the death of <hi>Sertorius.</hi> For when <hi>Perpenna</hi> had sent him a cofer full of letters, of Romanes that had written to <hi>Sertorius,</hi> and had held on his side: hee would not looke vpon any of them, but cast them all into a fire,<note place="margin">The want of discretion in extinguishing one faction, may breed many m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In the citie of Athens there happened a conspiracie of certaine noble men against the state, who had determined

that if they could not compasse their purpose of themselues, they would cal in the Persians to their helpe. As these things were a brewing in the campe, and many mo besides were guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the conspiracie, <hi>Aristides</hi> feeling the sent thereof, stood in great feare by reason of the time. For the matter was of too great importance, to be passed ouer without care: and there was no lesse danger in ripping vp the matter to the quicke, for as much as he knew not how many might be found guiltie of the crime. Therefore of a very great number, he caused but only eight to be apprehended; and of those eight, two that were to be most deepely charged fled out of the campe, and the other six he set againe at libertie. Whereby he gaue occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to such as thought not themselues to bee discouered, to assure themselues of safetie and to repent them of their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked purpose: saieng that for iudgement they should haue bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, whereby they might iustifie themselues.</p>

For when they saw that <hi>Conradine</hi> was ouercome, and that there was no hope for them to obtaine pardon at the hands of <hi>Charles</hi> of Aniou, they fel to rebelling, and fortified themselues in diuers places.</p>
               <p>Likewise when people are to far inraged, it is no time to punnish, but rather to reconcile and appease. When the Parisians rebelled for the aids: to put them in feare, men began to throw some of the rebels into the water. But

in steed of dismaieng them, they burst out into greater furie than afore; in so much that the executioners were faine to giue ouer their punishment, for feare of increasing the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion, in steed of appeasing it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Agesilaus</hi> hauing discouered a very dangerous conspiracie, did put some of the traitors to death secretly without arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or indictment, contrarie to the lawes of Lacedemon.

For honour nourisheth the liberall arts and vertue. In which behalfe the emperor <hi>Adrian</hi> did so greatly excell, that he was both feared and loued of all his men of war; feared because he chastised them, and belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,

because he paid them well. Vpon a time one demaunded of <hi>Lisander,</hi> What maner of common-weale hee liked best? That (qd. he) wherein both the valeant and the cowards are rewarded according to their deserts; as who would say, that vertue is furthered by reward; and that men of no value are spurred vp to doe well, by the shame and reproch which they receiue by doing amisse, and in being despised. <hi>Ennius Priscus</hi> demaunded of <hi>Traian,</hi> What was the cause that hee was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter beloued of the people than his predecessors? Because (qd. he) that commonly I pardon such as offend me, and neuer for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get them that doe me seruice.<note place="margin">The Law of Arms.</note> But afore I speake of rewarding or recompensing, we must know what is the law and discipline of arms, wherof the first and principall point (that is to wit, to doe no man wrong) dependeth vpon naturall iustice. And yet-notwithstanding, this seemeth so strange among vs, that the cheefe and principall point of warlike behauiour, seemeth to consist in pilling, swearing, rauishing, &amp; robbing, and that a soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier cannot be esteemed a gallant fellow, vnlesse he be furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed with those goodly vertues. Contrariwise, if the Romans had any souldiers that were neuer so little giuen to loosenesse, they would not vse their seruice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> no not euen in most extreme necessitie, (as is to be seen by the doings of <hi>Metellus</hi> in Affrike, and of <hi>Scipio</hi> in Spain) making more account of one legion that liued after the law and order of war, than of ten that were out of order. Now the lawes of armes were diuers, according to the diuersities of the captains that haue had the leading of Armies.<note place="margin">The vertue of obedience, dependeth vpon the gentlenes of nature.</note> The first consisteth in the obedience of the men of warre. For (as saith <hi>Plato</hi>) it auaileth not to haue a good captaine, vnlesse the souldiers bee discreet and obedient, because the vertue of well-obeieng, hath as great need of a gentle nature, and of the helpe of good trainment, as the princely vertue of commaunding. All other precepts tend generally to naturall iustice, the which will not haue wrong done to any man. <hi>Alexander</hi> being aduertised that two soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers which serued vnder <hi>Parmenio,</hi> had rauished the wiues of certaine souldiers strangers, wrate vnto <hi>Parmenio</hi> to

informe him therof, charging him that if he found it to be so, he should put both the souldiers to death, as wild beasts bred to the destruction of men. When the Romanes marched vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the leading of <hi>Marcus Scaurus,</hi> there was found in their trenches at their departure thence, a tree hanging ful of fruit, so great conscience made they to take any thing that was not their owne. And if any man went aside in any field, farme, or grange, at such time as the campe marched, he was punished immediatly, and it was demaunded of him if he could find in his heart, that a man should doe as much in his lands. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer <hi>Bellisarius</hi> went with his armie, he restrained his men from doing wrong to laborers and husbandmen, insomuch that they durst not eat the apples and peares that hung vpon the trees. After the death of <hi>Campson</hi> the Soldan of Aegypt, <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lim</hi> king of Turks being possessed of Damasco, and the rest of the cities of Syria, would not suffer his men of war to come within them, but lodged his camp by the wals of the towne, and of all the time that he was there, there was not any guard set to keepe the goodly and fruitfull Gardens, that were without the citie, because the rigorous iustice that <hi>Selim</hi> exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, restrained the Turks from misdoing; wherthrough the whole armie found themselues well apaid. For they neuer wanted victuals, but had plentie and aboundance of all things. <hi>Traian</hi> caused a captaine to be banished, for killing a hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmans Oxen without need; and awarded the husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man for amends, to haue the captaines horse and armor, and also his quarters wages.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tamerlane</hi> king of Tartarians, made a souldier of his to be put to death, for taking but a cheese from a poore woman. <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilas</hi> was so seuere in the discipline of war, that he would not leaue any one misdeed vnpunished. He that rauished any woman, was punished with death, or at least wise forfaited his goods, the which were giuen to the partie that was outraged. Insomuch that he passed by the cities and townes that were in friendship and league with him, without doing them any harme; saying that kingdomes and empires were easily lost,

if they were not maintained by iustice. Which thing <hi>Iustinian</hi> found to be very true, who through the vniustice and disorder of his captaines, lost the empyre of Italy. <hi>Paulus Emilius</hi> was a sterne obseruer of the law of arms, not seeking to purchase the loue of his souldiers by pleasing them, but shewing them himselfe from point to point, how auailable the ordinances of war were.

Insomuch that in the time of the ciuil wars, he cashed a whole legion at once, notwithstanding that he stood as then in great need of them, and ere euer he would admit them againe, he ceassed not, till he had punished the misdoers.

And in very deed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Legions in Germanie were very much marred, by being too much nusled in licentiousnesse afore; <hi>Adrian</hi> was driuen to doe in time of peace as in time of war, and to set vp the order of war new againe, which had bin discontinued from the time of <hi>Augustus.</hi> And for example to his men of war, he ate not any other victuals than such as were ordinarie, and he marched on foote fiue or sixe leagues a day.

And if in perusing his notes of remembrance, he saw any man that had done him seruice and was not worthilie recompenced; hee made him to come before him, and asked of him why he had not sued for recompence, willing him to sue boldly for any thing agreeable to his estate.</p>

For in so doing he bereaueth himselfe of the meanes to recompence manie, and is not so well serued as he else should be.

When I speake of the recompensing of Seruices, my meaning is, that it should be done measurably, and not by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting men in trust with too great a charge, nor by making them too mightie, least perhapes they turne head against their mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.

But his treason was bewraied, and he punished according to his deserts. We know what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in Fraunce to the maires of the pallace; which caused <hi>Consaluo</hi> to be called home out of Naples, where he managed the king of Aragons affairs so wel, and vnto whom the king his maister was beholden for the kingdome of Naples; which thing was done for feare least he should haue seazed vpon the kingdom, considering his credit, his good gouernment, and his experience in war. There remaineth yet one doubt more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the execution of iustice;<note place="margin">Whether a prince ought to shift offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers or no.</note> to wit, whether a prince for the benefit of his common-weale ought to chaunge his offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, as they did in old time in Rome, and in Athens. If it be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected that those were pulick-weales, wherein euery man ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by turne; I wil oppose <hi>Alexander Seuerus</hi> a sage prince and such a one as minded not any thing but the publick-weale, who also chaunged his officers; saieng that when princes are gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned continually by any one sort, means are found by intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, gifts, and other corrupt dealings, to peruert their good dispositions. And peraduenture at that time, <hi>Alexander</hi> had seene the inconueniences therof, the which he meant to reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or at leastwise to assay to remedy. But in this manner of dealing there may be as great inconuenience, as in the other: namely that their king shal not haue them so well affectioned towards him, as they ought to be. For they that are accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to the seruice of a good prince, do loue their maister far better, than those that are but new come in. And as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerb saith, A man must first know, ere he can loue. Besides this affection, they be the better acquainted with his humors, and
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:6660:114"/>
the better experienced in his affaires. For practise maketh men sufficient, and the new come is as easie to be corrupted as the old seruitor, when the way to corruption is once set o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen. Moreouer, they that come fresh, try by al means to make their hand of the bountie and liberalitie of the prince; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that most commonly, the oftner that there is a change, the oftener the princes purse is emptied. Record hereof is the fable of the flaine fox, who would not suffer the flies to be driuen from him, that had fed vpon him, for seare least when they were gone, there would come others fresh and fasting, which would doe him more harme and paine than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer that were alreadie full. <hi>Augustus</hi> altered not the maner of dealing which the Romans had vsed, of sending senators into a prouince, for a certaine time. Neuerthelesse being disquieted by a feat that had bene done in Germanie; to make all sure, &amp; to hold the people of that prouince in obedience, he would not haue the senators to remoue thence, to the intent that the subiects should be held in obedience by men of experience, that were alreadie acquainted with the people of that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie. And therefore it is best for all euents, that a prince should not change his officers, but that if any of them offend, hee should well punish them, as <hi>Augustus</hi> did a secretarie of his, whose thighs hee caused to be broken, because he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken a bribe to shew a letter. <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth king of France, liued in all prosperitie, because he was serued by the auntient officers of the crowne, yea euen by those that had taken him prisoner in battell when he was duke of Orleans. Contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, king <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleuenth, was in hazard to haue lost his crowne, by changing all new.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Treasurers and officers of account.</note>I graunt that the dealing of <hi>Alexander Seuerus</hi> was well to be admitted in cases of account, where the prince hath more need of a man of honestie, than a man of great skill. Also the said good emperor permitted them not to continue in office aboue one yeare at once, for feare least their ouer-long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance in those dealings should make them theeues, terming the offices of generall Receit, a necessarie euill; because that
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:6660:114"/>
on the one part they cannot be forborne, and on the other part they teach men to play the theeues. <hi>Froissard</hi> saith, that the earle of Fois, of whome he maketh very great reckoning, tooke twelue notable men to be of his Receits, of whom two serued euery month, and so from month to month other two by turns, which alwaie yeelded their accounts to a controller, in whom he put greatest trust.</p>
               <p>To conclude this discourse,<note place="margin">Precepts of Iustice.</note> the prince and he that is autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rised vnder him to be a iudge, must keepe well the precept of <hi>Martian,</hi> namely, that he be neither too soft nor too rigorous inpunishing, but as the cause deserueth. For he must not affect the glorie of meeldnesse, or of seueritie, but when he hath wel considered the case, he must doe iustice as the case requireth, vsing mercie and gentlenesse in small matters, and shewing se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueritie of law in great crimes, howbeit alwaies with some tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance of gentlenesse. For as <hi>Theodorike</hi> was woont to say, It is the propertie of a good and gracious prince, not to be desirous to punish offences, but to take them away; least by punishing them too eagerly, or by ouerpassing them too meeldly, he be deemed vnaduised and carelesse of the execution of iustice. S. <hi>Iohn Chrysostome</hi> saith, That iustice without mercie, is not iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice but crueltie; and that mercie without iustice, is not mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie but folly. And to my seeming, <hi>Suetonius</hi> hath no great like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood of reason to commend <hi>Augustus</hi> for mercifull, in that to saue a manifest parricide from casting into the water in a sacke, (as was wont to be done to such as had confessed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues guiltie of that fault) he asked him after this maner; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue thou hast not murthered thy father. For he that iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the wicked, and hee that condemneth the guiltlesse, are both of them abhominable to the Lord, saith <hi>Salomon</hi> in his Prouerbs.<note place="margin">Punishment must not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hus much in few words concerning iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, the which <hi>Cicero</hi> diuideth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two, namely into that which is tearmed by the generall name of Righteousnesse, &amp; into that which is tearmed Liberalitie, accordingly as the holy scripture doth ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take righteousnesse for the libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie that is vsed towards the needie, the which we call Alms or Charitie. He hath dispersed &amp; giuen vnto the poore, (saith the Psalmist) and his righteousnesse endureth for euer; that is to say, He will continue still to shew himselfe righteous, and he shall haue wherin to execute his liberalitie all the daies of his life. And S. <hi>Paule</hi> in his second Epistle to the Corinthians, prayeth God to encrease the reuenues of their righteousnesse, that is to say of their liberalitie or bounteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. And in the one and twentith of the Prouerbs, He that followeth righteousnesse and mercie, (saith <hi>Salomon</hi>) He that is kind-hearted and pitifull to the poore, shall find life, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, and glorie. And in the same place, The righteous giueth (saith he) and spareth not. Now therfore I must speake more particularly of the distributiue righteousnesse, which is called Liberalitie, and is as it were the meane betwixt nig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardlinesse and prodigalitie, a vertue well-beseeming a rich man. For (as saith <hi>Plato</hi>) He that hath store of goods, if he make others partakers with him, is to be honoured as a great man:<note place="margin">Liberalitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seemeth a prince.</note> but specially it most beseemeth a prince, as who is better able to put it in vse, than any priuat persons. For Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie vndoeth liberalitie, because that the more a man vseth it, the more he abateth his abilitie of vsing it towards many,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:6660:116"/>
A king who hath great reuenues, may honourably vse it in his life, without abating the meane to doe good to such as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue it. Therefore <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his booke of the Fortunat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and vertue of <hi>Alexander,</hi> saith; That as the fruits of the earth grow faire by the temperatnesse of the aire: euen so, good wits are furthered by the liberalitie, honourable counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce, and courtesie of a king; and that on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie part, they droope and decay through his niggardship, displeasure,<note place="margin">It is the dutie of a king to doe good vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to many.</note> and hard-dealing. For the very dutie of a king (said <hi>Agesilaus</hi>) is to doe good vnto many. <hi>Ptolomaeus Lagus</hi> said, It was a more goodly and princely thing to enrich other men, than to enrich himselfe, according to S. <hi>Paules</hi> saying, That it is better to giue than to take. And <hi>Fabricius</hi> had leuer to haue at commaundement men that were well moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, than the monie it selfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dennis</hi> the tyrant of Siracuse offered presents to the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours of Corinth, the which they refused, saying, That the law of their countrie forbad them to take ought of any prince whatsoeuer. Wherevnto hee answered, Surelie yee doe amisse, O yee Corinthians, in that yee bereaue princes of the best thing that they haue.<note place="margin">The misli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of great power, is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away by Liberalitie.</note> For there is not any other meane to take away the misliking of so great a power, than by courtesie and liberalitie. <hi>Alexander</hi> was woont to say, That there was not a better hoording vp of treasure, than in the purses of his friends; because they will yeeld it him againe whensoeuer hee needeth it. Now then, this vertue doth maruellously well beseeme a prince, because he hath wherwith to put it in vre; and yet neuerthelesse it ceasseth not to be in the mind of a poore man also.<note place="margin">Liberalitie <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>d by the gift but by the will.</note> For a man is not to be deemed liberall for his great gifts, but for the will that he hath to do good. For a poore man may be more liberall than a rich, although he giue far lesse without comparison than the rich, because liberalitie (like as all other vertues) proceedeth chiefly from the disposition or inclination that a man hath to giue.</p>
               <p>As for example, the poore widow that did put the two mites
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:6660:117"/>
into the offering box, was esteemed to haue giuen more than al the rich men, though the thing she gaue was nothing in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of the gifts of other men. For liberalitie consisteth not in the greatnes of the gifts, but in the maner of the giuing. And he is liberall, which giueth according to his abilitie, vnto good men, and vpon good causes. This vertue represseth nigardship, and moderateth prodigalitie, causing a man to vse his goods and his money aright.<note place="margin">Three waies of v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ing a mans goods well.</note> The meane to vse these well, consisteth in three points. The first is in taking a mans owne money where he ought to take it: and hereunto maketh the good husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of him that spareth his reuenue, to spend it to good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. For he that hath not wherewith to maintain his expenses, doth amisse in making large expenses at other mens cost: and he that hath it, doth amisse if he spend it not, because there is not any thing that winneth a prince so much the fauor of his people, as liberalitie doth. <hi>Dennis</hi> the tyrant inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding to try his son, furnished him with much costly stuffe, iewels, and vessell, both of gold and siluer of great price. And when long time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he had espied that the plate remained with him still, he taunted him, saieng that he had not a princely hart, sith he had not made him friends with his plate, hauing such abunda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce; for he was of opinion, that such gifts would haue gotten his son good will at all mens hands. For as <hi>Salomon</hi> saith in the xix. of the prouerbs: euery man is a friend to the man that giueth. And in the chapter going afore,<note place="margin">Gifts get f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> he saith, That a mans gift maketh way for him, and leads him to the presence of great men. And in the xvij he saith, That a gift is as a precious stone in the eies of him that possesseth it, that is say, that a gift hath such grace, that it can doe all to the winning of mens hearts. The second meane for a prince to vse liberalitie well, is, not to take his money where he ought not. Wherein consisteth the honor of his power, in that he wil not take from one to giue vnto another, nor strip one naked to clothe another. The third meane, is to spend it as he ought, which is the very true meane of liberalitie, whereunto both the other be referred. Now then, liberalitie consisteth chiefly in the well vsing of monie;
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:6660:117"/>
To vse money well,<note place="margin">What it is to vse monie wel</note> is to spend it and giue it to such as want and are worthie to haue. As for the only keeping of a mans re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenue, it is not the vsing, but rather the getting of money. Therfore liberalitie cannot consist in the well keeping of a mans reuenues, neither consisteth it meerely in not taking from others, but in benefiting others. For it is more praise-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie to doe good, than it is to keepe a mans owne (whereunto we be inclined by nature) or not to doe any man hurt. For it is not inough for a man to abstaine from doing harme, vnlesse he also doe good. And yet for all that, it behoueth the liberall to be carefull in keeping his owne, that he may haue wherewith to maintaine his liberalitie,<note place="margin">A poore prince is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther well <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

For as saith <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander Seuerus,</hi> the prince that is poore and needy, is neither serued with good courage of his subiects, nor feared of stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers: and much lesse the prodigall, who wasteth all without reason, and catcheth other mens goods to maintain his lauish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse withall. There are othersome that giue, but they be also greedie of gain; and they cannot be counted to do the deeds of liberalitie. For Liberalitie lieth chiefly in the heart, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardeth not gaine. But to loue monie, is a spice of couetousnes, notwithstanding that afterward a man spend it more for often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, than vpon any liberall mind. For there are many which deface their reputation, by taking vnworthely, foully, and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, to giue it away afterward.

                  <hi>Alexander</hi> was reputed the bountifullest and liberallest of all princes; but I am of opinion that <hi>Fabricius, Aristides, Lisan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Epaminondas,</hi> and infinite other Greeks and Romanes, had as liberal and princely hearts as he, notwithstanding that they had lesse means to vtter it. There are greatdeeds of liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to be found in the life of <hi>Alexander,</hi> and some also that passe the bounds of liberalitie; but yet the ballance weigheth most on the side of liberalitie.

And when the mule began to faint, the muleter laid the burthen vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his owne shoulders and carried it a good way himselfe: but in the end, he felt himselfe so ouercharged, that he was about to cast it to the ground.

               <p>There are that excuse their couetuousnesse by the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of their children. And soothly it is a sufficient cause to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine ouer-great expenses, and to hold a mans hand from sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, for feare he should leaue them poore. But to pine a mans selfe for their sakes, and to hoord vp heape vpon heape to make them rich, I count it neither husbandrie nor thriftinesse, but the very desire of hauing, which we call Couetousnesse. And for that cause doth <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the same treatise of the Desire of riches, say thus; Why desire we so great riches for our children? Surely to the end that they also should conuey them ouer to their children, after the maner of conduit-pipes, which keepe not any liquor resting in them, but conuey it foorth from pipe to pipe, vntill some backbiter or some tyrant come, that cutteth off this good keeper, and breaking his conduit-pipe, conueieth the water-course of his riches ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way; vntill the veriest vnthrift and naughtipacke of all his race, come and deuour all those goods alone.<note place="margin">The goods that are hoor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vp by the couetous, shal be wasted by the prodigall.</note> For as the emperor <hi>Constantine</hi> said, All the treasures that are hoorded vp by the couetous, shall be spent by the hands of the prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall. But for as much as of couetousnesse commeth the desire of riches, and there is no man but he esteemeth it a great hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse to be rich, it were for our behalfe to know what rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is, and what is the meane to become rich. This question is not now first of all demaunded; for it was demaunded on a time of <hi>Socrate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Euen that man (quoth he) that needeth fewest things; mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that richnesse is to be measured by the vse of riches.

<pb n="233" facs="tcp:6660:126"/>
For pouertie consisteth not in the small quantitie of goods, but in the vnsatiablenesse of the mind. <hi>Cicero</hi> saith in his Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxes, That the fruit of riches is in the aboundance of them, and that sufficednesse sheweth that there is aboundance, and that to be contented with the goods a man hath, is the surest richnesse.</p>

                  <note place="margin">What a prince is to doe for the wel-gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of his kingdome.</note> What means a prince should vse to keepe well his realme? The best (quoth he) is, not to set his mind vpon mony, nor to make his reuenue ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>great. <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the life of <hi>Marcus Cato</hi> saith, There is not a more needfull prouision for them that intend to deale with the gouernment of a common-weale, than riches; but yet there is a sufficiency, which being contented with it selfe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out desiring particularly things superfluous, doth by that means neuer distract the partie that hath it, from minding and intending the publike affairs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anacharsis</hi> said, That the couetous person and the nigard,<note place="margin">The misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble case of the couetous.</note> is vnable either to conceiue any good doctrine, or to giue any good and wise counsell. <hi>Lucrece</hi> said, It is great riches, when a man liueth trimlie of the little that he hath: because that of that little, there is not any want. <hi>Horace</hi> in his twelfth Ode, saith, That a man may liue well and merrily of a little, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out breaking his sweet sleepe through feare or hope. For the affectionat minding of riches (saith <hi>Eccles<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>asticus</hi>) pineth the flesh, and the carke therof bereaueth a man of sleepe. The same <hi>Horace</hi> writing to <hi>Crispus Salustius</hi> saith, That that man is rich, not which is a great king, but which hath his lusts in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection; and that the thirst of him which is diseased with the dropsie, is not to be stanched, but by drawing the waterie hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor out of the veins, and by remouing the cause out of the disease.<note place="margin">The meane to become rich.</note> Here by it is easie to decide the other question, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, By what means a man may become rich? For <hi>Socrates</hi> tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth it in one word saying, Ye shal easily become rich, if you impouerish your lusts and desire. <hi>Epicurus</hi> said, That he that will make a man rich, must not increase his goods, but dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish his lusts. For there is no riches so great as contentment.
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:6660:127"/>
And therfore the Philosopher <hi>Crates</hi> beholding how folke did buy and sell in the market, said; These folke are counted happie, because they doe things contrarie one to another, and I thinke my selfe happie, that I haue rid my hands of buying and selling.</p>
               <p>The true way then to become rich, is to couet nought, and to be vnmindfull of gaine, specially of vnhonest gaine; for that is no better than losse, as saith <hi>Hesiodus.</hi> For like as the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall man is loued of all men, (according to this saying of <hi>Salomon</hi> in the nineteenth of his Prouerbs, Euery man is a friend to him that giueth) so the couetous person is hated of all men: For the one helpeth the poore with his goods, the other is loth to giue any thing. In this respect <hi>Socrates</hi> said, that a man must not require either talke to a dead man, or a good turne of a nigard. But there is nothing so royall and princely, as to doe good vnto many,<note place="margin">Nothing so royall as to be helpfull to many.</note> as saith <hi>Cicero</hi> in his booke of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. And it is found, that there is more pleasure in giuing than in taking, as saith S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and also <hi>Hesiodus</hi> in his booke of Works and Daies. And <hi>Ecclesiasticus</hi> saith, Let not thy hand be open to receiue, and shut to giue. <hi>Dauid</hi> esteemeth him hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie, that lendeth and hath pitie of the poore, saying, That he shall euer haue wherwith to doe good without failing, but he that stoppeth his eares at the cry of the needie, shall crie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and not be heard. The same doth <hi>Salomon</hi> also say in the xxj of the Prouerbs. And the Psalmist saith thus; I haue bin young and now am old, yet saw I neuer the righteous man forsaken, nor his seed driuen to begge their bread; but hee is still giuing, lending, and releeuing, and his of-spring is seene to grow in good fortune and foyzon. On the contrarie part, The vnrighteous shall be driuen for verie hunger to borrow, and not be able to pay; but the righteous shall haue wherwith to shew their burning charitie. <hi>Virgil</hi> in his sixth booke of <hi>Aenae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi> putteth those persons in hell, which haue done no good to their friends, kins-folke, and neighbours, but haue bin wholly wedded to their riches, without imparting them to other folks. <hi>Acheius</hi> king of Elis, was slaine by his owne subiects for
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:6660:127"/>
couetousnes, &amp; for his ouer-charging them with impositions. <hi>Ochus</hi> king of Persia, was blamed, for that by reason of coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnes, he would neuer go into the country of Persland, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that by the law of the realme, he was bound to giue to euery woman that had born children, one French crowne, and to euerie woman with child two.

               <p>The oracle of <hi>Apollo</hi> had foretold, that Sparta should not perish, but by couetousnesse; and so it came to passe. In like maner befell it to the citie of Athens: For about the end of the wars of Peloponnesus, <hi>Amintas</hi> began to corrupt the iudges with bribes, and thence foorth they neuer prospered. No other thing was the ruine of Rome.

And therfore <hi>Salomon</hi> in the fourteenth of his Prouerbs, saith, That he which disdaineth his neighbour, sinneth; but he that pitieth the afflicted, is happie. And <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi> Blessed is he that considereth the poore in his need, or which hath a care of them which are in distresse; for surely God will relieue him when he is in distresse. We call that man gentle and courteous, which behaueth himselfe familiarly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all men, and is easie to be spoken to, as were the empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror <hi>Titus, Philip</hi> king of Macedonia, <hi>Scipio,</hi> and many others; for ordinarilie he that is kind-hearted, that is to say, which hath a care of his neighbor, and is willing to do him good, must yeeld him his eare as well as his purse, specially seeing that of both it is the lesse to his owne cost.</p>
               <p>There be fiue sorts of kindnesse or gentlenesse.<note place="margin">Fiue sorts of Gentlenesse or Kindnesse.</note> The first is, that which we terme by the generall name of kindnesse, which is a certaine meeld, charitable, and louing disposition of mind towards men; as when a man pitieth the poore, the oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, or the needie; and generally when a man behaueth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe courteously towards all men, be they poore or rich, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the example of our Maker, who delighteth to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the children of men, to doe them good. The second sort
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:6660:129"/>

But they that are gentle in all points, are also meeld and easie to be delt with, persuading themselues that the way to doe men good, is to heare their requests. And they that haue intended to shew themselues yet more kind and courteous, haue gone further, as <hi>Alexander Seuerus</hi> did, who blamed his good seruants, for that they required not recompence at his hand. Some other princes to draw men the more vnto them, haue called men by their names.

And for that cause did <hi>Cirus</hi> cal al his men of war by their names, howbeit that was a thing that could not be done without a diuine memorie. And to the same purpose I will not omit <hi>Scipioes</hi> answere to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Romane which vaunted, that he could call mo men by their names, than <hi>Scipio</hi> could. You say true (quoth <hi>Scipio</hi>) for my studie hath not bin to know many, but to be knowne of all.</p>
               <p>The third sort of kindnesse, consisteth in Clemencie, that is to say, in forgiuing offences, or in making light of them, which thing God hath commaunded vs in the fift chapter of saint <hi>Mat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But let vs leaue the handling of this point to Diuines, and take vs againe to the examples of the heathen. It was asked to <hi>Cleomenes</hi> king of Sparta, What a good king ought to doe?

And therfore <hi>Traian</hi> said vnto a freind of his, That the thing which made him better beloued than his predecessors, was, that he did easily pardon such as had offended him. <hi>Agesilaus</hi> by his good doing, made those that were his enemies to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his friends. <hi>Augustus</hi> made one his seruant that would haue killed him. <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleuenth assaied by all means to draw those to his seruice, that had bin his enemies, if he knew them to be men of seruice; but he was moued therto more for the profit that he hoped for by their seruice, than of any meeld disposition of nature. <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> being worthilie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for his clemencie and mercie, was no sooner reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to any enemies of his, but he would by and by vse them as friends; insomuch that he would euen set them at his owne table the same day.

Whom when <hi>Antigonus</hi> saw, he said to <hi>Alcioneus</hi>; My son, this deed of thine is much better, and pleaseth me far more than the other; but yet thou hast not done altogether as thou oughtest, in that thou hast not taken away this course cloke that hangeth vpon his shoulders, which doth more dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour to vs that haue gotten the victorie, than to him that hath lost it. Therwithall he embraced <hi>Helen,</hi> and hauing set him in good apparell, sent him home into his kingdome of Epire; and being possessed of the army of <hi>Pirrhus,</hi> he delt very courteously with all his seruants.<note place="margin">Of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlenesse.</note> But in Gentlenesse as in all other vertues, a man may offend in too much or too little; as they doe, which through shamefastnesse do condescend to all things; of whom <hi>Plutarch</hi> speaketh in his booke of Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamefastnesse, and as soothers and slatterers doe, which sooth men in all that they say, as <hi>Gnato</hi> doth in <hi>Terence.</hi> The other sort is of them that denie all requests that are made vnto

them, be they neuer so iust, and which through a froward dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of gainesaying that accompanieth them, doe encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all things that are spoken to them: or else are so rough and sterne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they neuer laugh, neither can a man tell how to be acquainted with them. And so kindnes or gentlenes matched with meeldnes, is a vertue that represseth the excesse and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derateth the default; keeping men fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> exceeding in ouermuch pliantnes, like the soother &amp; the flatterer; and fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the default of vnpliablenes like the cloune and the churle. For oft-times ouer-great familaritie, maketh a prince to be had in contempt, and ouergreat sternnes &amp; grauity make him odious, hard to be intreated, and not to be come vnto. Therefore it behoueth him to hold the meane, and to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider what may best beseeme him. For (as the Preacher saith) All things haue their times; there is a time to laugh, &amp; a time to weepe, a time to graunt, and a time to refuse.<note place="margin">Whether a prince ought to be meeld or sterne.</note> The which some not considering aduisedly, doe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther counsell princes to make themselues too familiar, and to deny nothing; or else to refuse all things, and in no wise to giue their subiects easie accesse vnto them: saying, that if a king make himself too gentle, &amp; too easie to be spoken to, he shalbe despised, and consequently ill obayed of his subiects, because that ouermuch familiaritie breedeth contempt. And therfore the Englishmen, Spaniards, Turks, and Scithians, do reuerence their kings well neere as gods, and dare not prease into their presence. For they that suffer themselues to be comne vnto, do oftentimes promise more than they can perform, as <hi>Titus</hi> did, who often promised more than he was able to doe; saying that no man ought to goe away sad and discontented from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of a prince. Insomuch that many me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> allowed the apoph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thegme of <hi>Brutus,</hi> who said, That that man had mis-spent his youth, which graunted all things. <hi>Caligula</hi> made no nicenesse to denie all mens requests, saying, That there was nothing in his owne nature that he esteemed so much, as impudencie and stoutnes of denying all things. The which point the emperor <hi>Maximilian</hi> practised vpon a poore man that craued an almes of him, and told him that the emperor and he came both of
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:6660:131"/>
one father, to wit of <hi>Adam,</hi> and so consequently were brethren, and therfore he desired him to deale brotherly with him and to do him some good. The emperor consented, and gaue him a small peece of siluer. Wherat when he saw the poore man discontented, hee told him that hee ought to take his gift in good woorth, saying that if euery of his brethren would giue him as much, he should be richer than he himselfe was. A cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine courtier whom <hi>Archelaus</hi> loued well, praied him to giue him a certaine goodly vessell: by and by <hi>Archelaus</hi> comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded one to giue it to <hi>Euripides.</hi> Wherat the party marueling that had craued it, receiued none other answere but this; thou art worthy to aske it and to goe without it; and he is worthy to haue it without asking. Meaning that he had giuen the courtier accesse to aske what he would, but that the goodnes of <hi>Euripides</hi> was such, as deserued some gift without asking. <hi>Philip</hi> counselled his son <hi>Alexander</hi> to behaue himselfe gently and graciously to his subiects afore he were king: for were he once king, he could not be so gracious. Deeming very wisely, that as there is not a better thing to stablish a kingdome, than the loue of the subiects, so it is very hard for him that reigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,<note place="margin">It is hard for him that reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to be gentle to all men.</note> to be gentle to all, as well because the state of a king, is subiect to enuy, as also because it cannot maintaine it selfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it, vnlesse it punish the wicked. For it behoueth a king so to temper his goodnes and gentlenes, as therewithall he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine his authoritie and grauitie. For oftentimes ouer-great gentlenes causeth men to make no account of a prince. And as <hi>Plutarch</hi> saith in the life of <hi>Pericles,</hi> It is very hard for a prince to keepe a seuere grauitie, for the vpholding of his reputation, and therwithall to suffer all men to haue familiar accesse vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. After the time that <hi>Pericles</hi> had the managing of the publicke affairs, he was neuer seene abroade in the streets, nor at any feasts. They that would haue a prince to be familiar, defend their cause by reasons and examples, saying that gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlenes maketh a prince wel beloued, well-willed, and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</p>
               <p>For as <hi>Terence</hi> saith, he that is a man, ought to be a parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker

of that which belongeth to man, that is to say, hee ought to be gentle, louing, and mercifull. And (as saith <hi>Iuuenal</hi>) na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath made mans heart tender, that hee should pittie such as are distressed, who craue helpe of the prince, whose throne is vpheld by goodnesse, gentlenesse, and kindnesse, as sayth <hi>Salomon</hi> in the twentith of the Prouerbs.</p>

And on a time, when hee saw a friend of his sicke, hee gaue him his chamber and bed, because there were no mo beds not cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in the Inne but that, and went out and lay himselfe xpon the hard ground.

Insomuch that his kindly simplicitie &amp; liberalitie, his familiar manner of playing and making mirth in company; and
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:6660:132"/>
specially the pains that he tooke at that time in succouring, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siting, and bemoning them that were sick or wounded, wrought such effect, that he made the sicke and wounded men, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue as affectionat towards him, and as resolute to doe him seruice, as those that were whole and sound. The Emperor <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian</hi> had the good wils of the Romans, because he visited as well his enemies as his freinds that were sicke, and releeued them all that he could. Also he would goe to the houses of old and auntient folke, that by reason of their yeares could not goe abroad, of whome he would enquire how they had liued, where they had dwelled, what customes they had seene, and what distresses and dangers they had indured. By doing wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of and by shewing charitie towards them, he profited himselfe, because that oftentimes, he serued his owne turne in matters that befell him, by the examples which those good old folke had told him of the time forepast. <hi>Cimon</hi> was greatly accepted of the common people for his plaine dealing, and for the same was aduanced to great offices. Contrariwise <hi>Nicias</hi> for his ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>great sternnesse and hardnesse to be acquainted with, was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uied of most men, and but for his great vertue and integritie, which caused men to reuerence him and feare him, he could neuer haue weelded his affairs as he did. <hi>Lucullus</hi> for want of behauing himselfe courteously and gently inough to his soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and for want of skill to entertaine them, could not make an end of his wars, which he had so happily begun, and brought almost to the point of perfection. For his souldiers became heady, and would not follow him. <hi>Dion</hi> was blamed, not only of the Sicilians, but also euen of <hi>Plato,</hi> for his manner of dealing, in speaking more roughly vnto such as sued vnto him, than the state of his affairs could beare. The Macedonia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s forsooke <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius,</hi> because he was vneasie to be delt with, and very hard to be spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to. <hi>Coriolanus</hi> was hated of the people for his stern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, notwithstanding that he was a wise captaine. Contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> notwithstanding that he was full of vice, yet was he welbeloued and esteemed of all men, for his courteous behauiour towards all sorts. Among the good parts that were
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:6660:133"/>
in <hi>Aristides,</hi> one of the best account was, that he could wel skil to win and alure mens hearts vnto him, which thing (saith <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi>) co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth of gentlnesse: but as for grauitie, it is accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with solitarines, that is to say, such kind of men haue few to follow them, and are forsaken of all men. The gentlenes of <hi>Pompey</hi> was so great, that he contented al men that spake with him: insomuch that euen they that complained vnto him, of the wrongs done vnto them by his freinds and seruants, were persuaded to beare them patiently; so greatly did he content them. And that was the very thing, that procured him so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny honorable offices of great charge. <hi>Suetonius</hi> reporteth <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus</hi> to haue ben so gentle, that he caused his dores to stand open to as many as would come and salute him, and receiued their petitions with such meeldnesse and courtesie, that after a smiling maner, he reproued one for making too much nicenes in preferring his sute vnto him, as though he had shewed a peece of coine to an Elephant. The people of Rome purposed to haue kept <hi>Crassus</hi> by force, from going to make war against the Parthians. Which thing <hi>Crassus</hi> fearing, praied <hi>Pompey</hi> to accompanie him.

As soone as he went about to compell the Tarentines to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of warre, by and by he lost their hearts. <hi>Cimon</hi> by his gracious speeches, and by his gentle harkening to the Greeks, recouered the principalitie of Greece out of the hands of the Lacedemonians.

                  <hi>Fabius</hi> was wont to say, That he maruelled that men delt better with horses, hounds, and other beasts, in taming them by gentlenesse, than with men; for euen by faire and gentle means, are froward men also to be woon and tamed. And we ought not to be more hard-harted towards them, than hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen are towards wild vines, who doe not cut them vp for their harshnesse, but doe make them become sweet by grassing them. And euen so must euill men be by benefits ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peased, and good men by the same means be maintained. <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omenes</hi> said, That the pampering of men with monie was grosse, void of policie, and full of vniustice; and that to his seeming, the most honourable and the most royall means, was to allure them by courtesie of delightful entertainment and communication, wherin both grace and faithfulnesse went matched togither. For he was of opinion, that there was none other difference betweene a friend and an hireling, but that
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:6660:134"/>
the friend is gotten and kept by gentlenes of nature and good vsage,<note place="margin">The tyrant that is a cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, is most cruell and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicious.</note> and the hireling is caught by mony. Herevnto we may ad that which <hi>Plutarch</hi> saith in the life of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> namely, That the tyrant which is most coward, is most cruel and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie of blood. And contrariwise there is no man more gentle and kindhearted, or lesse suspicious, than the valiant and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die man. And therfore the beasts that are not to be tamed, are commonly cowards and fearfull; wheras on the contrary part, those that be noble and full of courage, doe thinke themselues sure, and acquaint themselues with man, because they be void of feare, and refuse not the allurements and familiar vsages, which man proffereth vnto them. Euen so when princes yeeld themselues gentle to their subiects, their subiects also by that means become meeke towards them, in hope that their king will hearken to them, whensoeuer they request it. And that kind of demeanour is oftentimes a cause that the courtiers keepe themselues in right mind, for feare least they should be complained of to the prince, if they doe amisse. And the princes that deale otherwise, are subiect to this say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Dioclesian</hi> the emperour, That onely the emperour knoweth that which he should not know, and is ignorant of that which hee should know; because there are three or foure about him, which keepe him from knowing the truth. But to eschew the falling into this inconuenience, <hi>Antonie</hi> the meeke, one of the best emperors that euer was, gaue easie ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse vnto his presence, and willed that his pallace gates should be open euery day, to all such as listed to come in, to craue iustice of the emperor; as I haue said alreadie in the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Iustice. Moreouer he had good and discreet men about him, of whom he would enquire in secret what men reported of him, and if he found that their speaking euill of him was for iust cause, he endeuored to amend his fault. And therfore it is better that a prince should be too gentle, than too slerne; howbeit, that it is to be considered, that the excesse in any of both waies, cannot be without vice, and that as well in this as in all other things, the best is to be followed, which is
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:6660:135"/>
the meane, in matching grauitie and gentlenesse togither; as the Athenians said of <hi>Pericles,</hi> that no mans nature could be more moderated in grauitie, nor more graue with meeldnesse and gentlenesse, than his was. And as <hi>Gueuara</hi> saith in his first booke, Princes ought to endeuor to get the good wils of men by courteous conuersation, and also to be feared and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>douted for their maintaining of good iustice, as we read of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius Constantine</hi> the emperor, who was both feared of many, and loued of all.</p>

                  <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the life of <hi>Phocion</hi> saith, That too rough se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueritie, as well as too meeld gentlenesse,<note place="margin">Too great gentlenesse and too great seueritie are both verie dangerous.</note> is a verie slipperie and dangerous downfall; and that the middle way of yeelding sometimes to the peoples desire, therby to make them the more obedient otherwise, and to grant them the thing that doth delight them, therby to require of them the things that are for their profit, is a wholsome meane to rule and gouerne men well, who suffer themselues to be led to the executing of good things, when too lordly authoritie is not vsed ouer them. Therefore when maiestie is mingled with courtesie, there is no harmonie so perfect &amp; musick-like as that. For it is the thing wherin the prince may resemble God,<note place="margin">God enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

For this reuerence is accompanied with loue, but feare is accompanied with hatred. Now it is both more sure &amp; more honourable to be loued than to be feared. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a prince must moderat his behauiour in such sort, as he may be neither too much feared of the meaner sort, nor too much despised of the greater. For to be too much feared of his subiects, belongeth vnto a tyrant. But yet must he also beware that he be not despised of the great, he must keepe his estate, &amp; be graue, howbeit, such grauitie as is acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panied with gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlenes, so as when he is abroad he shew a princely maiestie, &amp; when he is to heare requests, he shew himselfe affable &amp; easie
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:6660:135"/>
to be delt with. After that maner did <hi>Iulius Casar</hi> behaue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in his dictatorship, but that was to his own ouerthrow, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he had taken vpon him that preheminence by force of arms, and had altered the state of the citie,<note place="margin">He that alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth a state, must haue force to make men feare him, vntill he be surely set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in his ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie.</note> in which case it is more safety for a prince to be feared than to be loued. For it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be but that the prince which hath changed a state, hath many enemies. <hi>Augustus</hi> his successor was better aduised than he, for at the beginning he was cruel, &amp; put those to death who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he thought able to impeach his doings at any time after. But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he once saw himselfe throughlie setled in his tyranny, &amp; that the most part of the citize<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s that had bin brought vp in li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie were dead, then began he to be a gentle, affable, &amp; grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous prince. <hi>Antigonus</hi> did the like in the beginning of his raign, dealing roughlie at the first, &amp; afterward beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming meeld and gentle.<note place="margin">A new domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is to be gotten by force, and to be maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlenesse.</note> And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it was asked of him, Why he had altered his maner of dealing? he answered, That at the beginning he nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a kingdome, &amp; now he wanted but fauor and good wil, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause a new dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is gotten by force of arms, &amp; by austeritie, but it is maintained by loue and good will. But in lawfull kings loue is more auailable than feare. The kings of France de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meane themselues better in that behalfe than all other kings. For their attendance representeth a great maiestie, &amp; yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding no man is barred fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> preferring his sute vnto him after he is out of his cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, specially in the morning when he goeth to masse, where certain masters of requests atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vpon him, &amp; deliuer him the petitions that are brought vnto them. There is a kind of gentlenes that is hurtfull to a prince,<note place="margin">To be ouer-easily intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted may be hurtfull.</note> and his granting of euerie mans request, may breed manie great inconueniences. For by graunting some point of fauour in case of iustice, wrong is done: and by graunting monie, the prince his purse is emptied, whereby hee is driuen to take where he ought not, or else where he can. The lawes of France haue well remedied that matter. For the king hath set downe by his ordinance, that he will not haue his letters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded which concerne not iustice, &amp; for the view of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he referreth himselfe to his iudges, for his checker matters: more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:6660:136"/>
there is his court of parliament, and a chamber of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts which controlleth the kings gifts: so as no man can go away discontented from him, because he granteth all things that are demaunded of him, and yet those gifts are without ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, wherof the ministers only doe beare the disgrace, as <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiauell</hi> hath very well marked in his booke of Princes. And so long as this law stood in force, the affaires of France did alway prosper.</p>
               <p>Now let vs speake of Enuie,<note place="margin">Of Enuie.</note> which extendeth it selfe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than roughnesse or austeritie, which properly is contrary to Gentlenes and Courtesie. For the rough &amp; sterne person is contrarie to the gentle and kind-hearted, as <hi>Terence</hi> teacheth vs in his comodie of the Brethere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vnder the persons of <hi>Mitio</hi> and <hi>Demea.</hi> But Enuie containeth in it churlishnesse, hatred, ambition, &amp; man-slaughter, according to the saying of S. <hi>Iohn Chrisostom</hi> vpon the xxvij of Genesis, where he saith, That En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie is the root of man-slaughter, and man-slaughter is the fruit of enuie.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> in his Duties, maketh no great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the wicked and the enuious, saying, That the wicked man delighteth in his owne welfare, and the enuious man is tormented at the welfare of another: the one loueth the euil, &amp; the other hateth the good; so as he that desireth the good, is more tollerable than he that would the mischiefe of all men. Enuie then is nothing else but a sorinesse conceiued at the prosperitie of another man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bion</hi> the Boristhenit speaking to a certaine enuious man, whom hee saw sad, said vnto him; I cannot tell whether some harme hath happened to thy selfe, or some good to some other bodie.

Themistocles</hi> said; Hee had not yet done any thing woorthie of praise, seeing that no man enuied him. Hereby we see, that as charitie extendeth further than gentlenesse, so enuie extendeth further than hatred, which
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:6660:136"/>
seemeth contrarie to loue and charitie.<note place="margin">The differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betweene ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie.</note> For enuie (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> teacheth vs in his booke of Enuie and Hatred) neuer depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth from those whom it hath once caught hold of, neither in prosperitie nor in aduersitie: wheras hatred vanisheth away in the extremitie of either fortune. Furthermore, when a man is persuaded that he hath receiued no wrong, or taketh an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that those whom he hateth as wicked persons, are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come honest men, or if they haue done him some such plesure as is a cause to dissolue the former iniurie, the hatred ceasseth. But as for the enuious person, although no man do him harme, yet ceasseth he not to be spitefull. And if he see an honest man, or a man of good qualities, or if he receiue a good turne, it doth but prouoke him the more to enuie, so as he is exas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated by the things wherby hatred is assuaged.<note place="margin">Enuie is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determinable.</note> Enuie is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determinable, and resembleth diseased eies, which are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at all brightnesse and light.

By enuie came death into the world, for through <hi>Satans</hi> enuie were we deceiued, through that deceit became we disobedient, and through that disobedience came death vpon vs. It is a very perilous vice, which seazeth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon mens states and liuings, but also vpon their liues, as wee read of <hi>Abell,</hi> who was murthered through the enuie of <hi>Cain</hi>; and of <hi>Ioseph,</hi> who was sold through the enuie of his bretheren. Saint <hi>Iohn Chrisostome</hi> in his 44 Homilie, saith; That this vice in respect of other vices is vnexcusable:<note place="margin">The sin of Enuie is vnex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusable.</note> for the lechor excuseth himselfe by lust, the theefe by pouertie, and the man-slear by choler; but the enuious man can find no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse at all God commaundeth vs to loue our enemies, and the enuious man hateth euen his friends. And in his fiue and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tith Homilie, and likewise vpon the one and twentith of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesis, he saith; That as the worme marreth the timber wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it breedeth, afore it goe out; euen so doth enuie marre the man. <hi>Antisthenes</hi> said, That as rust eateth yron: so the enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous are consumed by the fretting of their owne enuie. For the enuious (saith <hi>Horace</hi>) pineth away at the prosperitie
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:6660:137"/>
of another. And <hi>Alexander</hi> said vnto <hi>Meleager,</hi> That the enuious man carrieth his owne torment with him. <hi>Salomon</hi> in the fourteenth of the Prouerbs, saith, That as a sound heart is the life of the bodie, so enuie is a consumer of the bones. <hi>Plutarch</hi> likeneth enuie to smoke, For afore the flame breake out, it mounteth vp great, but as soone as the flame sheweth it selfe, the smoke vanisheth by little and little, and in the end is no more seene. <hi>Plato</hi> in his booke of Lawes, saith; That the enuious man imagining to vaunt himselfe the more by finding fault with others, can neuer attaine to true vertue, and is a hinderer of those whom he spighteth, by the wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full slaunders which hee reporteth of them. <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the life of <hi>Lisander,</hi> saith; that in the pursute of vertue, the enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ambitious men doe hold those for their aduersaries whome they might and ought rather to serue and helpe, in the doing of great and goodly things. For through their iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousnesse of glorie, they commonly enuie their like. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon commeth this saying of <hi>Martiall,</hi> That there no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count is made of them that are aliue.</p>
               <p>It is Enuie that causeth vs to esteeme more of men of old time, than of men now liuing. And as <hi>Ouid</hi> saith, We take no pleasure in reading mens books, vntil the authours of them be dead, because enuie hath accustomed vs to wound the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing with venemous tooth. For enuie feedeth vpon vs so long as wee be aliue, but be we once dead she ceasseth, and then is praise giuen according to desert. Some man will say, that this discourse may well be directed to common persons,<note place="margin">Whether a prince be sub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>iect to Enuie.</note> but princes are out of enuies reach. For if a prince be enuied, it cannot hurt him; and therewithall he is too great to beare enuie to his subiects. The enuie that <hi>Saule</hi> had vnto <hi>Dauid,</hi> for fighting with <hi>Goliah,</hi> sheweth sufficiently that kings are not exempted from enuie. For albeit that he receiued right great good by that deed of <hi>Dauids,</hi> yet notwithstanding for as much as he was blinded, and as it were drunken with enuie, he held him being his benefactor as his enemie. <hi>Abimelech</hi> was a king and a great lord, and yet when he saw <hi>Isaak</hi> a stranger prosper

and grow rich in his realme, he draue him out. When <hi>Laban</hi> saw <hi>Iacob</hi> his son in law growne richer than himselfe, he could not afterward giue him a good looke. Wherfore it is not to be douted, but that a prince may be enuious, &amp; also be enuied, &amp; therby receiue harme.

And that is the cause why we be commanded to loue our neighbor as our selues, to the end we be not enuious against him, but rather glad when he hath good successe in his affairs. And (as S. <hi>Paule</hi> saith in the 12 to the Romans, Reioice with them that reioice, and weepe with them that weepe; and beare well in mind, that enuie doth more harme to the enuious man himselfe, than to

There is another way to auoid enuie, which was practised by <hi>Dennis</hi> the tirant; which is, that he aduanced a man that was wicked and hated of the people: and when he was asked why he did so; because (quoth he) I will haue a man in my realme, that may be more hated than my selfe. <hi>Caesar Borgia</hi> to auoid the enuie of his cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell deeds, did put the partie to death by whom he had execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the same, to the end that the enuie should light vpon his minister, and die with him.

On the contrarie part, nothing is so much against wisdome, as ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weening is. For the proud man is so farre in loue with himselfe, that he cannot in any wise endure any man to be equall with him in vertue or power. And because that cannot be; needs must enuie issue out of that spring. And because he is of so small patience, and esteemeth none but himselfe, the least thing in the world setteth him in a choller; wheras the lowli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded man, hauing small opinion of himselfe, and beholding his owne infirmitie, is not so easilie in a chafe with his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, as saith S. <hi>Chrisostome</hi> in his Homilie of Fasting. The lowly is at rest both in bodie and mind, but the proud man hath no rest in neither of both.

And among the blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, he setteth this for most in S. <hi>Mathew,</hi> saying, Blessed be the poore in spirit; that is to say, the lowly minded, vnto whose praier he hearkeneth.

There is no health in the house of the proud, for the seede of sin is rooted in them. And in the seuenteenth of the Prouerbs, Loftines of hart (saith he) presup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth a fall, but lowlines and humilitie goe before honor and glorie. And in the nine and twentith, the pride of a man aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth him, but glory and honor shall be heaped vpon the lowli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded. And in the tenth of Ecclesiasticus, God hath cast downe the seats of the proud, and in their steads hath made the meeke to sit in their rooms. God hath dried vp the roots of the proud, and in their place hath planted the humble in glorie. And in the eighteenth Psalm, Thou wilt let the lowly liue in thy protection, &amp; the springs of the presumptuous thou wilt drie vp. On the contrarie part, the lowly and meeke shall inherit the earth, and without trouble they shall haue all the pleasure that man can get. And in the 40 Psalme, Blessed is the man that maketh God his defence, and hath no regard of the proud. King <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleuenth said, That whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pride rode foremost, shame and losse followed after. <hi>Esdras</hi> is specially commended of the angell, for his humbling of himselfe as he ought to doe, and for that he deemed not himselfe greatly worthy to be glorified among the righteous. But as for them that haue walked in great pride, they shall haue great store of miseries. The angell would not suffer St. <hi>Iohn</hi> to worship him, saying that he was a seruant of God, as he was; and bearing in mind that for the vice of pride the wicked angels fell.

written in the temple of <hi>Apollo</hi> at Delphos, whereof I haue spoken so oft afore. For as the great <hi>Mercurie</hi> sayth, The first disease of the mind is Forgetfulnesse. And the man that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth himselfe, is compared to the vnreasonable beasts, and becommeth like them, as <hi>Dauid</hi> saith in the 48 Psalme. The prince therefore must descend into himselfe, and know him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. To know himselfe is to view the nature, as well of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die as of his soule, and to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider that he is no better but man, as <hi>Dauid</hi> saith. For whosoeuer knoweth what hee is, will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware that he forget not himselfe, and not suffer himselfe to be cast into sin, the which <hi>Bion</hi> the Boristhenit did rightly affirme to be a hinderance to profit, and a more hindera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to the fruits of righteousnesse.<note place="margin">Pride a hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to al the fruits of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse.</note> For if we speake of becomming righteous to Godward, we cannot attaine thereto, but by Humilitie. The lowly heart and repentant soule, are an acceptable sacrifice vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, as witnesseth vnto vs the parable of the Publicane, who went home iustified by humilitie, and for acknowledging himselfe a sinner, in accusing himselfe to God, of which accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation ensewed immediatly reward, cleane contrarie to the iudgements of men, vvho vpon accusation and confession, doe by and by giue death. And therfore that we may be iustified, vve be commanded to tell our sinnes: and in old time (as <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crobius</hi> reporteth) the priest afore he made sacrifice to his idols confessed that he vvas a sinner, and thereat began his ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, as we also doe in our religion.

and yeeld thanks to him that is the cause of his better state. Now then, the mind that acknowledgeth the grace that is giuen vnto him, is enemie to pride: whereas the vnthankfull is linked in with pride. <hi>Salomon</hi> forbids vs to iustifie our selues before the Lord, likewise <hi>Dauid</hi> shunneth to enter into iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the Lord, saieng that no man shalbe iustified before him; which is to be vnderstood of trusting to any other thing than only Gods mercie. Humble your selues (saith S. <hi>Iames</hi>) in the presence of God, and he will exalt you. And S. <hi>Peter,</hi> Be ye apparelled with humilitie; for God resisteth the prowd, and giueth grace to the lowly.<note place="margin">The prowd prouoketh God to wrath.</note> 
                  <hi>Philo</hi> sayth, That the prowd person prouoketh God to wrath. Also <hi>Moses</hi> giueth him no temporall punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but reserueth him to Gods iudgement; because Pride is a sinne of the soule, which is not seene and perceiued but of God. If we speake of the righteousnesse that is to be vsed towards men, it is hard for a prince to applie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe thereto, vnlesse he be humble. For this vertue maketh a prince meeke, readie to heare poore mens requests, and to doe them reason, and loath to giue eare to flatterers and tale-bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers; it skorneth not any man, but maketh account both of poore and rich, behauing it selfe louingly and gently towards both, giuing easie accesse vnto either of them. <hi>Iob</hi> among his complaints protesteth that he neuer despised the iudgement of his seruants, were they man or woman, but esteemed of them as of himselfe. But hee that is too high-minded, will heare none but slatterers and tale-bearers; hee regardeth no counsell, he despiseth the poore, he disdaineth euery man, and easily taketh leaue to do wrong and iniurie, according to this saieng of <hi>Dauid,</hi> The froward are set on fire through their pride, to trouble the lowly that maketh small account of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. To be short, hee is full of vainglorie, enuie, and trouble, according vnto this saieng of <hi>Salomon,</hi> Among the prowd there is alway debate. <hi>Plato</hi> in his Lawes sayth, That hee which is prowd of his riches &amp; honour, &amp; burneth with a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieng in himselfe as though he needed no prince or guide, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himselfe on hand that hee is able enough of himselfe,

               <p>After that maner befell it to <hi>Osias</hi> king of Iuda, a good man, for in the end his heart was puffed vp, and he would needs offer sacrifice to God, whervpon ensued that he was by and by punished with a leprosie. Through pride &amp; ouerwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Dathan, Coree</hi> and <hi>Abiron,</hi> moued sedition against <hi>Moses,</hi> and would needs be equall with him, but the earth swallowed them vp quicke. <hi>Herod</hi> taking pleasure in the flatterie of the people, which said, That his words were the voice of God and not of man, was eaten vp of lice; so odious is that vice vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God. Thereof it commeth that it is said, not that God forsaketh the proud, but that he resisteth them; to shew that he will fight against them with his power, so greatly doth he abhorre that vice, according to this saying of the Psalmist, Thou didst cast them downe when they aduanced themselues. <hi>Virgill</hi> seemeth to approch hereunto, when he saith, That they which humble themselues are to be pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, and that the proud are to be encountered and subdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For as <hi>Herodotus</hi> saith,<note place="margin">God wil haue none to be great but himselfe.</note> God will not haue any other than himselfe to report or make himselfe great. The proud man ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer escapeth vnpunished (saith <hi>Seneca</hi>) and whensoeuer yee see any man praise himselfe out of measure, and more than is due vnto him, yee may assure your selfe, (saith <hi>Euripides</hi>) that Gods vengeance followeth hard at hand. <hi>Froisard</hi> saith, That <hi>Philip</hi> king of France, and <hi>Iohn</hi> his sonne, and the prince of Wales, lost Gwyen by their ouer-haughtinesse, and that king <hi>Charles</hi> recouered it by gentlenesse, bountifulnesse, and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie. <hi>Dauid</hi> was proud of the multitude of his people, but God to humble him, bereft him of a great part of them, and

S. <hi>Paule</hi> giueth vs an excellent one in his Epistle to the Philippians, where he saith, That we must go through with the worke of our saluation in feare and trembling, because it is God that worketh in vs, and therfore the more good we doe, the more cause haue we to stand in fear. And S. <hi>Peter</hi> in his first epistle, giueth vs the feare of God for a remedie, When any man speaketh (saith he) let him speake as the words of God, that God may be honored and glorified.</p>
               <p>The second meane to keepe vs from this vice, is to make little account of ourselues, and to humble ourselues when we be aduanced to dignitie, according to <hi>Ciceros</hi> precept in his Duties, and to the principle of the Gospell, which saith, That he which humbleth himselfe, shall be exalted, and hee that exalteth himselfe shall be brought low. And in <hi>Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticus</hi> it is said, The greater that thou art, the more see thou that thou humble thy selfe in all things, and thou shalt find fauour at Gods hand.<note place="margin">Humilitie <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

When <hi>Philip</hi> spake more loftilie after the winning of a battell than he was wont to doe afore, one willed him to measure his shadow, and he should find that it was no greater after the battell, than it was afore. This saying caused him to humble himselfe so well, that thenceforth he spake not more loftily than he had bin wont to doe, giuing one of the grooms of his chamber charge to put him in reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance euerie mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that he was a man. For there is none so insolent (saith <hi>Plutarch</hi>) as he that is carried away with an opinion of being happie. And as saith <hi>Gui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And when it was demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of him, Wherof that sadnesse proceeded? he said, He had no cause of heauinesse, but did it because he had bin too well pleased the day afore, and therfore intended to chastise and moderate the intemperance of his ioy by that meanes, There are manie that do now adaies as <hi>Epaminondas</hi> did, and are outwardlie modest, but inwardly they burne with ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

And therfore <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> reputeth him to be blessed, in whose heart there dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth no hypocrisie, nor any point of deceit. In the time of <hi>Alexander,</hi> the world did wonderously commend the fruga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of <hi>Antipater,</hi> who led a stoure life, without any delicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of meat and drinke or apparell. But <hi>Alexander</hi> said of him, That outwardly he was clad all in white, and inwardly all in purple; meaning that it was but a counterfait kind of sparing, and that within he was ful of ambition. Of which sort also was <hi>Diogenes,</hi> who vsing a streight kind of life, as much for ostentations sake, as for loue of vertue, did wash himselfe often with cold water in wintertime: wherof when folke ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing pitie, desired him to vse no such hardnesse any more; <hi>Pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For when <hi>Diogenes</hi> vaunted himselfe to tread <hi>Platoes</hi> pride vnderfoot: you doe so indeed (quoth <hi>Plato</hi>) but with another greater pride; mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that <hi>Diogenes</hi> had more pride and presumption in his pouertie, than <hi>Plato</hi> had in his wealth.

of Naples, and holding <hi>Diepold</hi> an Almane besieged within Sarne, happened to be taken in a salie that <hi>Diepold</hi> made out vpon a desperate aduenture, and being prisoner was vsed cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously by <hi>Diepold.</hi> Who hauing caused him to thinke vpon the curing of his wounds, would haue sent him home againe, and haue put the kingdome into his hands. But <hi>Gaulter</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing too lordly a heart, answered, that there was not so great a benefit, nor so great an honour, that he would receiue at the hands of so base a person as he was: with which words <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>epold</hi> being prouoked to wrath, threatned him that he should repent it.

Had hee beene lowlie-minded, his imprisonment had profited him, and he had gotten a faithfull seruitor of <hi>Diepold,</hi> who would haue made the kingdome of Naples sure vnto him, wheras now through his passing pride, he lost both kingdome and life. <hi>Alfons</hi> of Arragon dealt not so, for when he was prisoner, he did so much by his gentlenesse and humilitie,<note place="margin">The fruits of Humilitie.</note> that he made his enemies to loue him, and practised with them in such sort, that they helped him to win the realme of Naples. <hi>Taxilles</hi> gained more at <hi>Alexanders</hi> hand by his humilitie, than hee could haue conquered in all his life, with all his forces and men of arms. And yet notwithstanding his humbling of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe vnto <hi>Alexander,</hi> was after a braue and princelie maner, somoning him to the combat with such words as these: If you be a lesser lord than I, suffer me to doe you good; If you be a greater lord that I, doe by me as I do by you. Well then (qd. <hi>Alexander</hi>) we must come to the encounter, and see who shal win his companion to do him good: and therwithal imbracing him in his arms with all gentlenesse and courtesie, in steed of taking his kingdome from him, as he had done from others, he increased his dominion. <hi>Herod</hi> by humbling himselfe before <hi>Augustus,</hi> saued and increased his kingdome. <hi>Plutarch</hi> saith, That <hi>Pirrhus</hi> could verie well skill to humble himselfe tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards great men, and that his so doing helped him verie much
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:6660:146"/>
to the conquest of his kingdome. <hi>Lois</hi> the eleuenth, king of France led the countie of Charrolois with so sweete and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly words, that he got the thing by humilitie, which he could neuer haue obtained otherwise, and by that means, wound him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe from all his enemies, and setled his state in rest and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quilitie, which had bin in great hazard, if he had vsed brauery towards him. The lowlines of <hi>Aristides</hi> did maruellous great seruice, to the obtainment of the victorie which the Greeks had of the Persians, at such time as he agreed to the opinion of <hi>Miltiades,</hi> and willingly yeelded him the soueraigne authority of commanding the armie: For there were many captaines, which had euery man his day to command the whole armie as generals; but when it came to <hi>Aristides</hi> turne, he yeelded his preheminence into the hands of <hi>Miltiades,</hi> thereby teaching his other companions, that to submit a mans selfe to the wisest and to obay them, is not only not reprochfull, but also whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some and honorable; after whose example, all the rest submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themselues to <hi>Miltiades</hi> likewise. I told you in the chapter going afore, how he submitted himselfe to <hi>Themistocles</hi> his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie for the profit of Greece. And I wil say yet further of him, that beeing sent with <hi>Cimon</hi> to make war against the Persians, both of them bahaued themselues gently and graciously to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Greeks that were their allies: on the other side, <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanias</hi> and the rest of the captains of Lacedemon, which had the soueraine charge of the whole armie, were rough and rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus to the confederate people.

Now there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing higher than God, and therfore humilitie exalteth men, because it maketh them subiect vnto God. And as S. <hi>Chriso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom</hi> saith, It is the mother, the root, and the good of all goods.

And S. <hi>Peter</hi> who praied the Lord to depart far from him vretched sinner, was a foundation of the church. For there is not a more acceptable thing vnto God, than to mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster a mans selfe among the greatest sinners.

Also we see that ordinarily, the lowly prince is loued of euery man, and the proud is hated of all. And therfore let such as haue the gouernment of yoong princes, teach them cheefly among other things to be lowly and courteous towards all men; as knowing by experience, that nothing winneth mens hearts so much as humilitie, which kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vainglorie, Insolencie, Impatiencie, Enuie, Ambition, and all manner of vices.</p>

than to liue with dishonour, or to be conquered in battell. At a word, it is the dutie of prowesse, to be vnafraid of any dangers, which reason sheweth that we ought not to feare. <hi>Cicero</hi> in his Duties setteth downe three sorts of Prow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esse:<note place="margin">Three sorts of Prowesse.</note> the first consisteth in not fearing any thing; the second, in not making account of worldlie things; and the third, in beleeuing that there is not anie aduersitie, which a man is not able to endure. The same author in his first booke of the ends of good and bad, saith, That the strong-hearted and high-minded man, is free from all care and griefe; considering that he despiseth death, and is so fully resolued concerning sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, that he alway beareth a mind, that the greatest mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are ended by death, the smallest haue euer some release, and the meaner sort we ouer-master, either induring them if they be tollerable, or patiently passing out of this life as from a stage, if they be vntollerable.

Vpon Prowesse doe depend, trauell, resolution, strength, boldnesse, magnanimitie, confidence, and sufferance. Not without cause doe we put trauell into prowesse,<note place="margin">Of Trauell.</note> for as <hi>Diogenes</hi> said, No trauell is praise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie, which tendeth not to magnanimitie, and such trauell is to bee vnderstood, as well of mind, as of bodie: For in strength (saith <hi>Socrates</hi>) and in prowesse, there goeth a mouing both of bodie and mind. And co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly all good capteins haue put the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues to trauel as much as was possible, both with bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and mind, as we read of <hi>Alexander,</hi> who of a great courage
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:6660:148"/>
rowed ouer waters, scaled towns, and put himselfe foremost in perils and pains-taking. <hi>Pirrhus, Hannibal, Sertorius,</hi> and <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> did the like, and so did many emperors also, who sticked not to march fiue or six leagues on foot with their armies, put themselues into the water vp to the knees to passe a large mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish of a two or three leagues ouer, ate of the same bread that their souldiers did, endured hunger and thirst, and slept vpon the hard ground, as I haue said hertofore.</p>
               <p>Next I say,<note place="margin">Of Resolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> that Resolution is requisit in a man of prowesse and valor: for the very substance of prowes, is to be resolut. For resolutenes keepeth a man from wauering, so as hauing deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minatly set honor and vertue before him as his marke to shoot at, he feareth not any impediment that may crosse him. <hi>Leoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> chose rather to die with three hundred men whom he had all resolute to die with him, than to abandon the place which he had taken to keepe, notwithstanding that he was sure he should be ouerlaid with force: And when one said vnto him, the sunne was hidden with the shot of the Persians; So much the better for vs (quoth he) for then shall we fight with them in the shadow. One asked of <hi>Agis</hi> how many Lacedemonians he had to the wars; Enow (quoth he) to chase away the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. Also he said of them, That they demanded not how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie their enemies were, but where they were. <hi>Sceua</hi> a Iew ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing long time defended euery man, at the last after much slaughter by him made, abode still hauing his eies stopped, his head, his armes, and his thighes broken, and his sheild striken through in sixscore places. I see no resolutenes comparable to the Machabees, who to maintaine their lawes, offered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to all perils, and in the end rebelling against <hi>Antiochus,</hi> did with three thousand men discomfit forty thousand. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise <hi>Eleasar</hi> thinking to kill the king, whom he tooke to haue bin him that was mounted vpon the greatest Elephant, ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ong, and did so much that he killed the Elephant, and died himselfe vnder him. And <hi>Iudas Machabeus</hi> chose ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to die than to flee in battell, though he had but few men in comparison of his enemies. Likewise <hi>Ionathas</hi> the third bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:6660:149"/>
renued his armie being broken, and carried away the victorie. The Christian martyrs were resolute to die, rather than to doe sacrifice to idols: and with that resolution they endured death, and all maner of torments with wonderfull constancie.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Of Strength.</note>Strength also is needfull to prowesse, so as it behoueth good courage to be accompanied with strength, that it may put in execution that valeancie and noblenes of heart. <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sthenes</hi> said, That a man ought to will al the good in the world to his enemies, sauing only prowesse: because all his goods should come one day to him that is valeant. And whensoeuer he saw a braue dame, and well appareled, he was wont to go to hir husband, and to pray him to shew him his horses and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor: and if he found them good and well prouided he said no more to the woman: but if he were not well horsed and well armed, he would desire him to take from hir all hir goodly iewels, for feare least they became a pray vnto some other, for want of a man of desend them.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Of Boldnesse.</note>Likewise Boldnes is necessarie to prowesse. And doth in some sort resemble it. Neuerthelesse as saith <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his <hi>Protagoras,</hi> there is a difference betweene prowesse and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. For ordinarily euery man of prowesse is bold, but euery bold man is not valeant and ful of prowesse.<note place="margin">The difference of Boldnesse and Prowesse.</note> For boldnesse may come by art, by furie, or by choler: but prowesse commeth of good education, and of a certaine inworking secret force and goodnes of nature. <hi>Cato</hi> seeing his sword salne among his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, tooke it vp againe as boldly and constantly, as if his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies had not ben there. We call this a Boldnes, howbeit not simply a boldnes, but rather a prowesse, because it had ben a shaine for him to haue lest his sword to his enemie. So then, there was a cause of this boldnes; otherwise it had ben but rashnes. Likewise the deed that <hi>Robert de la March</hi> did at the iournie of Nouara, was full of vertuous Boldnes accompanied with prowesse and naturall kindnes: for his fatherly affection made him to enter bareheaded but with one squadron of horsemen, into the thickest or the Suitzers that had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

<pb n="279" facs="tcp:6660:149"/>
gotten the victorie, to saue his two sonnes <hi>Florange</hi> and <hi>Iamais</hi> captains of the Lanceknights, who lay sore wounded vpon the ground, where he fought with such furie, that the Suitzers themselues maruelled greatly that hee could recouer them aliue out of so great danger. <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> perceiuing the Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uians, that is to say, the people of Turney, to haue the better hand, caught a buckler out of a souldiers hand that began to quaile, and taking his place, did such feats of arms, that all his armie tooke courage againe, and got the victorie. The same <hi>Caesar</hi> seeing his standard-bearer readie to flie, caught him by the throte, and shewed him the enemies, saieng, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wilt thou? Behold, these bee the enemies with whome we haue to deale. And he did so well by his Boldnesse, vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antnesse and words, that he woon the victorie. And in that case boldnesse was needfull. When <hi>Cirus</hi> the yoonger was about to giue battell, <hi>Clearchus</hi> counselled him to hold him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe behind the Macedonians; What say you <hi>Clearchus,</hi> qd. <hi>Cyrus,</hi> would you haue me to seeke a kingdome, and to make my selfe vnworthie of it? To put a mans selfe in perill to no purpose, is rash boldnesse: but if need require, a man must not be afraid, and he that is not so afraid, is deemed both bold and valiant. And as <hi>Plato</hi> sayd in his defence of <hi>Socrates,</hi> the man that is valeant and full of prowesse, is without feare. So that they are in an error, which say that prowesse is a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating of feare. As for Magnanimitie, it is the selfe same vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antnesse which hath respect to nothing but vertue, as shall be declared hereafter.</p>
               <p>As touching Confidence,<note place="margin">Of Confide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.</note> it is annexed to valeantnes, and victorie doth often depend theron. For the beginning of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest is an assuring of a mans selfe that he shal conquer, as <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> saith in the life of <hi>Themistocles.</hi> Wee haue seene with what confidence <hi>Alexander</hi> went to make war against <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> hauing but a handfull of men in comparison of him. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesilaus</hi> hauing but ten thousand men, nor only defended the Lacedemonians, but also willingly made war vpon the king of Persia. As <hi>Hanniball</hi> stood looking vpon the great and
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:6660:150"/>
braue armie of the Romanes, at the battell of Cannas, one <hi>Gisco</hi> said vnto him, That it was a wonderous thing to see so many men; It is yet much more woonderfull (answered <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niball</hi>) that in all that great host there is not one like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee. This confidentnesse made the Carthaginenses the more assured, when they saw their Generall take so great skorne, and so little regard of the Romane armie. Therefore it is neither rashnesse to bee confident, nor prow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esse to thrust a mans selfe into perill without cause, after the manner of that Lacedemonian which had leuer to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw his armie through his rash boldnesse and vain-glorie, than to shun the battell; not considering that in loosing himselfe, he lost a great number of his countrimen, whom <hi>Scipio</hi> would haue held so deere, that hee would rather haue saued one of them, than haue discomfited a thousand enemies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paulus Emilius</hi> being readie to giue battell to <hi>Perseus,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired his people without doing any thing, and lodged them in his campe, the which he had fortified. And when <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio Nasica</hi> and other yoong noble men of Rome, desired him to make no delay; I would make none (quoth he) if I were of your age: but the victories that I haue gotten in time past by deliberation, haue taught me the faults that are committed by such as are vanquished, and doe forbid me to goe so hotly to assaile an host, readie ranged and set in order of battell, afore I haue rested my people that are but newly arriued. <hi>Pericles</hi> neuer hazarded armie where he saw great doubt, or apparent likelihod of danger. And he thought them no good capteins which had gotten great victories by aduenturing ouer-far, but was wont to say, That if none other than he did lead them to the slaughter, they should abide im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall. Vpon a time when he saw the Athenians desirous to fight with the Lacedemonians whatsoeuer perill came of it, for wasting their territorie; When trees (quoth he) be crop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped or cut downe, they grow again within a while after: but when men are once lost, it is vnpossible to recouer them.</p>

For it behoueth oftentimes to put vp iniuries, and to heare mis-speeches of himselfe, without making account of them, which is the propertie of Magnanimitie, as I shall declare hereafter. Insomuch that the goodly precept of <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctetus,</hi> which commaundeth to beare and forbeare, is to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of nothing else than Valiantnesse, meaning that men must beare aduersities with a constant mind, and prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly courage, not suffering themselues to be dismaied by them, or to be corrupted by prosperitie.<note place="margin">Prowesse o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The fourth is called Furious, when a man fighteth vpon hatred, choler, or passion. In so doing he seemeth couragious, because (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith) Choller is a great spurre to pricke one foorth to danger; yet notwithstanding he is not so: for as soone as his rage is ouer, he beginneth to wexlasie, and is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be gone at the least intreatance that can be.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aristotle</hi> in the eight of his Morals.

Likewise the foole-hardie see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of great courage though he be not so, because hee put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth himselfe foorth to danger without cause. But men ought in all things to deale by reason: for that which done with reason, is wel-beseeming and commended of all men, and that which is done otherwise, is blamed. Such as discerne not good from euill, thinke a man to be of great courage, because he seemeth so, whereas indeed it is either rashnes, follie, or rage, that maketh him to seeme so: as we read of <hi>Coriolan,</hi> who when he was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned of the people, shewed not any greefe and that (as saith <hi>Plutarch</hi>) was not through any drift or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasion of reason, or through any calmenesse of disposition, that made him to beare his mis-fortune patiently and meeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but through a vehement despight, and desire or reuenge, which carried him so forciblie away, that he seemed not to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feele his owne miserie:<note place="margin">Despight ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a man to forgee the basenesse of a lasie and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing mind.</note> the which the common people suppose not to be sorrow, though it be so in deed. For when such griefe is set on fire, then turneth it into despight, and then forgoeth it the basenesse, lasinesse, and faintnesse which is naturall vnto it. And therfore as he that hath a feuer, seemeth full of heat; so hee that is chollericke seemeth as though a mans mind were puft out, and made greater and larger by his being in such disposition. The fifth kind is called Customarie, which is when a man hath alwaies bin woont to ouer-come, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:6660:153"/>
bin foiled, such customablenesse maketh him to goe the more boldly to the encounter. But if he found resistance, then would he flie as well as other men, for want of resolute pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose in valiantnesse. The sixt sort is called Beastlie, which is, when a man goeth like a beast to find his enemie, not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to be couragious, and that he will make resistance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, whereby it may befall him as I haue said of the other. The seuenth sort is called Vertuous, which is the true and only kind of Prowesse, as when a man warreth or putteth himselfe in danger, not by constraint, nor vpon choller, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, or ignorance, but because it is expedient and behoofful in reason to be done. As for example, a prince must not make warre, vnlesse it bee iust, and for the benefit of his realme, or for the tuition and defence thereof, and of his subiects, and not vpon ignorance, or for Ambition, or desire of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge.</p>

As for example, when it is said, That it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth not to a man of Magnanimitie to doe wrong; this is a vertuous and iust deed, which bringeth honour to the man of Magnanimitie, and therfore we say, That Magnanimitie is an ornament to all vertues, because it maketh them the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in that the honor wheron the nobleminded man setteth his eye, surmounteth all things.</p>

but all things are in his hand, and nothing is out of his power. And in his first booke of Duties, We deeme it (saith he) the part of a noble courage and a constant mind, to be so firme and stable through the working of reason, as to make no rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning of the things which other men esteeme to be goodlie and excellent; and to beare the things in such sort which seeme hard and bitter, as he swarue not from the state of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,<note place="margin">The noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded-man is not trubled either with prosperitie or with aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie.</note> and from the dignitie which a wise man ought to haue: and that it is the point of a nobleminded &amp; constant man, not to be dismaied with aduersitie, nor to shrinke a whit from the place where he standeth, nor to step aside from reason.

               <p>The magnanimitie and constancie of <hi>Aristides</hi> was so great, that for all the honor that was done vnto him, he was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer high-minded, nor for any reiection, putting backe, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke, was neuer discouraged or troubled. <hi>Metelius</hi> hauing on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of a great number of senators, refused vpon perill of his life, to be sworne to a wicked law that was proclaimed by <hi>Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> a tribune of the people: said vnto his friends that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied him, That to doe euill, was too easie and too loitering a thing; and that to do well, where no danger is, was too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon a thing: but to doe good where danger is, that was the propertie of a man of honour and vertue. <hi>Cicero</hi> in the second booke of his Orator, saith, It is a great commendation to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure aduersitie wisely, and not to be discouraged by mis-for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, but to hold a mans selfe vpright, and to reteine his digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in the time of distresse.<note place="margin">He that hath a loftie cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nersitie is a noble minded man.</note> For there is not a thing more besee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming a noble minded man, than to be of great courage and loftie in aduersitie, the which would ill-beseeme him in pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritie.

For he that appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himselfe to great things, is called nobleminded; and he that dareth not aduenture vpon them, is called baceminded.

Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwise, the baceminded or faintharted man, becommeth wonderfully vainglorious of euery little peece of good fortune or aduauncement that befalleth him, and at euery little losse that betideth him, he shrinketh and is cast downe like an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, as if he had lost al, because he hath not the force of mind, to beare his fortune either good or bad.

As for example, <hi>Alexander</hi> liked not to haue the honor of winning the wager at the gamings of Olimpus, because there were no kings to encounter with him. This came of a noble and princely mind. But when he was to goe to the assault of a towne, or the giue battell: he was euer one of the foremost. The
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:6660:155"/>
second propertie of the nobleminded, is to reward vertuous persons, and such as haue imploied themselues in his seruice. Wherunto a king ought to haue a good eie, as I haue said in the title of righteousnes. The third propertie of the nobleminded, is to do but little, and not to hazard his selfe at all times. For a man cannot do great things easily and often. The fourth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, is to be soothfast, and to hate lying and all the appurte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances therof, as flatterers, talebearers, and such others, which ought to be odious, most cheefly vnto princes, who should be a rule to other men, as I haue said alreadie in speaking of truth, and shal speake againe hereafter in discoursing of vntruth. The fifth property of the nobleminded, is that he is no great crauer nor no great borower; assuring himself that nothing is so deerly bought, as that which is gotten by intreatance. Wherefore as for the emperors that hild out their hands at their court gates, to receiue presents and newy earsgists of the people: they were so far off from being princely minded, that they were rather to be esteemed inferior to rogues and beggars and al such like ras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cals. The sixt propertie of the nobleminded, is that he passeth not whether he be praised or dispraised, so long as he himselfe do well: of which sort was <hi>Fabius Maximus,</hi> who regarded not to be called a coward, but went forward continually with his platform of the ouerthrowing of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> without giuing him battell of hazarding any thing. <hi>Pericles,</hi> what outcries so euer men made vpon him, forbare not to go vnto the multitude, but did like the good pilot of a ship, which giueth order for all things in the ship, without staying at the teares and shriekings of the passengers, tormenting themselues with the terror of the storm.<note place="margin">Magnanimity passeth not for vaine tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moils.</note> For magnanimitie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sisteth, not only in despising death, but also in not regarding the vaine discourses and turmoiles, of such as vnderstand not what the matters meane.

And as <hi>Xenophon</hi> saith in his first booke of the Trainemnt of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> It is agreeable to reason, that such should prosper in their affairs, as are skilfull in them, and be diligent in going forward with them, rather than they that are ignorant and flouthfull.<note place="margin">A prince should passe his subiects in diligence.</note> And a little after he sayth, That a prince ought to indeuor to passe his subiects, not in sloth and idlenes, but in discretion and diligence. <hi>Plutarch</hi> sayth, That as water corrupteth that is not resored to: so the life of idle folke is corrupted and marred by sloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes, because none are helped by them. <hi>Thucidides</hi> repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth <hi>Alcibiades</hi> to haue said, That a citie giuen to idlenes did marre and corrupt of it selfe; but did vphold and amend it self in experience of many things by keeping it self occupied with diuers wars. We see ordinarily, that such as haue giuen o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer themselues in idlenes, haue had ill successe in their affairs: of which sort was <hi>Galba,</hi> who said that no man was to yeeld ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his idlenes, contrarie to the christian doctrine, which teacheth vs that we must yeeld account of all our idle words, and that we must put forth our talent to profit, vnder paine of punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; also co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie to the law of <hi>Draco,</hi> which punished

And <hi>Solon</hi> ordained that the high court of <hi>Areopagus,</hi> should haue authoritie and charge to enquire whereof euery man liued, and to punish those whom they found idle and vn-occupied.<note place="margin">An armie must not be su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And <hi>Scipio</hi> said he was neuer lesse alone, than when he was alone: because that when he was alone, he busied himselfe as well as when he was in the senat. Among the great affairs wherewith <hi>Alexander</hi> was occupied, he would now and then take some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation; but during those weightie affairs, there was neither feast, nor banket, nor play, nor marriage, nor any other pastime that he would stay vpon.<note place="margin">The diligence of <hi>Iulius Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> obtained many victories by his diligence, in such wise that he amased the Carnuts, that had reuolted from him. For he passed the mountaines with such speed, that hee was in their countrie with his armie, in shorter time than a messenger could haue bin, and began to waste the countrie out of hand, afore they had any tidings of his comming: Wherewith, and with some losse that they had receiued in a battell, his enemies were so dismaid, that in the end they submitted themselues to his will. And as he was dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in war, so was he not idle in the citie: but was occupied in pleasuring his freinds, in doing iustice to euery man, and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the affairs of the stare with great speed and skill; in so much that hee did bring the yeare into that order which we haue at this day, and was about to haue set the ciuill law in order of art.</p>
               <p>Albeit that the lord of Chaulmont had but few men, yet if he had gone speedily to the besieging of Bolonia, according to his former deliberation, hee had brought the Pope to such

a pinch, that he had driuen him to make peace, because there were but few people within the town.<note place="margin">The harme of going slowly about a mans businesse.</note> But by his ouerslow set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth to the siege, he lost the oportunitie, for in the mean time there came in sufficient force to encounter him. Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, <hi>Monsieur de Foix,</hi> by his hardines and diligence, did with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in fifteene dayes compell the armie of the Churchmen and of the Spaniards, to dislodge from before Bolona, discomfited <hi>Iohn Paule Baillon,</hi> with part of the Venetian companies in Campaine, and recouered Bresse by force of armes, where eight thousand men were put to the sword, and the rest were made prisoners. <hi>Hanniball</hi> was not onelie diligent, but also a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiser of all pleasures. <hi>Traian</hi> and <hi>Adrian</hi> were so diligent and skilfull in warre matters, that they knew the account of their legions, and called the most part of their men of warre by their names, the which they did so precisely, least vagabund strangers should intermeddle themselues, with them that were Romans born. And they permitted not any man, which could not good skill to handle his weapon and to fight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Epaminondas</hi> neuer gaue himselfe any respit from dealing in matters of the state, saying that he watched for his countri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens sakes, to the intent that they might make good cheare at their ease while he trauelled for them. <hi>Homer</hi> sayth, That it becommeth not a man of gouernment, and such a one as is to commaund manie, to sleepe the whole night.<note place="margin">Of ouermuch sleepe.</note> For too much sleeping is a spice of idlenesse, according to this saying of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> in his Prouerbes, <hi>Slouthfulnesse causeth sleepe to come.</hi> Whereof <hi>Plato</hi> speaketh after this maner, Ouermuch sleepe is not good, neither for the bodie nor for the minde, nor for the doing of any businesse; and that he that is a sleepe, is as a dead man. Wherefore whosoeuer will bee wise, and well aduised, must wake as much as he can, and take no more sleepe than is requisit for his health. For ouermuch sleeping feedeth vice, as <hi>Cato</hi> sayth in his paires of verses. <hi>Salomon</hi> in the twentith of his Prouerbs sayth, Delight not in sleepe, least thou become poore, but open thine eyes that thou mayest haue foyzon of food. And in the 23. chap. he saith, That ouermuch sleeping
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:6660:157"/>
maketh a man to goe in ragged clothes. For these considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the king of Persia caused a groome of his chamber to wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken him euerie day, and to bid him arise and intend to the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of his realme, as I haue said heretofore. Therefore the Prince that is wel aduised, will not giue himselfe to ouermuch sleeping, nor shut vp himselfe in a corner to do nothing, like to <hi>Domitian,</hi> who tooke pleasure in pricking flies to death, nor cast off all affairs to thrust out the time by the shoulders. For they that will disburden themselues of their affairs, haue commonly more to do than they would haue. And as the Greekes said in their common prouerbe,<note place="margin">A solitarie life is al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Adoxia,</hi> that is to say, The life that is without honour, or rather the life that is elendge and solitarie, is all one with the painfull life, because that they which thinke to liue without paine alone by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, are more troubled to defend themselues, from the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked which be not afraid of them, and therefore do vex them, than those which folowing some trade, do trauel for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weale. And as saith <hi>Thucidides,</hi> The rest that a man ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth through negligence, is more hurtful to a man than labor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some toile. That was the cause, why <hi>Darius</hi> would needs plunge the Babylonians into all maner of idlenesse, that they might not haue the heart to rebell afterward.<note place="margin">A policie of <hi>Cimon.</hi>
                  </note> The same poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie vsed <hi>Cimon,</hi> to diminish the force and power of his allies, by granting them whatsoeuer they required. After that the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians were driuen out of Greece, the allies of the Athenians ceased not to contribut both men and mony, towards the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of new warres, and the maintenance of an armie on the sea, wherof in the end they waxed wearie; &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidering with themselues that the Persians troubled them not, would not furnish them any longer with men and ships: well were they contented to pay monie for their fines; but the Athenian captaines inforced them thereunto, and condemned them at great fines if they failed. The which dealing made the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Athens to become hatefull to their allies. But when <hi>Cimon</hi> came to the gouerning of the state, he tooke the cleane contrarie way. For he did not compell or inforce anie man
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:6660:157"/>
to the warres, but was contented to take monie and emptie ships of such as listed not to serue in their owne persons: and he liked well of it that they should wax lasie and grow out of kind, by the allurements of rest at home in their houses; and of good men of warre, to let them become labourers, merchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and husband-men. And in their stead, he caused a good number of the Athenians to go into their gallies, in hardening them with trauell of continuall voiages. Insomuch that within short time after, they became lords of those that had waged and intertained them, healing themselues at their cost. And in the end they made those to be their subiects and tributaries, which at the beginning had bin their fellowes and allies.<note place="margin">Such as were but captaines, haue in the end made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues Dukes, Kings, &amp; Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors, by their dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</note> The like hath come to passe of diuerse captains that serued in the campe, and had the leading of armies: for in the end, of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains they haue made themselues dukes, kings, and emperors, as <hi>Vespasian,</hi> and other emperors without number. <hi>Tamerlane</hi> king of Tartars, <hi>Othoman</hi> king of Turks, <hi>Sforsa</hi> duke of Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan, and other great lords whom it would be too long to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. <hi>Nero</hi> and many others haue by their wickednes and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence lost their empires. <hi>Sardanapalus</hi> by his lasinesse, lost the kingdome of Assyria. So long as the kings of France suffered their affairs to be managed by others than themselues, they were lesse esteemed than an image, surely no more than liked the master of their Palace to allow the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who at length draue out the kings without gainsaying, as men of none account and vnprofitable. For it was the opinion of all men, that those were vnworthie to raigne and to commaund men, which were the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And as <hi>Salomon</hi> sayth in the 12. of the Prouerbs,<note place="margin">The hand of the diligent shal bear rule.</note> The hand of the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent shall beare rule, but the idle hand shall be vnder tribute. And in another placed, An idle hand maketh poore, but a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent hand maketh rich. The slouthfull person shall not gaine, nor haue whereof to feed, but the store of the diligent is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious. The slouthfull person wisheth, and his heart alwayes wanteth. The idle folke shall suffer famine, but the life of the diligent shall be maintained.<note place="margin">The slouthful man co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to penurie.</note> And in the 21. of the Prouerbs, The thoughts of the diligent tend altogither to abundance, but whosoeuer is slouthfull, shall surely come to penurie. And in the 36. Like as a doore turneth vpon the hinges, so doth the slouthfull man wallow in his bed. The sluggard hideth his hand in his bosome, and is loth to put it to his mouth. And in the 21. of Ecclesiasticus, The slouthfull man is like a filthie or mirie stone, whereof all men will speake shame. <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siodus</hi> sayth,<note place="margin">Not trauaile but idlenes is a foule thing.</note> That men grow rich by trauaile and diligence.

                  <hi>Aeschilus</hi> sayth, That vnto such as watch, god reacheth out his hand, &amp; liketh wel to help them that take paines.

person that is diligent, according to this saying of <hi>Salomon,</hi> in the 18. of his Prouerbs, That he that is slouthful at his worke, is brother to the scatter-good; therfore men must beware of idlenes. For as saith <hi>Theodorick</hi> writing to <hi>Festus,</hi> Like as mans nature is furnished by pains taking; so by sluggish idlenesse it decayeth and becommeth beastly.<note place="margin">Mens minds wax rusty and forgrowne by doing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</note> 
                  <hi>Plutarch</hi> saith that mens minds do rust and forgrow through idlenes; and that as the waters that stand vnoccupied in the shadow, do gather filth and infection: so the life of them that liue in idlenesse, if it haue any thing that may auaile, yet because it is not deriued vnto others, that other men may tast thereof, the natiue force and vertue thereof becommeth corrupt and stale. And by and by after, I am of opinion (saith he) that whereas we liue and are borne, and grow to be men, it is giuen vs of God to make vs to know him. Now if this be spoken of all men, who ought to employ themselues to all vertuous actions, and make their talent profitable: what shall we say of Princes, who haue that charge of purpose, not to hide themselues in a chamber, but to be alwayes doing, and to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell for those that are vnder their charge.</p>

                  <hi>Philo</hi> the Iew saith, That the soundnesse of the soule con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth in the good temperature of the irefull, lustfull, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable powers; whereof the reasonable, as ladie and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse, by means of Temperance, brideleth the other two as restie horses. <hi>Democritus</hi> was of opinion, that Valiant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse consisteth not onelie in ouercomming enemies, but also insubduing desires. And as <hi>Cicero</hi> sayth in his Duties, It is no reason that he which cannot be ouercome by feare, should be ouercome by his lusts: or that he which hath not shrunke for pains taking, should yeeld to his delights. An euill com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunder is he (saith <hi>Cato</hi>) that cannot commaund himselfe. For the patient man is better than the strong; and he that ouermaistreth his owne heart, is better than he that winneth a citie by force,<note place="margin">The difference betweene Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantnesse and Temperance.</note> saith <hi>Salomon</hi> in the sixteenth chapter of the Prouerbes. Neuerthelesse, this vertue differeth from Valiantnesse in this, that Valiantnesse vndertaketh things great, terrible, and difficult, and the other withdraweth men from the things that are pleasant and delectable. And like as Valiantnesse holdeth more of boldnesse than of feare, though it be the meane betweene them both: so Temperance being the meane betweene sensuall delightfulnes, and insensiblitie,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:6660:160"/>
approcheth nearer to insensibilitie, because it represseth the sensuall delight. <hi>Socrates</hi> said, That no man could be wise, which was not temperat. Saint <hi>Paule</hi> saith, That a good life consisteth in three things, namely Godlinesse, Vprightnesse, and Sobrietie; which sobrietie is nothing else but Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, when we abstaine from all lustes, and suffer not our selues to be ouercome by our desires. <hi>Mercurie</hi> saith, that tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance is a vertue that bringeth ioy,<note place="margin">Temperance maketh vs happie.</note> because wee become happie by abstaining from our lusts.

And like as Temperance appeaseth all desires, making them obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient vnto reason:<note place="margin">Intemperance vtterly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundeth the state of the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And therefore in the ten Commandements, we be forbidden to couet or lust after any maner of thing. For of this coueting springeth In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance, the roote of all euils, as Saint <hi>Paule</hi> after manie others calleth it in his Epistle to <hi>Timothie.</hi> And saint <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, That in this world is nothing else but coueting and lusting af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the delights of the flesh (vnder the which may be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended Lecherie, Slouth, and Gluttonie) and coueting after the delight of the eies (vnder the which are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehended the desire of riches) which containeth in it all maner of vsurie, robberie, niggardship and extorcion.

And <hi>Socrates</hi> (as <hi>Xenophon</hi> reporteth) was of opinion that that man could not be vertuous, that was a seruant to his delights, and that none but they which haue stay of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, doe say and doe that which is best; who chusing the good, and refusing the euill, do make themselues happie.

<pb n="302" facs="tcp:6660:161"/>
For out of that fountaine come all the mischiefs that we haue. <hi>Philo</hi> the Iew saith, That voluptuousnesse is likea harlot, who to enioy the man whom shee loueth, seeketh bawds to set her loue abroch, the which are the senses whom voluptuousnesse winneth first of all, by them to subdue the vnderstanding afterward. For the senses reporting within what they haue seene without, do represent vnto the vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, whatsoeuer they haue seene, and imprint in it the same affection. <hi>Antisthenes</hi> affirmed that he had leuer to be sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, than to be surprised with voluptuousnesse; for voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse bereaueth a man of his vnderstanding,<note place="margin">Voluptuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes bereaueth men of their wit.</note> no lesse than follie doth, and follie may be remedied by medicine, but so cannot the other. And when it was said vnto him, that it was a great pleasure to liue deliciously, I pray God (quoth he) that such pleasure may befall to the children of our enemies. At such time as <hi>Fabricius</hi> was Ambassadour vnto <hi>Pyrrhus, Cineas</hi> told him how he had heard a great Philosopher in Athens, counsell men to referre all their doings to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. Which thing seemed so strange to <hi>Fabricius,</hi> that he prayed God to giue such wisdome to <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> and the Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites. When one asked of <hi>Agesilaus,</hi>

And for that cause, when <hi>Darius</hi> had ouercome the Lydians, he ordained that they should vse perfumes, and that they should do nothing but daunce, leape, haunt tauerns, and be finely apparelled, to the intent that by that meanes becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming altogither effeminat, they might not haue the courage to rebell afterward. <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> seeing the Tarentines to be too full of dilicatenesse, and to set their minds to make warre with words more than with deeds: forbad all assemblies to feasts, to mumries, and to such other effects of ioifulnesse, then out of season, and brought them backe to the exercise of armes, shewing himselfe seuere to them that were inrolled in his muster-booke, and bound to go to the warres.</p>

<pb n="304" facs="tcp:6660:162"/>
it is to be sought so far foorth, as it is matched with profit, as health and strength of bodie are, the which we seeke for the benefit of them, and not the benefit for the pleasures sake. And as <hi>Aristippus</hi> saith, That man moderateth pleasure, not which abstaineth vtterly from it, but which vseth it in such sort, as he is not caried away with it, as we gouern a ship or a horse, when we lead them whether we list. For Reason (as saith <hi>Demosthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>) must be the mistresse of lusts. Also a man may take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the fiue sences of nature without offence, as when a man taketh delight in eating and drinking, because hee is well a hungred and a thirst, for the pleasure that a man taketh in his tast, commeth of sobrietie: and when a man scratcheth where it itcheth, that touching is not faultie; as for example, <hi>Socrates</hi> tooke singuler delight in rubbing himselfe after hee had indured the stockes.<note place="margin">The difference of the fiue sences.</note> Yet notwithstanding, ordinarily these two sences are most dangerous aboue all the other, when a man taketh more pleasure of them than he should doe, the which befalleth not to the other: as for example, if a man take pleasure in colours &amp; paintings, albeit there be too much or too little, yet is he not therefore accounted either temperat or vntemperat; neither he likewise that is too much giuen to the hearing of accounts, or of songs; nor hee that taketh too much delight in sents and smels, but rather they that delight in the sauours of meats and drinks, because that those sents re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new the remembrance of the things which they loue: as for example, the emperour <hi>Claudius</hi> at the onely sent of the rost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meat, that was prepared at a feast that was made for the Salian priests, did by and by leaue all his affairs, and went to dine with them. Also they that see or heare any speeches of the things which they loue, are tickled with some pleasure therof, which being entered in at the eies or the eares, taketh such root in the heart, that it is hard to put it away againe. For that cause when <hi>Sophocles</hi> beheld a faire yoong boy and commended his beautie, one told him, That it became him to haue not onely chast hands, but also chast eies. <hi>Candaules</hi> king of Lidia hauing a ladie of most excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t beautie to his wife, shewed her naked
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:6660:162"/>
to a friend of his named <hi>Gyges</hi>: but the sight of hir so inflamed the heart of <hi>Gyges,</hi> that he murthered the king, to marrie hir. The people of Bisance being besieged of <hi>Philip,</hi> sent Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors vnto him to know what iniurie he pretended to be done by them. And he sent them back againe without any good answer, saying that they were great fools, &amp; like to one that hauing a faire wife demanded of them that resorted often to hir,<note place="margin">Concupis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence the cause of verie great sins.</note> wherfore they came thither: meaning that the beautie of their town, made him desirous to win it. And for that cause doth our Lord and lawgiuer say, that he which lusteth after a woman sinneth as much as if he had to do with hir, by reason of the consent which he hath giuen to the sinne, the performance wherof ingendereth death. For when lust is once entred in, it is hard to keepe the rest from following after, or at leastwise to forbeare to giue attempt to obtaine the rest, as the iudges did to <hi>Susan, Dauid</hi> to <hi>Bersabee,</hi> and <hi>Tarquin</hi> to <hi>Lucreece.</hi> Well may we hear, see, and smel a far off; but we cannot touch or tast, but the things that are neere at hand. And that is the cause that we haue most delectation by those feelings. Moreouer, nature hath conueied into them, all the pleasantnes that she could, to the intent that that pleasure should maintaine al liuing wights, which cannot liue but by eating and drinking, nor be increased and continued without the act of copulation, specially the brute beasts, which would neither feede nor ingender, if they were not prouoked therto by nature. And as touching hounds which follow freshly vpon the sent of things, it is not for any pleasure that they haue in the hunting, but for the pleasure which they haue to eat it. The lion taketh no delight in the lowing of a bugle or an oxe, nor in the sight of a goodlie stagge, otherwise than by accident, that is to say for that he hopeth that it is meat prepared for him to dine vpon.<note place="margin">Temperance consisteth most in ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and in vse of women.</note> Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I say that temperance, consisteth chiefly and most peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly in eating and drinking, and in vse of women. And as <hi>Plato</hi> saith, Al things seeme to depend cheifly vpon three necessities and inward desires; of the which being well ordered, springeth the vertue of temperance, or contrariwise the vice of intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:6660:163"/>
if they be vnrulie. Two of them be in al liuing wights as soone as they be borne; namely, the desire to eat and to drink: and because euery liuing creature hath a naturall appetite, euen from his very birth, therefore is hee carried vnto it euen with a violent and forcible desire, and cannot abide to heare him that shall tell him he must doe otherwise. But the third necessitie, lust, or pregnant desire, which serueth for propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and generation, commeth a certaine time after, and yet it burneth men with a hote furie, and carrieth them with a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull loosenesse. These three diseases enforcing vs after that maner to the things that we most like of, must be turned to the better by feare, by law, and by true reason. S. <hi>Ierome</hi> writing to <hi>Furia</hi> sayth,<note place="margin">The lust of women is within vs, and therfore hard to oue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>come.</note> That this lust is harder to subdue that the others, because it is within vs, whereas other sinnes are without vs. As for example, Niggardlinesse may be laid downe by casting vp a mans purse a farre of: the railer is corrected, if he be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to hold his peace; a man may in lesse than an houre, change rich aparell into meane: only the desire which God hath endued vs withall for procreation, doth by a certaine constraint of nature, run to carnall copulation. Wherefore great diligence is to be vsed for the vanquishing of nature, that in the flesh a man may not liue fleshly. Some haue taken Temperance more largely, as <hi>Anaoharsis</hi> the Scythian, who said that a man ought to haue stay of his toung, of his bellie, and of the priuie parts. Which thing <hi>Plato</hi> hath declared more largely in his Phoedon, saying of the inordinat appetits of Intemperance, that there be diuerse sorts of names of them, according as they themselues are diuers. For the lust of things aboue the nauell concerning foode is called gluttony, and he that is possessed of that vice, is called a glutton; he that is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermaistered with drinking, is called a drunkard: that which forceth a man to the pleasute and ouerliking of a beautifull visage, and surmounteth reason in the desire thereof, is called loue: and the like may we say of all lust that ouermaistreth the opinion which tendeth to well doing. <hi>Pythagoras</hi> said that we must chiefly moderat these things; namely the belly,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:6660:163"/>
sleepe, the desire of the flesh, and choler, wherof I will speake particularly hereafter, after that I haue exhorted princes to Temperance generally, as to the vertue which is most neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie. For the desire of honour may lead a prince to prowesse,<note place="margin">Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

For the desire of hauing more, is the ordinarie vice of princes and great lords; so that if they desire women, banquets, or feasts, no man pulleth them back, but rather flatterers allure them thereunto. Wherfore it standeth them on hand to withdraw themselues from them and to beare in mind, that a man may be temperat without danger, but he cannot attaine to prowesse without putting himselfe in perill of warre. And the cause why valeantnes is preferred before Temperance, is, that valeantnes is the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to attaine vnto: But to haue the traine of vertues which consist in the sensitiue appetit; Temperance will obtaine more than valeantnes, which is peculiar to those that are hardie, and is hard by reason of the perill wherwith it is matched.<note place="margin">Wherin Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth.</note> But this vertue of Temperance is easie and void of all perill, and consisteth but in the contempt of volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuousnes, the which as S. <hi>Iohn Chrisostome</hi> saith in his xxij Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie,<note place="margin">Voluptuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes like to a dog.</note> Is like a dog: if you driue him away, he is gone; if yee make much of him, he will abide with you. <hi>Democritus</hi> saith that Temperance increaseth the pleasure of things.<note place="margin">Temperance increaseth pleasure.</note> Which thing <hi>Epicurus</hi> considering, who placed all mans pleasure in voluptuousnes, dranke nothing but water, ne ate other than crible bread, saying that he did it according to his profession, because it liked him better to eat little, and to vse meats that were least delicat. And yet neuerthelesse he gaue himselfe to Temperance, granting the thing in effect which he denied in his words, namly that vertue was the chief cause of pleasure. Also it is most commonly said, that ther is not a better sauce than appetit. And to haue grear pleasure of any thing whatsoeuer it be, a man must taste of his contraie, as of hunger to find meat sweet, and of thirst to feele drinke pleasant; after the example of <hi>Darius,</hi> who drinking vp a
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:6660:164"/>
glasse of water, good God (quoth he) from how great a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure haue I bin barred heretofore. <hi>Ptolomy</hi> in making a rode through the countrie of Aegypt, happened to want wherewith to dine, because his vittels followed him not, insomuch that for the hunger that pinched him, he was faine to eat a morsel of bread in a poor mans cottage, saying he neuer ate better bread nor with better appetite. <hi>Diogenes</hi> said, It was a strange thing, that wrestlers and singing-men despised their bellie and their pleasures; the one to haue a good voice, and the other to haue the stronger bodie: and that for temperance sake no man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded so to doe.<note place="margin">A notable precept for Temperance.</note> 
                  <hi>Isocrates</hi> in the exhortation which he giueth to <hi>Demonicus,</hi> giueth this precept for temperance worthy to be noted, Bethinke your selfe (saith he) to become temperat and staied, in the things which you would esteeme vile and shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, if your mind were hild down in them, as lucre, wrath, sensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, &amp; sorrow. Now it wil be easie for you to haue stay of your selfe, if you set your mind to the obtainment of the things that may increase your renowne, and not your reuenues. As tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching anger, you must vse no greater towards others, than you would that others should vse towards you. In the things that bring pleasure, you shall easily temper your selfe, if you consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what a shame it is for you to command your slaues, and in the meane while your selfe to be a slaue vnto voluptuousnes. Your sorrowes you shall be able to moderat, by beholding the miseries of other men, and by considering that you be a mortal man. And aboue all you shall be stirred vp to do good, if you consider that vpon that point dependeth pleasure. For in the idle life which seeketh nothing but feasting and cheering, the pleasantnes endeth forthwith togither with the pleasure: but when a man intendeth to vertue and purposeth vpon a sobriety in al his life,<note place="margin">What plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure is to be sought.</note> it giueth him a true ioy and a longlasting.

Againe he ware no gold nor precious stones: saying that a prince ought not to measure himselfe by the things which couer the bodie, but by the goodnesse and vertue of his mind. <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the life of <hi>Philopemen</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Voluptuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes maketh men nice and effeminat.</note> that by superfluitie and sumptuousnesse in houshold-stuffe, apparell, and fare, manie haue beene brought to seeke the delights, that make nice and effeminate the courages of such as vse them, because the tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the outward sense that is delighted with them, doth by and by soften and loosen the stoutnes &amp; strength of the mind. I say (quoth <hi>Agapete</hi> to <hi>Iustinian</hi>) that you are now rightly a king, seeing that you can rule and gouerne your delights, by wearing on your head the diadem of Temperance. A king is lord of al, but then specially when he ouerruleth himselfe, and is not subiect to euil lusts, but (by help of reason wherthrough he ouerruleth the vnreasonable affections) maketh himselfe lord and master by meanes of Temperance, ouer the lusts that bring all the world in subiection, which thing those could well skill to do, which haue had most estimation in the world. <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio</hi> was so temperat, that in foure and fiftie yeeres which he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, he neither sold nor purchased nor builded: and hauing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed two great cities, namely Numance and Carthage, yet he enriched not himselfe with the spoils of them; insomuch that at his death, he left behind him no more but three and thirtie pound of siluer, and two pound of gold. <hi>Paulus Aemilius</hi> had such stay of himself, that he neuer tooke one penie of the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of <hi>Perseu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And S. <hi>Ierom</hi> saith, in his rule of Monks, We cannot applie our selues to wisdome, if we set our minds vpon the abundance of the table; and that nothing but belly-cheare &amp; lechery do make vs to court riches. For this cause <hi>Salomon</hi> esteemeth them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy, that are vnder a king that is early at his feeding; that is to say, which is subiect to his mouth. <hi>Cato</hi> said, That we must take so much meat and drinke, as is requisit to maintaine the strength of the bodie, and not as shall accloy it. And as <hi>Cicero</hi> saith in his Duties, We must referre our feeding to the health and strength of our bodies, and not vnto pleasure. And <hi>Socrates</hi> saith, That we must so vse our feeding, as neither bodie nor mind be ouercharged therwith. And therefore Ecclesiasticus in the seuen and thirtith chapter saith thus; Be not greedie of thy meat, neither thrust thy hand into euery dish, for the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of meats procureth diseases, and of ful feeding breedeth choler.<note place="margin">A man of moderat diet prolongeth his life.</note> Many haue died of Gluttonie, but he that abstaineth shall prolong his life. Our Lord in the 21 of Saint <hi>Luke</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth vs to beware, that our hearts be not accloied with wine and meat. And S. <hi>Paule</hi> to the Ephesians, forbiddeth vs to take too much wine, as wherein lieth surfetting. <hi>Horace</hi> in the second of his sermons, describeth naturally the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and disco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie of too much feeding. <hi>Plinie</hi> saith, That simple meats are most wholsom for the body, &amp; that al sawses and sawcepikets are daungerous and deadly.

the world neither ate flesh nor dranke wine; wherein they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with our diuines, who put vs out of doubt, that the vse of flesh and wine was vnknowne afore the vniuersall flood. The Esseans liued longest of all the Iewes, because they did most abstaine, and vsed least daintie meats. There were three sorts of feeding in Persia, wherof the excellentest contented them selues with hearbs and meale. Saint <hi>Iohn Chrysostome</hi> in his fiue and fiftith Homilie saith,<note place="margin">A poore table is the mother of health.</note> That a poore table is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of health, and a rich table is the mother of diseases, as of headach, of quaking of the limbs, of agues, of gouts, and of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diseases more dangerous than hunger.

And our bodies cannot receiue a greater plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, nor a more rightfull, familiar and agreeable to nature: because that by that means men communicat, and participat of the selfe same vittels. <hi>Socrates</hi> did oftentimes banquet and gather good companies togither, whom he entertained well, howbeit soberlie and without superfluitie, delighting them more with his mirthfull and sweet talke, than with his meats and drinks. Insomuch that afterward, sober and merrie meals were called <hi>Socratissis</hi> meals.</p>
               <p>And this maner did <hi>Plato</hi> well hold still of his maister: For he entertained his guests well, but without anie superflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.

For temperate diet is the schoolmistresse of good and sage counsell, as said <hi>Sophocles. Epicurus</hi> said, That he should esteeme himselfe alway alike happie, so he might haue bread and water. For the appetite of eating and drinking, consisteth more in hunger and thirst, than in the delicatnesse of wines and meats. The Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians in stead of all other dainties, had for their first dish a broth that was blacke and of small taste, whereof notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing they made great account. <hi>Dennis</hi> the tyrant would haue tasted thereof, because they liked it so well; and he had a Lacedemonian cooke that prepared thereof for him: but when he had tasted of it, he liked not of it. Then said his cooke vnto him, that it was not to be wondered, if he misli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked it, seeing it was not seasoned as it should be, that is to say, with trauell in hunting and running,<note place="margin">The sawces of the Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians.</note> nor with hunger &amp; thirst, which are the sawces that the Lacedemonians vse to season their meats withall.</p>
               <p>On a time the queene of Caria gaue <hi>Alexander</hi> great store of delicate meats, for the which he thanked her: howbeit in taking them, he told her that he had much better than those, that is to wit, for dinner the iourney that he marched afore daylight, and for supper a small dinner. For a great dinner hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth a good supper, as <hi>Diogenes</hi> said to a yong man that ate nothing to his supper but Oliues; If thou hadst dined (quoth he) after this maner, thou wouldest not feed as thou dost.

Therefore we call him a glutton,<note place="margin">A Glutton.</note> which eateth either too much or too hastilie, or oftener than he needeth besides his ordinarie meales, or that seeketh delicate and daintie meats.<note place="margin">A Drunkard.</note> And we call him a drunkard, which drinketh out of measure. For, to drinke wine moderatly, is not forbidden. And as <hi>Anacharsis</hi> said, The first draught serueth for health, the second for pleasure, the third for shame, and the fourth for madnesse. For as <hi>Herodotus</hi> saith, Drunkennes putteth a man out of his wits, and makes him mad. <hi>Moyses</hi> forbiddeth the priests to drinke wine, or any other drinke that may make men drunken, during the time that they were in their course of sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plato</hi> in his common-weale forbiddeth magistrats wine, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time of the executing of their office, and also children vntill they be eighteene yeares old, for feare of putting fire to fire. For great heed ought to be taken, that we driue not youth into a setled disposition of furie. And after that time he will haue them to vse wine moderatly. And when they be come to fortie years, then they may drinke the more liberally, as a remedie against the waywardnesse of old age. And in the same booke, He that is full of wine (sayth he) both draweth

And therefore he saith, That a drunkard being set in any state of gouernment, whatsoeuer it be, vndoeth and marreth all, whether it be ship or armed chariot, or any other thing whereof he hath the guiding and gouernment. The Carthaginenses prohibited wine to their magistrats and men of warre, and so doth also <hi>Mahomet</hi> to all those that hold of his law. It was felonie for the magistrats of Locres to drinke wine, without the licence of a Phisition. And the yong Romans dranke no wine, afore they were twentie yeeres old.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Atheneus</hi> saith, That the Greeks neuer dranke wine with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out water, and that sometimes they put fiue glasses of water to one of wine, and sometime but two of water to foure of wine. <hi>Hesiodus</hi> will haue men to put three parts of water to one of wine. <hi>Sophocles</hi> mocked the poet <hi>Aeschylus,</hi> for that he neuer wrote but when he was well drunken.

stingeth like a serpent, and leaueth his sting behind him like an aspworme. At that time, thine eies shall see strangers, and thy hart shall vtter fond things. <hi>Plinie</hi> in the 14 booke of his naturall Historie saith among other things,<note place="margin">The inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences of drinking too much.</note> that it maketh the eies water, the hands quiuering, the nights vnquiet, lewd dreames, a stinking breath in the morning, and vtter forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse of all things. Moderate wine helpeth concoction, and the sinewes; and abundance thereof hurteth them. <hi>Esau</hi> by his gluttonie, lost his birthright. <hi>Noe</hi> by his drunkennesse became a laughing stocke to his owne children; and <hi>Lot</hi> delt shamefully with his owne daughters. Betweene a drunken man and a mad man,<note place="margin">Drunkennesse is a peti-madnesse.</note> is small difference. And as <hi>Crysippus</hi> saith, Drunkennesse is a peti-madnesse; as we read of <hi>Alexander,</hi> who in his drunkennesse was commonly furious. And as <hi>Strabo</hi> saith, Like as a small wind doth easily carie him away that is swaieng forward alredie, so a little greef doth easily make him mad, that hath taken in too much wine. And <hi>Sophocles</hi> saith, A drunken man is easily caried away with choler, and hath no vnderstanding: whereby it commeth to passe, that when he hath rashly discharged his tongue, he is constrained afterward whether he will or no, to heare of it at their hands of whom he railed in his lustinesse. For who so euill speaketh (saith <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siodus</hi>) shall shortly after heare more of it than he had spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. <hi>Theognis</hi> saith, That as gold is tried by fire, so is a mans mind by wine.<note place="margin">A mans dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrayed by wine.</note> For wine bereaueth him of all knowledge, and consequently of all aduisement and meane to dissemble, so as it is ill done to commit anie secrets to a drunkard. If a drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard offended in his drunkennesse, <hi>Pittacus</hi> would haue him punished with double punishment, that he should the rather abstaine from drunkennesse.</p>
               <p>The Romans did put them out of the Senate, that were drunkards. In old time a man could not put away his wife ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept she had beene an adultresse,<note place="margin">A remedie for drunkennesse.</note> a witch, or a wine drinker. To eschue this vice, we will take the remedie of <hi>Anacharsis</hi>; who counselled them that were subiect to that vice, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold how drunken men behaued themselues, or rather (as

                  <hi>Pithagoras</hi> said) to bethinke them of the things that a drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken man hath done. That was the cause why the Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians made their bondslaues drunken, that their yong folk might learne to hate drunkennesse, when they saw those poore soules out of their wits, and scorned at all hands. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore it is to be considered, what mischiefs haue come of drunkennesse, whereof all stories are full: as how the armie of <hi>Thomiris</hi> was discomfited by <hi>Cyrus,</hi> for that they hauing drunke too much, were laid downe and falne a sleepe. How the citie Abida in Mesopotamia was lost by drunkennesse, because the men that were set to gard the tower of Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomethere, hauing drunke too much, were falne into so deep a sleepe, that they were surprised by their enemies, and slaine afore they could awake. In general for frugality, we must haue the vertue of Temperance before our eies, which warneth vs to follow reason, and to eschue superfluitie of eating and drinking, vnder colour that we haue whereof to make good cheere; and say as <hi>Alcamenes</hi> did, who being vpbraided that he liued so sparingly and poorely for the riches that he had, said, That he which hath great reuenues, ought to liue accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to reason, and not at his pleasure. For frugalitie doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way well beseeme a Prince, so long as it proceed not of ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardship.

Also <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> was sober, and a small drinker, and it was said of him, That he was the onely sober man that went about to ouerthrow the state; as who would say, the subuerting of states belonged ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to drunkards and giddi-headed persons, than to men that are sober and discreet. <hi>Romulus</hi> was sober, and a small

And when it was said of him, That if all men did as he did, wine would be good cheape: Nay (quoth he) it would rather be deare if euerie man should drinke as much as I do, who do drinke as much as I list. <hi>Tiberius</hi> as if he had beene a very thriuing and sparing man, would be serued the next day, with the meats that had been dressed for his supper the night afore, with a pretence of nigardship: but to say the truth, it was but to mocke and deceiue the world: for at the last he would drinke well. By meanes whereof, when he was yet a yong man long afore he was emperour, being in the campe, in stead of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> he gate himselfe the name of <hi>Biberius,</hi> and in stead of <hi>Claudius,</hi> he gate himselfe the name of <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi> and in stead of <hi>Nero,</hi> he gat himselfe the name of <hi>Mero.</hi> And good cause why: for he bestowed two dayes, and one night together, in nothing else but eating and drinking with <hi>Pomponius, Flaccus,</hi> and <hi>Lucius Piso,</hi> to whom he gaue great presents, and committed vnto them the managing of great affaires, in recompence of their gluttonie, calling them men for all hours.</p>

Which thing Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> intending to shew vnto vs, saith in the fourteenth of the Apocalips, That he saw a hundred and foure and fortie thousand men, which sung a new song before the throne of God, and that none other but those hundred and foure and fortie thousand could sing that song.

And such as cannot be so, haue mariage for their remedie, wherein a man may liue chastly, when the man keepeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to his wife, and the wife to her husband, according to the precept of Saint <hi>Paule,</hi> and of <hi>Salomon,</hi> who saith, Let thy wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beloued seruant keepe companie with thee; meaning his wife. And let vs drinke of the water of our owne cup, of our owne pit, or of our owne well, to the intent to debarre the vice of adulterie, which oftentimes causeth the ruine of realmes and common-weals. <hi>Nero</hi> being wicked and incestuous, said, There was not a chast and continent person in the world, but onely that most men cloked the vice by subtiltie and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie. And because he was so much giuen to that vice him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, he thought it vnpossible for any man to be cleare. Yet notwithstanding it is said of <hi>Laelius,</hi> That in all his life he neuer had to do with anie other than his owne wife, and that after her death, he neuer knew anie other. <hi>Iulian</hi> the Emperour liued in continuall continencie after the death of his wife, notwithstanding that he was a yong man. There are manie men and women, both Greeks &amp; Romans to be found, which haue beene maruellous chast and well staid. <hi>Porcia</hi> the sister of <hi>Cato,</hi> said, That the chast woman neuer marrieth more than once. Men attribute the continencie of <hi>Xenocrates,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The continen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of <hi>Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates.</hi>
                  </note> to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine insensibilitie: But he was too wise, and too great a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonage, to be without any feeling: for he was a Philosopher of great renowme, temperat and well staid in all things, such a one as passed little for monie, women, and other pleasures, but continued alwaies as sad and graue as was possible; whom <hi>Plato</hi> counselled to offer sacrifice to the graces, that he might become more courteous and gracious. In his time there was the most beautifull and gentle courtisan of the world, named <hi>Phrynee.</hi> Now certaine yong men laid a wager with this <hi>Phrynee,</hi> that they would lay a man by her, that should not be moued by her beautie, nor by all her daliances. When the wager was made, they made the said <hi>Xenocrates</hi> to be laid in a faire bed, and the curtisan taried not long after ere she came into the bed vnto him, where she forgate not any thing
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:6660:170"/>
that might serue to kindle a mans courage, though he had bin of marble: finally after many kissings, touchings, and wanton daliances, all that euershe could win of him that night, was that she was faine to leaue him as she found him. The next morning hir paramours came to know whether they had won or lost. <hi>Phrynee</hi> confessed that the philosopher was not moued at all with her daliances. And when they required the monie which she had lost vpon the wager; she answered them, that she had made her wager of a man, and not of a block: truly in the opinion of the couetous and vnchast, he was a very block &amp; sencelesse; but in very deed he shewed himselfe to be well staied and a right philosopher, in that he could so well skill to ouermaister his affections, specially considering that the courtisan would haue triumphed ouer him and his philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie, in maintenance wherof he stood so resolutly grounded, that it was not possible afterward for the courtisan, to make him to stoope to the feats of hir amorous temptations. And so this his doing proceeded not of any grosse insensibility, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of a gallant mind that stood resolute in his purpose. After which manner wee read of certaine saints and martyrs, which by the grace of God did wonderfull deeds of chastity, resisting such temptations with inuinsible courage, whom we will omit for shortnes sake,<note place="margin">The conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph.</hi>

At whose continencie S. <hi>Iohn Chrisostome</hi> maruelling saith, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the nineteenth of Genesis, That it is not so great a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that the three children ouercame the fire in the furnace at Babylon, as it is wonderful and rare that this righteous man, being in this furnace of the incontinencie of the Aegiptian woman, far more dangerous than the furnace of Babylon, abode safe and sound, and so waded out of it, keeping the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of his chastitie pure and cleane.

I know well that some euen of nature are too cold, and othersome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine be too whot, and too sore giuen to flesh: but yet reason and resolutenesse aided by the grace of God, get the vpper hand. <hi>Polemon</hi> king of Licia was put away by his wife, for being to rough in dealing with her, as witnesseth <hi>Iosephus</hi> in his twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tith booke of his Antiquities. Among the greatest praises that <hi>Mahomet</hi> giueth to himselfe, he vaunteth in his Alcoran, that he had not his fellow in that feat.

As touching the goods of the bodie, it is certaine that a man cannot be beautifull and well disposed, if he be giuen to that pleasure. For as <hi>Cicero</hi> saith, An vnchast youth yeeldeth an ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worne bodie vnto old age.

Wherefore we must persuade our selues to do so, by custome without law writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and think it a shame and note of insamie, to do otherwise. And if it could be, a law should be made, that no man might touch any woman but his wife, nor beget bastards vpon concubines, and that if any man kept a concubine, he should be proclaimed as an infamous person, and be depriued from all honor and offices of the citie or common-weale.<note place="margin">Incontinencie maketh men to grow out of kind.</note> As tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the mind, nothing doth so much abate it and make it to grow out of kind.

               <p>It would require a whole booke, to number the mischieues that haue come thereof, and to shew the alterations that loue hath wrought in the minds of men. And as <hi>Parmeno</hi> sayth
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:6660:172"/>
in Terence, It is a strange thing, to see how men are altered by loue, and how a man that was well staid, and sterne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth loose and ill disposed through loue.

               <p>We read in the 19. chapter of the Iudges, what a bloodie battell there was betweene the Israelites and their fellows of the tribe of Beniamin, for a Leuits wife that was rauished by them; in which battell there died three score and fiue thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand men on both sides, and in the end the Beniamits being ouercome, were faine to accept such conditions as their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours would giue vnto them. <hi>Alexander</hi> would neuer giue himselfe to loue, vntill he was lord of Asia, for feare of being vanquished. And therefore he would not see the wife and daughters of <hi>Darius,</hi> for feare to be caught in loue by them, saying commonly, that the ladies of Persia were eye-sores vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. And albeit that vain-glorie made him so to do, for feare least he should haue beene hindered in his enterprise: yet he saw well that a man which doth such things, could not prosper. And as long as he set not his mind that way, his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires went well, and he purchased great praise, yea euen at the hand of <hi>Darius</hi> himselfe, who hearing of a truth how the world went with his wife and children, besought God that he might haue none other successour but <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander.</hi>

Anon the ladies departed, in whose stead yong men attired like women, were brought in to the banquet; at whose comming, the Persians began immediatly to handle them ouerbold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But the yong men set hand to their weapons, and slue them euery chone not one excepted. <hi>Ioane</hi> queene of Naples was hanged vp for her aduoutrie in the very same place where she had hanged her husband <hi>Andreasse</hi> afore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was not a lustie companion to her liking.

Let vs now speake of punishments ordained by lawes.<note place="margin">The punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulterie.</note> The Persians were rigorous in punishing adulterers; and likewise the Aegyptians, who pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished the adulterer with a thousand lashes of a whip, and the adulteresse by cutting off hir nose. And somtimes (as saith <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi>) they did cut off the priuie members of him that had deflowred a gentlewoman, because of the corrupting and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding of issue. <hi>Herodotus</hi> reporteth, That <hi>Feron</hi> king of Aegypt, did cause all the women in a citie to be burned, whom he vnderstood to be adultresses. The same king had beene blind ten yeares, and the eleuenth yeare the Oracle told him, that he should recouer his sight, if he washed his eies in the water of a woman, that had neuer had to do with any other than hir husband. First he made triall of his owne wiues wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but that would do him no good: and afterward of infinit others, which did him all as little; saue onely one, by the rubbing of his eies with whose water he reeouered his sight, and then put all the rest to dearh. By the law of <hi>Moses,</hi> adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous persons were stoned to death, as appeareth in the one and twentith of Leuitticus, and in the two and twentith of Deuteronomie; and afore that also in eight and thirtith of Genesis. The law Iulia, punished both the offenders with death, whereof there is an expresse title in the Digests. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticus speaking of an adulterous woman, saith, That hir children shall not take roote, and that her braunches shall not beare fruit.

                  </note> Now must I treat of the means to auoid this inconuenience. Saint <hi>Paule</hi> giueth one, which is verie certaine, that is to wit, mariage. Another reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die is, to eschew occasions. For there is more pleasure in not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring, than in enioying. When one demaunded of <hi>Sophocles,</hi> whether he gaue himselfe to women still in his old age, or no? No (quoth he) I haue withdrawne my selfe from it, and haue left vp that trade, as a wicked, wild and harebraind maister. Occasions are eschewed, by the eies, by the toung, and by the eares. By the eies, when a man turneth them away from loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vpon faire women, as I haue said of <hi>Alexander,</hi> and diuers others. <hi>Cyrus</hi> would neuer see the beautifull <hi>Pantea:</hi> And when <hi>Araspes</hi> one of his courriers told him, That her beautie was a thing worthie the beholding; Euen therfore (quoth he) is it best to abstaine from seeing her. The same cause (as wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth <hi>Iosephus</hi> in the eleuenth booke of his Antiquities) made the Persians not to shew their wiues vnto strangers. And as <hi>Tertullian</hi> saith in his treatise of the veiling of Virgins,<note place="margin">Of the veiling of maidens and maried women.</note> The Corinthians veiled their maidens. Contrariwise, the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonians did let them go vnueiled, that they might get them husbands: And when they were maried, then they veiled them. <hi>Sulpitius Gallus</hi> did put away his wife by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorce, because she went abrode bare faced, as <hi>Valerius</hi> saith in his sixt booke: but that was but a slender cause of diuorce. It is said in Genesis, That <hi>Rebecca</hi> couered her selfe as soone as she saw <hi>Isaac.</hi> This was not done without cause. For as <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> saith, Loue is nothing else but a well-liking of beautie, which carieth vs with an ardent desire to the obtainment of that which we couet. And <hi>Ouid</hi> writing to a certaine woman, saith, Would God thou wert not so faire, for then should I not be so importunate, but thy beautifull face enforceth me to be bold. <hi>Theocritus</hi> termed a faire face a mischiefe of yuory,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:6660:175"/>
because it is pleasant to see to, and causeth manie mischiefs. It is a speechlesse commendation, for it commendeth it selfe sufficiently without speaking. It is a kingdom without halber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; for the beautifull commaund euen kings, and without force obtaine what they will of them, yea and they be of such power, that some haue said (as <hi>Tertullian</hi> and manie others) that euen angels haue beene in loue with them, alledging the sixt chapter of Genesis, howbeit misvnderstood by them, the which thing Saint <hi>Iohn Chrysostome,</hi> writing vpon the same chapter, Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> in his booke concerning <hi>Noe</hi> and the Arke, S. <hi>Austen</hi> in his fifteenth booke of the citie of God, and all the right beleeuing doctors haue disprooued at large. If <hi>Paris</hi> had not seene <hi>Helen,</hi> the citie of Troy had not beene destroyed.<note place="margin">Sight is an intisement to adulterie.</note> If <hi>Dauid</hi> had not seene <hi>Bersaba,</hi> and <hi>Gyges</hi> the wife of <hi>Candaules</hi>: none of them both had beene murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers and adulterers both at once. If <hi>Caracalla</hi> had not seene his mothers thigh, he had not maried her. <hi>Suetonius</hi> saith, That <hi>Tiberius</hi> caused manie boyes and girles to come to Capree, whither he had withdrawne himselfe, that he might not be seene of the Romans in such lewd dealings. And he caused them to do a thousand villanous things in his presence, to delight his sight withall, and to quicken vp his lust, which was almost dead vnto such things. So that the surest way for a man, is to withhold his eies from the sight of all va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities. Next, a man must keepe himselfe from speaking foule and filthie speeches,<note place="margin">Speeches is an other intice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> and from hearing them spoken, as such men and women will do, as list not to read vnchast bookes, nor to heare ribaudrie talke, nor to come in place or compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie where such are read. For words spoken in ieast or in earnest, serue well to kindle the fire of loue, according to the answer that <hi>Popilia</hi> made, when one asked her why beasts endure not the male after they haue once conceiued, seeing that women endure them at all times: Because (quoth she) they be but beasts.</p>
               <p>The emperour <hi>Sigismundus</hi> widow, intending to marrie againe, albeit that in so doing she did no vnlawfull thing,

yet made she a meetly pretie answer, to him that would haue persuaded her to lead the rest of her life vnmaried, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the maner of the Turtle-doue, who neuer seeketh anie make againe, after she hath once forgone her owne. If you counsell me (quoth she) to follow the example of birds, why speake you not to me as well of pigeons and sparrowes, which after the death of their makes do ordinarily couple themselues with the next that they meet? A Vestall vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin named <hi>Spuria,</hi> because she was foule-mouthed, was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused of incest, and discharged by the censor, vpon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that she should no more speake filthily as long as she li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.

For by mens speech is it knowne how they be minded,<note place="margin">By a mans speech is his disposition knowne.</note> as <hi>Bacchus</hi> saith in Terence.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Iesus</hi> the sonne of <hi>Sirach</hi> in his seuen and twentith chapter, saith, That like as a mans labour maketh a tree to shew foorth his fruit: so doth a mans speech bewray the thoughts of his heart. <hi>Socrates</hi> said, That such as a man is, such are his affections: such as his affection is, such are his words; such as his words are, such are his deeds; and such as his deeds are, such is his life. <hi>Hiero</hi> king of Syracuse pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished the poet <hi>Epicharmus,</hi> because he had spoken wantonly before his wife: and verie iustly, for his wife was a true mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of chastitie. And vpon a time <hi>Hiero</hi> perceiuing himselfe to haue a strong breath, found fault with her that she had not told him of it. To whom she answered plainlie, That she had thought that all other mens breaths had had the like sent.</p>

                  <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his seuenth booke of matters of State,<note place="margin">Law makers ought to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish all filthie talke out of their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-weals.</note> saith, That lawmakers ought aboue all things, to banish all fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie and ribaudrie talke out of their common-weals; because the libertie of filthie communication, draweth vile and vnho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest deeds after it. And therfore <hi>Epictetus</hi> said, That amorous talke was an allurement vnto whordome. And for that cause Saint <hi>Paule</hi> to the Ephesians would not haue anie cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt word to passe out of our mouthes. By the lawes
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:6660:176"/>
of <hi>Romulus,</hi> He that spake any filthie words before women, was punished as a manslear. In the Digests vnder the title of Iniuries, we haue a notable book-case of <hi>Vlpian,</hi> who saith, That he which vttereth any filthie speech before women, although he staine not their chastitie, shall neuerthelesse be sued vpon an action of trespasse. And as men ought not to attempt the chastitie of women by lewd speeches: so likewise women must not prouoke men thereto, by too much decking and painting themselues. For, that is no better than an enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of men vnto whordome. And like as hunters lay baits vpon their snares, to allure wild beasts vnto them, and to draw them in; so do adulterers (saith Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi>) lay baits for the amorous, by their eies, by their speeches, and by their attires. And afterward they intangle them, and maske them in their nets, out of the which they suffer them not to scape, vntill they haue sucked out all their blood, and then they giue them a mocke for their labour.<note place="margin">The orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a good woman.</note> The ornaments of a good woman are meeldnesse, shamefastnesse, and chastitie. <hi>Poppea</hi> the wife of <hi>Nero</hi> was misliked of, for her ordinarie vsing of asses milke, to make her colour the fresher. What would they haue said, if she had euerie day vsed the Spanish white, and vermilion? A wife ought to go cleanly and comely appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled, but neither ought she to be painted, nor to be curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously attired: which thing <hi>Homer</hi> sheweth vnto vs, when he saith in his Iliades, That <hi>Iuno</hi> washed herselfe to do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the spots of her bodie, and then annointed her with oile after the maner of old time. But of the curiosities and fond tricks that are vsed now adayes, I will not speake at all. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly a woman must beware that she shew not herselfe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked: for that prouoketh men to do euill, and maketh women shamelesse.</p>

                  <note place="margin">A woman in stripping her selfe out of her clothes, strippeth her selfe of all shamefastnes.</note>As touching the first, the example of <hi>Caracalla</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are a sufficient testimonie vnto vs. And as touching the other, <hi>Herodotus</hi> assureth vs in his first booke, That a woman in stripping her selfe out of her clothes, bereaueth herselfe of all shamefastnesse. And Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> in his first booke of the
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:6660:176"/>
apparelling of maidens, will not haue them to be naked, or to be bathed; saying that in putting off their clothes, they put off also all shamefastnesse. And for that cause, Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> rebuketh sharply one <hi>Siagrius</hi> bishop of Veron, for ordaining that a certaine maiden should be searched vpon a pretended deflourment. As for the Lacedemonians, their short apparel, beneath the which a man might see their knees, and some part of their thighs, was ordained to make them the stronger, and the more warlike. But in verie deed, that kind of apparell was light. We haue yet one other great remedie of loue; which is, to eschue idlenesse: for idlenesse nourisheth loue, the taking away whereof breaketh <hi>Cupids</hi> bow. Therefore hunting and all exercises of trauell serue well to that purpose. And for that cause <hi>Phedria</hi> in Terence, promiseth that he will toile himselfe as much as he can during the absence of his louer, that his trauell may make him to rest without thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vpon her. Likewise, he that taketh paines, and is altogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther giuen to studie, is not subiect to Venerie. And in verie deed the Poets feigne that <hi>Diana</hi> and the Muses are enemies to <hi>Venus,</hi> and care not for <hi>Cupid.</hi> For it is hard that the man which hath any great conceit in his mind, should haue ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to thinke vpon the pleasures of <hi>Venus</hi>; or that he which hath his limbs tired with trauell, should desire any thing else than rest: howbeit that <hi>Caelius Rhodiginus</hi> in his eleuenth book of ancient Readings, maketh mention of a man, that the more he was beaten, the more feruently did he desire wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>

And good cause why, For speech bewraieth what a man is, as saith Ecclesiasticus. <hi>Periander</hi> one day de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded of <hi>Solon,</hi> whether he held his peace for want of abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie to speake, or follie. A foole (quoth <hi>Solon</hi>) cannot hold his peace: for the heart of the foole (saith Ecclesiasticus) is in his mouth, and the mouth of the wise in his heart. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when <hi>Socrates</hi> saw an ignorant person sit mute at the table: Thou hast (quoth he) but this one token of a learned man. And as <hi>Salomon</hi> saith in the sixteenth of his Prouerbs, The man that is of vnderstanding and skill, is sober in speech; yea, and the foole while he holdeth his peace, is counted wise: but he is to be hated which is shamelesse in speaking, and which for a drop of wit, flasheth out a whole flood of words.</p>

                  <hi>Macrobius</hi> saith, That an orator is seene by his speech, and a philosopher also is knowne by his holding of his peace, and by his speaking in their due times. And that could <hi>Isocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> well skill to tell one, which at a banquet desired him to say somewhat of the art of eloquence. For he answered him after this maner, I know not (quoth he) what time and place
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:6660:177"/>
require to be said, and that which I know, is not meet for this time and place. For as the sonne of <hi>Sirach</hi> saith, Some man holds his peace, because he discerneth the conuenient time. And therupon it commeth that in the thirteenth of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbs, <hi>Salomon</hi> teacheth vs that he which keepeth his mouth, keepeth his soule, and that he which openeth his lips rashly, shall feele hurt by it. And in the twelfth he saith, That he which keepeth his tongue, keepeth his soule from sorrow; and that he which bableth many words, woundeth his own soule. Againe in the same chapter he saith, That rash speaking is like the sting of an aspworme: but the toung of the wise is health.

Who art thou O man (saith the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist) that desirest to liue long, and to see good daies? Keepe thy tongue from euill, and thy lips from speaking guile. And therfore he praieth God especially, to set a watch before his mouth. And Ecclesiasticus saith thus, Who shall giue a watch to my mouth, and set a seale vpon my lips, that I fall not by meane thereof, and that my tongue destroy me not? And in another place,<note place="margin">Many words are not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fault.</note> Weigh thy words (quoth he) and put a bridle on thy tongue, and consider aforehand, least thou sin with thy tongue: for in many words must needs be some fault.</p>

But vpon the lips of the froward, there is as it were a burning fire. He that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not refraine from speaking, is like a citie that is open without walles. When the Lacedemonians sat downe to their meals, the eldest of the companie, pointing to the doore, said vnto them all, Let no word go out yonder: meaning that if anie thing were spoken freely at the table, it ought not to be blab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed out abrode. <hi>Sabellicus</hi> in the fourth Aenead of his fourth booke, saith, That in old time it was the custome of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians, to concele and keepe close all secrets, as a thing inioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them by their ancient discipline, vpon pain of their liues.

Among the vices of <hi>Thersites, Homer</hi> blameth chiefly his ouermuch bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. The Psalmist to shew the danger of the tongue, saith, That mens teeth are weapons, and their tongues arrowes and sharpe kniues, which may do much good, and much euill, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as they be applied, the one way or the other. The king of Aegypt sent <hi>Pittacus</hi> a mutton, desiring him to put asunder the good flesh from the bad. <hi>Pittacus</hi> sent him backe the tongue, as the instrument of the greatest good, and of the greatest euill that is done in the world. For as <hi>Salomon</hi> saith, Both life and death are in the power of the tongue. Saint <hi>Iames</hi> in his
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:6660:178"/>
canonicall Epistle saith, That though the tongue be but a smal member, yet it doth great things: and is like the helue of a ship to the whole bodie, and like a bridle by the which being in the horses mouth we turne his whole bodie which way we will. And a ship how great soeuer it bee, yet is it ruled by a small peece of timber. Saint <hi>Iohn Chrisostome</hi> in his two and twentith Homilie to the people, warrieth them that they should not vndo themselues by their tongues. For it is the tongue that marreth the whole body; and when the bodie is corrupted, the mind must needs be corrupted to.<note place="margin">Euill words corrupt good maners.</note> For euil words corrupt good maners. Yea and in our daily praiers which we make vnto God, he will not haue vs to vse abundance of words, as Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus saith in the fifth chapter, that it is the property of fooles to vse manie words vnto God, and that the multitude of words without reason, betoken a foolish praier. And our Lord will not haue vs to pray after the maner of the Heathen, who thinke they shall be heard for the multitude of their words. For as S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith in the second to the Corinthians, The kingdome of God consisteth not in words. As touching the maner of spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,<note place="margin">Of the maner of speaking.</note> 
                  <hi>Cicero</hi> shews it vs briefly in his Duties, saying, That in tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a man must not be too stiffe of opinion, but must suffer euery man to speake in his turne, and consider whereof he speaketh; so as if it be a matter of earnest, it be done with grauitie; or if it be a matter of mirth, it be done cheerfully: and in any wise a man must not speake without the bounds of reason.<note place="margin">The vnbrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led toung fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth euer mis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For he increaceth much his words, by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them forth, but his so doing bereaueth them of all power to persuade. And as it is held for a truth, that the seed of such as companie with women too much, is not of strength to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:6660:179"/>
children: so the words of great talkers is barreine and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse. And like as in our bodies, the parts that are infected and diseased, do alwaies draw to them the corrupt humors of the parts next vnto them: so the tongue of a great babler, being as it were in the whot fit of a burning feuer, doth alwaies ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther togither and draw vnto it some secret lurking euill. He that will see the mischiefes that haue happened to many men by too much speaking, and the meane to remedie the same: let him reade the treatise of <hi>Plutarch</hi> concerning too much speaking, where he treateth of it so largely, that nothing can be added vnto it: and also <hi>Erasmus</hi> booke of the Tongue. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse I may say in generall, that to keepe a mans selfe from the vice of the tongue, he must eschue curiositie, lying, flatterie,<note place="margin">Of curiositie.</note> mockerie, slaundering, and tale bearing. I call curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie or inquisitiuenes, a discouering of things that are to be kept secret. For commonly it commeth to passe, that he which is desirous to know too much, is a great babler. And that is the cause, why a certaine great Poet counselleth vs to shun inquisitiue folke, because he is a great babler, and the property of a great babler is io bewray secrets,<note place="margin">The property of a babler.</note> to sow discord, to make quarrels, to offend freinds, and to make enemies. The fashion of inquisitiue folks is, to learne mens pedegrees, the vices of their races, the doings of their houses, the faults that befall in mens families: what the neighbour oweth, and how he gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth his wife; also to silch letters, to stand listening by mens wals, to herken what they say, to marke diligently what ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants and chambermaids do or say; if he see a woman passe through the streets, to enquire whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce she coms; if he see men talke in secret, to learne wherof they speake. To be short, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> saith in his booke of Inquisitiuenes, they be like to pullerie, which as long as they haue a graine to eat, do neuer leaue scraping in the dunghill, to haue one little graine of corne more: so the inquisitiue folke, in stead of setting their minds vpon histories and good doings, and other needfull things, the which are not forbidden to be enquired of; do fall to gathering and hoording vp the euill of some house. In this
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:6660:179"/>
case the Athenians shewed themselues to be good men to <hi>Philip,</hi> and little inquisitiue of houshold secrets. For hauing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted his courriers, they opened all his letters and read them, sauing those that were written vnto him by his wife <hi>Olimpias,</hi> the which they sent vnto him closed and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broken vp as they were.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lisimachus</hi> demanded of <hi>Philippides,</hi> what he would haue of him; ask what you wil sir (qd. he) so it be no secret, because that commonly men conceale not any thing,<note place="margin">Men conceale not any thing but that which is euill.</note> but that which is euil, and that is the thing that the vnderminer is inquisitiue of. And like as the spondgie places of leather, do draw into them the worst of the leather: so the inquisitiue eares do draw all the matters that are to be had.<note place="margin">The law of the Locrians.</note> Therefore the law of the Locrians was good, which amerced the partie at a good fine, that enquired after newes. And like as cookes to stirre coles well in their kitchins desire but good store of flesh meates and fisshermen good store of fish: so the inquisitiue sort desire abundance of mischieues, great numbers of dealings, store of nouelties, and great chaunges, that they may haue wherewith to hunt and kill.<note place="margin">The remedy of curiositie.</note> The remedy of inquisitiuenes, is neither to here nor to see the things that belong not vnto vs. For the eie is one of the hands of curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ositie, &amp; is matched with blabbing, that is to wit, with babling out againe, as sayth <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his treatise of the Fruit of foes. As for the Lier,<note place="margin">The lier.</note> he hath no need of eies, for he forgeth what he listeth: of whome <hi>Horace</hi> speaking, sayth, That he that can forget that which he neuer saw, and hath no skill to conceale things committed to him in secret, is a naughtie fellow and to be taken heed of. Lying is a vice detested of God and man, as I will declare anon, after I haue treated of the seueral sorts of lying. For this vice should seeme to be common to all men, considering how <hi>Dauid</hi> saith that all men are liers. And so it might seeme that this vice were in some sort excusable, vntill we consider that the word Lie,<note place="margin">Lying is the foundation and substance of all vice.</note> is taken in diuers significations. <hi>Mercurie</hi> in his chap. of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding; saith that lying is the foundation and substance of
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:6660:180"/>
all vice, and therefore sinne is termed nothing, and leasing or lying,<note place="margin">The first sort of lies.</note> because it consisteth of not-being, or of bereauing, and all not being or bereauing, is out of the truth, which truth is God: and whatsoeuet is out of the truth is leasing. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore saint <hi>Austen</hi> in his fourteenth booke of the Citie of God, saith, That the man which liueth after himselfe, that is to say, after his owne imagination, and not according to Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, which is the truth, doth surely liue in leasing, because he liueth according to himselfe, and not in such sort as he was created to liue. And although a man liue well; yet do we say that he is subiect to leasing, by way of priuation of the truth, which priuation he is runne into by the sinne of <hi>Adam.</hi> For there is not one that doth good, no not one. And therefore Saint <hi>Paule</hi> to the Romans saith thus: If Gods truth abound through my lying.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The second sort of lying.</note>Also there is another sort of leasing, that draweth nigh vnto this, whereof <hi>Dauid</hi> speaketh, where he saith, The sonnes of men are nothing but vanitie; insomuch that if they be put into the ballance, they shall be found lighter than vanitie it selfe. Also the Preacher saith, That all that is in this world is vanitie of vanities, or nothing of nothings: that is to say, there is not any thing in this world, that can giue a man true and sure contentment, neither is there any thing setled and certaine, as saith <hi>Mercurie</hi> speaking of the will of God. And therefore we say that in man there is nothing but leasing. For they be not so certaine as other things, no not euen as the heauenly bodies and elements, which be not chaunged. For fire continueth alwayes fire: earth, earth, and so of the rest. But man consisteth of the four elements, which are diuerse, and altereth from age to age, so much that fathers know not their owne children, when they haue beene long absent and vnseene of them. Now the thing that chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth after such sort, and is subiect to growing, breeding, dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing and dissolution, and consequently to shifting and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration, cannot be true. And as <hi>Mercurie</hi> saith in his fifth chapter of Generation, The shape of mortall things is
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:6660:180"/>
changed from day to day, by reason that in time it returneth from growing to decaying like a leasing; for that which is not permanent and certaine, cannot be true: and therefore it must needs be a leasing.</p>
               <p>Another kind of leasing whereof I intend to speake heere,<note place="margin">The third sort of leasing.</note> is when we disguise the truth by falshood and deceit, or when for our owne pleasures sake, we say otherwise than it is, a vice proper to Satan, (whome our Lord in S. <hi>Iohn</hi> calleth a lier, and the father of lying) and cleane contrarie to God, as full oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit to his diuine nature, which consisteth in truth. And for that cause it is said in Wisdome, the mouth that lieth sleyeth the soule. And <hi>Dauid</hi> in the threescore and third Psalme saith, That the mouthes of such as speake lies shall be stopped. And in the xxiiij Psalme, it is said, That that man shall goe vp into the Lords hll, which giueth not ouer his hart vnto lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, ne sweareth to beguile. For the words of the Lord are pure words, as gold fined in the furnace from the earth, and seuen times tried. And the man that wil liue long and see good dayes, must keepe his tongue from euill, and his lips from spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king guile. For the mouth of the good liuer, teacheth nothing but wisdome, and his tongue vttereth nothing but that which is righteous and fruitfull, as sayth <hi>Salomon.</hi> Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> in the xiiij of the Apocalips, setteth downe among those that follow the lambe, them that haue not defiled themselues with women, and them in whose mouthes no guile or lying hath ben found. And in the last chapter, he excludeth out of the number of the blessed, all liers and them that loue lying. <hi>Plato</hi> in his fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For distitute of all freinds is that man, and vnworthy to be beleeued and credited. And in time when he is knowne to be such a one, he is so forsaken of all men in his hatefull old age, that he is faine to leade a solitarie life euer after.

For the inquisitiue person is commonly talkatiue, and the tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>katiue person is a her, and a lier is inquisitiue, and the inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue person is a lier.

And he that so continueth shall be odious: whereas the peacemaker and wise man shall be honoured.

And in the hundred Psalme, he saith, That he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued him that secretly slaundered his neighbour. And <hi>Salomon</hi> in the eighteenth of the Prouerbs, saith, That the words of the tale-bearer are as wounds, and do enter euen into the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trails. For he that purposeth with himselfe to raise slaunders, searcheth out all the euil that is in a house, to publish it abrode afterward. If a woman by her ouersight haue giuen any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of suspition, by and by he blazeth her abroade, as though she were the wickeddest woman in the world. As for them that are vnchast indeed, they besisted to the vttermost, and their legend is disciphered without omitting anie thing. If a man haue neuer so small a specke of vice, or of euill grace in him, the slaunderer faileth not to make euery flie an elephant. They that offend in this case, do sinne directly against that commaundement of the ten, which prohibiteth vs to beare false witnesse against our neighbour. For he that lieth (saith <hi>Salomon</hi>) is a false witnesse. Also he sinneth against the law of the Gospell, which saith, It were better for a man to be drowned in the bottome of the sea, than that he should giue occasion of offence or stumbling to his neighbour.

Saint <hi>Iames</hi> saith, Speake not euill one of another, He that speaketh e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill of his neighbour, speaketh euill of the law: that is to say, in speaking and iudging after his own fancie, he vsurpeth the authoritie that belongeth to the law. It is written in the first chapter of the booke of Wisdome, That the spirit of wisdom is gentle, and will not discharge him that speaketh euill with his lips: For the sound of his words shall mount vp vnto God, to the punishing of his iniquities.

And therefore <hi>Esay</hi> saith thus: My people, they that praise thee, seduce thee, and disorder the paths of thy feet. And <hi>Dauid</hi> in the 12 Psal. wisheth that God would cut out the tongues of all flatterers. And the thing that maketh them to preuaile with vs, is the loue of our selues, as saith <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his treatise how to discerne a flatterer from a friend.

                  </note> That the prince which loueth flatterers, loueth not the truth. Now there are of flatterers two sorts; the one are but trencher-men, which for a morsell of meat will sooth a man whatsoeuer he saies, like <hi>Gnato</hi> in Terence. The other be close flatterers, which put vpon them the visor of a friend, and hold aloofe from the ordinarie fashions of the peti-flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, that delight men to deceiue them the better: and these are hard to be discerned. And as a wolfe resembleth a dog, so a flatterer resembleth a friend, And therfore it behoueth a man to be ware, that he take not the wolfe for the dog. But in this point they iumpe togither, that commonly they follow not poore men that are of no abilitie, but sticke ordinarily to the greatest.<note place="margin">The flatterer seeketh but credit.</note> And as <hi>Plutarch</hi> saith, Euen as lice doth go away af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter death, and forsake the bodie so soone as the bloud is quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, wherby they were fed: so flatterers neuer resort to those whose affairs begin to go to wrack, and whose credit decaieth. He that is desirous to learne the meane how to discerne a flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer from a friend, let him read the fore-alledged treatise of <hi>Plutarch,</hi> from whence I haue taken part of that which I haue said. And the matter it selfe compelleth me to ad this, which I haue taken out of a thousand of the good and goodly things that are there. We haue (saith <hi>Plutarch</hi>) two parts in our soul, the one true, which delighteth in things honest, and is obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to reason; the other brutish, which delighteth in vntruth and letteth it selfe go after affections. The friend sticketh to the good after the maner of phisitions, preseruing and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing that which is sound: but the flatterer holding himself to the brutish part that is subiect to affections, doth rub it, tickle it, &amp; put it quite away from reason.

But like as an ape putteth vp wrongs, because he cannot keepe the house as a dog, labor as an oxe, or beare burdens as a horse, and therfore doth nothing but make mirth, and prouoke to laughter: euen so the flatterer, because that abhorring all perill and daunger, he cannot do good to his friend by his words in counsell, or by his deeds in warre: refuseth not the doing of any thing that may delight or please, as to be a trustie messenger of loue, a cunning conueyer of yong venerie, diligent to discharge you of the care of the furnishing out of the charges of a banquet, readie to prepare suppers, a carefull conueyer of concubines, troublesome and impudent towards friends, and practising to cast the wife out of the house, if he can. Those in few words are the vertues of flatterers, whom princes of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ought to beware of, specially the close ones. For as <hi>Cicero</hi> saith, Euerie man may espie the open flatterer; but the close one is not easie to be discerned, because his flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring lurketh vnder pretence of gaine-saying, and in making countenance to haue a man in estimation, and in the end he suffereth himself to be ouercome, to the intent that he which is deceiued, may thinke himself to haue gotten the aduantage. The last impe of the wicked tongue,<note place="margin">The talebea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer or back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biter.</note> is the backbiter or tale-bearer: of whom <hi>Salomon</hi> speaking in the eighteenth of the Prouerbs, saith, His words are as wounds, and that they pierce euen into the entrails within the bellie. This trade was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised first by tyrants, who being acquainted with mens hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, chose the greatest bablers and the wickeddest persons, to serue their turnes in listning for newes, and in hearkening what men said of them. <hi>Zozimus</hi> saith, That vnder the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Constantius,</hi> there were euen forges and shops of slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and that those backbiters laid chiefly for such as were in prosperitie, in hope to haue the offices and promotions of those whom they could put out, the which made them to applie themselues wholy to bring vp slaunder vpon them.

We in French do call such folke <hi>Mouches,</hi> that is Flies; The Romans called them <hi>Delatores,</hi> that is to say, Talebearers; and the Greeks called them <hi>Acoustes,</hi> that is to say, Hearkners, or Spies,<note place="margin">Talebearers were first brought vp by euill princes.</note> which go and report vnto princes all that euer they here and see.

But at the altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the state, they were the first whom the Syracusans put to the sword. Since that time princes haue so doted vpon that kind of people, that they haue giuen them certain fees to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moote men, that is to wit, the one halfe of the goods of him that was accused, concerning the which matter there was a law called Papies law. But <hi>Nero</hi> abridging them of their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>measurable libertie of accusing all men, did cut off that gaine, and brought it to a fourth part, whereof they were euer after called Quarterers, because they had a quarter of the goods that were so excheated. <hi>Tiberius</hi> was the first of all the empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of Rome that brought them credit, and after him <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian.</hi> Neuerthelesse, he punished slaunderers very sharply, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That the prince which punisheth them not doth stir them vp. <hi>Vespasian</hi> and his sonne <hi>Titus,</hi> caused them to be whipped, and afterward sent them vnto the sands to be seene of al men. <hi>Caligula</hi> would not admit any mention of a certaine conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie that was made against him, saying, That he had not done any thing why he should be hated, &amp; therfore he would giue no eare to Talebearers. <hi>Traian</hi> said, It was safer for a prince to hearken to such as discouered their faults vnto them, than to heare the reports of the other sort: and that it is hard that that prince should haue vnbloudy hands, which hath too ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der eares. <hi>Antonine</hi> did put the Talebearers to death, which could not proue their sayings.

                  <note place="margin">What anger is.</note>Anger is a boiling vp of the blood about the hart, which (as saith <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his booke of the Soule) worketh an eagernes to punish the offender, or else (as he saith in his Rhetoriks) it is a desire of reuenge appearing with a greife, or an eager dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to reuenge: or else (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> saith) a certaine enforcing of the courage vnmeasurably swelling, with the affections that prouoke a man to reuenge. <hi>Chrisostome</hi> in his third Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly saith, It is a certaine violentnesse void of reason. <hi>Cicero</hi> in his Tusculanes, saith it is a certaine eagernes and inordinat desire to punish a party, whom we deem to haue done vs wrong.</p>
               <p>Let vs speake first of meeldnesse, and afterward of Anger. Meeldnesse is commended of all men, and numbred by Saint <hi>Mathew</hi> among the eight points of blessednesse. And yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding he that is meeld and mercifull, faileth not to be angry. For else he should be blockish and without any feeling. But he is angry with reason, he is angrie at the vice, and not at the person. And that is the meaning of the Psalmist where he saith, Be angrie and sinne not. After that manner was Saint <hi>Paule</hi> angrie, at the horrible wrong done by <hi>Elymas</hi> the Magician; and Saint <hi>Peter</hi> at Saphyra. <hi>Moyses</hi> was counted the meeldest man of his time, and yet he made men often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to passe the edge of the sword. For his meeldnesse was
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:6660:187"/>
no impeachment to iustice, and to the punishing of sin. Meeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes then is a vertue that neither seeketh reuenge of all faults, nor leaueth the great faults vnpunished. In which behalf ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny deceiue themselues,<note place="margin">The leauing of wicked men vnpuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed is cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty against good men.

But (as <hi>Archidamus</hi> saith) this is to be counted cruelty against good men.</p>
               <p>Mercie is occupied in pardoning, not the faults done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the publick-weale, but the faults commited against our selues, as <hi>Titus</hi> did, who forgaue them that had conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red against him: and <hi>Agesilaus,</hi> who by his benefits made his enemy his friend: and likewise <hi>Augustus,</hi> who pardoned <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> a traitor, and banished <hi>Timagenes</hi> that did but slaunder him without hurting him.

And when he had enquired of his friends that had counselled him to punish the railer, whether he had ben as outrageous in his words as he was wont to be or no; and vnderstood by them that he spake good of him euery where:<note place="margin">It is in our owne power to haue good or ill report</note> Lo (quoth he) ye see it is in our owne power to haue good or bad report.

King <hi>Lois</hi> the twelfth did the like (as hath bin said in another place) when he would not be reuenged for the wrongs, that had ben done vnto him afore he was king. <hi>Pittacus</hi> had but one only son, who was slain through misfortune by a sawyer, the sawyer was taken and brought to <hi>Pittacus</hi> to be punished: But he let him go, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it was better to pardon than to punish. <hi>Plutarch</hi> reporteth in the life of <hi>Pericles,</hi> that there was a shameles railer, that railed vpon him all a whole day togither, to whom <hi>Pericles</hi> answered not a word, but intended to the dispatching of matters of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance vntill it was night, whom the railer followed home to his lodging still railing vpon him. And when <hi>Pericles</hi> was come thither, he commaunded one of his seruants to take a torch, and to light the man home back to his owne lodging. Ye see here a wonderfull temperance in a prince that had absolute power in the citie of Athens: who notwithstanding that he had such power, yet yeelded not a whit to hatred, spite, or anger. Insomuch that he made his boast that there was neuer any Athenian that wore a black garment by his means. <hi>Pompey</hi> also was greatly commended for pardoning the Mamertines that had taken part with <hi>Marius,</hi> howbeit that his so doing was for his hostes sake. <hi>Cicero</hi> sayth that <hi>Caesar</hi> in setting vp againe the Images of <hi>Pompey,</hi> did the

Albeit that <hi>Augustus</hi> tooke the Alexandrians his enemies by force, yet did he par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don them in honour of <hi>Alexander</hi> the founder of their citie. In respect whereof the Alexandrians found themselues more beholden to him, than to <hi>Alexander</hi> himselfe, &amp; commended him in all cases, saying that <hi>Alexander</hi> was the founder, but <hi>Augustus</hi> was the preseruer of their citie.

                  </note> and meeldnesse of <hi>Dauid</hi> is not to be compared withall by those that I haue alledged: For he did put vp infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit iniuries at the hands of <hi>Semei,</hi> without giuing him any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, commanding his men to let him alone, and telling them that God had raised him vp to humble him; and after his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie, he pardoned him that misdeed, notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding that he followed him casting stones at him. Which serueth to shew, that the precept of the gospell concerning the forgiuing of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, was practised by princes of good nature, as <hi>Dauid</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe witnesseth in his seuenth Psalm, where he saith, If I haue requited euill for euill, I am contented that he shall pursue me in warre, and that he shall take me and fling me against the ground, and so forth. Saint <hi>Iohn Chrisostome</hi> in his treatise of meeldnesse, sayth, That meeldnesse becommeth all men, but specially kings and such as are set in authoritie.<note place="margin">Meeldnes wel beseemeth kings and great states.</note> And the more power that the maiesty of a king hath to do al things: the more ought he to bridle himselfe, &amp; to take Gods law for his guide, if he will haue glorie and honor of his doings.

And to that purpose serueth this which is said in philosophie, that the cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick folk are aptest to learn sciences. And the Prouerb saith, That he which hath no choler, hath no wit. Many esteem it to be as it were the sinewes of the soule. <hi>Plato</hi> in his Lawes, saith, That a good man must be both meeld and also courageous; that is to say, not vtterly void of kindly choler. For we can hardly without it, eschue the wrongs and harmes that are hard to be cured otherwise, than by fight, by victorie, and by defending a mans selfe, and by not suffering a mans selfe to be wronged: the which thing cannot be done without anger and stomaching. And in his Theeterus he saith, It is hard to find a

man both soft and wittie togither. And they that haue sharpe and readie wits, and apt to be taught, are commonly choli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke and hastie, as being caried with waues like ships with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ankers.</p>

Saint <hi>Iohn Chrysostome</hi> vpon the fourth Psalme of <hi>Dauid,</hi> saith, That anger is good and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table against them that do wrong, or be negligent, and that it is a fit instrument to waken vs out of our sleepinesse, to make vs the more fierce in being angrie for their sakes, that haue receiued any wrong or harme. <hi>Alexander</hi> from his very youth did burne with desire to go to warre, and to do some exploit of armes. The which thing <hi>Aristotle</hi> perceiuing, to turne him away from it, told him that he must tarie till he were of age. Nay (quoth <hi>Alexander</hi>) for if I tarie so long, I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid that the great hardinesse and forwardnesse which is now in my youth, will then be quite gone: and this vehement desire giueth the greater force to our doings.

That which is done through perturbation cannot be don steadily.</note> but that all perturbations are attainted with vice, and this aboue al others. For as <hi>Cicero</hi> saith in his Duties, A man cannot do wel and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisedly with anger. For that which is don with a trobled mind, cannot bee done steadily, nor be allowed of them that see it. And as saith <hi>Theodericke</hi> writing to <hi>Iohn</hi> the consull of Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paine, Cholericke persons haue no feeling of the thing that is iust, neither seeke they any moderation of their reuenge. For this cause Saint <hi>Paule</hi> in his Epistle to the Romans, biddeth vs giue place vnto wrath, and to let it vanish away, waiting for the iudgement of God. And Saint <hi>Iames</hi> in his Epistle saith, That the anger of man performeth not the righteousnesse of God; that is to say, hindereth the accomplishment of Gods worke in vs. And <hi>Saluian</hi> bishop of Marsels saith, That wrath is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of hatred.<note place="margin">Anger is the mother of hatred.</note> And therefore the Lord would in any wise ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude anger, for feare least anger should breed hatred.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="360" facs="tcp:6660:190"/>And for that cause he said in Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi> That whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer is angry with his brother, is worthie to be punished in iudgement. <hi>Salomon</hi> saith in his Prouerbs, That a stone is hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie, and sand is weightie, but the wrath of a foole is heauier than they both. I confesse that oft-times it incrocheth vpon good dispositions, as euill weeds do vpon good grounds: but the diligence of the good husband doth easily destroy them, to make roome for good corne, and good hearbs. And as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching that <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith, That anger must be vsed as a soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier: he meaneth a certaine kindly and princely coragiousnes, which maketh men to follow a braue and difficult obiect, as I haue said alreadie of <hi>Alexanders</hi> forwardnes, which prouoked him to warre. For such a boiling forwardnesse, sauoureth more of noblenesse of mind, than of wrath. And whereas Saint <hi>Iohn Chrisostome</hi> saith, That anger is behoofful; that is ment for the punishing of faults. But as he saith in the same place, That is not properly wrath or anger, but a care, a wisdome, and an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly disposition, as the father that is angrie with his childs fault, for the care that he hath of him. And whereas some say, That anger hath a kind of noble-mindednesse, and of resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance vnto prowes, it is like as if a man should say, that a man which is sicke of a feuer were well dsposed, because he doth some parts of a lustie man in his fits, which he could not doe if he were in health:<note place="margin">Cholericknes procedeth of weaknes of the mind.</note> Euen so is it (saith he) with anger, which giueth a man a certaine forwardnesse that oftentimes is taken for prowesse, and yet is so farre off from sauouring of prowesse and true forwardnesse, that contrariwise it rather proceedeth of weaknesse and feeblenesse, than of hardinesse, as witnesseth <hi>Plutarch,</hi> making this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parison; Like as the swelling and puf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing vp of the flesh, betokeneth a great sorenesse in the flesh: so in tender minds, the more they relent and yeeld vnto sorow, the more abundance of cholericknesse doe they cast foorth, arguing the greater imbecilitie. That is the cause why women are commonly more treaf and testie than men; and sick-men, than men in health; and old men, than men that are in the flower of their youth; and men in aduersitie, than men in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speritie.

But to subdue anger is a point of prowesse and noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindednesse, as saith <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the life of <hi>Dion,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">To subdue an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is a point of a noble and valiant corage</note> the proofe whereof is shewed, not in bearing a mans selfe modestly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his friends, or toward honest men, but in the gentle for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing of them that haue offended him, &amp; in his meeld relea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of his displeasure. That is the cause why <hi>Salomon</hi> saith, It is better for a man to bridle his wrath, than to win a citie. And if a man will say, That irefulnesse is as it were the sinues of the soule:<note place="margin">Irefulnes like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the crampe</note> in the opinion of <hi>Plutarch</hi> he should rather liken it vnto the crampe, which retcheth a man out, or draweth him in with so much the greater vehemencie, as it is the more desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to reuenge. And as the same authour saith in the life of <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> Anger seemeth to be magnanimity, because it hath a desire to ouercome, and will not yeeld to any man: and yet for all that, it is but a feeblenes, the which thrusteth the cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler forth, as the weakest and most passionate part of the soule, no lesse than a corrupt matter of an impostume. They that haue vpheld,<note place="margin">Cholerick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons vnfit for gouernment.</note> that cholericke persons are apt to learne, haue added that they were not fit for gouernment, and therefore that the Lacedemonians praied dayly vnto God, to inable them to beare wrongs: esteeming that person vnworthie to be in authoritie, or to deale in great affairs, that is subiect to anger. That is the cause why <hi>Chilo</hi> the Lacedemonian, being asked by his brother, why he was not made a iudge as well as he; answered, It was because he could skill to beare wrongs patiently that were done vnto him, which thing his brother could not do:<note place="margin">That man is vnworthie of authoritie which cannot beare iniuries.</note> as who would say, He is not worthie to be a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrat, which cannot beare iniuries and discountenance them. There is a Greeke prouerbe which saith, That a prince must heare both the iust and vniust. And as <hi>Lois</hi> the eleuenth said, He that can no skill to dissemble, can no skill to reigne. For they that run headily vpon their owne opinions, and will not yeeld to any other, do in the end become desolate. But they that will liue among men,<note place="margin">The vnpatient are forsaken, or else haue few followres.</note> and haue to do in matters of state, must of necessitie become patient; or else they shall haue few to follow them, or rather they shall be vtterly forsaken.

               <p>And as <hi>Salomon</hi> saith in his Prouerbs, The indignation
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:6660:192"/>
of a prince is as a messenger of death. And in another place he saith, That the indignation of a prince is like the roring of a lion, but his fauour is like the deaw vpon the grasse. And as <hi>Plutarch</hi> saith in his booke of the Trainment of princes, After they haue once spoken the word, the partie that is but suspec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to haue offended, is vndone. And as the naturall philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers say, as the lightning commeth after the thunder, and yet is seene afore it;<note place="margin">Among prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces men are oft condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned afore ought be prooued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them.</note> and as in a wound, the bloud is seene afore the wound it selfe: so with princes and great potentates, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment goeth afore appeachment, and men are seene to be condemned, afore any thing be prooued against them: and that is because the prince cannot refraine his choler, vnlesse the force of reason set it selfe against their power, and breake it. For as saith Ecclesiasticus, According as the wood of the forrest is, so burneth the fire, and according as a mans power is, so burneth his anger, and so mounteth vp his wrath in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. Therefore the first and chiefest remedie that we can find for cholericknesse,<note place="margin">Remedies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst anger. The first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie.</note> is to submit our selues to reason For as saith <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his seuenth booke of Morals, Anger hearke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vnto reason, howbeit confusedly and negligently, like a quicke and hastie page, that goes his way ere he haue heard halfe his errand, which causeth him to do his message amisse: or like a dog that barketh as soone as he heareth any noise at the doore, without knowing whether he that knocketh is a friend or a foe. Euen so anger, through fauour &amp; light mouing, doth giue some eare to reason, but yet so as it runneth forth to punishing, without vnderstanding his commission. For rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son had iudged that there was some reprochful deed, or some contempt, but choler flingeth forth incontinently at randon, as though it had beene concluded and resolutely determined by discourse of reason, that the partie which hath done the wrong,<note place="margin">Naturally we couet reuenge and esteeme wrongs to be greater than they be.</note> is to be fought withall out of hand. For naturally we couet reuenge of the harme that is done vs, and esteeme it greater than it is. And like as bodies seeme great through a cloud, so do mens faults seeme greater through anger, than they be in deed; by reason whereof we be desirous to punish
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:6660:192"/>
them more than reason would we should. Insomuch that he which will punish as he ought to do, ought to be cleare from anger. For when anger bursteth out, it punisheth without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, cleane contrarie to the maner of eating and drinking, the which we vse not but when we be a hungred and a thirst. But we do then vse reuenge best, when we neither hunger it, nor thirst it, but haue begun to forgo the appetite thereof, apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to reason and discretion, without the which we cannot master our choler. And as the smoke that steameth vp into our eies, letteth vs to see the things that are before our feete: so choler dimmeth reason, and suffereth vs not without paine and labour,<note place="margin">Reason must be applied to anger.</note> to enioy the good wherewith reason could furnish vs. And therefore it must be put in readinesse long aforehand. And like as they that looke to haue their citie besieged, do gather and lay vp in store aforehand, whatsoeuer may serue their turne, and tarie not til succor come to them from abrode: enen so (saith <hi>Plutarch</hi>) must the remedies prouided long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore out of Philosophie,<note place="margin">The troubled mind heareth not what is said without.</note> be applied in time, against ire. For by reason of the turmoile that is within, the mind heareth not that which is said without, vnlesse it haue reason of it owne, and such discretion of it selfe within, as doth by and by set it selfe against the anger and suppresse it.

For the wise man (saith <hi>Salomon</hi>) delaieth his anger, and it is a glorie vnto him to ouerpasse faults committed, that is, to let the offence passe, and not to do as <hi>Darius</hi> did, who being in an exceeding great rage against the Athenians for sacking the citie Sardus,
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:6660:193"/>
praied God that he might reuenge that iniurie, and ordained that thrise euerie day when his meat was vpon the table, one should say vnto him, Sir, remember the Athenians; but rather as the Romans did, who to shew that magistrats ought not to be angrie in hast, tied the rods of their pretors vnto halberds, to the intent that the delay which was made in the vntying of them, should breake and appease the headines of the pretors wrath. If the Pythagorians hapned to be angrie, their custom was to touch one another in the hand, afore they departed out of the place, to the intent that they would not let their anger take place, according to the precept of Saint <hi>Paule.</hi> The fourth remedie is,<note place="margin">The fourth remedie.</note> neuer to take vpon ones selfe the chastising of the partie that hath offended him, but to put ouer the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof to some other bodie, as some philosophers haue don, who praied their friends to chastise their bond-slaues, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That they themselues could not do it, because they were too much moued with anger. As for example <hi>Architas</hi> of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, who would not chastise his seruant because he was in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger with him. <hi>Cicero</hi> in his Duties saith, That a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> must be wel ware that he be not angry when he punisheth, because anger neuer keepeth the meane that ought to be between too much and too little. And magistrats ought to be like vnto lawes, which punish men, not for anger, but for iustice. The fift meane is,<note place="margin">The fift re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie.</note> to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider that we would be loth to be punished as we would punish others; wherto agreeth the parable of the Receiuer in the Gospel, who hauing obtained fauour for his debts at his masters hand, yet neuertheles would needs play the torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tor towards a poore debter of his own. By the which parable we be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded to forgiue the wrongs that our neighbors do vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, as god forgiueth vs freely our misdeeds. And for want of so doing, we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not haue grace at gods hand. For thus saith Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticus, Doth man keepe anger against man, and craue health of God? If he that is a mortal man (saith he) do keepe anger, and craue forgiuenes of God; who shall forgiue him his sins? Be mindfull of the feare of God, and bear no anger to thy neighbor.

Now to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure vs that manslaughter is detestable afore God, we haue a precept in the ten Commaundements, the which forbiddeth vs to kill. <hi>Romulus</hi> called all manquelling, Parricide, because the one was villainous and detestable, and the other was not tollerable. <hi>Moyses</hi> appointed out fiue cities of refuge, for them that had committed manslaughter, so it were by chance and not vpon malice; meaning that such as had their hands defiled with bloud, should not be conuersant among other men. <hi>Dauid</hi> being welbeloued of God, and an earnest louer of God, would haue builded him a temple; but he was dissua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from it by <hi>Nathan,</hi> who had commaundement from God, to bid him leaue the doing thereof to his sonne <hi>Salomon,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his owne hands were defiled with the bloud of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. And as he himselfe saith in the fiue and fiftith Psalme,<note place="margin">Bloudie men shall not liue out halfe their dayes.</note> Bloudie aud deceitfull men shal not liue out halfe their daies. And we may say generally with Ecclasiasticus, That a man full of anger, kindleth strife and variance among friends, and setteth enmitie among them that were at peace.</p>

                  <pb n="368" facs="tcp:6660:194"/>Of anger come iniuries, discords, disagreements, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the vtter ouerthrowes of cities,<note place="margin">Anger causeth the ouerthrow of cities.</note> whereof princes repent them afterward, or at leastwise are blamed for it, as <hi>Philip</hi> was for Olinthus.

                  <hi>Plutarch</hi> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of <hi>Marius,</hi> saith that his cholericknes, ambition, and coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnes, did driue him like a mightie wind, into a bloodie, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell and vnkind old age. The same <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the life of <hi>Sylla,</hi> saith, That <hi>Sylla</hi> suffred himself to be caried away with choler without aduisement, without setting any other consideration before his eies, than only the reuenge of his enemies, without making any account of his friends and kins-folke, and without any touch of mercie and compassion: and his furie was so firy, that he put no difference between such as had offended him, and such as had done nothing. If these examples suffice not, let him consider that a man ought to be more tractable than a lion. Now the lion how fierce so euer he bee, is made gentle and tame by art, which surmounteth his nature. And shall not man which by nature is meeld, take paine to tame the beast that lodgeth within him? he ouercommeth the nature of beasts,<note place="margin">A man may command anger seeing it harbereth within him.</note> and yet for all that he cannot ouercome himselfe. And as S. <hi>Iohn Chrysostome</hi> saith vpon the first of <hi>Mathew,</hi> If I char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged you to appease another man; you might answer me that you haue not other mens wils in your hand: but I speak to you of anger, which is your owne beast, and lion, whom you may command.<note place="margin">Anger impai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the health both of bodie and soule.</note> And if by cunning and good means ye can make a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a man; how hapneth it that through your negligence, you suffer your selues of men to become lions?

And a man must not excuse his cholericknes by this common saying, That the first motions are not in mans power, and therefore it is hard to resist anger.

For to say the truth, the verie office of a prince, is to deale with war-matters, and to make himselfe a good captaine, that he may know how to defend himselfe, &amp; to assail his enemies when time serues,<note place="margin">The prince that is valiant is esteemed and had in feare.</note> which is the thing that setteth his subiects most in peace. For the prince that is vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant and practised in fears of armes, is commended, feared and redoubted of his neighbors. Contrariwise, the coward, and he that despiseth the art of warre, and hath not weapon in hand, is subiect to the contempt of his neighbours, and to endure warre whether he will or no. Wherefore as a prince ought to haue great vnderstanding in matters of gouernment, so ought he not to be ignorant what belongeth to warre. And as his dutie consisteth,<note place="margin">The art of war vpholdeth the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-weale.</note> first in the well-ordering of the common-weale: so is it also necessarie for him to haue skill
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:6660:197"/>
of martiall affairs, to maintaine the common-weale. Now as touching the art of warre, I find not a better booke or a better scholemaister thereof, than experience; though enow haue written thereof. For it is learned more by practise than by spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, and it belongeth not vnto any other to treat thereof, than to such as haue spent some part of their life in the wars. And if any man of my calling would treat thereof, it might be said vnto him that he plaid the foole, as <hi>Hanniball</hi> said to <hi>Phormio.</hi> But to treat of policies and sleights of warre practised by captaines, is not a dealing with the Art of warre, otherwise than by accident, and after the maner of Historiographers, who forget them not in their histories; but in bringing againe of the histories to remembrance which make mention of them, according to my fore determined purpose, which was to shew how noble princes haue demeaned themselues, both in peace and warre, and to deliuer as in euidence, their quicke sayings and politike stratagems. Of the one I hope I haue in some sort discharged my selfe in my former two bookes: and now in this, I will treat a little of the feats of war, and of some policies found in histories for the instruction of princes, to the end that among the notable things which I haue inserted here out of diuerse histories where they were dispersed; this which is the principall point, may not tary behind vntouched, leauing the larger discouery therof, to such as deale with arms. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in if I keepe some order and fashion of precepts, it is but to treat of those things in some method, which are dispersed in the histories; and not to giue any certaine iudgment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what is to be done in that behalfe. For I hope that when the matter is once set downe, a prince may vpon this discourse, chuse what he thinketh good, as bees do vpon flowers. I know that the most part of the stratagemes that were found good in time past, are now out of vse, and that as <hi>Cambyses</hi> said vnto <hi>Cyrus,</hi> like as in musick the newest songs &amp; such as were neuer heard afore, do like men best: so in warre, the policies that haue not earst ben practised, haue best successe, because the enemie doth least suspect them. But we may also say, that many
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:6660:197"/>
times old songs are renewed and song for new: and likewise in warre,<note place="margin">Nothing is done, which had not ben <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> old policies may be renewed, and taken for new. For there is not any thing done, which hath not ben done afore. By means wherof I haue gathered and compacted together, a part of the old policies of time past, to the intent that among many, the prince may chuse that which he shall find best, or at leastwise not be ignorant to keepe himselfe from them. For the knowledge of the policies of times past, together with those which he hath seene by experience, wil giue him a great iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the feat of war, and will make him to call to mind a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and bethinke him of the things that he hath seene at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times. Wherfore to keepe the order that I began with, it is to be vnderstood, that to raigne happily and to maintaine himselfe and his subiects in peace and tranquility; it is not i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for a prince to stablish good laws and ordinances, if he do not likewise set good order for matters of war, which may light vpon his armie whether he will or no; and sometime the wrong that shall be offered him, shall compell him to warre vpon his neighbour. So that it is hard for a prince to raigne long without some warre, either in assailing or in defending, whereof it commeth to passe that he increaseth and dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth his state and reputation, according to his fortunate or vnfortunate successe. And to make himselfe the stronger he maketh leagues with his freinds and allies; or else his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie preuenteth him, who hauing made an offensiue league with his associats, commeth with great power to enter into his countrie. For the which a prince must prouide afore hand, as it shall be easie for him to doe in time, if he haue strength, howbeit that it be a terrible thing to see so many nations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him alone.<note place="margin">In ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And in the meane while, he must at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt by all means to disioine the whole league, or at leastwise to get some one out of the league, which is so easie a thing to be done, that as many as haue bent themselues vnto it, haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most neuer failed. King <hi>Lois</hi> the eleuenth was very excellent in this feat. Euery man knows how he accorded with the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Charolois at Constans; so that when he was once taken out of the play, it was of necessitie, that the dukes of Berry and Bretaine should be comprised in the accord, because they were not of sufficient power to encounter the king of France, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the helpe of the Burgonions. Another time, hauing to doe with two mightie neighbours, the king of England and the duke of Burgoine, when he saw that the duke of Burgoine was not yet knit to the king of England; he made peace with the king of England, so as hee had no mo to deale with, but the duke of Burgoine. King <hi>Francis</hi> the first was assailed by the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, and by the king of England in the yeare 1544. By rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son whereof he opposed against the emperour a strong host, and against the king of England towns well fortified. And in the mean while he found means to agree with the emperour, without calling the king of England therto; and by that means it was the easier for him to agree with the Englishmen after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. The emperor was sore combred, in hauing to deale with two mightie armies at once, to wit king <hi>Henrie</hi> the second, and the Protestants. By reason whereof he aduised himselfe to graunt the Protestants their demands, that he might after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward bend himselfe vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the king. Which thing maketh me to thinke, that in leagues there is somewhat to be feared, and that there is danger in entring into them, the which it stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth a prince greatly on hand to prouide for. But it is not hard
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:6660:198"/>
to vndo them, because the leguers looke more to their owne peculiar profit,<note place="margin">Leaguers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect their owne peculiar profit.</note> than to the common profit of them all; and the societie which all of them do make, is lion-like, as they terme it; for euerie of them respecteth his owne peculiar profit. And if ye set that aside, by and by all is laid a water. But if there befall too happie successe to any one that is in league, and the prince see that fortune smileth vpon his companion: he must not by and by giue him ouer there, and make league against him,<note place="margin">Leagues bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by diuers means.</note> as the Pope, and the duke of Millan, and all Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie did for king <hi>Francis</hi> the first, vpon his taking of the empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Charles</hi> prisoner, with whom they had bene lincked in league afore against the king. The Leontines, and Rhegines, hauing entered into armes against the Syracusanes, made a league with the Athenians, by whose ayd they maintained the warre along time. But in the end, when they vnderstood by the report that <hi>Hermocrates</hi> made vnto all the Sicilians in generall, that all that the Athenians did, was to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues lords of Sicilie: they gaue ouer the league, and made peace among themselues.<note place="margin">The drawing backe of one leaguer, disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointeth the whole le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And this slacknesse of his saued the citie Padoa, and a good part of the state of Venice. And had the Venetians beene warriers and well prouided, they had put king <hi>Lois</hi> to a plunge.

But here some man might demaund, whether such a Gouernour or chieftaine ought neuer to be chaunged, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ought to be chaunged as the pretors, proconsuls and presidents of prouinces were among the Romans. I haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in the title of Iustice, that the emperour <hi>Alexander Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerus</hi> chaunged his officers oft, and that <hi>Augustus</hi> altered not the custome of the Romans, in sending senators into prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for a certaine time. <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his bookes of Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale- matters, reproued the Candiots, for suffering one of
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:6660:199"/>
their magistrats whom they called Consuls, to be perpetuall, whereas they should haue beene shifted from time to time. And it is not to be doubted, but that that maner of dealing was verie behooffull in a Common-weale, where euerie man lookes to beare office of honour, which few should haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed, if the charge of gouernment should haue beene tied to one alone, to occupie the place of many good citizens, who could haue discharged the office as well as he.<note place="margin">The danger of suffering one gouernor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually in a prouince.</note> And thereof would haue ensued a great inconuenience, namely that an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie being gouerned ouerlong by one citizen, would haue growne partiall in his behalfe, and not haue acknowledged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other for their head, than him vnder whom they had so long serued. Moreouer the Generall or chiefe captaine of an armie, that shall haue continued so long together in office, would become so rich and increased in honour, that he could not find in his heart to liue as meane citizen afterward.

For there was not in his time any goodly enterprise, whereof he was not the executor.

For as on the one side, the greatnesse of the benefit encountered the law: so on the other side, there was as an apparant breach of the law, which might procure great preiudice in time to come.<note place="margin">Too great a mightinesse is daungerous in a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monweale</note> Now in a free citie, this ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>great mightines is to be feared: and therefore it is no wonder though <hi>Publicola</hi> was in good time redoubted of the Romans, and compelled to shew that he ment to make himselfe equall with the meanest.

For had not the excellent citizens beene brideled by exile, they would at length haue growne so proud, that they would haue made themselues kings and maisters of the citie, as <hi>Pericles</hi> might well haue done, if he had beene of an ambitious mind, and as others did afterward that were meaner than he.

But if a Gouernour be not too full of vice, it is much better that he continue still. For he shall learne how to behaue himselfe towards the men of his prouince, by acquainting himselfe long time with their humors. And for his knowledge of the countrie, he shall do goodlier exploits than a new lieutenant could do: besids that he shall be more loued and regarded of the Souldiers, with whom he shall haue spent his yong yeares.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Orasmuch as a prince cannot be alway with his armie, it behoueth him to choose some excellent captaine, to haue the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereof. Now it may be demanded, whether it were better to appoint two or three to that charge, or to be contented with one, for if one alone haue the execution of that charge, no man shall controll him, whereas mo doing their dutie well, may do more faithfull and trustie seruice, by striuing who shall do best. And this maner did the Athenians vse, who for a time held the dominion of the Easterne seas; and so did the Romans who subdued the whole world. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians in their warres of Sicilie (which were of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance) sent thither <hi>Niceas</hi> and <hi>Alcibiades.</hi> And ordinarilie they had two at the least, and sometimes ten together that commaunded. The Romans most commonly sent the two consuls to the warres, who ruled the armie with equall power. But they that did so, found not themselues euer best at ease, We haue an example therof in three Tribnnes of Rome sent to Fidene with authoritie of consuls,<note place="margin">It is not good to haue many commaunders in an armie.</note> who through their disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement &amp; mistaking one anorher, were like to haue brought the Roman host to ruine. Also they vsed but light wars. For in times of danger they made a Dictator, that one might abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely command alone: being of opinion that one alone might better gouerne an armie than many could, because it is hard to find two or three excellent captains in a whole countrie: as <hi>Philip</hi> of Macedonie said, He maruelled how the Athenians could euery yeare appoint ten captains to commaund their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, whereas he could find but one in all his realme.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="380" facs="tcp:6660:202"/>And in good sooth, had the captaines whom the Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans appointed, bene no wiser than they that appointed them, their common-weale had smarted for it.

For ye shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer find two men of one selfe-same humor. And if it were so; yet the one is so thrust forward with ambition, enuie, and iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie against his fellow, that they faile not to marre all. If <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceas</hi> and <hi>Alcibiades</hi> had beene neuer so long togither, they would neuer haue agreed. For the one was too slow, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther too quicke, after the same maner that <hi>Fabius</hi> and <hi>Minu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius, Paulus Aemilius</hi> and <hi>Varro</hi> were: for if the one did well one day, the other mard all the next day, the harme whereof the Romans felt a long time after.</p>
               <p>In our ciuill warres we had two princes in our armies, of whom the one tooke vpon him to commaund, and the other would giue no place to him. And in hope to content them both, vnto the one was committed the vauntgard with the tokens of battell; and vnto the other was committed the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, rather in name that in effect: whereat the other disdai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, was a cause that a good part of the armie was broken. Therefore the best is to haue but one generall. And we must not here take example at common-weales: for their vphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of themselues is dearer vnto them, than the ouerthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their enemies. And because the ouergreat mightines of a citizen is daungerous to their state, they had rather faile in the other point, than to giue too great authoritie to one alone, for feare least he should fall to vsurping, or that his greatnesse should cause some sedition in the citie. But a king, who cannot be deposed by any one alone, how excellent and valiant a captain so euer he be, is neuer in that doubt, nor in the distrust
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:6660:202"/>
wherein common-weals are. And therefore he ought not, but vpon some necessitie,<note place="margin">There must be no equals to the generall in an armie.</note> to commit the charge of his armie to any mo than one. Aso he must beware, that with his gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor he send not other captains, that esteeme themselues as great or greater than the generall. For that were the way to set all out of order. <hi>Olympius</hi> thought she did well, in sending the Siluershields to the succor of <hi>Eumenes,</hi> but she mard all by it: for their captains made so great account of themselues, that they would not obey him, no nor scarcely accept him for their companion. By reason wherof they betraid him, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered him to his enemie. The ruine of the common-weale of Rome, came of two citizens well neere of equall power, of whom the one would abide none greater than himselfe, and the other would haue no peere. And because either of them was of great credit with the Senate, they set the whole citie togither by the eares But the king who carieth his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sel with him, and hath neither tribunes not consuls, disposeth of his state at his owne will, and no man dareth intermeddle with the gouernment, further-forth than is to his liking.</p>

Yet notwithstanding as gentle and patient as he was, he gouerned that insolent people without any rebellion, speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally at the beginning of the wars of Peloponnesus, where the people of Athens saw their goods spoiled from out of their windowes; whom notwithstanding their eager desire to go out against the Lacedemonians, he kept still at home by his gentle and honourable persuasions. <hi>Xenophon</hi> maketh <hi>Cyrus</hi> gentle, courteous, familiar, and void of all pride, roughnes, and crueltie. <hi>Scipio</hi> was meeld and gentle to his men of warre, and vsed his enemies with so great courtesie, that he woon the hearts of the Spaniards by such means, &amp; ouercame them ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with honorable dealing than with force. <hi>Plutarch</hi> saith as much of <hi>Lucullus.</hi> Infinit other examples may we alledge; of such as haue ben obaied by their men of war, and ben loued of all their countries.<note place="margin">For rigor and crueltie.</note> On the contrarie part, we haue some that haue kept their people in order by austeritie, as <hi>Manlius Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quatus</hi> and many others. <hi>Hanniball</hi> was cruell and stoure, as well to his men of warre as to his enemies. And yet had he an armie of sundrie sorts of strangers, all obedient and well orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; and besides that he drue to his side many of the allies of the Romans.

The third day he had a pauilion all blacke, which was as much to say, as that there was no more place for co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>passion, but that he would put al to fire &amp; sword The fear of such cruelty caused al cities to yeeld the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues at his first co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming,<note place="margin">That captaine is to be puni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>shed, which holdeth a place vnable to be defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, against an armie roiall.</note> And he could not deuise to haue don so much by frendly dealing, as by that means.

<pb n="384" facs="tcp:6660:204"/>
fauour of the publick-weale. For a man can win no partakers which sheweth himself so rough to euery man, and he dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth himselfe of all suspicions of ambition. But in the maner of the proceeding of <hi>Valerius</hi> and <hi>Publicola,</hi> there may be some mistrust, because of the friendship and good fauor which he purchased at his souldiers hands, wherby they might worke some euill practises against the liberty of their countrie. But when it commeth to the consideration of a prince, as <hi>Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon</hi> painteth vs out a perfect prince vnder the person of <hi>Cyrus</hi>: the maner of <hi>Publicola, Scipio,</hi> and such others, is much more al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable and dangerlesse.<note place="margin">It is good that a prince should haue his army affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionated to him alone.</note> For the prince is to seeke for no more at his subiects and souldiers hands, but obedience and loue. For when a prince is well minded on his owne part, and his armie likewise affection it only towards him, it is conformable to all conditions of his state. But for a priuat person to haue an army at his deuotion, is not conformable to the rest of the parts, whom it standeth on hand to make him liue vnder the lawes, and to obey magistrats. But there remaineth yet one doubt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decided, which is whether a lieutenant-generall of an host,<note place="margin">Whether a liuetenant ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral should be gentle or rigorous.</note> who is neither prince nor king, but is sent by a king to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand, ought to be gentle or rigorous. For he cannot be suspected to make his army partiall. And though he had it so, which thing he can not do, he should smally preuaile against his prince. Wherfore in this behalfe, I would hold as well the one as the other, to the obseruation of the lawes. I would be rigorous to the men of war. For there is not so beautifull and profitable a thing to an armie, as the execution of iustice, and the keeping of the law vninfringed. The which if ye once breake in any one man, though he be a very braue and valeant fellow; it must needs be broken in diuers others. But, the discipline of war being well kept and obserued,<note place="margin">The generall ought to be familiar in behauior and rigorous in discipline.</note> the generall ought to be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar towards al his souldiers. <hi>Alexander</hi> was familiar, gentle, and courteous to the common souldiers. <hi>Antonie</hi> was to them, both gentle and louing. <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> was likewise, and so were all the excellent emperours. On the other side, they also were welbeloued, and yet in discipline they were rigorous. I
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:6660:204"/>
haue told you heretofore in the chapter of Iustice, how the said <hi>Iulius Caesar, Augustus, Traian,</hi> &amp; certain others winked at small faults, but were rigorous in others, as towards mutiners, traitors, and sleepers in the watch, and such others aforealled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. The reason was, that they would not in any wise corrupt the discipline of war, for feare of the mischiefe that might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue: and therfore they neuer pardoned the faults of them that infringed it. It is a wonderous thing, that <hi>Caesar</hi> being but a citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, and hauing his army but of such as serued him of good wil, and being lately afore discomfited at the battell of Durazo, and fleeing before the army of the senat; was notwithstanding not afraid, to punish such as had not done their dutie in the battell; insomuch that whole legions were faine to sue to him for mercie. Which doing, sheweth the good discipline that was in the Roman armies, and the faithfull seruice which they did to their generall, to whom they had giuen their oth. Anon after again, when he gaue battell to <hi>Pompey,</hi> with what cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes did all his souldiers accept it? With what zeale and good will did they beare with their generall?<note place="margin">Austerity aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not the loue of men of war.</note> and with what feercenesse did they fight? The which serueth to shew, that seueritie taketh not away the loue of men of war, when they perceiue that otherwise their chieftaine is valeant and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie to rule. For then they impute it not so much to his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steritie, as to their owne faults. Which ought to be punished according to the law. <hi>Tamerlane</hi> hanged a souldier of his, for stealing a cheese. This rigour was was very needfull. For else he should haue had no vittels in his campe, which was alway followed with infinit vitellers. And by being so rough tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards his souldiers, he got the good will of whole countries, in executing iustice vpon his men of warre according to the law. He was gentle to such as submitted themselues vnto him, but sharpe and cruell to such as resisted him: which was the way to winne much people. And no man withstood him. Wherfore I conclude, that whether it be the prince himselfe, or whether it be his lieutenant; he must not be so gentle to his souldiers, as to beare with all their faults: nor so courteous to
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:6660:205"/>
the plaine countrie-men, but that he must shew them all some examples of his seuerity, that they may stand in aw of him. But he must reserue his austerity for the wicked and stubborn sort; and he must vse gentlenes, meeldnes, and louingnes, towards his good souldiers and such as hold out their hands to yeeld themselues vnto him, whom he ought to intreat well, not for a day or twaine a some do, but for euer, to the end that the people which are his neighbors, may be allured to do the like, when they find that this his good dealing, proceedeth not of dissimulation, but of the very loue, meeldnes, and good nature of the prince.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He prince that hath to deale with arms, ought to be prouided of two things, namely of valeant and well experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced captaines, and of good and well trained souldiers.

But the question is, in case that both meet not togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whether it were better to haue an euill army and a good captaine, or a good armie and a bad captaine. This question seemeth to be doubtles. Notwithstanding forasmuch as <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiauell</hi> putteth it in ballance, although he resolue it after the common maner; yet am I to say a word or twaine of it by the way, to confirme it the better. In this discoursing vpon the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie of <hi>Titus Liuius,</hi> he saith, The valeantnes of the souldiers hath wrought wonders, and that they haue done better after the death of their captaine than afore, as it befell in the armie

which the Romans had in Spain vnder the conduct of the <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pios,</hi> the which hauing lost those two generals, did neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse ouercome their enemies. Moreouer he alleageth <hi>Lucul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> who being vntrained to the wars himselfe, was made a good captaine by the good peticaptains of the bands that were in his armie.

It is well knowen, that so long as the Volses had <hi>Coriolane</hi> to their captain they had alwaies the vpper hand against the Romans. But as soone as he was dead, they went by the worse.</p>
               <p>When the Romans had cowardly captains, they were continually beaten by the Numantines: but when <hi>Scipio</hi> was once chosen generall, they did so well ouerset their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, that in the end they rased Numance itselfe. And as I haue said in this discourse, when one vpbraided the Numan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines, that they suffered themselues to be beaten by those, whom they had so often beaten afore; they answered, That in very deed they were the same sheep, whom they had encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered afore,<note place="margin">Some one ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is of great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue in an host.</note> but they had another shepherd. This sheweth suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently, how greatly some one man may auaile in an armie. <hi>Antiochus</hi> not regarding the multitude of his enemies, asked a captain, How many me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he thought his presence to be worth? making account, that he himself alone should supply the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber which the captain desired. <hi>Eumenes</hi> had not an host so wel trained as his enemies: and yet he guided it in such sort, as he could neuer be ouercome. When <hi>Antigonus</hi> supposing this <hi>Eumenes</hi> to haue bin extreamly sick, was purposed not to haue lost the faire occasion of discomfiting his army, as soone as he saw the good gouernance therof, iudged incontinently that it was a good chieftaine that had the ordering thereof. And when he perceiued the horslitter of <hi>Eumene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As for that which is alledged of the <hi>Scipios,</hi> it will not serue. For inasmuch as the battell was well ordered afore, the Romans might well obtaine the victory, though both the consuls were there slain. Likewise, notwithstanding the death of the duke of Burbon, yet was Rome taken by his army, because the souldiers that had aduentured vpon the assault, knew not of the death of their captaine. And the Thebans failed not to get the victory though <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Againe, the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors armie which was sent against the marques of Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brough, gat the victorie notwithstanding that duke <hi>Moris</hi> the generall of the field lost his life there. And as touching that which is said of <hi>Lucullus,</hi> who had little experience of war; that is very true: Neuerthelesse he behaued himselfe so discretly in the warre wherein he was imploied, that he was nothing beholden to <hi>Pompey,</hi> which bereft him of the honour of conquering the whole East.</p>
               <p>And to shew that he was not led by the aduice of his army, but by his own skill; being at the siege of Tigranocerta, &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing counselled by some to raise his siege, and to go meet his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy who was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming towards him with great forces, and not to stay about the city: he beleeued his own wit, and vndertook a ieoperdous aduenture. For with the one halfe of his armie
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:6660:206"/>
he went to encounter his enemie, whom he ouercame, and left the other halfe afore the citie, the which he tooke at his returne. Also <hi>Plutarch</hi> commendeth him highly, for gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning himselfe so well, considering his small experience.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ith we haue giuen a head to an army, now we must come to the heart, and prouide it of that which is requisit for it within, which is nothing else but the good order that is to be vsed in ranging the men of war in battel-ray. For in this order consisteth the welfare and life of the host. This in mine opinion, should be handled by a man that had followed the wars the most part of his life; the which thing I cannot do for want of experience. Wherfore I leaue this chapter as a blanke paper, to be filled with good and goodly discourses, by some valeant and wel-experienced captaine. I wil but only set down the maner vsed in old time, shewing how they ordered their battels. The Greeks had a great battaile compacted and clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed togither of many ranks, which they named a Phalanx. When a souldier of a former ranke happened to be slaine or beaten downe,<note place="margin">Of the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanx.</note> he of the next ranke stept into his place; and he of the third ranke into the place of the second: and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently

al the rest, as the Suissers also do at this day, so as no ranke was disfurnished but only the hindermost; the former were alwaies kept whole and vnbroken, by reason of their great number, so thronged and close couched as they were hard to be opened. And albeit that the Romans were most expert in warre,<note place="margin">The policie of <hi>Paulus Aemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And when he discouered any part of their battell opened, he made some small troope of his men to enter into it, and so by fighting in small companies in places where he perceiued any default, he brake their aray and discomfited them. But the Romans had another order, which might hold the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tack in fight a whole day, after such maner as I wil tel you, presupposing that they deuided their people into many sorts of companies. One was of a <hi>Camarada</hi> of ten men, the which they termed a Maniple, a word wherby they betokened that which we call a band. And setting aside many degrees like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ours; they had their cohorts, of six hundred men a peece, or there abouts. Then was the legion, which was of six thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand footmen, comprehending with it three hundred hors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and was compacted of ten cohorts: Wherein were two sorts of armour, the one light, and they that wore those, were named Velites, which serued to skirmish as our harquebusirs, our forlorne hopes, and our light horsmen do now adaies. And they that wore the heauier armour, were called Cataphracti. Now hauing their battell compacted of a legion,<note place="margin">The order o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And to that end they parted their legion into three maner of men, that is to wit, Pikemen, Principals, &amp; Triaries. The Pikemen being the formost and of least valeancie and experience,<note place="margin">Pikemen.</note> fought thicke set, and had many mo men in their
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:6660:207"/>

                     </gap>he Principals</note> to the intent that if the first battell were foyled, they might retire without disorder within the battell of the Principals, and there begin the fight againe. And if it happened by mischance, that the battell of the Principals was foiled also, which happened not oft,<note place="margin">The Triarie.</note> then they were receiued by the Triaries, who had their ranks looser than the Principals, that they might receiue into them the souldiers of the other two battels. Now these Tria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries were the valiantest and best experienced of all the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie. Therfore by the orderly retyring of the Pikemen and Principals, into the ranks of the Triaries, who were old soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, the fight was maintained more than afore. So then the Pikemen who made the foresront, had their battell well stuffed and furnished with men. The Principals had their battell somewhat thinner, that they might without disorder, receiue into them the former ranks. And the Triaries were twice as thin as they. And after that maner they fought stout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without disorder all the day long. And it may be, that the same order being brought in vse againe, might be found good and profitable.</p>

And yet was he forced from the passage, and the king of England passed with all his host, hauing but six houres to passe them in, which was the time betweene the ebbe and the tide. The Flemings tooke stoutly vpon them, to stop the passage of the Frenchmen ouer the riuer Alis, which was both deepe and maddie; and although it was about the feast of Saint <hi>Martin,</hi> yet notwithstanding a part of the vauntgard passed about a league from the bridge of Comines, in two or three boats, whereof the greatest carried not aboue nine men at once, who after they were arriued, did hide themselues in an Aldercarre, right ouer against the place where they tooke boat. And when they were all togither, they marched against the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Flemmings, and woon the bridge of Comines. When the marshall of Hesse sent the Reisters into Fraunce, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of <hi>Monsieur D' Andelot</hi>; the late earle of Neuers, and the marshall of Saint <hi>Andrew,</hi> were sent to stop their passage, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the riuers began to swell being in the end of October.

In the yeare 1567. they came againe vnder the leading of <hi>Casimire</hi> the countie Palatines sonne. To stop whose passage, because it was not meant to hasard a pitcht field, a part of the kings power was sent vnder the leading of the duke of Neuers that now is, who spared not the pioners to make trenches, nor to set lets in places that might bee waded, nor to enterlace trees to stop the passage: and yet all this could not let them, but that they passed at their ease. Afterward the king to stay the meetings of those whom he meant to punish, ceised all the bridges and passages, and set good gards at them: and yet for all that they ceassed not to passe in two places of the riuer Loir, to Bonnie and Rosyers, where the <hi>Monsier d' Andelot</hi> lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great companies, passed his men both on hors-backe and on foote at a foord, though he had some of them drowned. <hi>Charles M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The mountains of Italie neuer made the Hunnes or Herules a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid: for they leauing those high rockes behind them, got the passage of Aquileia, and passed all their people there.

It is to grosse a kind of play, to hazard a battell when a man stands
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:6660:210"/>
vpon his gard. <hi>Gasely</hi> one of the great captains of Egypt, said, That the warres of greatest importance, which at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning haue vehement and sodaine swayes, are woont to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swage of themselues by intermission and space of delay:<note place="margin">A prince can not aduenture a battell in his owne country without great daunger.</note> and that on the contrarie part, man cannot assay a battell in his owne countrie without great daunger, because there is no way to amend a fault that is done in battel. For if the battell be lost, the countrie is in great perill to be lost too, as befell to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans at the battell of Cannas against <hi>Hanniball.</hi> To <hi>Campson</hi> and <hi>Tomombey</hi> against <hi>Selim</hi>; and vnto the last king of Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, who chose rather to bid the Turke battel, than to winne time of him: for he lost both his life and his kingdome. <hi>Xerxes</hi> by loosing the battell against the Greeks, lost but his men, because he was the assailant. But <hi>Darius</hi> by giuing battell in his owne countrie, lost his whole kingdome. And to say the truth, it was to grosse a kind of play, against one that had so small a rest. And he shewed himselfe too negligent in his own defence, and too hastie in bidding battell. Too negligent, in that he being so great a lord, and hauing wherewith to set out a million of men, he tooke not order to haue three armies in a readinesse, one to enter into the countrie of Greece, therby to turne their forces backe againe; another to watch at the passage into his owne countrie, and the third to be about him in his realme, to gather vp those againe togither, which had not beene able to defend the passage, and to haue encamped himselfe in a sure place of aduauntage, to follow the taile of <hi>Alexanders</hi> host, as <hi>Fabius</hi> did the host of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> that he might not be compelled to come to a battell.

<pb n="398" facs="tcp:6660:211"/>
that feare, for he came to meet <hi>Darius</hi> in the face, and with a well ordered armie gaue him battell, and discomfited him. Wherin <hi>Darius</hi> did greatly amisse, for he might haue held him play with his great number of men, &amp; haue wearied him with some of his light horsemen (as the Parthians could well skill to do afterward to the Romans) without hazarding the substance of his armie.<note place="margin">The despising of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, is the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow of great princes.</note> And the thing that vndid him, was his ouerweening opinion that he should ouercome <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> with ease, which is the thing that ouerthroweth all such as vpon disdain to their enemies, do set no good order in their affairs, and in the leading of their armies.

The duke of Guelders finding a great power of the Brabanders comming vpon him, was sore asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, for he saw that he must either fight thirtie to one, or else shut vp himselfe in a citie. To shut vp himselfe he was loth, and therefore fully resoluing himselfe to abide the battell, he fell to giuing charge vpon his enemies vnprouided, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken with a lunatike feare, fled away without striking a stroke. <hi>Stillico</hi> went and charged suddenly vpon the Gothes, as they were going into Gallia.

And in driuing off the time a while longer, and in tarying for his men that were dispersed in diuerse places of his realme, he had both made himselfe the stronger, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so brought his enemie to extreme necessitie. But in chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing rather to set vpon his enemies while they were wearie, and ill at ease of the long iourney that they had made; he found by experience that nothing is vnpossible to a conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour: for he lost the battell and died. <hi>Carafa</hi> the countie of Mathalon, would not beleeue the counsell of them that would haue had him to follow the French-men that drew toward Salerne, and to haue cut off their vittails without figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with them, vnlesse they could take them in some place of aduauntage; or to get betweene Salerne and their campe, to keep them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> entring into the town, &amp; to make them returne into the Basilicat, because they wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted both vittels &amp; artillery.

they were but few in number: and for his labour he lost the field. For the lord of Perfie attending him with resolution, discomfited him. Had he beene trained in the schoole of king <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleuenth, he would haue learned, that he which hath the profit of a warre, hath also the honour therof. When <hi>Ferdinand</hi> king of Naples began to reconquer the realme of Naples, he was so ioyfull of his good fortune, that in a braue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie he would needs giue battell to the Frenchmen, contrarie to the aduice of a great captaine, who counselled him to hold himselfe close within Seminara, vntill he were more certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aduertised of the intent and power of the Frenchmen; tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him that the counsels which promise suretie in all things, are honourable inough; and that they which by a fond ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustinesse of courage, do hinder the means whereby a matter should come to good issue, are void of honour, shamefull, and miserable.

Yet notwithstanding they forbare not to giue bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, and lost it.

And although fortune began to turne her back vpon <hi>Hanniball</hi>; yet notwithstanding, had not the foresight of <hi>Fabius</hi> ben, the valeancy of <hi>Marcellus</hi> had serued the Romans to small purpose. But <hi>Hanniball</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing two valeant captains vpon him at once, of two diuerse humours, was sore incumbered how to deale with them. For when <hi>Marcellus</hi> had lost a battell, <hi>Fabius</hi> was readie at hand to stop <hi>Hanniball</hi> from passing any further. And in this case, seeing the Romans were able to maintaine two armies, and it stoode them on hand to conquer, or at leastwise to recouer that which they had lost at the iourny of Cannas: they were not misaduised in their counsell, to chuse these two braue captains of so differing humors, to the intent that the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all fighting of the one might wearie <hi>Hanniball,</hi> and the linge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of <hi>Fabius</hi> might ouerthrow him.

               <p>The Romans did so against the Gaules and Germaines, against <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> and against <hi>Hanniball.</hi> So did <hi>Charles Martell</hi> against the Sarzins, and <hi>Philip</hi> of Valois against king <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="403" facs="tcp:6660:213"/>
against the Frenchmen, had taught him to seeke the oportunitie of time. For sith the former way auailed him not, it behoued him to try another.</p>
               <p>The Gaules were valeant and furious in fight; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Cneus Sulpicius</hi> did well to protract time with them. <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niball</hi> was inuincible in Italie, and therefore <hi>Fabius</hi> did wisely in trying another way; and <hi>Scipio</hi> did boldly and valeantly in making warre in Affricke, to turne him away from Italie. If <hi>Manfred</hi> had taken the aduauntage of time at Naples, he had done wel: for he had cut the combes of the Fenchmen, who are furious and almost vnpregnable at the first brunt; and had in short time brought <hi>Charles</hi> to vtter want of vittels and monie. Contrariwise it stood <hi>Conradine</hi> on hand, to giue battell to <hi>Charles</hi> duke of Aniou as he did: For he was to reconquer the countrie.

For first he ment to alay the fire which he saw increasing in such sort, as it would be hard to quench, if it were once throughly kindled in all parts. Againe, he feared least the prolonging of time, would increase the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry side, and that many would incline that way, if it were not preuented by destroying the chiefe leaders of that part by a bloody battel. And as for winning therof, he thought himselfe sure of it. For although the contrary party had the choise of the souldiers of the old bands; yet had he not such a number of

They that hold the opinion that a man cannot be enforced to battell, alledge
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:6660:214"/>
the examples of <hi>Cneus Sulpicius</hi> against the Gaules, of <hi>Fabius Maximus</hi> against <hi>Hannibal,</hi> of <hi>Pericles</hi> against the Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, of <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth against <hi>Edward</hi> king of England, of the constable of France at Auignion, of the duke of <hi>Alua</hi> at Naples against the duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> and of diuers others, who by delay of time brought the enterprises of their enemies to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and were neuer enforced to come to handstrokes. On the contrarie part, they that haue hazarded a battell in their owne countrie, haue found themselues ill apaid, as <hi>Craesus</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Cyrus, Darius</hi> against <hi>Alexander, Philip</hi> of Valois against king <hi>Edward,</hi> and many others aforealledged, whom we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare to speake of to auoid tediousnes.<note place="margin">A mighty ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel vs to come to handstroks.</note> But these examples are not able to proue, that a captaine cannot be compelled to fight whether he will or no. For when a conquering enemie commeth strongly into a countrie, he may compell you to come to battell, or else to flee, or else to shut vp your selfe in some citie, which are dishonourable points, and of dangerous consequence. The duke of Saxonie meant to haue wone time of the emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth after that maner, vpon trust of the great riuer Albis that was betweene the two camps: but the emperour found a foord, the which was shewed him by a miller, whereat he passed some of the troops of his horsmen; and the residue did so much by swimming and by boats, that they got land on the side where their enemies lay. <hi>Philip</hi> king of Macedonie the father, and <hi>Perses</hi> his son, encamped them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues vpon a mountaine, wherunto there was but one onely accesse, very difficult.

Ye know how the late prince of Condie, trusting to the riuer Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, came before Newcastle, thinking it vnpossible for vs to haue enforced him to battell, but to our disaduantage: and yet was he driuen therto without any difficulty.<note place="margin">An army may be compelled to come to handstroks.</note> And therfore I say with <hi>Machiauell</hi> in his discourses, that a very small army may well wearie and vexa conqueror, but in the end they shal not keepe themselues from battell, vnlesse they will leaue the

field free to their enemies. As for the examples that I haue alledged of <hi>Pericles,</hi> and of king <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, they will not serue the turne in this case. For they had no armies, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were contented to hold themselues close and in couert.

But <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niball</hi> thought it better to sound the retreit, than to hazard himselfe against so mighty an enemy, that could not be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by his slights, as other captains had ben whom he had sought withall. As touching that which the constable did at Auinion, it proued him to be of good discretion. For being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to make head against so mightie an enemy, he was faine to fortifie and strengthen himselfe, in a place where he might not be forced.

As touching the fact of the duke of Alua, holding fast continually this principle, Not to come to battell in his owne country, without necessitie; when he saw that the duke of Guise had not yet taken sooting in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Naples, but rather that he was stopped at a litle town which he could not obtain: the protracting of time was needful for him. And if the duke of Guise would haue passed on fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he should haue wanted vittels, hauing so great an armie attending vpon him at hand to cut them off, &amp; not one towne wherein to make his storehouse.<note place="margin">Protracting of time is profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, when an armie may lodge at ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntage.</note> So that the duke of Aluaes protracting of time, hauing lodged his camp in a strong &amp; sure place, was profitable to himselfe, and preiudiciall to the duke of Guise, who sought nothing so much as to come to hand strokes, whereby he might haue opened vnto himself a way into the realme of Naples, if he had had the lucke to win the battell: but he could neuer come vnto it. The emperour <hi>Charles</hi> and the king of France, plaid at the barriers one against another in Picardie and Arthois. For as soone as the one did put off armes, the other entered by and by into his countrie with an armed power. And all the fruit of their salies one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst another in al a whole summer, was but the taking of som litle towne: &amp; so they skirmished one with another at handie strokes. And in this case, although there was a light armie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the assailant, onely to cumber him, and to cut off vittels from him: yet was it wisely done to shun the combat. For it was well knowne, that the winter would cause the armie to break vp, &amp; there was no need to put any one man in ieopardy.</p>

And hereunto I will adde that which <hi>Paulus Iouius</hi> saith in his hystorie,<note place="margin">Why the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie inuaded not the Turks dominion while <hi>Selim</hi> was in Egypt.</note> where he demaundeth, Why <hi>Ismael Sophie</hi> king of Persland, did let slip so faire an occasion of inuading the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Selim</hi> emperour of the Turks, at such time as <hi>Selim</hi> was so sore incombred in Egypt? The reason is, that the king of Persia hath not sufficient power to make warre out of his owne countrie, vpon so mightie a prince as the Turke is, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that the noble men and gentlemen, in whom co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sisteth a great part of the Persian strength, are loth to go to the wars out of their countrie, because they serue at their owne char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.

Also we haue seene how the Parthians afore them, neuer passed so much to conquer out of their owne realme, as to keepe their owne at home, and that they haue discomfited all the armies of the Romans that euer came against them. Neither hath the common saying beene verified of them, That the assailants haue euer more courage than the defendants. For that is not euer true.

When <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> came to Tarent, the Romans suffered him not to approch to their gates, but sent to encounter him before he came there. And when they had lost one battell, they renued it again with a fresh supplie, as though it had beene with the water of some continuall running spring. And although this was in Italie, yet was it not in the countrie of the Romans. For they sent so manie men to meet him, that he could neuer come home to them: in so much that <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> said, That if he should win but one battell more of them, it were inough to worke his own vtter ouerthrow; because he could neuer get any victorie of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but with great losse of his people. So soone as the Romans vnderstood that <hi>Hannibal</hi> was determined to passe the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, they dispatched an armie out of their countrie, to be in a readinesse at the foot of the hill, either to encounter him, or else to wearie and cumber him by all means possible. And it was seene by experience, that the two or three battels which he woon, stood him in little stead. For he could not for all that, get so much as any one citie into his hands. But when he once came neere to Rome, and had woon the famous bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell of Cannas against them in their owne soyle: then hee wanne many cities, and made many people to submit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to his obedience. And there was none other impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that he tooke not Rome it selfe, but onely the fatall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinie of the citie. Such daunger cannot befall a man in a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reine countrie. As for example, The Romans were vtterlie ouerthrowne by the Parthians, and yet for all that, they nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not to feare the inuading of their citie. They lost manie battels to the Carthagenenses, both on sea and land, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the Carthagenenses vnto them, and yet neither of them both tooke care for the defence of their citie, but to make a new armie to worke reuenge. But <hi>Hannibal</hi> saw, that the best way to haue a hand at the Romans, was to seeke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at their

And the Romans themselues being schooled by <hi>Hannibal,</hi> perceiued well that the way to driue the Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genenses out of Italie, and to bring their owne matters to good effect, was to shew their legions before the gates of Carthage, and to bid them battell there, and so they did. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the winning of the which battell, the Romans became lords of Carthage. <hi>Actius</hi> liked better to fight with <hi>Attila</hi> in Fraunce, than to attend his comming into Italie.

For he that is maister of the field, will haue vittels at his aduauntage, wanting neither carts, guides, nor spies. As long as <hi>Hannibal</hi> was in Italie, he could better skill how to plant his campe, and to giue battell to his owne aduauntage, than could the Romans being in their owne countrie.

<pb n="415" facs="tcp:6660:219"/>
the souldiers and men of armes haue bene too neere their own houses; which thing was not done so in Spaine, England, and Italie. And as for the assembling of much people, it would behoue a man to seeke another countrie than this, where the princes listing not to traine their subiects to the warre, are constrained to craue aid of straungers.<note place="margin">An answer to the seuenth argument.</note> Wheras it is said, That the defendant hazardeth but a part of his power: certainly he hazardeth as much as the assailant. For when the assailant departeth out of his countrie, he leaueth garrisons and men of warre behind him to defend it against sudden troubles that might ensue of insurrections by absence of the prince, or by some sodaine inuasion of some neighbor that would take him vnprouided, as <hi>Iames</hi> king of Scots did to his owne vndoing, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the king of England, at such time as he was passed to Calice with a great force, and was occupied about the siege of Tirwin and Turney. So that no well aduised prince setteth vp all his rest vpon the hazard of one battell, but doth euer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue a store for after-claps.

And oftentimes fortune is so fauourable to the vanquisher, that after a victorie he maketh himselfe lord of the whole realme, and needeth not to make any other agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with his prisoner, than to grant or take away his life at his own pleasure.<note place="margin">Fortune fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth the aduenterous.</note> It is commonly said that fortune furthereth the aduenterous, and we see it so by experience. <hi>Nin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The campe that is well planted, ought to be nere a riuer, that they may haue the commoditie of water, which cannot be forborne; and also for the fortifying of themselues, and for the doing of their enterprises. For a riuer doth wonderfully strengthen a camp, because the enemy cannot passe it without danger. But a captaine must also be maister of the riuer, and not coope vp himselfe betweene two riuers, except he haue means to get out againe at his pleasure, least it disappoint him of the commoditie of vittels and of succours, as it befell to <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Caesar</hi> in Spaine, against <hi>Affraenius</hi> and <hi>Petreius.</hi> But that happeneth commonly by some extraordinarie ouerflowing, wherof notwithstanding a man shal discharge himselfe so well,<note place="margin">Of woods.</note> that he shall ouercome them afterward.

                  <hi>Perseus</hi> had planted his campe to great pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose on a high ground of aduantage neere the mountaine O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limpus, and had caused all the passages of the hill to be ware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kept, sauing one that seemed vnapprochable.

But neither the one nor the other durst go find out his enemie, because there was a maris betwixt them. But aboue all things a captaine must beware that he lodge not in the midst of a hill, vnlesse he be sure from aboue, sor by that means he may easily indomage his host: as <hi>Salomon</hi> a captaine of the Romans endomaged the Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusians,<note place="margin">The policy of <hi>Salomon.</hi>

In the dawning of the day he marched with his armie directlie vp the hill, and at the same instant the other part of his armie shewed themselues to the enemies vpon the toppe of the hill, so as the Maurisians perceiuing themselues to be betweene the two armies, and hauing their enemies both aboue them on the toppe of the hill, and beneath them at the foot, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to take them to flight through the thick forrest, with the losse of siue thousand men, and not one Roman slaine. <hi>Sylla</hi> to compasse <hi>Mithridates,</hi>

And as they were so all assembled, suddenly comes in a post, whom he had procured, as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople with letters, which he presented: wherein the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour sent them word that he had sent them another armie, as great or greater than that they had alreadie.

make his praiers, in a certaine church of the Christians, that was neare the towne; and for his conuey, caried with him fiue thousand horses vnperceiued of the enemies, who by chaunce tooke another way to come to the campe before the towne. When <hi>Iustine</hi> vnderstood by the noise, that his enemies were afore the towne, setting vp scaling ladders, digging, and making a great assault to enter in, immediatly he turned head, and with his horsemen went and charged vpon his enemies, that were at the point to haue woon the towne. Whereas they being greatly amazed, and thinking that it had beene the fresh succours which they had heard of, tooke themselues to sight, and being pursued by the men of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, were almost all put to the sword. <hi>Eumenes</hi> vsing dissimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation wisely,<note place="margin">To keep soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers from knowing the enemie, to whom the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall suspec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traied by his owne men.</note> got the victorie against <hi>Craterus.</hi> For when he vnderstood that <hi>Neoptolemus</hi> and <hi>Craterus</hi> came against him, in hope to cause his souldiers to turne to their part by the onely brute of their comming, and also to take them vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares as they were making good cheare, becaue they came then freshly from the discomfiting of <hi>Neoptolemus</hi>: he held his armie in good order, and readie to fight, and therewithall caused a report to run abrode, that it was <hi>Neoptolemus</hi> and <hi>Pigres</hi> that came backe vpon him a fresh, with certaine horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men gathered at aduenture out of Cappadocia, and Paphla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonia. And to keepe his countrimen from knowing <hi>Craterus,</hi> he set not one Macedonian against him in the forefront, but placed there two companies of straungers that were men of armes, commaunding them expresly to run vpon their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies as soone as they saw them, and to charge vpon them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly, without giuing them leysure to parlie, or to retire, and without giuing any eare to the heraults and trumpetters that should be sent vnto them; because he feared least the Macedonians would turne against him, if they once knew that <hi>Craterus</hi> was there. Wherefore as soone as <hi>Eumenes</hi> men espied their enemies, they failed not to run against them a full gallop, as they had beene commaunded. At the sight wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <hi>Craterus</hi> was greatly abashed: for he thought that the
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:6660:227"/>
Macedonians should haue turned on his side, as <hi>Neoptolemus</hi> had promised him. Neuerthelesse, dealing like a man of valor, he also spurred his horse against his enemies, and did so well that the battel was fought a long time with doubtful ballance, but in the end <hi>Eumenes</hi> woon the field, and <hi>Craterus</hi> and <hi>Neop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolemus</hi> the chieftanes of his enemies were both slaine.

With the which menace the townsmen were so scared, that they stirred not out of their houses, and the Englishmen being too few to abide the assault, were ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laid with force, and put all to the sword. The countie of Fois intending to go from Bolonia to Bresse the nearest way, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer it, tooke his iourney through the duke of Mantuas ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorie. And because he was to passe by certaine sluces, which were fast shut vp and well garded, he sent to the duke of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua to desire passage: who notwithstanding that he was against the Frenchmen; yet being abashed at his so sudden comming, was faine to open him the passage, the which he would haue denied him if he had not seene his power.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen two armies come within sight one of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be kept from skirmishing, the which is somtime necessary, and somtime verie daungerous. And this poynt (as saith <hi>Machiauell</hi>) is one of that number, wherein the euill is so neare vnto the good, that the
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:6660:227"/>
one is easily taken for the other. I haue often heard this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion of making skirmishes blamed by <hi>Monsieur Tauannes,</hi> who would not put any thing in perill, but all to profit. For he would either fight in good earnest, or hold himselfe quiet without fighting, and reserue his forces to some good occasion. Some will say that such skirmishes giue the more courage to men of war, and make them, as it were to record their lessons, and the things that are to be done in battell. It is a making of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to look vpon the wolf, that by beholding of him through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they should not be afraid of him. But on the contrarie part also, if the wolfe bite them, it is to be doubted least they will become the colder in hunting him. Three dayes afore the battell of Moncounter, the armie of the <hi>Monsieur,</hi> and the armie of the princes, skirmished vpon the banke of the riuer Dine, but that skirmish was so rough for them, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan that day to despair of the victorie, &amp; to be shie of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter which they had anon after. But now to make some resolution vpon the discourse of the hystorie (which is the thing that I pretend) I say that skirmishes are of two or three sorts.<note place="margin">The sorts of skirmishes.</note> Sometimes when men lie in garrison, and warres are prolonged, they skirmish with a few men to giue a stroke with the speare, or to make some gallant enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise, as was done at Bolloyne against the Englishmen: For they that were in the great fort, and in the fort of the Chastilion, did often times issue out against the Englishmen that lay in garrison in Bolloyne, and there made certain light skirmishes, and so returned into their holds againe. This fight was commended of men of warre, who should but haue lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered there, if they had not now and then led foorth their bands, and come downe into the plaine.</p>
               <p>Sometimes it is needfull to make skirmishes to assure and to traine your men, as <hi>Pelopidas</hi> and <hi>Epaminondas</hi> did agaynst the Lacedemonians. These two captaines were valiant in their owne persons, and had men of good courage, for they fought for their libertie. But they were but meanlie trayned to the warres, and had to do with the
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:6660:228"/>
Lacedemonians, who had not their peeres in all Greece. Therefore to encourage their men, the said captaines did ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whiles let them loose to the Lacedemonians at aduantage, as men do yong hounds to a hare.<note place="margin">Skirmishes made to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage, do make the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie despised.</note> And as they were somewhat fleshed, they drew them backe of purpose, and would not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard them too much afore battell, to the intent that tasting the sweetnesse of victorie, they might learne to shake off the feare of their enemie, which was thought to be inuincible; and contrariwise, that the beholding of him, and the often victories had of him to their aduauntage, might cause them to set light by him. Therefore it was needfull to assure them by such skirmishes, afore they should come to battell. <hi>Valerius Goruinus</hi> did the like against the Samnites, for feare (as <hi>Titus Liuius</hi> saith) least the new kind of warre, and the new enemie, should dismay them. But such skirmishes must be made with discretion, and not vpon a head, neither must the generall of an armie permit them, except he perceiue some verie great aduauntage on his owne part, to be had without losse or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Sometime skirmishes are made to begin battels, and those may and must be: for it is the entrance into the battel. But for as much as some do but onely sustaine such skirmishes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out breaking out vpon their enemies, I will speake a word thereof, afore I speake of the battell.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His would not deserue a chapter, no nor to be once spoken of, but that <hi>Machiauel</hi> in his discourses hath made a pretie small chapter of it, with a short reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution therevpon. And forasmuch as in mine opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, his resolution seemeth not to agree with <hi>Iulius Caesars</hi>; I will speake a word of it by the way. Now then he saith, that
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:6660:228"/>
when <hi>Decius</hi> and <hi>Fabius</hi> consuls of Rome, made war against the Samnits and Tuscanes, <hi>Decius</hi> went with his whole power to assaile his enemies; and <hi>Fabius</hi> did but only ward him, dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the lingering assault to be the more for his behoof, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing his force to the vpshot, when the enemy should haue forgone his first heat; and therfore that the dealings of <hi>Fabius,</hi> had better successe than the doings of <hi>Decius.</hi> For <hi>Deciussis</hi> le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions were all discomfited, and himselfe slaine; wheras <hi>Fabius</hi> went away with the victory, by reseruing his forces vnto such necessities. Of which example he gathereth his resolution, that the doing of <hi>Fabius</hi> is more sure than the others. But this resolution cannot satisfie me. For it is vnpossible to keepe ones selfe from fighting, when the enemy commeth with full pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to assaile. Well may ye do so when you be well intren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, for the enemy cannot assaile you but to his owne losse. But when a day of battell is set, either you must forsake the place, or else fight. And in this case the running together and the shouting of the hostes, giueth the greater cheerfulnesse and force to the men of war.<note place="margin">We must then reserue our forces for bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, when the enemy letteth vs alone.</note> It is another thing that <hi>Fabius</hi> did in reseruing his forces for battell, while the enemie did spit out his fire in another place. And this policie was practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the late duke of Guise, at the battell of Dreux: for how much soeuer he was intreated to giue battell, he would neuer come to it, vntill he saw that his enemies had spit out all their fire, and that persuading themselues to be sure of the victorie afore hand, they fell to pillage. For then he set vpon them with all his forces fresh and vndiminished, and gaue them the foile. By the way, it had not ben in the power of the constable to refuse battell, nor in the duke of Guisis pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er neither, if he had ben set vpon. For then had it behoued him of necessitie to fight, and to that intent came they the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But it was a great point of wisdome in the duke of Guise, that seeing his enemies had left him behind, he reserued his power for such a need. And therein he did as <hi>Fabius,</hi> and as <hi>Charles</hi> of Aniou did against <hi>Conradine.</hi> But to know whether in a battell, men ought to sustaine the assault of the enemie
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:6660:229"/>
without running vpon him, or to daunt him at the first push; the case is to be ruled by the resolution that <hi>Caesar</hi> maketh therof in his Commentaries, where he findeth fault with <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey,</hi>

Wherein he saith he did a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table fault, because the shoutings and the running together, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth the force of the souldiers, who go therewith the more cheerfully and fiercely to the battell.

And when the bridge is made well and dilligently, he must passe ouer foure faucons, and fiue or six hundred men on foot, and some cariages with speed to stop them, and also some pio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to make trenches at need.

This bickering gaue the emperour leisure to passe his army in boats, and to obtain the further bank. Sometimes hast is made to take the enemy vnprouided, and out of aray, to astonish him and to break the order of his bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, as <hi>Henrie</hi> the bastard of Castile did against his lawfull bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>don Peter,</hi> by the aduice of <hi>Bertrand</hi> of <hi>Guesclin.</hi> For he saw he had but few men, and considered that if <hi>don Peter</hi> should haue come against him in battell, raunged in good order, he had not beene able to stand against him, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the small number of men that he had to encounter so great a number of well trained souldiers, as <hi>don Peter</hi> brought with him.

Neuerthelesse, they were pursued by the Athenians, who compelled them to raunge themselues in battell, and to fight in the middest of a strait, where for the better fortifying of themselues, and to stoppe the Athenians from issuing out, they raunged their ships in a ring, wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now to giue a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine rule thereof, it is vnpossible; neither is it my intent, but onely to put in practise the auncient histories, and to put in writing the policies that haue beene vsed by men of old time. <hi>Hanniball</hi> that captain of singular experience, ordered his bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell in such wise at Cannas, that he set the best men of their hands on the two sides, and filled vp the middest with the worser. The which two wings he caused to shoot themselues forth in a point, inioyning them that as soone as the Romans had broken the forefront, and pursued them as they retired backe, so as the middle of the battell came shrinking in, and bowing in compasse like a new moone, and that the Romans were come within it; then they should fall vpon them on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side, and inclose the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in behind. Insomuch that the battel which at the beginning was informe of a wedge, was at length

in forme of a Cressant, which was a cause of the great slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The constable of Clisson vsed almost the same fashion, at the battell of Rosebecke. He led his host diuided in three parts; a vauntgard, a maine-battell, and a rereward, and all three neere one another. But when they began to approch, they stepped forth into wings, so as the middleward was som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what shrunke in, and drawne backer: but the men of armes that were in the wings fell to it so furiously, that the Flem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings were not able to follow them that were in the battell, insomuch that it set it selfe in strength againe, and the Flem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings being cooped in betweene the three battels, lost al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most fiue and twentie thousand of their men. <hi>Amur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For he caused his two wings to aduance forward, wherein hee had almost threescore thousand men, and set himselfe well closed in the bulcke of the battell, sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding eight thousand men afore to skirmish, and to keepe his armie from being discouered, whom he commaunded, that when they were assailed by the Christians, they should tetire to the bodie of the battell. The which thing they did so fitly, that the Frenchmen which were in the vaward were inclosed on all sides, and the most part of them slaine or taken, and the rest were driuen to flee, to their great losse. But he that doth this,<note place="margin">The ranks must not be inlarged where is but few men.</note> must haue a great number of men. For it is a daungerous matter to enlarge the ranks, when a man hath but few men, because that thereby he maketh them the thinner, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently the easier to be broken.

It was the first mischiefe that <hi>Darius</hi> receaued at the hand of <hi>Alexander.</hi> His wisest men councelled him to tarrie for <hi>Alexander</hi> in a plaine and open countrie, seeing he had a desire to fight with him, and not to go seeke him in Cilicia, in strait and narrow places, where if he tooke him in the straits, his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie would stand him in no stead to fight,<note place="margin">A great armie must not chuse a hill-ground, but a plain cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion.</note> so pent vp. But he not crediting that wholesome counsell, found too late, that a great armie ought alwayes to choose a large place, where a man may with his great number enclose his enemie, which he cannot do in a narrow roome.

this victorie made the Lacedemonians to take such courage again vnto them, that returning back they gaue a fresh charge vpon the Achaians, whom it was easie to defeat, because the one halfe of their power was gone from them. <hi>Demetrius</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing discomfited a wing of his enemies, chased them so far, that he could not ioin again with his footmen; by reason wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they being destitut of their horsmen, were all discomfited. <hi>Philopemen</hi> perceiuing that <hi>Machauidas</hi> the tirant of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonians, had put his archers to slight at the beginning of the battell, determined to let him passe on without resisting him.

The which being done, he met suddainly with <hi>Machauidas</hi> comming back from the chase and thinking to win all: and slue him as he would haue leaped a ditch.

He for his part had set his men in order of battel, and as soone as night was come, he made them to march a leysurely pace. Now so long as the fire that bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the fagots vpon the oxens hornes was but small, the oxen went faire and easily vp the foot of the hill, like as it had beene an armie marching in aray with torches lighted. But when the fire once burned the roots of their hornes, then

they began to push one another, and to run here and there o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the hils for the paine that they felt. This did so astonish the Romans that kept the passage, for feare least they should be beset, that they durst not tarie at the passage where they were appointed, but leauing the straits fell to fleeing towards their campe.

should be three dayes later in comming than they were looked for.<note place="margin">Of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of a mans feare.</note> Thereupon he commaunded his captains, to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble their souldiers into a place certaine, and in the meane while he himselfe went to choose a place meet to encampe in, that might be plainly seene, vpon the top of a mountaine where his enemie should passe, in comming on the side of the wildernesse. Then fortified hee his trenches, and departed them in foure quarters, wherein he made good store of fires, in such distance one from another, as are woont to be made in a campe. This was no sooner done, but <hi>Antigonus</hi> came vnder the hill, who perceiuing the fires all along, was greatly displeased thereat, thinking that his enemies had been aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised of his comming long afore, and that they were come to meet him. Wherefore fearing least he should be compelled, to come to battell with them being fresh &amp; well rested, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as his men were wearie and halfe tired: he returned home an easier way. In the meane while <hi>Eumenes</hi> gathered his men to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither at his leisure. Sometime a generall of a campe dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth his flight, and dislodgeth so secretly in the night, that his enemies are not ware of it till it be too late, as king <hi>Francis</hi> the first did, after he had vittailed Laundersey. And in this case he must make fires after the accustomed maner, and in such sort as they may not go out of a long time: he must set vp men of straw in the tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ches with some motions, he must lay trunchio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and bats of wood along the rampire, &amp; leaue matches burning, as the marshall of Fois did at Parma, to the end it may be thought a far off, that they be harquebusses, &amp; such like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits as a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may deuise. But the thing that may most deceiue the enemy, is the leauing of some horsmen to come last away, to occupie the vauntcurrors, in case that any be sent out to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the taile of the host.<note place="margin">The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="459" facs="tcp:6660:241"/>
in extreame feare, and do not any thing of value, as befell to the Frenchmen at Saint Quintins, and to the Spaniards at Zerbes, in the yeare a thousand fiue hundred and seuen and fiftie. For in either of those discomfitures, were mo men vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done for not resoluing themselues to fight, than had beene if they had beene resolutely bent vnto it. The like hapned to <hi>Cleon</hi> chieftaine of the Athenians, against <hi>Brasidas</hi> chieftain of the Lacedemonians. <hi>Cleon</hi> went to view Amphipolis how to besiege it, not supposing that <hi>Brasidas</hi> would haue encounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him, neither had <hi>Cleon</hi> any desire that he should, because he had not his whole power with him, without the which he would not fight with him. But when he saw his enemies come vpon him to bid him battell, contrarie to his expectation, he gaue his men a token to retire, and so they did with al the hast they could. But when <hi>Brasidas</hi> saw his enemies begin to shrink, he had the more courage to presse vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him. The which he did with such speed, that he ouercame him &amp; got the victorie. He that will read the 11. chapter of the fift booke of Thucidides, shall find there a retreit, much resembling the retreit of the Frenchmen at Saint Quintins, and well neare a like discomfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Therfore a captaine must conceale from his souldiers, what feare he hath to fight, and giue them to vnderstand, that his retiring is not to eschue battell, but to draw his enemies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a more commodious place, and of more aduauntage: and he must leaue some horsemen in the face of his enemies, as wel to hide the departure of his footmen, as also to stay such as come to skirmish with them: and in any wise he must take the places of aduauntage and straits whereat his armie is to passe, as <hi>Hanniball</hi> did by the policie aforementioned, to the intent that the strait be not an impediment of the passing of his armie, and that it may serue to stop the enemies that would thrust into it to pursue him. <hi>Philopemen</hi> seeing himselfe too weake, made his retreit after that maner in the sight of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

vpon his enemies, he made them play so oft, that at last being farre disseuered from his troope, he was astonished to see him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe alone, intangled on all sides among a great number of his enemies, and in the end after long fighting was taken prisoner. The Romans hauing beene well curried, by the Parthians, and considering that they were not strong inough for them, resolued to retire. But they retired in good order and leasure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and fought valiantly when the Parthians came to trouble them, alwaies making head vpon the enemie. But when they came to the discending of any hils and mountains that were rough and steepe, they were distressed by the Parthians, with the shot of their arrows, and with their darts, because the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans could not come downe but slowly step by step. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to saue themselues from those hail-stormes,<note place="margin">The policie of the Romans.</note> they deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed this shift. The legionarie souldiers caried ordinarily great pauesses, to couer those that were lightly armed. These they made to be set by them, and then kneeling downe on the ground with the one knee, they cast their pauisses before the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and they of the second ranke couered the former sort with theirs, and the third ranke likewise couered the second, and so forth through out the rest, so as this maner of pauissing and couering one another, was made like the rowes of tiles on the side of a house roofe, and (to see to) resembled the greeces of a Theatre, so as the shot of the arrowes did but glaunce ouer them. The Parthians seeing this behauiour of the Roman le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gionaries, thought they had been tired with trauell, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon couching their launces, approched euen to handstrokes. Then the Romans stept quickly vpon foot, and with their Iaueli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And in this case the generall may vse dissimulation, when he knoweth that there is yet another power readie, as <hi>Sertorius</hi> did, who to

procure meane of safe retire to his men that were disperpled, and to ioine them to a new power which he had caused to come, and to gather them all togither at their ease, fled open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to a certaine towne that was strongly situated, and fell in hand with fortifying it, as if he had ment to abide the siege there, for doubt least his enemies should come thither to find him out.

But as soone as he vnderstood that his people were in safetie, and the supplie of new force ready, he went out of the town to ioine his new for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces togither, with the which he came backe againe to find his enemies.

For he would haue no speech of fighting, vntill he saw the trenches almost finished, and that there was no great space betweene the two ends of them that they were not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly met togither. And then he shewed <hi>Nectanebus</hi> how he might escape without daunger, because the trench should serue their turne, and be an impediment to the enemies, that the whole multitude of them should not runne vpon them at once, because it should gard them on either side, and by that means they should match them with equall number. And in deed as soone as the euening was shut in, they marched in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of battell out at the gap that was not entrenched, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing foiled the first that encountered them, they saued them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues at ease.</p>

He turned so long to and fro in his flight, that at length he drew a great sort of the enemies that lay vpon his hand, vnto the said cawsey, the which he passed, and afterward vpon the midst therof he sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly stopped their passage with the forefrunt of his battell, the which he made equall to the bredth of the cawsey, and thereby made the number of his people equall to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his enemies, because they could no more come about him, neither on the sides, nor behind: by means whereof, after he had fought a while, he put them all to flight. <hi>Eumenes</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing discomfited by <hi>Antigonus,</hi> and fleeing before him, tooke a path a little out of the way cleane contrarie to those that chased him, and trauelled so long, till he came againe to the field where the battell was fought. There he caused the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of his men that were slain in the battel, to be gathered vp and to be buried with the accustomed funerals, and also tooke him that had betraid him, whom he had pursued so freshly, that he gaue him no respit to retire to the enemies.

Gaules had taken the hill aforehand, which caused him to draw his armie backe. <hi>Hanniball</hi> hauing chosen a faire plaine, wherein there was a deepe vallie, and a certaine little hill, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie aduauntageable for his armie, which had beene no hard matter for him to haue gotten; to the intent to draw <hi>Minutius</hi> to battel, left it indifferent for a bait to train his enemies to the encounter. And one night he couched a certaine number of his men of warre in those, and afterward at the breake of the day, sent a small troope to take the said hill: <hi>Minutius</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise sent out his vauntcurrors, and after them all his men of armes, and finally when he saw <hi>Hanniball</hi> come thither in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, he himselfe also went thither with the rest of his armie, and gaue a great assault to haue driuen away those that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended the hill. Then <hi>Hanniball</hi> perceiuing that his enemie had cast himselfe into his nets, gaue the watchword to his men that were in ambush, who brake out with a great noyse vpon the taile of the Romans, of whom they slue a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber at the first dash, and had put the rest out of aray, but for the readie succour of <hi>Fabius,</hi> who aided him at need, and wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted the victorie out of <hi>Hannibals</hi> hand.

Also <hi>Flaminius</hi> the Roman consul, was discomfited by a like policie. For <hi>Hanniball</hi> suffered him to win the passage that was in the hils aboue the lake of Trasimenus; but yet higher aboue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he had laid his men in ambush.

               <p>The same <hi>Hanniball,</hi> perceiuing that <hi>Marcellus,</hi> neither by vanquishing, nor by being vanquished, could hold himselfe from troubling him, vsed this policie, when he saw him nie him. Betweene the two camps was a certain peece of ground

But when he saw his game at the best, he made all his troopes to mount on horsebacke, and to turne their faces; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch that all at once they charged vpon the pezants of the mountaines and discomfited them. <hi>Secco</hi> a Florentine beeing desirous to draw <hi>Monfronk</hi> captaine of the Pisanes to battell, who of his owne nature was forward enough to it, laid an ambush betweene Bientina and Pisa, commanding them not to stir, vntill he gaue them their watchword.

In the mean while, he laid an ambush of two hundred men, and then went to pull down the pales that were about the towne, that the townesmen might the easlier issue out, which disappointed not his hope at all. For there issued out about a threescore of them, hoping that they which were without, would haue set vpon the Frenchmen behind, as soone as they heard the bickering: but it was quite otherwise. For being enuironed by them that lay in the ambush, they were all either slaine or taken, asore the Englishmen wist it. The maior of Rochell intending to put the citie into the kings hand, bethought him of this policie. He told the captaine of the campe, that he had receiued letters from the

king of England, wherby he was commanded to take musters both of the townesmen and of the garrison. This letter well sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, was shewed to the captain of the castle, who knew the kings seale, but could not read. The maior made semblance to read the letter, which contained no such thing as he spake, and yet neuertheles he red it as boldly as if it had ben written, clean contrary to the tenor of the writing. According to this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, the next morrow euery man was readie with his armor and weapon in the place appointed, and the captain of the castle sent thither threescore men well furnished, reseruing not past a dosen or fifteene men to keepe the castle? Now the maire had aforehand laid two hundred men in ambush behind the old wals &amp; houses of the town, which were not far from the castle. When they of the garrison were a little gone forth, they found themselues inclosed by the townsmen wel armed, and in great number before, and by them that lay in the ambush be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, so as they could not return into the castle, and the captain who with so few men was not able to resist them, was faine to yeeld himselfe. <hi>Constantine</hi> being imbarked at Pirey,<note place="margin">The ambush of <hi>Constantine.</hi>

Insomuch that <hi>Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi> garison, supposing they had bin <hi>Ptolomies</hi> gallies, went out to receiue them. But perceiuing too late what they were, they had no way to defend the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues; for <hi>Demetrus</hi> was come within the hauen, the entrance whereof he had found wide open. And to bring his enterprise the easilier to passe, he made proclamation by the sound of a trumpet, that his father <hi>Antigonus</hi> had sent him to deliuer the Athenians from all garrisons, and to set them free: the which thing caused the Athenians to turn vnto him, &amp; to yeeld him the town, so as the garrison was put away, and they were set at libertie. <hi>Nicias</hi> intending to lay siege to Siracuse, sent a man of Catana thither as a spie, to tell them that if they would take the campe of the Athenians vnawares, they should come with all their power towards Catana at a certain day that he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, because the Athenians would for the most part of the time be within the citie, wherein there were a number of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral citizens, which fauoring the affairs of Siracuse, were determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to seaze the gates of the citie as soone as they perceiued the Siracusanes to approch, and at the same time to set fire vpon the ships of the Athenians; and there were a great sort of the towns men of that confederacie, who did but wait for the day &amp; houre of their comming. By this policie he made the Siracusanes to come out into the fields with al their power, so as they left their citie vtterly empty, &amp; he in the mean season departing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na with al their fleet, took the hauen of Siracuse at his ease, and chose a place to plant his camp in, where his enemies could not indomage him. The Athenians hauing secret conference with some of the citie Megara, ceised one of the gates afore dailight, by the which the citisens were woont to take in a Brigantine, which they sent a nights to scoure the sea, &amp; afore day brought it in again vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a chariot, within the inclosure of the wals, which went fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the city to Nisey, where was their haue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which was the
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:6660:248"/>
cause that the gate could not be shut so soone, but that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians ceised it, and mounted vpon their wals, giuing a push to take their citie. But the garrison of the Peloponnesians arriued there in that instant, who had beene a sufficient impediment to the Athenians, if the Athenians had not bethought them to make proclamation by the sound of a trumpet, That al the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garians which would yeeld themselues to the Athenians and lay away their weapons, should be saued. Which thing whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Peloponnesians heard, fearing least all the townesmen had bin of that confederacie, they forthwith forsooke the sea, and saued themselues at Nisey. <hi>Alcibiades</hi> tooke the citie Celibrie in Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lespont, by intelligence with some of the citizens, but not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some perill of his owne person, yea and to his confusion, if he had not remedied the matter quickly. He should haue bin neere the citie by a certaine houre, and for his watchword a burning cresset should haue bin put vp about midnight: But they that were within, were constrained to put vp their token afore the houre, for feare of one of the confederacie, who repented him of his doing. Which token when <hi>Alcibiades</hi> perceiued, although he had not his troopes readie, yet would he not let slip the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, but taking with him thirtie men, and appointing his troopes to follow him with all speed possible, ran streight to the walles. There was he receiued, and the gate opened vnto him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into he entered with his 30. men, and 20. others that came by chance. But they were no sooner entred, but they heard the townsmen co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming in arms against them, so as there was no like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood that he should haue escaped if he taried there. On the otherside he was loth to flee, and leaue the taking of the towne. Wherfore he aduised himself vpon the sudden,<note place="margin">The policie of <hi>Alcibiades.</hi>
                  </note> to cause silence to be made by the sound of a trumpet; and when the noise was appeased, he made it to be proclaimed, that the Celibramians should not take weapon against the Athenians. This did some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what cool those that were desirous to fight, because they doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted least all the armie of the Athenians had bin alreadie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the citie. And so as they were parlying, the rest of his armie came in, by means whereof he became master of the towne. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so he vsed another policie to get Bizance, which is now called
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:6660:248"/>
Constantinople. For lying in siege afore the citie, he had secret intelligence with two of the towne, which had promised to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray it vnto him. To bring this enterprise to passe, he made a shew to leuie his siege, and to go his way into Ionie with great dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, for some that had made an insurrection there. And in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie deed he departed in the open day with all his gallies: but the same night he returned back againe, and comming on land with his men that were best armed, approched near the wals without making any noise. And he had appointed the rest of his men that were in the ships, that in the meane while they should with all speed row into the hauen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and there make as great noise as they could, to the intent that the Bizantines should draw thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therward. In which meane time he himselfe by the helpe of his intelligencers, entred the citie and woon it, howbeit not without fighting. As <hi>Robert</hi> of Artois besieged Vannes,<note place="margin">The policie of <hi>Robert</hi> of Artois.</note> he caused an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault to be giuen in three places at once, and the assault endured all the day long. At night euery man retired; and the French men put off their armor to rest and refresh themselues. But <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> of Artois suffred not his men to vnarme them, but onely to rest them a litle, and to eat and drinke. Afterward hauing set his three battels in order, he began the assault againe in two places, commanding the third battell to stand still, vntill it were time to depart: and because it was night, the assailants had kindled so great fires, that they which waked on the sudden, went right whether soeuer they saw the fires, without attending any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of the captain, and without putting themselues in order. During the time that euery mans hands were full, the third battel chose another part of the town vnfurnished of war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and there setting vp store of ladders, did so much that they entred the citie, and put the whole garrison of Vannes to flight.

And when they were passed, one companie went right to the towne, and took the gates which they found open, (for the Frenchmen thought them to haue beene their owne men,) and they that is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued out were inclosed both afore and behind, and vtterly ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown. The Seneschal of Beauquere vnderstanding that great store of rother beasts should passe by the towne of Athenie, sent threescore men to driue them, and in the mean while lay in am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bush himselfe neere the towne.

But in the night he returned back sectetly, and without making any noyse, couched himselfe in ambush neere the towne. The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilenians doubting nothing, went out vnaduisedly, and without order the next morning; and without standing vpon their gard, went to rifle the campe of the Romanes. But <hi>Lucullus</hi> step<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping out suddenly vpon them, tooke a great number of them prisoners, and slue about fiue hundred that stoode at defence, and wan about six thousand slaues. <hi>Fredericke</hi> vsed another poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie to get Saminimat.<note place="margin">A policie of <hi>Frederick Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barossa.</hi>
                  </note> It happened that he had receiued a great losse before Parma, where his armie was ouerthrowne, and he was faine to take the way of Tuscan for to returne into his realme of Naples. There was no likelihood that he minded the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Saminimat, that had plaid the traitors and rebels against him, neither was he determined to rest there. But to compasse them without great paine or studie, he dissembled their treason, and chose a number of his best, most couragious, and most loyall sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, whom he caused to be chained together as if they had bin prisoners. The which being done, he caused his mules to be lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with a great sort of hampers, full of all kind of armor and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillerie, and couered them with the same sumpterclothes, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:6660:249"/>
the sumpters of his chamber were woont to be couered. These prisoners so made at the instant, he sent vnto Saminima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, with <hi>Peter</hi> of the Vineyard, his steward of houshold, secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie and chauncelor, who had the whole gouernment thereof, and was a prisoner in deed, accompanied with messengers of credence, which should declare vnto the inhabitants of the towne, that the emperour hauing not a more loyall towne, seut them those prisoners men of importance, and his preciousest stuffe with them, praying them to keepe them carefully till his returne, because that being now on his way into his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Naples, he would not be troubled with such baggage. The men of Saminimato seeing the emperour in armes round about them, made good countenance, notwithstanding that they mistrusted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues to be bewraid, and thereupon shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselues verie obedient, receiued all the traine with good cheere, causing them all to come into the citie.

               <p>The Slauonians vsed another policie to take another town. There approched a certaine of them to the wals, so few in shew as were not sufficient to take the towne, and yet did they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continently giue an assault. They that were within beholding the small number of them, ran out vpon them, &amp; folowed bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them a good way off from the towne. And when they were a sufficient farnesse, the residue shewed themselues behind them, and slue a great sort of them, so as they could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer into the citie againe. Then the Slauonians comming to the assault, entered at ease, because there were none but the citizens left to defend the towne. The king of Portugall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing how the Britons that were within Feroll in Castile, made often salies out; laid fiftie men in ambush, and a three daies after, went with a few men and skirmished hard at the barriers of the towne. The Britons failed not to come out
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:6660:250"/>
against him, and pursued the Portugals so hard, that they tooke about fiue and twentie of them, and were fain to open the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers wide, to let in the prisoners, and to let out those that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued them. At length, they that lay in ambush, riding as fast as they could, right to the barriers, and making themselues masters of them, entred mingled with the Britons into the towne. The men of Capua being desirous to receiue the Imperials into the citie, and to expulse the Frenchmen, willed the Imperials to lay themselues in ambush neere the towne, and when they knew them to be laid, they would persuade the Frenchmen to make a rode out of the citie, to fetch vittels afore they were more straitly besieged. The Frenchmen perceiuing their reason to be apparant, went out to do so. But when they came backe againe, they found the gates shut, and vnderstood that the Capuans had receiued the Imperials in at another gate. <hi>Sertorius</hi> vsed an other policie to win the Characitanians,<note place="margin">A policie of <hi>Sertorius.</hi>
                  </note> which did nothing but rob him, and spoile him, and mocke him without feare, because they retired themselues into rocks and caues that could not be come vnto. He considered that right against their caues, there was a light clay that fell to dust like sand, the which the northwind blowing full into their caues, did ordinarily carie vp that in dust, and driue it into their dens. When <hi>Sertorius</hi> had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected this in himselfe, and vnderstood by the inhabitants of the countrie therabouts, that the like was don customably: he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded his men to gather togither a great quantitie of that light earth, and thereof to make a huge mount right against their caues. When this great mount was finished, he made his horsmen trot vp and down on it, and anon the wind taking the dust as soone as it was raised from the ground, caried it full into their caues, striking it right into the eies and eielids of them. Wherby their eies were stopped, and their caue was filled with a hote and sultrie aire. Insomuch that being not able to take breath but with great paine, they submitted themselues the third day after to his discretion. When a man hath taken a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, it is not enough to enter into it, and to sacke it, except he set a good guard at the gates, for feare of afterclaps; as befell to the Castilians in Spaine, who with the helpe of the Grisenians, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:6660:250" rendition="simple:additions"/>
against the Romans for their ill vsing of them, and slue a good sort of them. As soone as <hi>Sertorius</hi> heard the vprore, by and by he gat him out of the towne with a few of his men, and assembling togither such as were escaped, returned againe to the towne, and finding the gate still open, whereat the Griseni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were entered in, he slipped in also, and setting a good gard at the gates, (in which point the Grisenians had ouershot them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues) and in other parts of the towne, did put all to the sword that were of yeares to weare armour. Then apparelled he his soldiers, in the apparell and armour of those whom he had slain, and went in that maner to the citie of the Grisenians, from whence those came by whom they were surprised by night. The Grisenians thinking at the sight of their owne furniture, that they had beene their owne men, opened them their gates, and went out to meet them as their friends, whom they thought to haue dispatched their matters verie well. So the Romans slue a great number hard at the gates of their citie; and the rest yeelding themselues to the mercie of <hi>Sertorius,</hi> were by him sold.

Many were of opinion, that (considering the disorder of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perials,) if he had entered in by the castell (which was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded) he might haue done some notable feat, or at leastwise he had deliuered the Pope. But (as it is commonly said) little woteth a man what is done in his enemies host; and it had bin a great hazard, to haue put himself in daunger with so few men, against so great a number of enemies. <hi>Bellisarius</hi> perceiuing that he could not win Panormus by land,<note place="margin">A policie of <hi>Bellisarius.</hi>

                  </note> The Lord of Estourney surprised the towne of Audenard in this
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:6660:251"/>
maner. He laid foure hundred chosen men in ambush, neere the gate of Graundmount. Then sent he two chariots laden with prouision, and foure souldiers apparelled like carters to driue the chariots, wel armed vnder their apparell, who feigning them selues to come out of Henault, caused the great gate to be ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto them. Now when they came vpon the bridge, they staied, and plucked out the taypinnes that held the traces. The warders being offended at their long tarying, tooke the horses by the heads to make them go, but the chariots abode behind, because the horses were loosned. Then the warders perceiuing themselues to be deceiued, began to strike the carters, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended themselues so well, that they slue two of the warders. In the meane while the lord of Estourney hauing good leysure to approch, came at the instant, and tooke the gate, whereby he became master of the town. If they that enterprised to take the citie of Turin in the yeare 1542, had so vnyoked their oxen, or turned a chariot within the gate, the towne had bin lost. For it was saued alonely by the letting downe of the portcullis, which stopped a ten or twelue hundred men that came in good array, while those that were entred into the town in chariots couered with hay, were fighting at the gate, and at the place. The citie of Ortingas was taken after that maner. <hi>Peter</hi> of Auchun, who lay in garrison at Lourd, sent in the moneth of May, two good souldiers apparelled like seruingmen, to seeke masters in the towne. They had not beene long there, but they were prouided of marchantmen: whom they serued so well, that their seruice was verie well liked. About the middest of August, a faire was kept in that towne, wherevnto many marchant strangers resor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Now while the townesmen bought and sould, and made good cheere, <hi>Peter</hi> of Auchun went out about midnight, and laid himself in ambush vvithin a vvood neere the towne, hauing sent six men afore vvith two scaling ladders, vvhereby they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred secretly into the towne, by the helpe of the two souldiers, while their masters was drinking. As soone as they were entred, the two soldiers brought the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the gate where was the bodie of the gard ready to set forward assoon as they should whistle the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Herewithal the two seruing me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> knocked at the gate, telling the
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:6660:251"/>
warders that their master had sent them for good wine. The warders knowing them opened the gate, and suddenly at a vvatchword, the other six souldiers came running thither and slue the warders. This being done, they tooke the keyes of the gate, and did let downe the bridge so softly, that no man percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued it. As soone as the bridge was downe, they began to sound a blast of deceit, whereat, <hi>Peter</hi> of Auchun and his companie set forward, tooke the bridge, and made himselfe master of the towne. To famish the citie of Athens, <hi>Lisander</hi> vsed this deuise. After he had ouercome the Athenians by sea,<note place="margin">The policie <hi>Lysander.</hi>
                  </note> he determined to lay siege to Athens. But afore the doing thereof, he went with his fleet to all the sea-townes, where he commaunded vpon paine of death, that as many Athenians as were there, should get them home to Athens, which thing he did vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, to pester them vp close togither within the wals of Athens, that they might the sooner be famished; and so it came to passe. For whereas he was not able to ouercome them by force, he suffered them to rest a while, and afterward when he knew that vittails began to wax scant, he besieged them so nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly, that they were faine to yeeld the citie to the Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians.</p>
               <p>To attempt the taking of the rocke of Vandois which was impregnable, the vicount of Meaus laid a stale of 1200 men in a caue neare the fort, and sent others to skirmish with them at their bars, charging them that if any came out of the towne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, they should retire softly vntill they came to the stale. The Frenchmen failed not to make countena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, but went slowly to the skirmish, as if they had beene men vnwilling and smally trained, which thing gaue courage to <hi>Guion du sel</hi> (who had the gouernment of the fort in the absence of <hi>Amerigoll Marcell</hi>) to sallie out with certaine of the garrison. And he cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Frenchmen so farre, that he was inclosed betweene their ambush and their campe, so as he could not saue himselfe, nor any of his companie.

For vvhen he vnderstood that succors were comming to him, fearing least the Goths should set vpon them by the vvay; he caused a certaine vvall, vvherwith one of the gates of the citie vvas dammed vp, to be beaten downe in the night, and set a good number of men of vvar at it, causing a thousand horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to issue out at one of the other gates, whom he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded to returne to the same gate againe vvhen they vvere charged by their enemies. Now vvhile they vvere in hand vvith their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, <hi>Bellisarius</hi> vvent out vvith a great power at the gate that vvas towards the sea, vvhereof his enemies had no mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust, and easily putting those to flight that encountered him on that part, he vvent on till he came right against the other gate, vvhere he assailed his enemies behind, as they vvere figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vvith his men that had issued out first, in vvhich conflict many of his enemies vvere slaine; vvho being sufficiently occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied in defending themselues, gaue leisure to the Greekes to ioine vvith the armie of <hi>Bellisarius,</hi> vvithout any let. Sometimes there is scarcetie of vittels in a towne, so as it needeth to be vit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telled. And therfore he that hath the charge therof, seeketh by all means to get some in, vvithout the enemies priuitie. <hi>Bellisa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> intending to vittell the citie of Rome, which was streitlie besieged by the Gothes, vnder the leading of <hi>Totilas</hi>; deuised this shift. <hi>Totilas</hi> had made two towers of timber to be builded vpon a bridge ouer the riuer Tiber, to keepe men from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to Rome by water. And without the ouerthrowing of these towers, there was no way to passe. To do it by plaine force it was not possible for him, for he had too few men. Wherfore he took two lighters, and ioined them togither with rafters: vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the which he builded a tower of timber, of equall heigth to the other two; vpon the top wherof he had a little boate full of pitch and brimstone. After this tower boat followed two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:6660:253"/>
other boats couered ouer with boord, and made full of loope holes, that his men standing surely fenced in them, might shoot at their enemies. Within those boats he put great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of vittels garded by the choisest of his souldiers, by whom vpon either banke of the riuer (as neere as might be) he sent of his souldiers both on horsebacke and on foot. When he came at the towers of the bridge, he cast vpon them the said little boat that was full of brimstone, which immediatly burned vp the towers and the two hundred men that were within them. In the meane while the Romans brake downe the bridge, and made way for the litters that conueied the vittels, the which had out of all doubt gone forth to the citie, had it not ben for the fault of <hi>Isaces</hi> one of <hi>Bellisarius</hi> captains, who by his rash go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the hauen towne of Ostia, contrarie to <hi>Bellisarius</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, was discomfited and taken prisoner by the Goths. For <hi>Bellisarius</hi> being abashed therat, and thinking that the towne it selfe had ben taken, wherin was his wife and all his mouables, returned suddainly back thither, without accomplishing his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise.

In the meane while he sent out two hundred horsmen to safecundit the monie, and the next morning caused his men to go out and raunge themselues in battel-ray; and the Gothes did likewise. At noone he caused his men to dine, and in the afternoone fell to skirmishing, so that while they were bicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring so together, <hi>Attalius</hi> that brought the monie, entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Rome without any daunger. The duke of Guise vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the distresse wherein the Marshall of the March was, within Peron, for want of men and poulder; departed from Han with two hundred men of armes and foure hundred chosen harquebusers, and comming by night neere the campe of his enemies, led his harquebusers secretlie and without noise to the side of the marris: and hauing with him all the trumpets

that he could get together, did suddainly giue an alarme to all parts of the emperors camp, so as they tooke them to their wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons. During this great alarme, which letted the enemies to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to any thing else, or to heare the flashing of the water through the which the dukes me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> went, the harquebusers were receiued into the towne, euery of them carrying vpon his neck, a bag of poulder weying ten pound. The viceroy of Naples and <hi>Antonie de Leua,</hi> to conuey monie into Pauie, procured two men whom they trusted, to carrie foure hoggesheads of wine to sell, to the French campe that besieged the towne, within the which hoggesheads were three thousand French crownes. And for the selling of their wine, they went, and lodged as neer the towne as they could. <hi>Antonie de Leua</hi> being aduertised ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, made a sallie out on another side, and while they were bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie at the skirmish, one of his men brake the hoggesheads and tooke away the three thousand crownes, with the which he saued himselfe in the towne.

The Plateians being streitly besieged by the Peloponnesians, and hopelesse of all succour, found this shift to get out of the towne. The Peloponnesians had made a double wal about the citie Plateia, one towards the towne to keepe them from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming out, and the other along the side of the camp, to keep the succours of the Athenians from going in, which walles were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant sixteene foot asunder. Betweene the two walles were the

lodgings of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that garded the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and at euery tenth battlement were towers that coupled the two wals together, so as a man could not passe along the wall, but he must go through those towers, into the which those that kept the watch a nights, withdrew themselues when it rained. To compasse their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination, the Athenians made skaling ladders full as high as the wals, the heigth whereof they tooke, by considering the thicknesse of the brickes whereof it was made, numbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them from the top to the foot. The townesmen there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hauing gotten intelligence of the manner of the watch, spied a night when it rained and the wind blew lowd, and the moone shined not: and came to the foot of the wall vnpercei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, because of the darkenesse of the night, and went seuerally by themselues one from another, least the iustling of their har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse togither, should make any noise. When they had set vp their ladders against the void spaces where they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood that no man warded, they that brought the ladders mounted vp first, and after them the rest. Now when a good sort of them were vp, they that watched within the towers perceiued them, by a crannie of one of the battlements that was cast downe in their comming vp. Insomuch that at the first alarme, all the campe came to the wall, not knowing wherfore, by reason of the night and the foule wether. On the other side the Plateians that abode in the citie, went out and assailed the walles in other places, to busie their enemies heads, who were all sore amazed what the matter should be, so as neither they, nor those that garded the towers, stirred not out of their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Neuerthelesse, they that had the charge to releiue the watch, lighted vp beacons on the side towards Thebes, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>token the comming of enemies. Which thing the townsmen perceiuing, lighted vp a great sort of them vpon their walles also, to the intent that their enemies should not know wherfore those fires were made, and that their companions might saue themselues, afore any rescues came to the watch. In the meane time, those that mounted vp first, wonne two towers, and hauing slaine them that were within, got vp them fellowes that remained yet beneath, putting those backe with shot and
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:6660:255"/>
throwing of stones, which came to rescue the wall. Insomuch that all they which were to salie out of the towne, mounted vp the wall, and then going downe from the towers, came to the ditches on the outside, vpon the brim whereof they found those that should haue succoured the watch, who had lighted vp the beacons; by means whereof, being well and perfectly seen, they were ouerthrowne by the Athenians, and by the townesmen with shot of arrowes, And so the Plateyans passing the ditch with ease, did knit themselues well and close together, and so passed all in good order by the way that leadeth to Thebes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they doubted that the way to Athens was garded. But when they had gone that way a vvhile, they turned aside the way of the hill, and by a priuie path came all to Athens with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out disturbance.</p>
               <p>Sometime to commaund a towne, they make a mount: and in old time it vvas vvoont to be made against the vvall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there vvas none other fighting but vvith handblowes, for artillarie vvas not yet inuented. <hi>Cabades</hi> king of Persia made such a mount of earth to be cast vp against the vvall of Amyda, which he saw to be impregnable. But the Amydans to defend themselues from it, made a mine within their wall, whereby they drew away a good peece of the ground that vpheld the mount, and vnderpropped it with timber-worke, that it might not be perceyued. And when they saw the mount couered all ouer with Persians, they let it sinke, so as all that were vpon it were slaine, which caused them to raise their siege.</p>

                  </gap>ke of nothing so well, as to hold the citie of Athens vnder their obeysance, and that the Thebanes, who wished them euill to the death for their forsaking and betraying them at their need, would not in anie wise succour them. <hi>Sphodrias</hi> being mooued with his persuasions, tooke those men of warre with him that he had, and departing by night, went into the countrie of Attica, euen to the citie Eleusine. But when he came there, his men were afraied, and would go no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And so being discouered, hee was faine to returne from whence he came. Whereby he procured to the Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonians a warre of no small importance, nor easie to bee vndone againe. For thence-foorth the Athenians sought the alliance of the Thebanes againe, and succoured them verie earnestly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Coriolanus</hi> vsed the like practise. For when he saw he could not cause the peace to be broken, that was betweene the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans and the Volses, he procured a man to go tell the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates of Rome, that the Volses had conspired to runne vpon the Romans as they were looking vpon their playes and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings,
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:6660:257"/>
and to set fire vpon the citie. Whereupon, the Volses were commaunded to depart out of the citie of Rome, afore the Sunne going downe. Wherewith the Volses being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased, proclaimed warre against the Romans. <hi>Alcibiades</hi> vsed the like tricke. For the Lacedemonians were come to treat of peace with the Athenians, and had for their patrone one <hi>Nicias,</hi> a man of peace, and well renowmed among the Athenians. <hi>Alcibiades</hi> went vnto them aforehand, and warned them in any wise to beware, that they told not that they had commission to conclude a full agreement, least the people compelled them of authoritie to graunt them whatsoeuer they would haue; coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selling them but onely to set downe certaine conditions, as in way of conference. The next morning <hi>Alcibiades</hi> asked them verie smoothly, what they came to do. They aunswered, that they came to make some profers of peace, but had no commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to determin anie thing. Then fell <hi>Alcibiades</hi> to crying out vpon them, calling them vntrustie and variable, telling them that they were not come to do anie thing that was of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue. And so the ambassadours were sent home without doing any thing, and <hi>Alcibiades</hi> was chosen captaine to make warre against them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Coriolanus</hi> to encrease the dissention which he knew to be betwixt the nobilitie and commons of Rome, caused the lands of the noble men to be with all care preserued harmles, causing the peoples in the meane time to be wasted and spoiled: which thing caused them to enter into further quarrell and disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment one against another, than euer they had done afore. The noblemen vpbraided the common people, with their iniurious banishing of so mightie a man; and the people charged the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie, that they had procured him to make warre against them in their reuenge. <hi>Hanniball</hi> to bring <hi>Fabius</hi> in suspition, whom he feared aboue all the Romans, caused his lands of purpose to be kept harmelesse, when he wasted all other mens, to the end it might be thought, that he had some secret conference with him, and that that was the cause why he would not fight with him, howbeit that in verie deed, his refusing to encounter, was of great wisedome, to make his enemie
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:6660:258"/>
consume away without putting any thing in hazard. <hi>Timoleon</hi> practised another notable policie, to shift himselfe from the hands of the Carthaginenses. Whereas he was sent by the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians, to deliuer the citie of Siracuse from the tyrannie of <hi>Dennis,</hi> as soone as he was arriued at Rhegium, <hi>Icetes</hi> whom the Siracusanes imploied to the same effect, and who dissembling his purpose, intended to take the place of <hi>Dennis,</hi> and to do as much as he; sent messengers to <hi>Timoleon,</hi> desiring him not to passe his men into Sicilie, because the warre began to draw to an end, and the Carthagenenses, with whom he had secret intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, would not that his men should passe into Sicilie, but that he himselfe should come alone, to aid them with his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell in such affairs as should be offered to deale in. And because he doubted least <hi>Temoleon</hi> would not consent to his request; he had desired the Carthaginenses (who lay neare vnto the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen of Rhegium with twentie gallies) to stop his passage ouer, and to fight with him, if he attempted to enter by force. <hi>Tim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leon</hi> seemed to like well of the saying of the messengers, neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse he said it behoued him for his discharge, to haue the same decreed in the assemblie of the Rhegians, and in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, as of them that were friends to them both. The which thing he did of set purpose, to hide his owne intent the better, by making the Rhegians priuie to the matter. The next day all the parties met in the Mootehall, where the whole day was purposely spent in talke, that <hi>Timoleons</hi> gallies might haue ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to prepare themselues vnsuspected of the Carthaginenses, forasmuch as they saw <hi>Timoleon</hi> present with them. Who assoon as he vnderstood that his gallies were departed all, sauing one that staid behind for him, went his way secretly through the prease by the Rhegians, who being secretly made priuie to the matter by him, had staid him from speaking any more. And so embarking himselfe without any disturbance, he arriued within lesse than an houre at Tauromenion, where <hi>Andromachus</hi> wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for him. <hi>Sylla</hi> in the ciuill warres, seeing his enemies to be many in number, thought it stood him on hand to vse policie, as well as force. Wherupon he solicited <hi>Scipio,</hi> one of the consuls, to come to agreement with him: the which thing <hi>Scipio</hi> refused
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:6660:258"/>
not. Hereupon many goings and commings were about the matter, because <hi>Sylla</hi> protracted the conclusion verie long, fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding still some occasion of delay, that in the meane while his souldiers (who were made and accustomed to such policies, as well as their captaine) might practise with <hi>Scipios</hi> souldiers to forsake him. For they going into <hi>Scipios</hi> campe, inueigled some of his men with mony, some with promises, and other some with necessitie, so that in the end when this practising had continued a certaine time, <hi>Sylla</hi> approched to their campe with twentie Antsignes, where his souldiers fell to saluting <hi>Scipios,</hi> and they saluting them again, turned and yeelded themselues vnto them, so as <hi>Scipio</hi> abode alone in his tent, where he was taken and not suffred to go away any more. Thus like the fowler with his fine birds made to the stale, <hi>Sylla</hi> with his twentie Antsignes, drew fortie Antsignes of his enemies into his net, whom he led all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his owne campe. Which thing when <hi>Carbo</hi> saw, he said, That in <hi>Sylla</hi> he had to deale with a fox and lion both togither, and that the fox did him more harme than the lion. The emperour <hi>Iulian,</hi> to keepe himselfe from being disappointed of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of prisoners that he demaunded, vsed such a policie as this, to the Almans whom he had vanquished, and to whom he had graunted peace, vpon condition that they should deliuer him all such prisoners as they had of his. For doubting least they would not deliuer him all, but keepe some good number of them, he demaunded of euerie of them that were escaped and saued out of prison, what were the names of them that were pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners, because it could not lightly be, but that they were either of kin or of alliance, or neighbours, or friends vnto them; and he wrate their names in a paper. In the meane season, the ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours came with their prisoners; of whom <hi>Iulian</hi> caused the names to be set downe in writing, and the secretaries conferring the one paper with the other, marked those whom the ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours mentioned not, and named them secretly to the emperor behind him. The emperor began to be angrie with the ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadours, for that they had not brought him all his prisoners; tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them that they had kept backe such and such of such a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or towne, naming them all by their names; whereat the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:6660:259"/>
were sore abashed, supposing that it came by reuelation from God. Whereupon they failed not to deliuer all. <hi>Triuulce</hi> perceiuing the garrison of Millan, and specially the Millaners themselues, to be astonished at the comming of <hi>Maximilian</hi> and the Swissers into Lumbardie, bethought himselfe of this policie, to put a suspition into the emperours head, of some cause of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust in the Swissers. He wrate letters with his owne hand, and sealed them with his seale, to the chiefe leaders and captains of the Swissers, that he might bring them in suspition with the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, and sent them by a seruant of his owne that spake the Swissers tongue well. By these letters he willed them, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme within two daies the thing that he and they were agreed vpon, for he should then haue all things readie according to their platfourme. The messenger offered himselfe of purpose be taken by the emperours scouts, and being examined wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he came thither without the watchword, he praied pardon, promising to tel the truth, and therupon confessed, that he brought letters to the captains of the Swissers. At that word his pardon was graunted him: and he plucking off his neather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stocke, tooke out the letters which were sowed in the sole of it, the which were caried to the emperour immediatly. When he had read them, although he was in great perplexitie, yet was he not of opinion that they should be shewed to the cardinall of Sion, because he would not accuse a captaine of so great autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie among the Swissers, and much lesse cause them to be atta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, for feare of putting his affaires in daunger. But in his heart he distrusting the disloyaltie of the Swissers, he repassed the mountaines againe, without making any further speech of it, and returned home into Germanie. <hi>Cyrus</hi> by the counsell of <hi>Croesus,</hi> vsed this policie to saue Sardis from sacking. He caused it to be cried by the sound of a trumpet, That no man should conuey a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the bootie, because a tenth part thereof was to be giuen of necessitie to <hi>Iupiter.</hi> And for that cause he set warders at euery gate, to see that nothing should be conueyed away. He did this to hold them at a bey, for feare of som mutinie, if he should haue taken it from them by force. But when they saw the king did it of religion and deuotion, they obeyed him without gainsaying,
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:6660:259"/>
by meanes whereof, the greatest part of the goods of the citie was saued.</p>
               <p>Thus haue you a part of the feats of warre of times past, the which I thought good to adde vnto the antient quicke sayings, and to the principall points of the goodliest hystories, to the intent that a prince may find in one place, and take out of this celler or warehouse, whatsoeuer he listeth to choose. For it is farre easier to take in one place, the wares that come from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse parts of the world, than to go seeke them a farre off, and in places dispersed. And yet is it to no purpose to seeke them all in one place, vnlesse they be sorted out aforehand, so as a man may put his hand to whatsoeuer he requireth. For that cause it behoued me to vse a method, in referring euery hystorie to his proper place. There are many other points of warre to be found in hystories, the which my hast to make an end of this my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, causeth me to let alone, and to content my selfe for this present, to haue declared vnto you the things that I haue drawn out of <hi>Plutarch, Thucidides,</hi> and some other authours that came to my remembrance. Also I haue left many, which you may see in the <hi>Mounsieur de Langies</hi> Discipline of warre. Of others I will say as an euil painter, That they lie hid behind the Cipres cloth. As touching the feats of warre of our dayes, I will not presume to speake of them, because they which are yet aliue, haue seene the practising of a great part of them, and can better and more particularly report them, than they be written. And to say the truth, when I considered the feats of warre of these times, I find them so honorable, that they be nothing inferior to those of old time. But it is better to leaue the reporting of them, to those that were at the doing of them, than to speake of them like a clearke of armes, for feare least it be said vnto me, That the things were not so done as they be written: The which I doubt not but men will thinke, euen of those also which I haue here alledged. But they be drawne out of such authors, as for their anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie and authoritie, haue purchased prescription against all reproches.</p>
