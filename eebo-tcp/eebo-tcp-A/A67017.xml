            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>NExt to the Pleasure of doing well, there is no greater satisfaction than where the Performance meets with a favourable reception from those for whose sake it is designed. I thank God I have this dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Comfort in the Testimony of a good Conscience, and Your Majesties Gracious Acceptance of the poor services God enabled me to doe for your Majesties In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, and the Safety of those Protestants, whom the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the <hi>Papists</hi> drove into <hi>London-Derry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor am I more pleased with Your Majesties Royal Bounty to me, much above not only my Merit, but Expectation, than with Your Majesties Tenderness for my Poor Fellow Sufferers and Partners in that Action, whom I doubt not but Your Majesties will find as brave

in the Field, and in taking other Towns, as in defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that, which neither the Number, nor Rage of their Enemies without, nor those more cruel Ones within, of Famine and Sickness, could ever make them think of Surrendring. The Part I Acted in this Service might more properly have been done by other hands; but that Necessity which threw it upon me, will I hope justifie me before God and the World, from the irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity of interessing my self in such an Affair, for which I was neither by Education or Function quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; Especially since the necessity which called me to it, was no sooner over, than I resigned more chearfully than ever I undertook the Employment, that I might apply my self to the Plow to which I had put my Hand. I am not at all angry with the Reflexions that some make, as they think, to my Disparagement; because all they say of this kind, gives God the greater Honour, in whose Almighty Hand no instrument is weak, in whose Presence no Flesh must glory. But as the whole Conduct of this matter must be ascribed to Providence alone, as it ought, this should then give them occasion to consider that God has Espoused your Majesties Cause, and Fights your Battels, and for the Protestant Religion; and by making use of a poor Minister, the unworthiest of the whole Communion, of which he is a Member, would intimate to the World, by what Hand he will defend and maintain both your Majesties Interest, and the Religion you have delivered from those that were ready to swallow both up.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:60523:3"/>That which I here presume to lay at Your Majesties Feet, is indeed very unfit for Your Royal View; but that since Importunity would have it publick, I thought it Sacrilege to entitle any other to the Copy, than those to whom the Original was devoted. The Picture can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be commended for the Workmanship, but it may possibly be the more acceptable, for that because more resembling the Life from which 'tis drawn: There is little Skill, or Art, in either, but there are Ornaments much more valuable in both, natural Simplicity, Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, and a plain Truth, In which character I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beg Your Majesties will always consider, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the Endeavours of</p>

            <head>A Description of the CITY of London-Derry.</head>
            <p>THE Form of the Town comes some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what near an <hi>Oblong</hi> or long Square; and its Situation lengthways, is <hi>N. W.</hi> and <hi>S. E.</hi> or a Diagonal drawn from the Church through the Market-house, to the Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zine, is near upon a <hi>N.</hi> and <hi>S.</hi> Line.</p>
            <p>The Length of the Town through the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle from <hi>Ship-key gate</hi> to <hi>Bishops-gate,</hi> is about 300 Paces, or 1500 Feet. The Wall on the <hi>W.</hi> side the Town 320 Paces; the Wall on the <hi>E.</hi> about 380.</p>
            <p>The Breadth at the <hi>N. W.</hi> End 140; at the <hi>S. E.</hi> End 120; from <hi>Butchers-gate</hi> to <hi>Ferry-key-gate,</hi> where the Town is Broadest, 180 Paces.</p>
            <p>The Wall is generally 7 or 8 Foot thick; but the out-side Wall of Stone, or Battlements above the <hi>Terra-plene,</hi> is not more than two Foot in thickness.</p>
            <p>The Four Corners have each of them a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion; on the long side to the <hi>West</hi>-ward are two other Bastions; and on the side to the <hi>East</hi>-ward, one Bastion, one Demi-bastion, and two other Works which are commonly call'd Flat-forms.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:60523:5"/>There are Four Gates; <hi>Bishops-gate</hi> at the <hi>S. E.</hi> End, <hi>Ship-key-gate</hi> at the End opposite to it: <hi>Butchers-gate</hi> at the <hi>N. E.</hi> Side, and <hi>Ferry-key-gate</hi> over against it.</p>
            <p>In the middle of the Town is a <hi>Square,</hi> call'd the <hi>Diamond</hi>; where the <hi>Market-House</hi> stands (du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Siege, turn'd into a <hi>Guard-House.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Near the S. <hi>W.</hi> end of the Town, stands the Church; on the top whereof, being a flat Roof, were placed two of our Guns, which were of great Use in annoying the Enemy. In the <hi>S. E.</hi> Angle of the Town, was the principal Magazine. within the Town also were several Wells, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and before <hi>Bishops-gate</hi> was a <hi>Ravelin</hi> built by Col. <hi>Lundy</hi>; and the Ground on forwards to the <hi>Wind-mill-hill,</hi> was taken in by the Besieged to the Distance of 260 Paces from the Town, and about the same Distance a cross from the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; and for fear this Ground should be taken from the Besieged by the Enemy, another Line was industriously drawn from the <hi>S. W.</hi> Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Town, to the River, to secure their Retreat.</p>
            <p>The Number of Guns planted on the Bastions and Lines, was 8 <hi>Sakers</hi> and 12 <hi>Demi-culverins</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The whole Town stands upon an easy As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and exposed most of the Houses to the Enemies Guns.</p>

            <head>A Diary of the SIEGE of LONDON-DERRY.</head>
            <p>BEing prevail'd on, to give an Account of the Siege of <hi>London-Derry,</hi> it is convenient, by way of preliminary, to take notice how that Town came to be out of the Hands of the <hi>Irish,</hi> when all places of the Kingdom of any strength or consideration were possessed by them. It plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed God so to infatuate the Councils of my Lord <hi>Tyrcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel,</hi> that when the three Thousand Men were sent to <hi>England</hi> to assist his Master against the Invasion of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> he took particular care to send away the whole Regiment Quartered in and about this City; he soon saw his Error, and endeavoured to repair it, by Commanding my Lord <hi>Antrim</hi> to Quarter there with his Regiment, consisting of a numerous swarm of <hi>Irish</hi> and <hi>Highlanders</hi>; upon the 6<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> they were on their March in and about <hi>New-Town</hi> (a Market-Town belonging to Col. <hi>George Philips,</hi> 12 Miles di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant from <hi>Derry</hi>) Col. <hi>Philips</hi> having notice of this, and joining with it the apprehensions they were under, of a general Insurrection of the <hi>Irish</hi> intended on the 9<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> and considering that <hi>Derry</hi> as well as other places was to be presently possessed by the <hi>Irish,</hi> and having several Informations brought him, and some taken before him that gave some credit to the Fear and Jealousies they were under, and encreased his suspicion of some damnable Design against the <hi>British</hi> of those parts; He immediately dispatches a Letter to Alderman <hi>Norman,</hi> giving an Account of these Matters, and his Opinion of them, and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuning
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60523:6"/>
him to consult with the sober People of the Town, and to set out the Danger of admitting such Guests among them: The next day he sent an Express, advising him to cause the Gates of the City to be shut, and assured them he would be with them with his Friends the day following, and would stand by them and serve them to the hazard of his Life and Fortune. Alderman <hi>Norman</hi> and the rest of the graver Citizens were under great Disorder and Consternation, and knew not what to resolve upon. One of the Companies was already in view of the Town, and two of the Officers within it, but the younger sort who are sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom so dilatory in their Resolutions, got together, run in all hast to the Main-Guard, snatcht up the Keys, and immediately shut up all the Four Gates, and the Magazine. On the 9<hi>th</hi> day, Col. <hi>Philips</hi> comes into <hi>London-derry,</hi> he had been Governour of that Town, as also of the Fort of <hi>Culmore</hi> in King <hi>Charles</hi>'s time, and therefore the Inhabitants desire him to resume the Government, and immediately delivered him the Keys of the Gates and the Magazine: He being well acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with proceedings in <hi>England,</hi> with the Advice of the Gravest sort, dispatches Mr. <hi>David Kerns</hi> as their Agent thither, to represent their Condition and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions, and to procure some speedy Relief.</p>
            <p>News being carried to <hi>Dublin</hi> of this Revolt, as they call'd it, the Lord <hi>Montjoy</hi> with his Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-Collonel <hi>Lundy</hi> and six Companies, are sent down to reduce the Place The Governour had already form'd Eight Companies of good effectual Men in the City, and Armed them out of the Stores, and with some Management, quieted all Factions and Tumults, and reduced all things to good Order, so that all were Unanimously resolved to stand it out till they received a Return to their Address sent into <hi>England.</hi> My Lord
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60523:6"/>
               <hi>Montjoy</hi> appears before the Town; his Interest among us, and the consideration of our own Circumstances, that there was no appearance of any sudden Relief from <hi>England,</hi> no Provisions in the Town, and (which was worst of all) but two Barrels of Powder in the Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zine, which my Lord <hi>Montjoy</hi> must needs understand, being Master of the Ordnance; made it thought most adviseable to listen to a Treaty; so the Governour with the Consent of the City-Council agreed upon certain Capitulations; that only two Companies should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Town, and they to be all Protestants, and that the Town-Companies should be allow'd to keep their Arms, and to do Duty with the others, &amp; that no stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is to be admitted into the City, without License from the Governour and Sheriffs. Having obtained Conditions of so easy a Nature, and of so probable Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to the Town, they receiv'd my Lord <hi>Montjoy,</hi> who made Lieutenant-Collonel <hi>Lundy,</hi> Governour of the Town.</p>
            <p>The Gentlemen of the other Parts of the <hi>North</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> being well acquainted with the Proceedings at <hi>Dublin;</hi> that particularly, Commissions were given out to raise many Thousands of <hi>Irish,</hi> all over the Kingdom; and all to be Maintained at the Expence of their Officers (who were not able to Support themselves) for the space of three Months. They were with good reason equally appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive, this was not intended for their Safety or Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; and therefore they generally resolved to put themselves in the best Posture they could to Defend themselves against any inconveniences such Methods might bring upon them: They had several Consultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with their Neighbours, and some Great Men were not wanting in their Advice and Encouragement. One left some Instructions with Mr. <hi>George Walker</hi> Rector of

               <hi>Donaghmore</hi> in the County of <hi>Tyrone,</hi> recommending the necessity of Securing <hi>Dungannon</hi> by a Garrison of their own, and of Victualling that Town; in order to which, Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> saw it not only excuseable, but necessary to concern himself, and raise Men, out of which he form'd a Regiment, and to apply what Interest he could make towards the Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Town. <hi>Gordon O Neale,</hi> observing those Preparations, sends his Priest to inquire into the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, which was readily interpreted to him: <hi>So many</hi> Irish <hi>were Arm'd in the Country, they thought fit to put themselves in a Posture of Defence against the Danger they saw themselves Exposed to.</hi> The Men complain of want of Powder, but by the Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of their Officer, a Bag of <hi>Mustard-Seed</hi> was laid upon the Carriages, which by its resemblance, easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obtained the Credit of a Bag of Powder, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately gave motion to the Souldiers.</p>
            <p>In order to Settle a Correspondence with <hi>London-Derry,</hi> Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> Rides to that Town, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sults Collonel <hi>Lundy.</hi> The Opinion they had of his Experience in War, and Zeal for the Cause they were to Maintain, gave all People great Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from his Conduct; he Approves and Encourages the Design, sends two Files of his Disciplin'd Men to <hi>Dungannon,</hi> and afterwards two Troops of <hi>Dragoons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>March</hi> 14. Orders are sent to Col. <hi>Steward</hi> (who was very considerable among us) from Col. <hi>Lundy,</hi> that the Garrison at <hi>Dungannon</hi> should break up; some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the Advantagious Situation of the Place, and the great quantity of Provisions already laid in, and the consequence of leaving both, to give strength to their Enemies, shew'd some unwillingness to comply with Commands so different from the Measures they had hitherto pursued; but at last, agreed to March to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60523:7"/>
               <hi>Colrain</hi> or <hi>Derry</hi> according to Collonel <hi>Lundy</hi>'s Orders.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>March</hi> 17. We March'd as far as <hi>Strabane,</hi> and there met our Order from Collonel <hi>Lundy</hi> to return to <hi>Omagh,</hi> and the <hi>Rash.</hi> Five Companies of the above Regiment are Quartered at <hi>Rash,</hi> under Command of Mr. <hi>Walker</hi>; and five at <hi>Omagh,</hi> Commanded by Lieutenant-Collonel <hi>Mervin:</hi> A Fortnight after, we receiv'd a Potent to March to St. <hi>Johnstown,</hi> five Miles from <hi>Derry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>March</hi> 20. Captain <hi>James Hamilton</hi> Arrived from <hi>England,</hi> with Ammunition and Arms, 480 Barrels of Powder, and Arms for 2000 Men, and a Commission from the King and Queen for Col. <hi>Lundy</hi> to be Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the City, together with Instructions to swear all Officers Military and Civil, and assurance of speedy Supplies from <hi>England.</hi> The King and Queen are pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly Proclaimed with great Joy and Solemnity. About this time the <hi>Irish</hi> made a descent into <hi>Vlster,</hi> and drove great Numbers of poor Protestants before them, who took shelter in <hi>Colrain</hi> and <hi>London-Derry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>March</hi> 23. Col. <hi>Philips</hi> is sent to <hi>England</hi> with an Address to the King, and to Sollicit a speedy Supply.</p>
            <p>Col. <hi>Lundy</hi> goes to <hi>Colrain</hi> to give his Advice and Assistance to that place. The rest of this Month, and the beginning of the next, is spent in Preparations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Enemy; they had possessed themselves of <hi>Colrain,</hi> &amp; drove all before them till they came to <hi>Clody</hi>-Bridge, of which I shall give this short Account.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>April</hi> 13. Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> receiving Intelligence, that the Enemy was drawing towards <hi>Derry,</hi> he Rides in all hast thither, and gives Col. <hi>Lundy</hi> an Account of it, but the Collonel believed it only a false Alarm; Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> returns from him to <hi>Lyfford,</hi> where he joined Col. <hi>B. Crofton</hi>; the Enemy come to <hi>Clody-ford</hi>; all Night long the Enemy and We fired at one another; and in the Morning, Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> took his Post at the long Cawsey
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60523:8"/>
as Commanded by Col. <hi>Lundy,</hi> leaving Col. <hi>Crofton</hi> to maintain the Post against the Enemy, which he perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with good Resolution.</p>
            <p>The Souldiers having spent all their Ammunition, <hi>viz.</hi> three Charges of Powder a man, are forced to give way; Major <hi>Stroud</hi> rallies the Horse in order, to bring off the Foot: The Regiment at the <hi>Long-Cawsy</hi> was in some dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, having staid too long, expecting Orders, but got off under the shelter of some Horse, &amp; followed the Army, which was 10000 strong, and make good their Retreat to <hi>Derry</hi>; Col. <hi>Lundy</hi> and several of Quality being then at the Head of them. Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> found the Gates shut against him and his Regiment, and staid all Night with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Gates; next day with much difficulty and some violence upon the Centry they got in: Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> waited on Col. <hi>Lundy,</hi> and press'd the taking the Field; but he not being satisfied with the behaviour of his Army the day before, gave Advice of a different Nature, which did not agree with Mr. <hi>Walkers</hi> Sentiments, who thought himself obliged to stand by his Men that he had brought from their own homes, and not to Expose them again to the Enemy, by dismissing them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>April</hi> 15. Col. <hi>Cunningham</hi> and Col. <hi>Richards</hi> came into the Lough from <hi>England,</hi> with two Regiments and other Necessaries for Supply of <hi>Derry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There were several remarkable Passages might be here inserted, relating to those that came from <hi>Drumore</hi> and <hi>Colrain</hi>; but as I would not reproach any, so I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do right to all; and whatever mis-fortune the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of those places brought upon them, the beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of such of them as staid in the Garrison of <hi>Derry,</hi> sets them above Apologys for any miscarriage; for certainly there could not be better Men in the World; and many of those that left us, have been exposed to Censure; but I hope the World will be so just, not to give Characters from things done in such a confusion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:60523:8"/>
               <hi>April</hi> 17. Upon the News of King <hi>James</hi>'s Army being on their March towards <hi>London-derry,</hi> Colonel <hi>Lundy,</hi> our Governour, thought fit to call a Councel; and that Col· <hi>Cuningham,</hi> and Col. <hi>Richards,</hi> that were sent from <hi>England,</hi> to our Assistance, should be Members of it; accordingly they met, and with other Gentlemen equally unacquainted with the Condition of the Town, or the Inclination and Resolution of the People, they make this following Order.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vpon inquiry it appears, That there is not Provision in the Garrison of</hi> London-derry, <hi>for the present Garrison, and the two Regiments on Board, for above a Week, or Ten Days at most, and it appearing that the Place is not tenable against a well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Army; Therefore it is concluded upon, and resolv'd, That it is not convenient for His Majesties Service, but the contrary, to land the two Regiments under Col.</hi> Cuningham <hi>&amp; Col.</hi> Richards, <hi>their Command now on Board in the River of</hi> Lough-foyle.— <hi>That considering the present Circumstances of Affairs, &amp; the likelihood the Enemy will soon possess themselves of this place, it is thought most convenient, that the principal Officers shall pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately withdraw themselves, as well for their own preservation, as in hopes that the Inhabitants, by a timely Capitulation, may make terms the better with the Enemy; and that this we Judge most convenient for His Majesties Service, as the present State of Affairs now is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this Resolution, an Instrument was prepar'd to be Subscribed by the Gentlemen of the Councel, and to be sent to King <hi>James,</hi> who was advanced in Person with his Army as far as St. <hi>John</hi>'s Town; it was recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended with this Encouragement; <hi>There was no doubt, but upon surrender of the Town, King</hi> James <hi>would Grant a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Pardon, and Order Restitution of all that had been Plunder'd from them.</hi> Some Gentlemen were influenced by these considerations to subscribe, others did not only refuse but began to conceive some Jealousies of their Governour; and some, tho' they did but guess at their proceedings, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd themselves after a ruder manner, threatning to hang both the Governour and his Council. Captain <hi>White</hi> is
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60523:9"/>
sent out to the King, to receive proposals from him; and it was at the same time agreed with Lieutenant General <hi>Hamilton,</hi> that he should not march the Army within four Miles of the Town.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding which, King <hi>James</hi> having some confidence given him, that the Town, upon His Majesties approach, would undoubtedly surrender to him; and that the very sight of so formidable an Army would fright them into a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance: Upon the 18<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>April</hi> Advances, with his Army, before our Walls, with Flying Colours; His Majesty think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it discretion, to use the shelter of a Party of Horse on South-end of <hi>Derry</hi>-Hill, the more safely to observe what sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutation His Forces had from the Garrison.</p>
            <p>Orders were given, that none should dare to fire till the King's Demands were first known, by another Messenger to be sent to His Majesty for that purpose; but our men on the Walls, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering to see Lieut. Gen. <hi>Hamelton</hi> (contrary to his Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not to come within four Miles of the Town) approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Walls in such order, they imagining they were by some means or other betray'd, thought it reasonable to consider their own safety, and to keep the Enemy at distance, by firing their Guns upon them, which they accordingly did.</p>
            <p>The Enemy that were great strangers to this sort of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise, upon this could not be kept in any order by their Officers, but some took to their heels, others with less La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour could hide themselves, and a great many were kill'd. King <hi>James</hi> did shew himself in some disorder, and much sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised to find the behaviour of his Army, as well as of the Besieged, so different from the character he had receiv'd of both; some were apprehensive of the King's displeasure upon such a disappointment, and sent Arch-Deacon <hi>Hamilton,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Nevil,</hi> to beg His Majesties pardon for having drawn His Majesty into so dangerous and unsuccessful an undertaking, and to signify to him the difficulty of commanding or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading so tumultuous and untractable a Rabble, to any moderation or complyance; but if His Majesty drew off his Army, till those Gentlemen return'd, and brought assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60523:9"/>
of His Majesties presence with it (of which some questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was yet made) they doubted not but they could bring them to a better understanding.</p>
            <p>This evening King <hi>James</hi> retired with his Army to St. <hi>John</hi>'s-Town. In the mean time Mr. <hi>Muckcridge</hi> the Town- Clark sees it absolutely necessary, to give some intimation of Proceedings at the Council of War, which (tho' every mans concern) care was taken not to make too publick, <hi>viz.</hi> That Colonel <hi>Cuningham,</hi> his Ships, Men, and Provision should return to <hi>England,</hi> and all Gentlemen and others in Arms should quit the Garrison, and goe along with him: this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery occasion'd great uneasiness and disorder in the Town, which had like to have had very ill effects upon the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and some of his Council; it did also add much to the rage and violence of the Garrison, when they heard some wrong had been done my Lord <hi>Kingston</hi> and his Party, by the indirect measures of some within our Walls; their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for him being as great as their expectations from him.</p>
            <p>The Governour and his Council finding themselves of little interest in the Town, and that they could not be further ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> thought fit to retire, and not to press the matter further. Some of the Gentlemen left us in all this confusion, and made their escape to the Ships at <hi>Kilmore,</hi> tho' not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some hazard; for the Souldiers were under great discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, to find themselves deserted by those that engaged them in the difficulties they were then under, and were not easily kept from expressing it with violence upon some Persons; but it was the care of others to keep them in temper, and from those outrages, as well as to support them against such discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Arthur Royden</hi> protested against the proceedings of the Council, and would not have left the Town, but that he was dangerously sick, and was forc'd from us by the advice of his Physitian, and his Friends.</p>
            <p>Governour <hi>Lundy</hi> could not so easily make his escape, being conceiv'd more obnoxious than any of the rest, but sound it convenient to keep his Chamber; a Council being appointed,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60523:10"/>
Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> and Major <hi>Baker</hi> meeting him there, desired him to continue his Government; and that he might be assur'd of all the assistance they could give him; but he posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively refused to concern himself any further. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission he bore, as well as their respect for his Person, made it a duty in them to contribute all they could to his safety; and therefore, finding him desirous to escape the danger of such a Tumult, they suffered him to disguise himself, and in a sally, for the relief of <hi>Culmore,</hi> to pass in a Boat with a load of Match on his back, from whence he got to the Shipping.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>April</hi> 19. The Garrison seeing they were deserted, and left without a Governour, and having resolv'd to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Town, and to defend it against the Enemy, they considered of some Person they could have confidence in, to direct them in the management of this Affair, and unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously resolv'd to choose Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi> and Major <hi>Baker,</hi> to be their Governours dureing the Seige; but these Gentlemen considering the importance, as well as the uncertainty of such an Office, acquainted, by Letter, Col. <hi>Cunningham</hi> (whose busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness they thought it was to take care of them) with this matter, and desired him to undertake the Charge; but he being obliged, by his instructions, to obey the Orders of Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Lundy,</hi> thought fit to take other measures. They then accepted the Government of the Garrison. These Gentlemen chose Eight Collonels, and Regimented the men in this order:
<list>
                  <item>Col. <hi>Walker</hi> 15 Companies.</item>
                  <item>Colonel <hi>Baker</hi> 25 Companies.</item>
                  <item>Col. <hi>Crofton</hi> 12 Comp.</item>
                  <item>Col. <hi>Michelturn</hi> 17 Comp. formerly Col. <hi>Skivingtons</hi> Regiment.</item>
                  <item>Col. <hi>Lance</hi> 13 Comp.</item>
                  <item>Col. <hi>Mountro</hi> 13 Comp. formerly Col. <hi>Whitneys.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>Col. <hi>Hamil.</hi> 14 Comp.</item>
                  <item>Col. <hi>Murrey</hi> 8 Comp.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>In all 117 Companies, each Comp. consisting of 60 Men.</p>
            <p>In all 7020 Men, 341 Officers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:60523:10"/>This was our complement after having form'd our selves, as above mentioned; but the Number of Men, Women and Children in the Town, was about Thirty thousand. Upon a Declaration of the Enemy to Receive and Protect all that would desert us, and return to their dwellings, Ten Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand left us; after that many more grew weary of us, and Seven thousand died of Diseases.</p>
            <p>The same day our Governours view the Stores, and give other necessary Orders and directions: In the mean time they observe the motion of the Enemy, and that their Guns were so placed, that they could not draw out to their usual place of exercising, therefore they divide the Outline into Eight parts; each Regiment had its own ground, and each Company knew their own Bastion. The Drummers were all enjoyned to quarter in one house, so that on the least notice they repair'd to the respective post of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany they belong'd to; and upon all Alarms, without any parademg, all officers and private men came into their own ground and places, without the least disorder or confusion.</p>
            <p>There were Eighteen Clergy-men in the Town of the Communion of the Church, who in their turns, when they were not in Action, had Prayers and Sermon every day; the Seven Nonconforming Ministers were equally careful of their people, and kept them very obedient and quiet, much different from the behaviour of their Brother Mr. <hi>Osborn,</hi> who was a spy upon the whole North, imployed by my Lord <hi>Tyrconnel,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hewson,</hi> who was very trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, and would admit none to fight for the <hi>Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> till they had first taken the Covenant.</p>
            <p>After injoyning all parties to forget their distinctions, and to joyn as one man, in defence of the interest of K. <hi>William</hi> and Q. <hi>Mary,</hi> and the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> against the Enemies of both; we betake our selves, in the first place, by order, to our several Devotions, and recommend our selves, and the Cause we undertook, to the Protection and Care of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty; for we might then truly say, with the Church in the <hi>Liturgy, there is none other that fighteth for us, but only thou,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60523:11"/>
O God.</hi> It did beget some disorder amongst us, &amp; confusion, when we look'd about us, and saw what we were doing; our Enemies all about us and our Friends running away from us; a Garrison we had compos'd of a number of poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, frightned from their own homes, and seem'd more fit to hide themselves, than to face an Enemy; when we consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd we had no Persons of any Experience in War among us, and those very Persons that were sent to assist us, had so little confidence in the Place, that they no sooner saw it, but they thought fit to leave it: that we had but few Horse to Sally out with, and no Forage; no Engineers to instruct us in our Works; no Fire-works, not as much as a Hand-Granado to annoy the Enemy; not a Gun well mounted in the whole Town; that we had so many Mouths to feed, and not above ten days Provision for them, in the Opinion of our former Governours; that every day several left us, and gave con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant intelligence to the Enemy; that they had so many op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities to divide us, and so often endeavour'd it, and to betray the Governours; that they were so Numerous, so Powerful and Well appointed an Army, that in all human probability we could not think our selves in less danger, than the <hi>Israelites</hi> at the <hi>Red Sea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When we considered all this, it was obvious enough what a dangerous undertaking we had ventur'd upon; but the Resolution and Courage of our people, and the necessity we were under, and the great confidence and dependance among us on God Almighty, that he would take care of us, and preserve us, made us overlook all those difficulties. And God was pleased to make us the happy instruments of preserving this Place, and to him we give the Glory, and no one need goe about to undervalue or lessen those he was pleas'd to choose for so great a work; we do allow our selves to be as unfit for it as they can make us, and that God has only Glorified himself in working so great a wonder <hi>with his own right hand, and his holy arm getting himself the Victory</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>April</hi> 20. A part of the Enemy march'd towards <hi>Peny-burn</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:60523:11"/>
hill, a place about a Mile distant from the Town <hi>N.B.E.</hi> on the side of the River, there they pitch'd their Tents, &amp; by that means hinder'd all passage to, &amp; correspondence with, <hi>Culmore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We sent Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi> out of the Garrison, with Orders to go to <hi>England,</hi> and to give account of our Resolutions to defend the Town against the Enemy. Our men were order'd to fire after him, that the Enemy might think he had deserted us.</p>
            <p>This day my Lord <hi>Strabane</hi> came up to our Walls, make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us many Proposals, and offering his Kings Pardon, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and Favour, if we would surrender Town; but these fine words had no place with the Garrison. At that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry time of his Capitulating with us, we observ'd the Enemy using that opportunity to draw their Canon to a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent stand, we therefore desired his Lordship to withdraw, otherwise we would make bold to fire at his Lordship; his Lordship continued in his Complements, till we plainly told him we would never deliver the Town to any but K. <hi>William</hi> and Q. <hi>Mary,</hi> or their order. My Lord having ended all his Insinuations, found himself at last obliged to retire.</p>
            <p>Several Trumpets were likewise sent to us from the Enemy, but with as little success.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>April</hi> 21. The Enemy placed a <hi>Demi-culverin,</hi> 180 Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches distant from the Town, <hi>E. B. N.</hi> on the other side the water: they play'd at the houses in the Town, but did little or no mischief only to the Market-house.</p>
            <p>This day our Men Sallied out, as many as pleased, and what Officers were at leasure, not in any commendable Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, yet they killed above 200 of the Enemies Souldiers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides <hi>Mamow</hi> the <hi>French</hi> General, and several other Officers whose Names you will fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d in the annexed List. A party of Horse came with great Fury upon the Salliers, and forced their retreat, which they made good with the loss of four private Men, and one Lieutenant <hi>Mac. Phedris,</hi> whom our Men brought off; and having leisure and more concern <hi>then</hi> upon us for the loss, then afterwards on such occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; we buried them with some Ceremony. We had at
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60523:12"/>
this time 50 Horse Commanded by Col. <hi>Murry;</hi> upon whom they press'd so hard at first, that some of his Horse were bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to the very Gates; so that Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> found it necessary to mount one of the Horses and make them rally, and to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Col. <hi>Murry,</hi> whom he saw surrounded with the Enemy, and with great Courage laying about him. In this Action we took three pair of Colours.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>April</hi> 23. The besiegers planted four <hi>Demi-culverins</hi> in the lower end of Mr. <hi>Strongs</hi> Orchard, near 80 Perches distant from the Town, opposite to <hi>Ship-key-Street:</hi> these playing incessantly, hurt several People in the Houses, battered the Walls and Garrets, so that none could Lodge safely above Stairs. The besieged make due returns to their Firing from the Bastions, kill'd Lieut. <hi>Fitz Patrick,</hi> Lieut. Col. <hi>O Neale,</hi> two Serjeants, and several Souldiers; and besides these, two <hi>Friars</hi> in their Habits, to the great Grief of the Enemy, that the Blood of those Holy Men should be spilt by such an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical Rabble, as they call the besieged.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>April</hi> 25. They plac'd their Mortar-pieces in the said Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard, and from thence play'd a few small Bombs, which did little hurt to the Town, all of them lighting in the Streets, except one which kill'd an old Woman in a Garret; from the same place they threw afterwards many larger Bombs, the first of which fell into a House while several Officers were at Dinner; it fell upon the Bed of the Room they were in, but did not touch any of them; forced into a lower Room, and kill'd the Landlord, and broke down one side of the House, and made a large passage for the Guests to come out at instead of the Doors it had choaked up.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>April</hi> 28. The besieged made another Sally, and killed several of the Enemy at <hi>Penyburn</hi>-Hill, but were forced to Retreat, being pressed by the Enemies Horse, who charged us on all sides. In this Action, we lost only two Men, had eight or ten wounded, which in few days recovered, and were fit for Service.</p>
            <p>This day by a shot from one of our Bastions, the Enemies Gunner was kill'd, and one of his Guns broken.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:60523:12"/>
               <hi>May</hi> 5. This Night the Besiegers draw a Trench cross the <hi>Wind-Mill Hill,</hi> from the Bog to the River, and there begin a Battery; from that they endeavour'd to Annoy our Walls, but they were too strong for the Guns they us'd, and our Men were not afraid to advise them to save all that Labour and Expence; that they always kept the Gates open, and they might use that Passage if they pleas'd, which was wider than any Breach they could make in the Walls.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May</hi> 6. The Besieged fearing that Battery might incommode that part of the Town nearest to it, consult how to put a stop to their further proceeding in that work; Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> draws a Detachment out of each Company, of Ten men, and after putting them into the best Order their Impatience could allow, he Sallies out at the Head of them (with all imaginable Silence) at <hi>Ferry-Key Gate,</hi> at four of the Clock in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. One part of them beat the Enemies Dragoons from the Hedges, while the other possesses their Trenches. The Dispute was soon over, and the Enemy, thô a very considerable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment, are so pressed by the forwardness of our Men, and discouraged at the sight of so many lying in their Blood, that they fled away, and left us the Ground we contended for, and some Booty, besides the plunder of the Dead.</p>
            <p>The Salliers in this Action kill'd Two hundred of their Men, most of which were shot through the Breast or Head; Five hundred were Wounded, Three hundred of them within few days died of their Wounds, as we were informed by Messengers, and the Prisoners we took afterwards. The account of the Officers kill'd, or taken Prisoners in this Action, you will find in the Bill annexed. Our side lost Three men, and had only Twenty wounded. At this time we took Five pair of Colours.</p>
            <p>We sent a Drummer to desire the Enemy to send an Officer with 14 Men to bury their Dead, which they did perform very negligently, scarce covering their Bodies with Earth.</p>
            <p>After this performance, the Enemies want of Courage, and our want of Horse occasion'd, that some Weeks produced
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60523:13"/>
but little of Action, except Skirmishes; in which Captain <hi>Noble</hi> was very active and successful; kills several of their Officers, and finds Letters about them that afforded some Intelligence, and particularly instructed us about the Surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>Culmore</hi>; but upon what Conditions, and for how much Mony, we could not understand.</p>
            <p>Our Sallies many times began but with small parties; Capt. <hi>Noble,</hi> and sometimes other Officers, when they saw the Enemy make an approach, wou'd run out with about Ten or Twelve men at their Heels, and Skirmish'd a while with them: When the Besieged saw them Engaged, and in any danger, they issued out in greater numbers to their Relief, and always came off with great Execution on the Enemy, and with very little loss to themselves.</p>
            <p>In all these Sallies we lost none of any Note, but Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant <hi>Douglas</hi> and Captain <hi>Cuningham,</hi> whom the Enemy took Prisoner, and after Quarter given, basely Murdred. They did not want being reproach'd with so signal an Instance of their Cruelty and breach of Faith, neither did they want Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to deny it by the addition of many bloody Oaths and Protestations; but it was too evident by the Testimony of their own Officers and Souldiers, that were afterwards our Prisoners. But this sort of proceeding was very usual with them, and agreeable to an account we had of their obligation by Oath and Resolutions, not to keep Faith with us, and to break whatever Articles were given us: Which a Prisoner with us, (troubled in Conscience, that he had engaged himself with so wicked and perfidious Men) dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd to us.</p>
            <p>We were convinced of the Truth of it by some Examples they gave us after this: When they hung out a <hi>White Flag</hi> to invite us to a Treaty, Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> ventur'd out to come within hearing of my Lord <hi>Lowth</hi> and Colonel <hi>O Neale,</hi> and in his passage had an hundred Shot fired at him; he got the shelter of a House, and upbraiding them with this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, bid them order their Men to be quiet or he wou'd
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60523:13"/>
order all the Guns on the Walls to fire at them; They deny'd they knew any thing of it: And this was all the satisfaction to be expected from persons of such a Principle. At another time the Enemy desired one <hi>White</hi> might have leave to come to them; the Besieged sent him in a little <hi>Boat,</hi> with two Men, upon <hi>Parol,</hi> which they broke very dishonourably, keeping both the Men and Boat with them. The loss of the Boat was considerable to us, for the Gentlemen that left us took all our Boats, and left them to the Sea and Wind, and this was the only Boat we had remaining.</p>
            <p>The Enemy remove their Main Body from St. <hi>Johnstown,</hi> and pitch their Tents upon <hi>Bely ugry-Hill,</hi> about two Miles distant from <hi>Derry</hi> S.S.W. They place Guards on all sides of the Town, so that the Besieged found it impossible to receive or convey any Intelligence, and great difficulty to come to the Wells for Water, which they often Fought for, and cost some of them their Blood. One Gentleman had a Bottle broke at his Mouth by a Shot; yet the Water of the Town was so muddy and troubled with our continual-Firing, and so many going to it, that we were forced to run those hazards.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>June</hi> 4. The Besiegers make an Attack at the <hi>Wind-Mill Works,</hi> with a Body of Foot and Horse; the Horse they divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into three Squadrons, and Assaulted us at the Rivers side, it being Low water; the Foot Attack the rest of our Line. The Front of the Horse was composed of Gentlemen that had bound themselves by an Oath, that they wou'd mount our Line; they were Commanded by Captain <hi>Butler,</hi> second Son to my Lord <hi>Montgarret.</hi> Our Men place themselves within our Line in three Ranks, so advantageously that one Rank was always ready to march up and relieve the other, and discharge successively upon the Enemy, which (thô 'tis strange how they could think otherwise) was great surprize and astonishment to them; for they it seems expected we should make but one single Volley, and then they cou'd fall in upon us. Their Foot had Fagots laid before them for a defence against our Shot; they and the Horse began with a loud <hi>Huzza,</hi> which
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60523:14"/>
was seconded from all parts of their Camp with most dreadful shrieks and howlings of a numerous Rabble that attended the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy. The Fagot-Men are not able to stand before our Shot, but are forced to quit their New defence and Run for it: Capt. <hi>Butler</hi> tops our work, which was but a dry Bank of 7 foot high at the Water side, and thirty of his Sworn party of Horse follow him. Our Men wondred to find they had spent so many Shot, and that none of them Fell: But Capt. <hi>Crooke</hi> observed they had Armour on and then commanded to Fire at their Horses, which turn'd to so good account<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that but three of these bold Men with much difficulty made their Escape. We wonder'd the Foot did not (according to Custom) run faster, till we took notice that in their Retreat they took the Dead on their backs, and so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd their own Bodies from the remainder of our Shot, which was more Service than they did when alive.</p>
            <p>The Enemy in this Action lost 400 of their Fighting Men, most of their Officers were kill'd Captain <hi>Butler</hi> was taken Prisoner, and several others, which are mentioned in the List. We lost on our side six private Men, and one Captain <hi>Maxwell</hi>: two of the Men were kill'd by a Shot of a great Gun from the other side the Water, opposit to the <hi>Wind-Mill Works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Night the Enemy from <hi>Strong-Orchard</hi> play their Bombs which were 273 pound weight apiece, and contained several pounds of Powder in the Shell; they plowed up our Streets, and broke down our Houses, so that there was no passing the Streets nor staying within Doors, but all flock to the Walls, and the Remotest parts of the Town, where we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued very safe, while many of our sick were killed being not able to leave their Houses: They plied the Besieged so close with great Guns in the Day time, and Bombs in the Night<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and somtimes in the Day, that they could not enjoy their rest, but were hurry'd from place to place, and tyer'd into faintness and diseases, which destroy'd many of the Gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, which was reduced to 6185 men the 15 of this Month; these Bombs were some advantage to us, on one account, for being under great want of Fuel, they supply'd us plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60523:14"/>
from the Houses they threw down, and the Timber they broke for us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>June</hi> 7. Three Ships came up to <hi>Killmore F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rt,</hi> and fired at the Castle, and attempted coming up the River; but one of them unfortunately run aground, and lay some time at the Mercy of the Enemies Shot, and so much on her side, she could not make any return; but at length with some pleasure we saw her get off, and, as we believed, without much loss or damage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>June</hi> 15. We discovered a Fleet of 30 Sail of Ships in the <hi>Lough,</hi> which we believed came from <hi>England</hi> for our relief, but we could not propose any method to get intelligence from them, and we did fear it was impossible they could get to us; and the Enemy now begin to watch us more narrowly. They raise Batteries opposite to the Ships, and line both sides of the River with great numbers of Fire locks. They draw down their Guns to <hi>Charles-Fort,</hi> a place of some strength upon the Narrow part of the River, where the Ships were to pass; here they contrived to place a Boom of Timber, joyned by Iron Chains, and fortified by a Cable of 12 Inches thick twisted round it; They made this Boom first of Oak, but that could not float, and was soon broke by the force of the water: Then they made one of Firr-beams which answered their purpose better; it was fastned at one end through the Arch of a Bridg, at the other by a piece of Timber forced into the ground and fortified with a piece of stone work. This account, as we had it from the Prisoners, did much trouble us, and scarce left us any hopes; We made several signs to the Ships from the Steeple, and they to us from their Ships, but with very little information to either. At last a Messenger got to us, one <hi>Roch,</hi> from Major General <hi>Kirk,</hi> who gor to the Water-side over-against us, and then swam cross the River; he gave us an account of the Ships, Men, Provision and Arms in them for our relief; the great concern of the Major General for us, and his care and desire to get with his Ships up to the Town. He sent another Messenger along with
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60523:15"/>
this, one <hi>Crumy</hi> a Scotch man, to give us this account, and to know the Condition of our Garison, but he was taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner: There was soon an understanding between him and the Enemy, he is instructed to frame a Message much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from the other; they hang out a white Flag, invite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us to a parlee; they tell us we are under great mistakes about the Major General, and our expectation of relief from <hi>England,</hi> that they were all there in confusion, and that we might have leave to inform our selves further from the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger they had taken, either in private or publick: We sent some to that purpose, but they soon discovered the cheat, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to us with other particular accounts of his Treachery.</p>
            <p>We received further intelligence in <hi>July</hi> by a little Boy, that with great Ingenuity made two dispatches to us from the Major General at <hi>Inch.</hi> One Letter he brought ty'd in his Garter, another at his second coming within a Cloth But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton. We sent our first answer made up within a piece of a Bladder, in the shape of a Suppositor, and the same way ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the Boy; Our second Answer he carry'd within the folding of his Breeches, and falling among the Enemy, for fear of a discovery he swallowed the Letter, and after some short confinement and endeavour to extort some thing from him, he made his escape again to the Major General.</p>

            <p>But to return to our Story, the Besieged send many a longing look towards the Ships, their Allowance being very small, as you may see by the Account of Allowances out of the Store: They build a Boat of 8 Oars a side, and Man it well, with intent to make to the Fleet, and give the Major General an account of the sad Condition we were in; they set out with the best of our Wishes and Prayers but were forced to return, it being impossible they could indure the Showers of Shot that were poured in upon them from each side the River.</p>

               <hi>June</hi> 18. Captain <hi>Noble</hi> went up the River, and took twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Men along with him, with a design to Rob the Fish-House, but was prevented by Alarum from the Enemies Boats; however he Engaged them, killed a Lieutenant, one Ensign, and five private Men, took fourteen Prisoners and both their Boats. The Boats we offer'd to return, and to give the best Prisoner we had, for leave to send a Messenger to the Ships; but we could not prevail: We had agreed for five Hundred pound for L.

allow'd all the Prisoners, when we were starving our selves, which we did not put any great value on, but that the Enemy so ill deserv'd them. At this time Governor <hi>Baker</hi> is very dangerously ill, and Col. <hi>Michelburn</hi> is chosen and appointed to assist Governor <hi>Walker,</hi> that when one Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded in Sallies the other might take care of the Town; and if one shou'd fall the Town might not be left without a Government, and to the hazard of new Elections.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>June</hi> 24. or thereabouts, <hi>Conrad de Rosen,</hi> Marshal General of the <hi>Irish</hi> Forces, is received into the Enemies Camp; and finding how little the Enemy had prevail'd against us, expressed him self with great Fury against us, and swore by the Belly of God, He would demolish our Town and bury us in its Ashes, putting all to the Sword, without consideration of Age or Sex, and wou'd study the most exquisite Torments to lengthen the misery and pain of all he found obstinate, or active in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing his Commands and Pleasure: But these Threatnings, as well as his Promises, in which he was very eloquent and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had very little power with us; God having under all our Difficulties establish'd us with a Spirit and Resolution above all Fear or Temptation to any mean Compliances, we having devoted our Lives to the defence of our City, our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and the Interest of King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For fear any one should contrive Surrendring the Town, or move it to the Garrison<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Governour made an Order, That no such thing should be mention'd upon pain of Death.</p>
            <p>Every day some or other Deserted the Garrison, so that the Enemy receiv'd constant Intelligence of our proceedings. This gave some trouble and made us remove our Ammunition very often, and contrive many other Amusements. Our <hi>Iron Ball</hi> is now all spent, and instead of them we make <hi>Balls</hi> of <hi>Brick,</hi> cast over with <hi>Lead,</hi> to the weight and size of our <hi>Iron-Ball.</hi> The Gunners did not pretend to be great Artists, yet they were very industrious and scarce spent a Shot without doing some remarkable Execution.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Marshal de Rosen</hi> orders 3 Mortar pieces and several Pieces of Ordnance against the <hi>Windmill</hi> side of the Town, as also two
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60523:16"/>
Culverins opposite to <hi>Butchers-Gate</hi>; He runs a Line out of <hi>Bog-street</hi> up within ten Perches of the half Bastion of that Gate, in order to prepare Matters for laying and springing a Mine; He made approaches to our Line, designing to hinder the Relief of our Out guards, and to give us trouble in fetching Water from <hi>Colum kills Well</hi>; He defends his Line with a strong Guard in hopes to seize our Out-works, if we shou'd chance to be negligent in our Posts and neglect keeping good Guards. By the Contrivance of our Governour and Colonel <hi>Michelburn,</hi> and the directions and care of Captain <hi>Shomberg,</hi> or rather being instructed by the Working, Motions and Example of the Enemy, as well as we could observe them; We Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Enemy before the <hi>Butchers-Gate,</hi> the Governour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trives a Blind to preserve our Work, from the Enemies Battery. The Enemy Fired continually from their Trenches, and we make them due returns with sufficient damage to them; for few days passed, but some of the choice and most forward of their Men fell by our Arms and Firing.</p>
            <p>

We were often told, That some great thing was to be perform'd by this Lord; and they had a Prophecy among them, <hi>That a</hi> Clancarty <hi>should knock at the Gates of</hi> Derry; the credulity and superstition of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, with the vanity of so brave an Attempt, and some good

Liquor, easily warm'd him to this bold Undertaking; But we see how little value is to be put on <hi>Irish</hi> Prophesies, or Courage so supported.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>June</hi> 30. Governor <hi>Baker</hi> dies, his death was a sensible loss to us, and generally lamented, being a Valiant person; in all his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons among us shew'd the greatest Honour, Courage and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and would it suit a design of a Journal, might fill a great share of this Account with his Character.</p>
            <p>And indeed there were so many great things done by all our Officers and Men, and so often, that 'tis impossible to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count them all; but certainly never People in the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved themselves better, and they cannot want mentioning upon other occasion, where it may be more to their advantage than to fill this Paper with their Story.</p>
            <p>About this time Lieutenant Gen. <hi>Hamilton</hi> offers Conditions to the Garrison, and they seem to hearken to them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> till they had us'd that opportunity to search for Provision to support the great Necessity of the Garrison, which was now brought to that extremity, that they were forc'd to feed upon Horse flesh, Dogs, Cats, Rats and Mice, Greaves of a year old, Tallow, and Starch, of which they had good quantities as also salted and dried Hides, &amp;c. yet they unanimously resolv'd to eat the <hi>Irish,</hi> and then one another, rather than surrender to any but their own King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary.</hi> Our Answer to the Lieutenant General was, <hi>That we much wonder'd he shou'd ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect we cou'd place any confidence in him, that had so unwort<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>General <hi>Rosen</hi> sends us a Letter to this effect, <hi>That if we did not deliver the Town to him by Six of the Clock in the Afternoon on the</hi> 1st <hi>day of</hi> July, <hi>according to Lieutenant Gen.</hi> Hamilton<hi>'s Proposals, he wou'd dispatch his Orders as far as</hi> Balishanny, Charlimont, Belfast, <hi>and the Barony of</hi> Inishowen, <hi>and rob all Protected, as well as Vnprotected Protestants, that were either related to us, or of our Faction, and that they shou'd be driven

under the Walls of</hi> Derry, <hi>where they should perish, if not reliev'd by the Besieged.</hi> He threatned, <hi>to burn and lay waste all our Country, if there should appear the least probability of any Troops coming for our Relief: Yet, if the Garrison would become Loyalists</hi> (as they termed it) <hi>and Surrender the Town on any tolerable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, he would protect them from all Injuries and give them his Favour.</hi> But the Besieged receive all these Proposals with contempt and some indignation, which did produce some heat and disorder in the Mareschal.</p>
            <p>Among the Bombs thrown into Town, there was one dead Shell, in which was a Letter declaring to the Souldiers the Proposals made by the Lieutenant General; for they imagined them Strangers to their Condescensions, and that their Officers wou'd not communicate such things to them. Copies also of these Proposals were conveyed into Town by Villains, who disperse them about the Town, but all to no purpose; for they will not entertain the least thought of Surrendring, and it would cost a mans Life to speak of it, it was so much abhor'd.</p>

               <hi>July</hi> 2. The Enemy drive the poor Protestants, according to their threatning, under our Walls, Protected and Unprotected, Men, Women and Children, and under great distresses. Our Men at first did not understand the meaning of such a Crowd, but fearing they might be Enemies, Fired upon them; we were troubled when we found the mistake, but it supported us to a great degree, when we found that none of them were touch'd by our Shot, which by the direction of Providence (as if every Bullet had its Commission what to do) spared them, and found out and kill'd three of the Enemy, that were some of those that drove the poor People into so great a danger. There were some Thousands of them, and they did move great Compassion in us, but warm'd us with new rage and fury against the Enemy, so that in sight of their Camp we imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately erect a Gallows, and signified to them we were resolved to hang their Friends that were our Prisoners, if they did not suffer these poor People to return to their own Houses.</p>
            <p>We send to the Enemy, that the Prisoners might have Priests
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:60523:18"/>
to prepare them after their own Methods for death; but none came. We upbraid them with breach of Promises, and the Prisoners detect their barbarity, declaring, <hi>They could not blame us to put them to death, seeing their People exercis'd such Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity and Cruelty upon our poor Friends, that were under their Protections.</hi> They desired leave from the Governor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to write to L.G. <hi>Hamilton</hi>; they had a much better opinion of him than we cou'd be perswaded into; yet we allow a Messenger to carry the following Letter to him from their Prisoners.</p>

                  <p>UPon the hard dealing the Protected (as well as other Protestants) have met withal in being sent under the Walls, you have so incens'd the Governor and others of this Garrison, that we are all condemn'd by a Court Martial to dye to morrow, unless those poor People be withdrawn.

The Lives of 20 Prisoners lye at stake, and therefore require your diligence and care. We are all willing to die (with our Swords in our hands) for His Majesty; but to suffer like Malefactors is hard, nor can we lay our Blood to the charge of the Garrison, the Governor and the rest having used and treated us with all Civility imaginable.

            <p>But however the sight of our Gallows and the Importunity of some Friends of those that were to Suffer upon them, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon the Lieutenant General: So that <hi>July</hi> 4. the poor Protestants have leave to repair to their several Habitations; we
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60523:18"/>
took down the Gallows, and order'd the Prisoners to their usual Apartments. Our Garrison now consisted of 5709 Men, and to lessen our number yet more, we crowded 500 of our useless People among the Protestants under the Walls, who pass'd undis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd with them, thô the Enemy suspected the design; and to distinguish them, they pretended of finding them out by the smell. We also got into our Garrison some Effectual Men out of their number: They were in a most miserable condition, yet dreaded nothing more than our pity of them, and willingness to receive them; begging of us on their knees, not to take them into the Town, but chose rather to perish under our Walls, than to hazard us within them.</p>
            <p>The Governour has several Intimations given him by a Friend in the Enemies Camp, That he should look to himself, that some mischief was intended him. Soon after this he understood some Jealousy was entertain'd among the Souldiers, That he had great quantity of Provisions hid in his House. Some of the Garrison improv'd this to that degree, that there was great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of a Mutiny among the Men, and that he then began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the Caution was given; but by his Instructions to a Souldier, that was to pretend, he himself had the same Suspicion; it was contriv'd that the House was privately search'd, and their Curiosity being satisfied, they return to the good Opinion of their Governour.</p>
            <p>He observ'd likewise, that the Enemy had endeavour'd to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuate to the Garrison, That he was to betray the Town to King <hi>James,</hi> and was to be highly prefer'd for the Service. This put them in mind of a Message that one Mr. <hi>Cole</hi> brought to Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> in the beginning of <hi>May</hi> last, and however it was then supprest, the Story is now reviv'd, and the Governour in some danger. —Mr. <hi>Cole</hi> being taken by the Enemy, and continuing their Prisoner for some time, is at last admitted to some discourse with the Lieutenant General, who enquired particularly, what sort of person Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> was; who he was most intimate with? Mr. <hi>Cole</hi> (among several of Mr. <hi>Walker</hi>'s Friends) at last names himself, hoping by this means to be employ'd on a Message to him and to obtain his liberty. The Lieutenant General ask<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:60523:19"/>
               <hi>Whether he wou'd do Service for K.</hi> James, <hi>and carry some Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posals he had orders to make to Mr.</hi> Walker? He told he wou'd; and upon this immediately he has a Pass given him, and is dispatch'd upon a Message to Mr. <hi>Walker.</hi> Mr. <hi>Cole</hi> being got safe into the Town, was receiv'd with great Joy, and so well pleas'd with his liberty that he forgot his Business, only casu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally mentions it to some of the Garrison, with other discourse. Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> (after this) meeting several of them, they Saluted him by some great Names and Titles.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> easily saw the danger of this, and finding it was occasion'd by Discourses of Mr. <hi>Cole,</hi> he order'd him immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to be confin'd; and being examin'd, he unriddles the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, and gave all People satisfaction, so that they remain'd in no more doubt of their Governour.</p>
            <p>But under these, and many other such like difficulties, the Governour (not without some trouble and industry) reassum'd his Credit with the Garrison, which God was pleased to preserve to him in spight of all the inventio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and designs to the contrary.</p>
            <p>From our Works we cou'd talk with the Enemy; several of our Men gave account of Discourses with the <hi>Irish, That they express'd great prejudice and hatred of the</hi> French, <hi>Cursing those Damn'd Fellows that walked in Trunks,</hi> (meaning their <hi>Jack-Boots) that had all Preferments in the Army that fell, and took the Bread out of their Mouths, and they believ'd wou'd have all the Kingdom to themselves at last.</hi>

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:60523:19"/>
the Enemy in their Trenches. One Regiment draws up against them in good Order, but had only three of their Matches lighted; we came upon them over against <hi>Butchers-Gate</hi> and kill'd 300 of their Men, besides Officers. The Execution had been much greater, but many of our Men being much weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with Hunger were not able to pursue them, some falling with their own blows. We return'd without any purchase of Cattle, but were advis'd to a more easie Experiment; having one Cow left we ty'd her to a Stake, and set Fire to her. We had hopes given us, that by the Cry and Noise she wou'd make, the Enemies Cattle would be disturbed and come to her relief; and they began to move and set up their Tails, so that we hoped to have gain'd our point; but the Cow got loose, and turn'd to no account, only the danger of losing her.</p>

            <p>The Governour being with good Reason apprehensive, that these Discouragements might at length overcome that Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution the Garrison had so long continued, considers of all imaginable methods to support them, and finding in himself still that confidence.

Upon this the Enemy set up the loudest <hi>Huzza</hi>'s, and the most dreadful to the besieged that ever we heard: Fired all their Guns upon her, and were preparing their Boats to Board her; Our Trouble is not to be expressed at this dismal Pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, but by great Providence firing a Broad side, the shock loosned her so that she got clear, and passed their Boom. Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Douglas</hi> all this while was Engaged, and the <hi>Dartmouth</hi> gave them very warm Entertainment: At length the Ships got to us, to the unexpressible Joy and Transport of our distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Garrison, for we only reckon'd upon two days Life, and had only nine lean Horses left, and among us all one Pint of Meal to each Man; Hunger and the Fatigue of War had so prevail'd among us, that of 7500 Men Regimented, <note place="margin">

            <p>This brave Undertaking added to the great Success God had blessed us with in all our Attempts, so discourag'd the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, that on the last of <hi>July,</hi> they ran away in the Night time, rob'd and burnt all before them for several Miles, leaving no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing with the Country People, but what they hid the Night before, in which their Care was so great, that Provision grew very plentiful after it.</p>

                  <hi>The besieged took above</hi> 2000 <hi>Arms from the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, besides Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and Cloths,</hi> &amp;c·</note> and thought fit to make some haste to get farther off; they broke into pieces four of their great Guns, and threw twelve Cartloads of Arms and Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition into the River.</p>
            <p>Thus after 105 days, being close besieged by near 20000 Men constantly supplied from <hi>Dublin,</hi> God Almighty was pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in our greatest Extremity to send Relief, to the Admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:60523:21"/>
and Joy of all good People, and to the great disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of so powerful and inveterate an Enemy; who were concerned in point of Interest, as well as Reputation to have Rendered themselves Masters of that Town.</p>
            <p>The Enemy lost between eight or nine thousand Men before our Walls, and a hundred of their best Officers, according to the best Computation we could make of both, by the Information of the Prisoners we took, most of these fell by the Sword, the rest of Fevers and Flux, and the <hi>French</hi> Pox, which was very remarkable on the Bodies of several of their dead Officers and Soldiers.</p>
            <p>We are now under some Impatience, to see Major-General <hi>Kirk,</hi> under God and the King, our Deliverer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aug.</hi> 1. The Governor orders C. <hi>White,</hi> C. <hi>Dobbin,</hi> C. <hi>J. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton.</hi> Capt. <hi>Jenny</hi> and Mr. <hi>Jo. Fox,</hi> both Clergy-men, to wait on the Major-General at <hi>Inch,</hi> to give him an account of the raising the Siege, and to carry him our Thanks, and desire him to come and receive the Garrison. The next day the Major-General sent to us Col. <hi>Steward,</hi> and Col. <hi>Richards</hi> the Engineer, to Congratulate our Deliverance. On <hi>Sunday</hi> the Major-General came into the Town, and was received by the Governor, and the whole Garrison, with the greatest Joy and Acclamations. The Governor presents him with the Keys, but he wou'd not receive them. The next day the Governor (with several of his Officers) Dined with the Major-General at <hi>Inch</hi>; he complemented the Major-General with his Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, That after doing the King all the Service in his power, he might return to his own Profession: But the Major-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral desired him to dispose of it as he pleased, and accordingly he gave it to Captain <hi>White,</hi> as a mark of his Respect, and the Gentleman's known Merit.</p>
            <p>Upon this, we call a Council at <hi>Derry,</hi> the Governor is prevailed on to go to the King, and to carry an Address from the Garrison. The Garrison is now form'd, and of eight Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments made into six. After assurance from the Major-General, of his Care and Favor to his Men, and particularly to his own Regiment, he took leave of them and embarked for <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>WE the most Dutiful and Loyal Subscribers of this Address, (out of a deep sense of our late miserable Estate and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) do hereby return our due Acknowledgments to Almighty God, and to Your Sacred Majesty, and, under you, to the indefatigable Care of Major-General <hi>Kirk,</hi> for our unexpected Relief by Sea, in spight of all the opposition of our industrious, but bloody and implacable Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; which Relief was no less wonderfully, than seasonably, convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us, and that, at the very nick of time, when we (who survived many thousands that died here of Famine during the Siege) were just ready to be cut off, and perish, by the hands of barbarous, cruel, and inhuman Wretches; who no sooner saw us delivered, and that they could not compass their Wicked Designs against this Your Majesties City, and our Lives, (for which they thirsted) immediately set all the Country round us on fire, after having plundered, robbed, and strip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped all the Protestants therein, as well those Persons they themselves granted Protections to, as others: We do therefore most sincerely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice with all our Souls, and bless God for all his Singular and Repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Mercies and Deliverances; and do for ever Adore the Divine Providence for Your Majesties rightful and peaceable accession to the Imperial Crown of these Kingdoms (the proclaiming of which was justly celebrated in these Parts with Vniversal Joy;) and we do with all humble Submission present to Your Sacred Majesty our unfeigned Loyalty, the most valuable Tribute we can give, or Your Majesty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from us.

made us so happy as to be Your Subjects, we come in the like humility to lay our selves intirely at Your Royal Feet, and do most heartily and resolvedly offer and engage our Lives and Fortunes to Your Service.

From all which Promises, Vows and Services, we and every of us promise (without any Exception or Reserve) not to recede unto our Lives end. In testimony of all which, we have here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto subscribed our Names at <hi>Londonderry</hi> this 29th day of <hi>July,</hi> Anno Dom. 1689.</p>

            <p>TO all Christian People to whom these Presents shall come, the Mayor, Sheriffs, and Citizens of the City of <hi>London-derry,</hi> send Greeting. Having received intimation from several creditable Persons, that an Insurrection of the <hi>Irish</hi>-Papists was intended, and by them a general Massacre of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants in this Kingdom, and the same to be acted and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated on or about the 9th. of this instant <hi>December;</hi> and being confirmed in our fear and jealousie of so horrible a Design by many palpable Insinuations, dubious Expressions, monitory Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and positive Informations, all conducing and concurring to beget in us a trembling Expectation of a sudden and inevitable Ruin and Destruction; we disposed our selves to a patient and quiet resignation to the divine Providence, hoping for some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance and diversion of this impending Misery, or to receive from the hands of GOD such a measure of Constancy and Courage as might inable us to possess our Souls in patience, and submissively to wait the issue of so severe a Trial: Accordingly, when on the 5th. Instant part of the Earl of <hi>Antrim</hi>'s Forces advanced to take possession of this Place, though we looked on our selves as Sheep appointed for slaughter, and on them as the

Executioners of Vengeance on us, yet we contrived no other means of escape than by flight, and with all precipitation to hurry away our Families into other Places and Countries. But it pleased GOD, who watches over us, so to order things, that when they were ready to enter the City, a great number of the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and some of the meaner sort of the Inhabitants, run happily to the Gates and shut them, loudly denying entrance to such Guests, and obstinately refusing Obedience to us. At first we were amazed at the Enterprise, and apprehensive of the many ill Circumstances and Consequences, that might result from so rash an Vndertaking; but since that, having received repeated Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisements of the general Design, and particular Informations, which may rationally induce us to believe it; and being credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly assured, that under the pretence of six Companies to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter amongst us, a vast Swarm of <hi>Highland</hi> and <hi>Irish Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,</hi> were on the Ways and Roads approaching to us; That some of the Popish Clergy in our Neighbour-hood, had bought up Arms, and provided an unusual Furniture of Iron Chains for Bridles, (whereof sixty were bespoke in one place) and some of them seized, and now in our Custody; We began to consider it as an especial Instance of God's Mercy towards us, that we were not delivered over as a Prey unto them, and that it pleased him to stir up the Spirits of the People so unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly to provide for their and our common Safety, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation: Wherefore we do declare and remonstrate to the World, that as we have resolved to stand upon our Guards, and defend our Walls; and not to admit of any Papist whatsoever to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter amongst us, so we have firmly and sincerely determined to persevere in our Duty and Loyalty to our Sovereign Lord the King, without the least breach of Mutiny, or Seditious Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to his Royal Commands. And since no other Motives have prompt us to this Resolution, but the preservation of our Lives<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to prevent the Plots and Machinations of the Enemies of the <hi>Protestant Religion;</hi> We are encouraged to hope that the Government will vouchsafe a candid and favourable Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of our Proceedings, and that all his Majesties <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant</hi> Subjects will interpose with their Prayers to God, their Sollicitations to the King, and their Advice and Assistance to

            <head>An <hi>ORDER</hi> of the Council of War before the Defeat at <hi>Claudyford. LONDONDERRY,</hi> April 31. 1689.</head>
            <p>AT a General Council of War then held, it was resolved una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimously, that on <hi>Munday</hi> Morning then next following, at Ten of the Clock, all Officers and Soldiers of Horse, Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons and Foot, and all other armed men whatsoever of our Forces and Friends, inlisted and not inlisted, that can and will fight for their Country and Religion, against Popery, shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the fittest ground near <hi>Claudyford, Lifford,</hi> and <hi>Long-Kaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy,</hi> as shall be nearest to their several and respective Quarters, there to draw up in Battalions to be ready to fight the Enemy, and preserve our Lives, and all that is dear to us, from them; And all Officers and Soldiers of Horse and Foot, and Dragoons, and others that are arm'd, are requir'd to be then and there in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the purpose aforesaid, and to bring a weeks Provision at least with them for Men, and as much Forage as they can for Horses.</p>
            <div type="proposals">
               <head>Proposals made to Collonel <hi>Lundee,</hi> Governour of <hi>Derry,</hi> by Major <hi>Stroud.</hi> April 13. as aforesaid.</head>
               <p n="1">I. THE said Major proposed to the said Governor, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Castle of <hi>Raphoe,</hi> or demolish it.</p>
               <p n="2">II. How inconsiderable every Troop and Company were, that went by the names of Troops and Companies, instancing the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment of my Lord <hi>Mount-Allexander,</hi> all then dispersed except his own Troop, and Capt. <hi>Vpton</hi>'s Troop; which both joined would not make one good Troop.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:60523:24"/>III. That the said Major proposed to the said Governor, that Harrows should be thrown into the Fords, and for want thereof, the Instruments called Round-head, which would have answered the same purpose; and fearing that the Proposals aforesaid might be neglected that Night, the said Major <hi>Stroud</hi> writ also to the same effect and purpose to the Governor by Captain <hi>Whaley,</hi> who delivered the same Letter accordingly; and if these Propositions had been observed, the Enemy could not have passed the Ford: But not being observed, and on <hi>Monday</hi> following, finding the Enemy in good posture on the other side of the Water, drawing Battalions down to the Ford, he drew up what Men he could to make Opposition, who cried out, that they wanted Powder, and most of them Arms; and in like manner the Major applying to the Fort near <hi>Claudy Bridge,</hi> they also cried out for want of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and from thence returning to the Horse, he found them breaking, and after retreating near a Mile, prevailed with them to Rally, in order to bring off the Foot, especially the Regiment of <hi>Antrim</hi>'s, which was accordingly done. At the same time the Souldiers told me, that the Governor was gone by, and some others, which made him very earnest to be gone; saying, I would keep them there to be cut off.</p>

            <p>HEaring you have taken the Field, in Order to Fight the Enemy, I have thought it necessary for His Majesty's Service, to let you know there are two well-disciplined Regiments here on Board, that may joyn you in two days at farthest, I am sure they will be of great Use in any Occasion, but especially for the Encouragement of Raw Men, as I judge most of yours are: Therefore it is my Opinion, that you only stop the Passage of the Enemy at the Foords of <hi>Finn,</hi> till I can joyn you, and afterwards, if giving Battel be necessary, you will be in a much better po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture for it than before. I must ask your Pardon if I am too free in my Advice; according to the Remote Prospect I have of things, this seems most Reasonable to me; but as His Majesty has left the whole Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Matters to you, so you shall find that no Man living shall more chearfully Obey you, than</p>

            </opener>
            <p>ON the 6<hi>th.</hi> Instant I was Introduced by my Lord <hi>Granard</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my Lord Deputies Presence, in the Castle of <hi>Dublin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vid. <hi>p.</hi> 21</note> and have his Pass to come and go to, through and back from <hi>Vlster,</hi> and though I have not his Excellencies direct Commission, yet I assure your Honour, I am at least permitted by the Lord Deputy to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the chief and others of those of the <hi>Vlster</hi> Association with his Discourse to me, which was to the effect following, to wit,</p>
            <p>That his Excellency,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Doth not delight in the blood and devastation of the said Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, but however highly resents their taking and continuing in Arms, and the affronts done by them to his Majesties Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereby, and by some Indignities done to the late Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Clemency, issued and dated the  <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">

               </gap> 
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Notwithstanding whereof is willing to receive the said Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince into protection, provided they immediately deliver up to his Army for his Majesties use their Arms and serviceable Horses, and provided they deliver up to his Excellency these three Persons, to wit,  <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">
                  <desc> _____ </desc>
               </gap>  if they remain in this Kingdom, and can be had.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And for further manifestation of his design to prevent blood, is willing to grant safe Conduct even to the said three Persons, or any other of their party to and from his Excellency, or to and from Lieutenant General <hi>Hamilton,</hi> Commander of a part of his Army hereafter mentioned, if they intend any peaceable and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Treaty; but withal, will not upon the said or any other account stop the March of the said part of his Army, no not for one hour; and if it shall appear in such Treaty, that they took up Arms meerly for self-preservation, then he will pardon even the said three Persons also, but is hopeless that any such thing can be made appear, seeing many of them have already received and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:60523:28"/>
of Commissions from the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and display his Colours in the field, as his Excellency is credibly informed.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If these terms be not immediately agreed unto, he will with a part of his Army fight them, which part he intends shall be at <hi>Newry</hi> on Monday the 11<hi>th.</hi> Instant, which will from thence march to <hi>Belfast,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Colerain</hi> and <hi>Londonderry,</hi> as his Excellency intends. And that the Country <hi>Irish</hi> (not of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my) Men, Women and Boys, now all armed with Half-pikes and Baggonets, in the Counties of <hi>Cavan, Monaghan, Tyrone, London<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derry, &amp;c.</hi> will upon the approach of the said part of the Army, and Resistance thereunto made, immediately enter upon a Massacree of the <hi>British</hi> in the said Counties; which force and violence of the Rabble, his Excellency says, he cannot restrain.</p>
            <p>These are the heads of what I can offer to you to the best of my memory from his Excellencies own mouth, but I intend to stay here this night, where if you think fit, I shall fully Discourse with you of all the above Particulars, whereof I hope you will give immediate notice to all chiefly concerned in your Neighbourhood. This in haste is all from</p>

               <note place="margin">Vide Page 34.</note> as appears by his sending of this.</p>
            <p n="2">II. That the General has full Power, does appear by his Commission.</p>
            <p n="3">III. That General <hi>Rose</hi> has no Power from the King to intermeddle with what Lieutenant General <hi>Hamilton</hi> does, as to the Siege, being only sent to oppose the English Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour; and that all Conditions and Parlies is left to the said Lieutenant General <hi>Hamilton</hi>: That as to what Articles shall be agreed on, they may may see by the Kings Warrant he has full Power to confirm them: Notwithstanding, if they do not think this sufficient, he will give what other reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Security they can demand. As to the English Landing, such as had Commissions from the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> need not be apprehensive, since it will be the Kings Interest to take as much care of his Protestant Subjects, as of any other, he making no distinction of Religion.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. As to what concerns the <hi>Inneskillin</hi> People, they shall have the same Terms as those of <hi>Derry,</hi> on their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, the King being willing to shew Mercy to all his Subjects, and quiet his Kingdoms.</p>
            <p n="5">V.

            <p>As to the Last Point, Such as have a mind to return to their Homes, shall have a necessary Guard with them to their respective Habitations, and Victuals to supply them; where

            <p>HAving this opportunity, <note place="margin">Page 19.</note> I think fit to let you know the great and most lamentable disappointment we are under. My Lord <hi>Kingston</hi> is basely us'd by your Officers; they have drawn him from the Garrison of <hi>Sligo,</hi> which he had so bravely Fortify'd, and had such a number of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plin'd Men both Horse and Foot in, and so well arm'd, that he could not but have done Service with them, and have made good that Post against the Enemy: But Col. <hi>Londy</hi> writ to him, That the Blood of all the Protestants of the North will lie upon him, if he does not quit the Garrison of <hi>Sligo,</hi> and come to their Assistance. Upon this he marches from <hi>Sligo,</hi> and at <hi>Balishanny</hi> meets a Letter of Col.<hi>Londy</hi>'s, telling him, There was no Provision for him at <hi>Derry,</hi> and that he must quarter there. My Lord takes Horse, rides twenty Miles in the Night to understand the meaning of these things, but finds the Enemy had stop't all passages to <hi>Derry</hi>; so he returns to his Men, and there finds that <hi>Sligo</hi> was possessed also by the Enemy. You may imagine what a Distraction we were in upon this; but with the most earnest entreaty we prevailed with my Lord to go for <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to solicit for Relief from thence, and are resolv'd to to take our shelter in <hi>Iniskellin</hi>; if any thing happen amiss to us, our Children, if they survive, may curse your Great Men for it; <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
