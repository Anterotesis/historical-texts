         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>WHEN, many Years ago, I was induced to write ſomething a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Subject of the following Treatiſe; I did it, <hi>partly</hi> to give ſome Satisfaction to a Friend, and <hi>partly</hi> to impoſe upon myſelf an Obligation, to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the more attentively upon what Grounds it may be aſſerted, That there is no Inconſiſtence between a Man's being an Induſtrious <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuoſo,</hi> and a Good <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> How little fond I was of troubling the Publick with a Diſcourſe of this Nature, may be gueſſed by my having thrown it aſide, among other neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected Papers, for ſeveral Years. And it had ſtill continued in that Obſcurity, if the, formerly unprevalent, Deſires of thoſe that would have it appear in Publick, had not been enforced by an Obſervation or two, that I could not but make. For I could ſcarce avoid taking notice of the great and deplorable Growth of Irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, eſpecially among thoſe that aſpired to paſs for Wits, and ſeveral of them too for Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers.
<pb facs="tcp:57680:4"/>
And on the other ſide, it was Obvious, that divers Learned Men, as well as Others, <hi>partly</hi> upon the Score of their Abhorrence of theſe Infidels and Libertines, and <hi>partly</hi> upon that of a well-meaning, but ill-informed, Zeal, had brought many Good Men to think, that Religion and Philoſophy were incompatible; both Parties contributing to the Vulgar Error, but with this difference, That the Libertines thought a <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuoſo</hi> ought not to be a <hi>Chriſtian;</hi> and the Others, That he could not be a true One.</p>
            <p>'Tis like, it may ſeem to ſome Readers, that I have too much enlarged the Notion of Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, and too much inſiſted on the Proofs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible from that Topick: But 'tis not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that others may approve the Reaſons, with which that ample Notion of Experience is, where it is propoſed, accompanied. And the Ingenious Perſon, I was chiefly to pleaſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a great Lover and Valuer of Experience, and of Arguments grounded on it, the Deſire of gratifying Him enticed me to ſay ſo much, that when I took up the Thoughts of making this Treatiſe publick, I found the Effects of my Complaiſance ſo interwoven with the other Parts of the Diſcourſe, that I could not make any Great Alteration, (for ſome I did make) without almoſt ſpoiling the Contexture of it.</p>
            <p>I hope the Equitable Reader will not expect to find every Subject, of which I have occaſion to diſcourſe, fully Treated of: For I neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
<pb facs="tcp:57680:4"/>
nor pretended to write a Body of Natural Theology, nor a Demonſtration of the Chriſtian Religion; but thought it ſufficient for me, to conſider the Points I wrote of, as far forth as was Neceſſary, or very Conducive, to my Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. And therefore I thought myſelf, not only Warranted, but Obliged, (in point of Diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) to decline the mention of ſeveral Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Reflections, that would indeed have been very Proper, if my Deſign had been, to ſhew, why One <hi>ſhould be</hi> a Chriſtian; but Impertinent, to ſhew, that a <hi>Virtuoſo,</hi> while ſuch, <hi>may be</hi> a true Chriſtian. But, as for this Reaſon, I omitted many Things, that would have Enrich'd or Adorn'd my Diſcourſe; <hi>ſo</hi> I have endeavoured to make ſome Amends, both by ſuggeſting ſome new Subjects, and by adding on thoſe that have been already Treated of by others, divers Thoughts, into which I was led by the Attentive Conſideration of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject itſelf; on which ſcore, they may probably not have yet occurr'd to the Reader, and may appear to him, either to be new, as to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; or, if any of them be coincident with the more known Ones, to have ſomething of peculiar, as to the way of Propounding, or of Applying, them. And, I confeſs, I was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what Encouraged to communicate my Thoughts on theſe Subjects, by conſidering, that (thô is ought not to be ſo, yet) 'tis Notorious, that in the Age we live in, there are too many Perſons
<pb facs="tcp:57680:5"/>
that are like to be found more indiſpoſed to be Impreſs'd on by Arguments, in favour of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, from profeſs'd Divines, how worthy ſoever, than from ſuch as I, who am a Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and have been look'd upon as no undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Cultivator of Experimental Philoſophy. And that the Style might not be unſuitable to the Writer, and the Deſign; I thought fit, in my Arguments and Illuſtrations, both to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy Compariſons drawn from Teleſcopes, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſcopes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to make frequent uſe of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Hypotheſes, and Obſervations, in requeſt among thoſe, that are called <hi>The New philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers.</hi> Which I the rather did; becauſe ſome Experience has taught me, that ſuch a Way of propoſing and elucidating Things, is, either as moſt clear, or, upon the account of its No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty, wont to be more acceptable, than any Other, to our Modern <hi>Virtuoſi;</hi> whom thus to Gratify, is a good Step towards the Perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of them. For 'tis eaſie to obſerve, that ſome Men are more acceſſible to Truth, and will be more prevailed upon by it, when it is preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them in One Dreſs, than when it appears in Another: As we daily ſee, that ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons will be more eaſily prevailed with to take a Medicine, and that it will have a more kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Operation upon them, if it be exhibited in that Form and Conſiſtence, that is beſt lik'd by the Patients; whereof ſome love to have the Ingredients, the Medicine is to conſiſt of, offer'd
<pb facs="tcp:57680:5"/>
them in a Liquid, others in a Soft, and others in a Dry, Form.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Though</hi> I am wont, as well as inclinable to ſpare the preſent Age; and <hi>though</hi> my Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of ſome reputed <hi>Virtuoſi</hi> that live in it, are written with as harmleſs and friendly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, as was the ſeeming Rudeneſs of the Angel to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> when he ſtruck him on the Side, and haſtily rouzed him, but to awake him, to take off his Chains, and to free him from the Dangers that threatned him; <hi>yet</hi> I ſhall be more troubled than ſurprized, if I ſhall find the following Treatiſe diſliked by divers Perſons, that would paſs for <hi>Virtuoſi,</hi> and by ſome that really are ſo. For ſome Men, that have but ſuperficial, thô conſpicuous, Wits, are not fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to penetrate ſuch Truths, as require a laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and attentive Speculation; and divers, that want not Abilities, are ſo taken up by their Secular Affairs, and their Senſual Pleaſures, that they neither have Diſpoſition, nor will have Leiſure, to diſcover thoſe Truths, that require both an Attentive and Penetrating Mind. And more than of either of theſe ſorts of Men there are, whom their Prejudices do ſo foreſtal, or their Intereſt byas, or their Appetites blind, or their Paſſions diſcompoſe, too much, to allow them a clear Diſcernment, and right Judgment, of Divine Things. Upon which, and other accounts, I ſhall not think it ſtrange, if what I write ſhall make no great
<pb facs="tcp:57680:6"/>
Impreſſion on Readers thus Qualified, whom to Convert, 'tis not enough to Convince them: Nor ſhall I be greatly diſcouraged, or think much the worſe of my Arguments, if they do not make Proſelytes of thoſe, whom Siniſter Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations make ſuch Reſolved Adverſaries to the Truth, that He alone, that can Preach from Heaven, is able to prevail upon them; and they muſt be Converted, almoſt as <hi>Saul</hi> the Perſecutor was, by an extraordinary Light from Heaven, and a Power able to ſtrike them to the Ground. But though I am not ſo little acquainted with the preſent Age, as to expect to plead for Religion with the Approbation of Atheiſts, or of Libertines, yet I ſhall not think my Pains altogether miſpent, if what I have written, <hi>either</hi> Startle any Irreligious Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſo far, as to Engage him to conſult abler Aſſertors of Chriſtianity and Virtue, than I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be; <hi>or</hi> elſe prove ſo happy, as to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm and Strengthen, by new Arguments and Motives, thoſe that have heartily embraced the Chriſtian Faith and Morals, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps not upon the firmeſt Grounds. For it will be no ſmall Satisfaction to me, if, though I cannot Convert the reſclvedly Irreligious, I ſhall at leaſt furniſh thoſe that are not ſo, with Preſervatives againſt them, and hinder their Impiety from being Contagious.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:57680:6"/>But I fear, that thoſe that are Enemies, both to the Doctrines I propoſe, and to the Aims I perſue, will not be the only Perſons that will find fault with the following Tract; ſince, perhaps, there will not be wanting ſome Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Men, that expected, as well as deſired, that I ſhould never write but as a Naturaliſt, becauſe they themſelves eſteem nothing, ſave the Laws and <hi>Phoenomena</hi> of Nature, to be Subjects worthy of a Philoſophical Pen: As if, becauſe Rational Spirits are Inviſible and Immaterial. Beings, all Diſquiſitions about them muſt be airy and uncertain Speculations, and, like their Objects, devoid of Solidity and Uſefulneſs. But though among theſe Ingenious Men there are ſeveral, whoſe Expectations from me I am much more diſpoſed to Gratify, than Diſappoint; yet, on ſuch an occaſion as this, I muſt take the liberty to own, That I do not think the Corporeal World, nor the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent State of Things, the Only or the Principal Subjects, that an Inquiſitive Man's Pen may be worthily employed about; and, That there are ſome Things that are grounded, neither upon Mechanical, nor upon Chymical, Notices or Experiments, that are yet far from deſerving to be Neglected, and much leſs to be Deſpiſed, or ſo much as to be left Uncultivated, eſpecially by ſuch Writers, as being more concerned to act as Chriſtians, than as <hi>Virtuoſi,</hi> muſt alſo think, that ſometimes they may uſefully buſy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb facs="tcp:57680:7"/>
about the Study of Divine Things, as well as at other times employ their Thoughts about the Inſpection of Natural Ones. There are ſome Objects, whoſe Nobleneſs is ſuch, that, though we derive no Advantage from them, but the Contentment of knowing them, and that but very imperfectly too; yet our <hi>Virtuoſi</hi> themſelves juſtly think much Pains and Time, and, perhaps, Coſt too, well ſpent in endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to acquire ſome Conjectural Knowledge of them: As may be inſtanced in the Aſſiduous and Induſtrious Reſearches they have made about the remote Coeleſtial part of the World, eſpecially the Stars and Comets that our Age has expoſed to their Curioſity. For moſt of theſe, though they require chargeable Teleſcopes, and tedious, as well as unhealthy, Nocturnal Obſervations, are Objects, of which we can know very little with any Certainty; and which, for ought appears, we can make no uſeful Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments with. Since therefore we ſo much prize a little Knowledge, of Things that are not only Corporeal, but Inanimate; methinks we ſhould not undervalue the Studies of thoſe Men, that aſpire to the Knowledge of Incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real and Rational Beings, which are incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably more Noble, than all the Stars in the World, which are, as far as we know, but Maſſes of Senſeleſs and Stupid Matter. Since alſo the <hi>Virtuoſi</hi> deſervedly Applaud and Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh the laborious Induſtry of Anatomiſts, in
<pb facs="tcp:57680:7"/>
their Enquiries into the Structure of dead, ghaſtly, and oftentimes unhealthfully as well as offenſively Foetid, Bodies: Can it be an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment improper for a <hi>Chriſtian Virtuoſo,</hi> or unworthy of him, to endeavour the Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the Nature and Faculties of the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Mind; which is That, that Enobles its Manſion, and gives Man the Advantage he has of <hi>the Beaſts that Periſh?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am content, that merely Natural Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy ſhould often Employ my Thoughts, and my Pen; but I cannot conſent it ſhould Engroſs them, and hinder me from being Converſant with Theological Subjects. And ſince, among my Friends, I have ſome, (and thoſe not Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable for their Number, and much leſs for their Merit,) that preſs me to Treat of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Matters, as well as Others, that would have me addict myſelf to Cultivate Phyſical Ones; I, who think myſelf a Debtor to Both theſe ſorts, am willing to endeavour to Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify Both; and having already, on many Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, preſented the later ſort with large, as well as publick, Effects of my Complaiſance for them, I hope, they will not think it ſtrange, that I ſhould now and then have Regard to the former ſort, too; eſpecially, ſince I had higher Motives, than Complaiſance ought to be, to induce me to Treat ſometimes of Things that might be grateful to thoſe Friends, that are much ſo to Religious Compoſures.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:57680:8"/>I preſume, it will be taken notice of, that, in the following Treatiſe, as well as in divers of my other Writings, eſpecially about Subjects that are purely, or partly, Philoſophical; I make frequent uſe of Similitudes, or Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons: And therefore I think myſelf here obliged to acknowledge, once for all, that I did it purpoſely. And my Reaſons for this Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, were, <hi>not only</hi> becauſe fit Compariſons are wont to delight moſt Readers, and to make the Notions, they convey, better kept in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory; whence the beſt Orators and Preachers have made great and ſucceſsful uſe of Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors, Allegories, and other Reſemblances; <hi>but</hi> I was induced to employ them chiefly for two other Reaſons: 1. That <hi>though</hi> I freely confeſs, that Arbitrary Similitudes, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Thoſe that are Foreign to the Subject treated of, ſuch as are moſt of the Vulgar Ones, that are uſually borrowed from the Fictions of the Poets, and from the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and often ill-applied, Relations of <hi>Pliny, Aelian,</hi> and other too frequently Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous Writers, are ſcarce fit to be made uſe of but to Vulgar Readers, or Popular Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories; yet Compariſons fitly choſen, and well applied, may, on many occaſions, uſefully ſerve to illuſtrate the Notions for whoſe ſake they are brought, and, by placing them in a true Light, help Men to conceive them far better, than otherwiſe they would do. And, 2. Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite
<pb facs="tcp:57680:8"/>
Compariſons do not only give Light, but Strength, to the Paſſages they belong to, ſince they are not always bare Pictures and Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances, but a kind of Arguments; being oftentimes, if I may ſo call them, Analogous Inſtances, which do declare the Nature, or Way of Operating, of the Thing they relate to, and by that means do in a ſort prove, that, as 'tis poſſible, ſo it is not improbable, that the Thing may be ſuch as 'tis repreſented: And therefore, <hi>not only</hi> the Illuſtrious <hi>Verulam,</hi> though not more a Florid, than a Iudicious, Writer, has, much to the ſatisfaction of his Readers, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently made uſe of Compariſons, in whoſe Choice, and Application, he was very happy; <hi>but</hi> that ſevere Philoſopher Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi> himſelf ſomewhere ſays, that he ſcarce thought, that he underſtood any thing in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiques, but what he could declare by ſome apt Similitude; of which, in effect, he has many in his Writings; [As, where he compares the Particles of freſh Water, to little Eels; and the Corpuſcles of Salt in the Sea-water, to little rigid Staves; and where, after the Stoicks, he compares the Senſe of Objects by the intervention of Light, to the Senſe that a blind Man hath of Stones, Mud, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by the intervention of his Staff.] To which I ſhall add, That proper Compariſons do the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation almoſt as much Service, as Microſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copes do the Eye; for, <hi>as</hi> this Inſtrument gives
<pb facs="tcp:57680:9"/>
us a diſtinct view of divers minute Things, which our naked Eyes cannot well diſcern; becauſe theſe Glaſſes repreſent them far more large, than by the bare Eye we judge them; <hi>ſo</hi> a skilfully choſen, and well-applied, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon much helps the Imagination, by illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating Things ſcarce diſcernible, ſo as to repreſent them by Things much more familiar and eaſy to be apprehended.</p>
            <p>I confeſs, I might, on ſome Occaſions, have ſpoken, not only more Poſitively, and Boldly; but, as to many Learned Readers, more Acceptably, if I would have diſcourſed alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether like a <hi>Carteſian,</hi> or as a <hi>Partizan</hi> of ſome other Modern Sect of Philoſophizers. But, beſides that, I am not minded to give myſelf up to any Sect, I thought it conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, that a Diſcourſe, deſigned to work on Perſons of differing Perſuaſions about Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical Matters, ſhould not declare itſelf dogmatically, or unreſervedly, of a Party, but employ rather the Dictates of Reaſon, or Principles either granted, or little conteſted, than proceed upon the peculiar Principles of a diſtinct Party of Philoſophizers.</p>
            <p>If now and then I have inſiſted upon ſome particular Subjects, more than appears abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary, I did it, becauſe that, though I wrote this Treatiſe <hi>chiefly for</hi> my Friends, yet I did not write it <hi>for them only;</hi> but
<pb facs="tcp:57680:9"/>
was willing to lay hold on ſome of the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions that the <hi>Series</hi> of my Diſcourſe offered me, to excite in myſelf thoſe Diſpoſitions that I endeavoured to produce in others: And, by inſiſting upon ſome Reflections, impreſs them more deeply upon my own Mind; eſpecially when I was Treating of ſome Points, either ſo Important, or ſo Oppoſed, or Both, that they can ſcarce be too much inculcated.</p>
            <p>The Name of the Perſon, to whom the following Papers were addreſs'd, not being <hi>neceſſary</hi> to be made Publick; ſome Reaſons made it thought <hi>convenient,</hi> that it ſhould remain unmentioned.</p>

                  <p>I Perceive by what you intimate, that your Friends, Dr. <hi>W.</hi> and Mr. <hi>N.</hi> think it very ſtrange, that I, whom they are pleas'd to look upon as a diligent Cultivater of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental Philoſophy,</hi> ſhould be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57680:12"/>
Embracer of the <hi>Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;</hi> tho' divers of its Articles are ſo far from being Objects of Senſe, that they are thought to be above the Sphere of Reaſon. But, <hi>tho'</hi> I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume they may find many Objects of the like wonder, among thoſe with whom I am compriz'd by them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of the <hi>New Virtuoſi;</hi> and among Theſe, they may meet with divers perſons more able than I, to eaſe them of their wonder; <hi>yet,</hi> ſince they are pleas'd by ſingling me out, as it were to challenge <hi>me</hi> to do it, I ſhall endeavour to make them think it at leaſt leſs ſtrange, That a great Eſteem of Experience, and a high Veneration for Religion, ſhould be compatible in the ſame perſon. Wherefore I ſhall not deny, that I am now and then buſied in deviſing, and putting in practice, Tryals of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſorts, and making Reflections upon them: And I own too, that (about natural things) I have a great Reverence for Experience, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of Authority. But withal, I
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57680:12"/>
declare, that to embrace Chriſtianity, I do not think I need to recede from the value and kindneſs I have for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental Philoſophy, any thing near ſo far as your Friends ſeem to imagin. And I hope it will appear, that, If the Experimental way of Philoſophiſing I am addicted to, have any things in it that indiſpoſe a man to aſſent to the Truth, and live according to the Laws, of the Chriſtian Religion; thoſe few things are more than coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervail'd by the peculiar Advantages, that it affords a Man of a well-diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd mind, towards the being a good Chriſtian.</p>
                  <p>I ſaid, a man of a <hi>well-diſpos'd mind;</hi> that is, one, that is both do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile, and inclin'd to make pious appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of the Truths he diſcovers; becauſe ſuch a Qualification of Mind, I hope, God, through his Goodneſs, has vouchſaf'd me; and the occaſion given by your friends to the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diſcourſe, relating peculiarly to <hi>me,</hi> a perſonal account of my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and reaſons of them, ought to

ſuffice. And 'twill be <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> (as they ſpeak,) if my Diſcourſe be found, as it often will be, to extend much farther. Which Reflection, I deſire you would frequently have in your thoughts, to prevent miſtaking the Deſign of the following Epiſtle.</p>
                  <p>I doubt not, but the Popular Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices, that I perceive your two Friends, among many other more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout than well-inform'd Perſons, have entertain'd, will make them think, that what I have now deliver'd needs good proof, and perhaps better than it is capable of. And therefore I hope you will eaſily allow me the liberty, I am going to take, of briefly premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſome things, to clear the way for the principal Points, deſign'd to be diſcours'd of in this Letter.</p>
                  <p>I know you need not be told, that the Philoſophy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is moſt in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt among the modern <hi>Virtuoſi,</hi> and which by ſome is call'd the <hi>New,</hi> by others the <hi>Corpuſcularian,</hi> by others the <hi>Real,</hi> by others (tho' not ſo proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) the <hi>Atomical,</hi> and by others again
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57680:13"/>
the <hi>Carteſian,</hi> or the <hi>Mechanical, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy;</hi> is built upon two founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Experience.</hi> But it may not be impertinent to obſerve to you, that although the Peripatetick, and ſome other Philoſophies, do alſo pretend to be grounded upon Reaſon and Experience; yet there is a great difference betwixt the uſe that is made of theſe two Principles, by the School-Philoſophers, and by the <hi>Virtuoſi.</hi> For <hi>thoſe,</hi> in the framing of their Syſtem, make but little uſe of Experience; contenting themſelves for the moſt part to employ but few and obvious Experiments, and vulgar Traditions, uſually Uncertain, and oftentimes Falſe; and ſuperſtructing almoſt their whole Phyſicks upon <hi>Abſtracted Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;</hi> by which, I mean, The rational Faculty endowed but with its own Congenit or Common Notions and <hi>Idea's,</hi> and with Popular Notices; that is, ſuch as are common among men, eſpecially thoſe that are any thing Learned. But now, the <hi>Virtuoſi</hi> I ſpeak of, and by whom, in this whole
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57680:14"/>
Diſcourſe, I mean thoſe, that Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and Cultivate Experimental Philoſophy, make a much greater and better uſe of Experience in their Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical Reſearches. For they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult Experience both frequently and heedfully; and, not content with the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> that Nature ſpontaneouſly affords them, they are ſolicitous, when they find it needful, to enlarge their Experience by Tryals purpoſely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd; and ever and anon Reflecting upon it, they are careful to Conform their Opinions to it; or, if there be juſt cauſe, Reform their Opinions by it. So that our <hi>Virtuoſi</hi> have a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Right to the diſtinguiſhing Title that is often given them, of <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Philoſophers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I can ſcarce doubt, but your Friends have more than once oblig'd you to take notice, of the Prophane Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes and Licentious Lives of ſome <hi>Virt<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>oſi,</hi> that boaſt much of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the New Philoſophy. And I deny not, but that, if the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Nature falls into the hands
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57680:14"/>
of a Reſolved Atheiſt, or a Senſual Libertine, he may miſemploy it to Oppugn the Grounds, or Diſcredit the Practice, of Religion. But it will fare much otherwiſe, if a deep in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight into Nature be acquir'd by a man of Probity and Ingenuity, or at leaſt free from Prejudices and Vices, that may indiſpoſe him to entertain and improve thoſe Truths of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, that would naturally lead him to Sentiments of Religion. For, if a Perſon thus qualify'd in his Morals, and thereby diſpos'd to make uſe of the knowledge of the Creatures to confirm his Belief, and encreaſe his Veneration, of the Creator, (and ſuch a Perſon I here again advertiſe you, and deſire you would not forget it, I ſuppoſe the <hi>Virtuoſo</hi> this Paper is concern'd in, to be) ſhall make a great progreſs in Real Philoſophy; I am perſwaded, that Nature will be found very Loyal to her Author, and in ſtead of Alienating his Mind from making religious Acknowledgments, will furniſh him with weighty and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57680:15"/>
Motives, to conclude ſuch Sentiments to be highly rational and juſt. On which occaſion, I muſt not pretermit that judicious Obſervation of one of the firſt and greateſt Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimental Philoſophers of our Age, (Sir <hi>Francis Bacon</hi>) That God never wrought a Miracle to convince Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts; becauſe in his Viſible Works he had plac'd enough to do it, if they were not wanting to themſelves. The Reaſon he gives for which Remark, I ſhall confirm, by obſerving, that 'tis intimated in a paſſage of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting both <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 20.</note>
                     <hi>that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible things of God are clearly ſeen from the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World,</hi> as Tokens and Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, (as I remember the Particle <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> in the <hi>Greek</hi> doth elſewhere ſignify,) and that his Divinity and Eternal Power may be ſo well underſtood by the things that are made, that the Gentiles, who had but the Light of Nature to lead them to the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of the true God, were Excuſeleſs, for not being brought by
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57680:15"/>
that Guide to that Acknowledgment.</p>
                  <p>And indeed, the Experimental Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy giving us a more clear diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, than Strangers to it have, of the divine Excellencies diſplay'd in the Fabrick and Conduct of the Univerſe, and of the Creatures it conſiſts of, very much indiſpoſeth the mind, to aſcribe ſuch admirable Effects to ſo incompetent and piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a Cauſe as Blind Chance, or the tumultuous Juſtlings of Atomical Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſenſeleſs Matter; and leads it directly to the acknowledgment and adoration of a moſt Intelligent, Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful and Benign Author of things, to whom alone ſuch excellent Producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may, with the greateſt Congruity, be aſcrib'd. And therefore, if any of the Cultivaters of Real Philoſophy pervert it to countenance Atheiſm, 'tis certainly the fault of the Perſons, not the Doctrine; which is to be judg'd of by it's own natural Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, not by the ill Uſe that ſome bad Men may make of it; eſpecially if the prevaricating Perſons are but
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57680:16"/>
pretenders to the Philoſophy they miſemploy; which Character will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be found to belong to moſt, if not all, the Atheiſtical and Prophane Men, the Objection means. For moſt of theſe do as little underſtand the Myſteries of Nature, as believe thoſe of Chriſtianity; and of divers of them it may be truly ſaid, that their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality, and Luſts, and Paſſions, dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken'd and ſeduc'd their Intellects: Their Immorality was the Original Cauſe of their Infidelity; nor were they led by Philoſophy to Irreligion, but got and perverted ſome ſmattering of Philoſophy, to countenance the Irreligious Principles, they brought with them to the Study of it.</p>
                  <p>But all this notwithſtanding, I fear, if not foreſee, that you will ſurmiſe, that the ſtudy of Natural Philoſophy, how innocent ſoever it may be <hi>in it ſelf,</hi> will, <hi>in this Libertine City,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage me to converſe with many, who, tho' they paſs for <hi>Virtuoſi,</hi> are indeed Atheiſts; whoſe contagious Company muſt Endanger, if not Infect, me.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:57680:16"/>This obliges me to tell you, that tho' I have no reaſon to take it at all unkindly, that you are jealous of me on the ſcore of being Solicitous for my Safety; yet I hope my Danger is not ſo great as you may apprehend it. For <hi>First,</hi> I muſt own to you, that I do not think there are ſo many Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Atheiſts, as Men are wont to imagin. And tho' my Converſation has been pretty free and general a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Naturaliſts, yet I have met with ſo few true Atheiſts, that I am very apt to think, that Men's want of due Information, or their uncharitable Zeal, has made them miſtake or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſent many for Denyers of God, that are thought ſuch, chiefly becauſe they take uncommon Methods in ſtudying his Works, and have other Sentiments of them, than thoſe of vulgar Philoſophers. And in the <hi>next</hi> place I muſt tell you, that having, through the goodneſs of God, choſen my Religion, not Inconſiderately, but upon mature Deliberation; I do not find thoſe <hi>Virtuoſi,</hi> you call Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57680:17"/>
ſuch formidable Adverſaries, as thoſe that are afraid to hear them, do, by that Apprehenſion, appear to think them. And indeed, I have obſerv'd the Phyſical Arguments of the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts to be but very few, and thoſe far enough from being Unanſwerable. And as for the very chief of them, <hi>tho</hi>' they are wont to puzzle ſuch as are not vers'd in nice Speculations, becauſe they repreſent the aſſertion of a Deity, as a Doctrine encumber'd with inextricable Difficulties; <hi>yet</hi> I do not think the Objections ſolidly ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſince the ſame Difficulties, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers not inferior, may be urg'd againſt thoſe Hypotheſes and Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, that the Deniers of God do or muſt admit. And indeed, moſt of the perplexing Difficulties the Atheiſts lay ſo much ſtreſs on, do not proceed from any Abſurdity contained in the Tenent of the Theiſts, but from the Nature of things; that is, partly from the Dimneſs and other Imperfections of our Human Underſtandings, and partly from the Abſtruſe Nature, that,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57680:17"/>
to ſuch Bounded Intellects, all Objects muſt appear to have, in whoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception Infinity is involv'd; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that Object be God, or Atoms, or Duration, or ſome other thing that is uncauſable. For, however we may flatter our ſelves, I fear we ſhall find, upon ſtrict and impartial Tryal, that finite Underſtandings are not able clearly to reſolve ſuch Difficulties, as exact a clear comprehenſion of what is really Infinite.</p>
                  <p>But to perſue this Diſcourſe, would lead us too far. And 'tis more fit, after ſo much has been ſaid concerning not only the Deſign of this Tract, but the New Philoſophy, the <hi>Virtuoſi,</hi> and my ſelf; to proceed to thoſe more Particular things, that directly tend to the main Scope of our Epiſtle.</p>
                  <p>The firſt advantage, that our Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimental Philoſopher, as ſuch, hath towards being a Chriſtian, is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that his courſe of Studies conduceth much, to ſettle in his Mind a firm Belief of the <hi>Exiſtence,</hi> and divers of the chief<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Attributes, of <hi>God:</hi> Which Belief,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57680:18"/>
is, in the order of things, the firſt Principle of that Natural Religion, which it ſelf is pre-required to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd Religion in general, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently to That in particular, which is embrac'd by Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>That the conſideration of the Vaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Beauty, and Regular Motions, of the heavenly Bodies; the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Structure of Animals and Plants; beſides a multitude of other <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena</hi> of Nature, and the Subſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of moſt of theſe to Man; may juſtly induce him, as a Rational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to Conclude, That this vaſt, beautiful, orderly, and (in a word) many ways admirable Syſtem of things, that we call the <hi>World,</hi> was fram'd by an Author ſupremely Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, Wiſe, and Good, can ſcarce be deny'd by an intelligent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudic'd Conſiderer. And this is ſtrongly confirm'd by Experience, which witneſſeth, that in almoſt all Ages and Countries, the generality of Philoſophers, and contemplative Men, were perſuaded of the Exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57680:18"/>
of a Deity, by the conſideration of the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of the Univerſe; whoſe Fabrick and Conduct they ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally concluded could not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly aſcrib'd, either to blind Chance, or to any other Cauſe than <hi>a Divine Being.</hi>

                  <p>But, <hi>tho</hi>' it be true, that God <hi>hath not left himſelf without witneſs,</hi> even to perfunctory Conſiderers; by ſtamping upon divers of the more Obvious Parts of his Workmanſhip, ſuch conſpicuous Impreſſions of his Attributes, that a moderate degree of Underſtanding, and Attention, may ſuffice to make Men acknowledg his Being; <hi>Yet,</hi> I ſcruple not to think, That Aſſent very much inferior to the Belief, that the ſame Objects are fitted to produce in an Heedful and Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Contemplator of them: For the Works of God are ſo worthy of their Author, that, beſides the Impreſſes of his Wiſdom, and Goodneſs, that are left as it were upon their Surfaces; there are a great many more curious and excellent Tokens, and Effects, of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57680:19"/>
Divine Artifice, in the hidden and innermoſt Receſſes of them; and theſe are not to be diſcovered by the perfunctory looks of Oſcitant or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful Beholders; but Require, as well, as Deſerve, the moſt attentive and prying Inſpection of inquiſitive and well-inſtructed Conſiderers. And ſometimes in one Creature, there may be I know not how many admirable things, that eſcape a vulgar Eye, and yet may be clearly diſcern'd by That of a true Naturaliſt; who brings with him, beſides a more than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Curioſity and Attention, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent knowledge of Anatomy, Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, Coſmography, Mechanicks, and Chymiſtry. But treating elſewhere purpoſely of this Subject, it may here ſuffice to ſay, that God has couch'd ſo many things in his Viſible Works, that the clearer Light a Man has, the more he may diſcover of their Unobvious Exquiſiteneſs, and the more clearly and diſtinctly he may diſcern thoſe Qualities that lye more Obvious. And the more wonderful things he
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57680:19"/>
diſcovers in the Works of Nature, the more auxiliary Proofs he meets with to eſtabliſh and enforce the Argument, drawn from the Univerſe and its Parts, to evince <hi>That there is a God:</hi> Which is a Propoſition of that vaſt weight and importance, that it ought to endear every thing to us, that is able to Confirm it, and Afford us new Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to acknowledge and adore the Divine Author of things.</p>
                  <p>In reference to this matter, we may confidently ſay, that the Experimental Philoſophy has a great advantage of the Scholaſtick. For in the Peripate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Schools, where things are wont to be aſcrib'd to certain Subſtantial Forms, and Real Qualities; (the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of which are acknowledg'd to be very abſtruſe and myſterious things, and the later are many of them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly occult;) the accounts of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures Works may be eaſily given in a few words, that are general enough to be applicable to almoſt all Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. But theſe uninſtructive Terms do neither oblige, nor conduct, a man
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57680:20"/>
to deeper ſearches into the Structure of Things, nor the manner of being Produc'd, and of Operating upon one another. And conſequently, are very inſufficient to diſcloſe the exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite Wiſdom, which the Omniſcient Maker has expreſs'd in the peculiar Fabricks of Bodies, and the skilfully regulated Motions of them, or of their conſtituent Parts: From the diſcernment of which things, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, it is, that there is, by way of reſult, produc'd in the mind of an Intelligent Contemplator, a ſtrong Conviction of the Being of a Divine Opificer, and a juſt acknowledgment of his admirable Wiſdom. To be told, that an Eye is the Organ of Sight, and that this is perform'd by that Faculty of the Mind, which from its Function is call'd <hi>Viſive;</hi> will give a Man but a ſorry account of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments and Manner of Viſion it ſelf, or of the Knowledge of that Opificer, who, as the Scripture ſpeaks, <note place="margin">Pſal. 94. 9.</note>
                     <hi>form'd the Eye.</hi> And he that
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57680:20"/>
can take up with this eaſy Theory of Viſion, will not think it neceſſary to take the pains to diſſect the Eyes of Animals, nor ſtudy the Books of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicians, to underſtand Viſion; and accordingly, will have but mean thoughts of the Contrivance of the Organ, and the Skill of the Artificer, in compariſon of the Idea's that will be ſuggeſted of both of them, to him that, being profoundly skill'd in Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy and Opticks, by Their help takes aſunder the ſeveral Coats, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and Muſcles, of which, that exquiſite Dioptrical Inſtrument con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts: And having ſeparately conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd the Figure, Size, Conſiſtence, Texture, Diaphaneity, or Opacity, Situation, and Connexions, of each of them, and their Coaptation in the whole Eye, ſhall diſcover, by the help of the Laws of Opticks, how admirably this little Organ is fitted, to Receive the incident Beams of Light, and Diſpoſe them in the beſt manner poſſible, for compleating the lively Repreſentation of the almoſt infinitely various Objects of Sight.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:57680:21"/>'Tis eaſie for Men to ſay in general Terms, that <hi>the World is wiſely fram'd;</hi> but I doubt it often happens, that Men confeſs, that the Creatures are wiſely made, rather becauſe upon other grounds they believe God to be a wiſe Agent, than becauſe ſo ſlight an account as the School Philoſophy gives of particular Creatures, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces them of any Divine Wiſdom in the Creator. And <hi>tho</hi>' I am wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to grant, that ſome Impreſſions of God's Wiſdom are ſo conſpicuous, that (as I lately intimated) even a Superficial Philoſopher may thence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, that the Author of ſuch Works muſt be <hi>a wiſe</hi> Agent; <hi>yet, how wiſe</hi> an Agent he has in thoſe Works ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd himſelf to be, none but an Experimental Philoſopher can well diſcern.

                     <hi>II.</hi> After the Exiſtence of the Deity, the next grand Principle of Natural Religion, is, the <hi>Immortality of the Rational Soul;</hi> whoſe genuine conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is, the Belief and Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Future and Everlaſting State. For this important Truth, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Arguments may be alledg'd, that may <hi>perſuade a ſober and well-diſpoſed Man</hi> to embrace it: But to <hi>convince a learned Adverſary,</hi> the ſtrongeſt Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the Light of Nature ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies us with, ſeems to be that which is afforded by the Real Philoſophy. For this teacheth us to form true and diſtinct Notions of the Body, and the Mind; and thereby manifeſts ſo great a difference in their Eſſential Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, that the ſame thing <hi>cannot</hi> be both. This it makes out more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly, by enumerating ſeveral Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and Functions of the Rational Soul; ſuch as, <hi>To</hi> Underſtand, and that ſo, as to form Conceptions <hi>of</hi> Abſtracted things, <hi>of</hi> Univerſals, <hi>of</hi>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:57680:22"/>
Immaterial Spirits, and even <hi>of</hi> that infinitely Perfect One, God himſelf: And alſo, <hi>to</hi> Conceive, and Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, that there are Incommenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Lines, and Surd Numbers; <hi>to</hi> make Ratiocinations, and both cogent and concatenated Inferences, about theſe things; <hi>to</hi> expreſs their intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Notions, <hi>pro re natâ,</hi> by words or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted Signs, to other Men; <hi>to</hi> exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe Free-will about many things; and <hi>to</hi> make Reflections on its own Acts, both of Intellect and Will. For theſe and the like Prerogatives, that are pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to the Human Mind, and ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to any thing that belongs to the Outward Senſes, or to the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it ſelf, manifeſt, that the Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Soul is a Being of an higher Order, than Corporeal; and conſequently, that the Seat of theſe Spiritual Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and the Source of theſe Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, is a Subſtance, that being in its own nature diſtinct from the Body, is not naturally ſubject to Dye or Periſh with it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:57680:22"/>And in reference to this Truth, our <hi>Virtuoſo</hi> hath an advantage of a mere School-Philoſopher. For being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the true and real Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Putrefaction, and other Phyſical kinds of Corruption; and thereby diſcerning, that the things that deſtroy Bodies, are the Avolation, or other Receſs, of ſome neceſſary Parts, and ſuch a depraving Tranſpoſition of the component Portions of Matter, as is altogether incongruous to the Struc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Mechanical Modification, that is eſſential to a Body of that <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> or kind, it belongs to: Our Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſt, I ſay, knowing this, plainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives, that theſe cauſes of deſtruction can have no place in the Rational Soul; which being an Immaterial Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and conſequently a Subſtance not really diviſible, can have no Parts ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd or tranſpos'd, and ſo being exempted from the Phyſical Cauſes of Corruption that deſtroy Bodies, ſhe ought to laſt always. And being a Rational Creature, endow'd with internal Principles of Acting, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57680:23"/>
in Free-will, ſhe ought to live for ever, unleſs it pleaſe God to anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilate her; which we have no reaſon to ſuppoſe he will do. But on the other ſide, the Modern Peripateticks (for I queſtion whether <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf were of the ſame opinion) main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Subſtantial Forms, by ſome of them, ſtyl'd <hi>Semi-ſubſtantiae,</hi> to which in Apes, Elephants, and others, that paſs for ingenious Animals, they aſcribe ſome ſuch Faculties and Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, as ſeem to differ but gradually from thoſe of the Rational Soul; and (how innocent ſoever I grant their Intentions to be) their Doctrine tends much to Enervate, if not quite to Diſable, the chief Phyſical way of Probation, whence the Immortality of Man's Mind is juſtly inferr'd. For ſince according to the Peripateticks, ſubſtantial Forms, are, as they ſpeak, educ'd out of the Power or Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality of the Matter; and do ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon it, not only as to Action, but as to Being, that they cannot at all ſubſiſt without it: But when the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57680:23"/>
particular Body (as an Herb, a Stone, or a Bird,) is deſtroy'd, they periſh with it; or, (as ſome of them ſcarce intelligibly expreſs the ſame thing) <hi>fall back into the baſom of the matter:</hi> I think they give great advantage to Atheiſts, and Cavillers, to impugn the Minds Immortality.</p>
                  <p>For if to an Ape, or other Brute Animal, there belongs a Being more noble than Matter, that can actuate and inform it, and make it ſelf the Architect of its own Manſion, tho' ſo admirable as that of an Ape, or an Elephant; if this Being can in the Body it hath fram'd, perform all the Functions of a vegetable Soul; and beſides thoſe, See, Hear, Taſt, Smell, Imagin, Infer, Remember, Love, Hate, Fear, Hope, Expect, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet be a mortal thing, and periſh with the Body: 'Twill not be difficult for thoſe Enemies of Religion, who are willing to think the Soul Mortal, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their brutiſh Lives make them wiſh ſhe were, to fancy, that human Minds are but a ſomewhat more
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57680:24"/>
Noble, but not for that leſs Mortal, kind of Subſtantial Forms; as amongſt Senſitive Souls themſelves, which they acknowledge to be equally Mortal, there is a great diſparity in Degrees, that of a Monky, for inſtance, being very far ſuperior to that of an Oy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <hi>III.</hi> The third main Principle of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reveal'd Religion, and conſequently of Reveal'd, (which preſuppoſes Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Religion, as it's foundation) is a Belief of the Divine Providence. And in this grand Article, as well as in the two foregoing, a Man may be much Confirm'd by Experimental Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy; both as it affords him poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Inducements to acknowledge the Article, and as it ſhews the great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probability of the two main Grounds, on one or other of which, (for they are not well conſiſtent) is founded the denyal of God's Providence.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>Virtuoſo,</hi> that by manifold and curious Experiments ſearches deep in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Nature of things, has great and peculiar Advantages, to diſcover
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57680:24"/>
and obſerve the excellent Fabrick of the World, as 'tis an immenſe Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregate of the ſeveral Creatures that compoſe it; and to take notice in its particular Parts, eſpecially thoſe that are Animated, of ſuch exquiſite Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances, and ſuch admirable Coor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinations, and Subordinations, in reference to each other, as lie hid from thoſe Beholders that are not both Attentive and Skilful. When our <hi>Virtuoſo</hi> contemplates the Vaſtneſs, ſcarce conceivable Swiftneſs, and yet conſtant Regularity, of the various Motions, of the Sun, Moon, and other Celeſtial Lights: When he conſiders <hi>how</hi> the Magnetiſm of the Earth makes its Poles conſtantly look the ſame way, notwithſtanding the Motions of its fluid <hi>Vortex; how</hi> by daily turning about its own Center in four and twenty hours, it receives as much Light, and benefit from the Sun, and all the glorious Conſtellations of the Firmament, as if <hi>they,</hi> with all the vaſt heavenly Region they belong to, mov'd about <hi>it</hi> in the ſame time; <hi>how</hi>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:57680:25"/>
by its Situation among them, it enjoys the regular Viciſſitudes of Day and Night, Summer and Winter, <hi>&amp;c. how</hi> the ſeveral Parts of the Sublunary World are mutually ſubſervient to one another, and moſt of them (one way or other) Serviceable to Man; <hi>how</hi> excellently the Bodies of Animals are Contriv'd; <hi>what</hi> various and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous proviſion is made for differing Animals, that they may ſubſiſt as long as they ſhould, according to the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Nature, by furniſhing them, according to their reſpective Natures, <hi>ſome</hi> with Strength to take their Food by force, <hi>others</hi> with Induſtry to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure it by Subtilty; <hi>ſome</hi> with Arms, as Horns, Hoofs, Scales, Tusks, Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Stings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to Defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and Offend their Enemies; <hi>ſome</hi> with Wings or ſwiftneſs to fly from Dangers; <hi>ſome</hi> with Foreſight to prevent them; <hi>ſome</hi> with Craft, and perhaps ſtrange Fetches of it, to Elude them; <hi>how</hi> being diſtinguiſh'd into two Sexes, each of theſe is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd with appoſite Organs, for the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57680:25"/>
propagation of the <hi>Species,</hi> and with skill and kindneſs to nouriſh and train up their young ones, till they can ſhift for themſelves; <hi>how</hi> admirable, and indeed aſtoniſhing, a proceſs is gone through in the formation of the <hi>Foetus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>,</hi> eſpecially of a Human one; <hi>how</hi> divers Animals are endowed with ſtrange Inſtincts, whoſe Effects ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſeem much to ſurpaſs thoſe of Reaſon it ſelf; tho' they are ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added to the Mechanical Structure of the Animal, and argue a reſpect to things very remote from it, either in time, place, or both, and perhaps alſo to the Grand Fabrick or Syſtem of the World, and the general Oeconomy of Nature. When, as I was ſaying, a Philoſopher duly reflects on theſe things, and many others of the like import, he will think it highly ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal to infer from them theſe three Concluſions.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That a Machine ſo Immenſe, ſo Beautiful, ſo well contriv'd, and, in a word, ſo Admirable, as the World, cannot have been the effect of mere
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57680:26"/>
Chance, or the Tumultuous Juſtlings and Fortuitous Concourſe of Atoms, but muſt have been produc'd by a Cauſe, exceedingly Powerful, Wiſe, and Beneficent.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That this moſt Potent Author, and (if I may ſo ſpeak) Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer of the World, hath not Aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd a Maſterpiece ſo worthy of him, but does ſtill Maintain and Preſerve it; ſo regulating the ſtupendiouſly ſwift Motions of the great Globes, and other vaſt Maſſes of the Mundane Matter, that they do not, by any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Irregularity, diſorder the grand Syſtem of the Univerſe, and reduce it to a kind of <hi>Chaos,</hi> or confus'd State of ſhuffl'd and deprav'd things.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That <hi>as</hi> it is not above the Ability of the Divine Author of things, though a ſingle Being, to Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and Govern all his Viſible Works, how great and numerous ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; <hi>ſo</hi> he thinks it not Below his Dignity and Majeſty, to extend his Care and Beneficence to particular Bodies, and even to the meaneſt Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:57680:26"/>
providing not only for the Nouriſhment, but for the Propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of Spiders and Ants themſelves. And indeed, ſince the Truth of this Aſſertion, <hi>That God governs the World he has made,</hi> would appear (if it did not by other Proofs) by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, and Regularity, and aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly rapid Motions of the vaſt Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial Bodies, and by the long Trains of as Admirable, as Neceſſary, Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, that are employ'd to the Propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of various ſorts of Animals, (whether Viviparous, or Oviparous;) I ſee not why it ſhould be deny'd, that God's Providence may reach to his particular Works here below, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to the nobleſt of them, <hi>Man;</hi> ſince moſt of thoſe Learned Men that deny this, as derogatory to God's Majeſty and Happineſs, acknowledge, that at the firſt <hi>Creation,</hi> or (if they diſlike that term) <hi>Formation</hi> of things; the great Author of them muſt not only have extended his Care, to the grand Syſtem of the Univerſe in general, but allow'd it to deſcend ſo low, as to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57680:27"/>
contrive all the Minute, and various Parts, (and even the moſt homely ones) not only of Greater and (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putedly) more perfect Animals, as Elephants, Whales, and Men; but ſuch Small and Abject Ones, as Flies, Ants, Fleas, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which being mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly propagated by Eggs laid by the Female, cannot reaſonably be thought the off-ſpring of Putrefaction. Whence I gather, as from matter of fact, that to be concern'd for the welfare, even of particular Animals; as it is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to God's All-pervading Wiſdom, and exuberant Beneficence; ſo (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Men's Vanity may make them ſurmiſe) it is not truly derogatory to his adorable Greatneſs and Majeſty.</p>
                  <p>And on this occaſion, I ſhall add, that <hi>ſince</hi> Man is the nobleſt of God's viſible Works; <hi>ſince</hi> very many of them ſeem made for his Uſe; <hi>ſince,</hi> even as an Animal, he is (as the Pſalmiſt truly ſpeaks) <note place="margin">Pſalm 138. 14, 15.</note>
                     <hi>wonderfully made,</hi> and <hi>curiouſly,</hi> or artificially <hi>wrought;</hi> and <hi>ſince</hi> God has both given him a
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:57680:27"/>
Rational Mind, and endow'd it with an Intellect, whereby he can Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template the Works of Nature, and by them acquire a Conviction of the Exiſtence, and divers Attributes, of their ſupremely perfect Author; <hi>ſince</hi> God hath planted Notions and Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in the Mind of Man, fit to make him ſenſible, that he ought to Adore God, as the moſt Perfect of Beings, the Supreme Lord and Governor of the World, the Author of his own Nature, and all his Enjoyments: <hi>Since</hi> all this, I ſay, is ſo, Natural Reaſon dictates to him, that he ought to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the Sentiments he has for this Divine Being, by Veneration of his Excellencies; by Gratitude for his Benefits; by Humiliation, in view of his Greatneſs, and Majeſty; by an Awe of his Juſtice; by Reliance on his Power, and Goodneſs, when he duly endeavours to ſerve and pleaſe him; and, in ſhort, by thoſe ſeveral Acts of Natural Religion, that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhews to be Suitable, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Due to thoſe ſeveral Divine At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57680:28"/>
of his, which it has led us to the knowledge of.</p>
                  <p>And here I ſhall take leave to add, that, from the <hi>Carteſian</hi> Principles, (which you know are embrac'd, by a great part of the Modern <hi>Virtuoſi</hi>) I think, I may draw a double Argument for Divine Providence.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>firſt,</hi> according to the <hi>Carte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi> all Local Motion (which is, under God, the grand Principle of all Actions among things Corporeal) is Adventitious to Matter; and was at firſt produc'd in it, and is ſtill every moment Continu'd and Preſerv'd immediately by God: Whence may be inferr'd, that he Concurs to the Actions of each particular Agent, (as they are Phyſical;) and conſequently, that his Providence reaches to all and every one of them.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>ſecondly,</hi> the ſame <hi>Carteſians</hi> believe the Rational Soul to be an Immaterial Subſtance, really diſtinct and ſeparable from the Body. Whence I infer, that the Divine Providence extends to every particular Man;
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:57680:28"/>
ſince when ever an <hi>Embryo,</hi> or little Human Body form'd in the Womb, is, by being duly Organiz'd, fitted to receive a Rational Mind, God is pleas'd to Create one, and Unite it with that Body. In which Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action, there ſeems to me a neceſſity of a direct and particular interven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Divine Power; ſince I underſtand not, by what Phyſical Charm or Spell an Immaterial<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance can be allur'd into this or that Particular <hi>Embryo,</hi> of many that are at the ſame time fitted to receive a Human Soul; nor by what merely Mechanical Ty, or Band, an Immate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Subſtance can be ſo durably (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps for 80 or 100 Years) joyn'd and united with a Corporeal, in which it finds no Parts, that it has Organs to take hold of, and to which it can fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh no Parts to be faſten'd upon by them. Nor do I better conceive, how a mere Body can produce Pain, Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by its own mere Action, or rather Endeavour to act, on an Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Spirit. Nor will the force of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57680:29"/>
all that has been ſaid for God's Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Providence, be eluded, by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with ſome Deiſts, that after the firſt formation of the Univerſe, all things are brought to paſs by the Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Laws of Nature. For tho' this be confidently, and not without co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, pretended; yet, I confeſs, it does not ſatisfie me. For, beſide the inſuperable difficulty there is, to give an Account of the firſt formation of things, which many (eſpecially <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telian</hi>) Deiſts will not aſcribe to God; and beſides that the Laws of Motion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without which the preſent State and Courſe of things could not be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd, did not neceſſarily ſpring from the Nature of Matter, but depended upon the Will of the Divine Author of things: Beſides this, I ſay, I look upon a Law, as a Moral, not a Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, Cauſe, as being indeed but a Notional thing, according to which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> an intelligent and free Agent is bound to regulate its Actions. But inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Bodies are utterly incapable of Underſtanding what a Law is, or what
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57680:29"/>
it injoyns, or when they act conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably or unconformably to it; and therefore the Actions of Inanimate Bodies, which cannot incite or mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate their own Actions, are produc'd by real Power, not by Laws; tho' the Agents, if Intelligent, may Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate the Exertions of their Power by ſettled Rules.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <hi>IV.</hi> I have taken notice of two other Accounts, upon which the Experimental Knowledge of God's Works, may, in a well-diſpos'd Mind, conduce to eſtabliſh the Belief of his Providence; and therefore, tho' I ſhall not dwell long upon them, I muſt not altogether pretermit them.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then, when our <hi>Virtuoſo</hi> ſees how many, and how various, and oftentimes how ſtrange, and how ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Structures, Inſtincts, and other Artifices, the wiſe Opificer hath fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd, even Brutes and Plants withal, <hi>to</hi> purchaſe and aſſimilate their Food, <hi>to</hi> defend or otherwiſe ſecure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from hoſtile things, and (to be ſhort) <hi>to</hi> maintain their Lives, and

But of theſe rare Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, Inſtincts, and other Methods, and, if I may ſo ſtyle ſome of them with Reverence, Stratagems and Fetches of Divine Skill, that God is pleas'd to employ in the conduct of the viſible World, eſpecially Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, I have already elſewhere pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely diſcours'd, and therefore ſhall now proceed, and obſerve, in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place, That, when we duly conſider the very differing ends, to which many of God's particular Works, eſpecially thoſe that are Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated,

And therefore if, being thus prepared, he ſhall be very credibly informed, That God hath actually been pleas'd to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57680:31"/>
Diſcover, by Supernatural Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (what, by Reaſon, without it, he can either not at all, or but roving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, gueſs at) what kind of Worſhip and Obedience will be moſt accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to him; and to encourage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Man to both theſe, by explicite Promiſes of that Felicity, that Man, without them, can but faintly hope for, he would be ready then thankfully to acknowledge, That this way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding beſeems the tranſcendent Goodneſs of God, without deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from his Majeſty and Wiſdom. And by theſe and the like Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, whereof ſome were formerly intimated, a Philoſopher, that takes notice of the wonderful Providence, that God deſcends to exerciſe for the welfare of Inferiour and Irrational Creatures, will have an advantage above Men not vers'd in the works and courſe of Nature, to believe, upon the Hiſtorical and other Proofs that Chriſtianity offers, That God has actually vouchſafed to Man, his nobleſt, and only rational viſible
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57680:32"/>
Creature, an explicite and poſitive Law, enforc'd by Threatning ſevere Penalties to the Stubborn Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors; and Promiſing, to the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Obeyers, Rewards ſuitable to his own Greatneſs and Goodneſs. And thus the Conſideration of God's Providence, in the conduct of things corporeal, may prove, to a well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd Contemplator, a Bridge, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he may paſs from Natural to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd Religion.</p>
                  <p>I have been the more particular and expreſs, in what I have ſaid about Divine Providence, becauſe I did not find other Writers had made it needleſs for me to do ſo: And I dwelt the longer upon the Exiſtence of the Deity, and the Immortality of the Soul, that I might let you ſee, That I did not ſpeak Groundleſly or Raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but that I had conſider'd what I ſaid, when I aſſerted, That the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental Philoſophy might afford <hi>a well diſpos'd Mind</hi> conſiderable Helps to Natural Religion. I find my ſelf therefore now at Liberty to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57680:32"/>
proceed to farther Conſiderations, and repreſent to you, That</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <hi>V.</hi> Another thing, that diſpoſes an Experimentarian Philoſopher to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace Religion, is, That his <hi>Genius</hi> and Courſe of Studies accuſtoms him to value and delight in abſtracted Truths; by which Term, I here mean ſuch Truths, as do not at all, or do but very little, gratifie Mens Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Senſuality, or other Inferiour Paſſions and Appetites. For, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Generality of thoſe that are averſe from Religion are enclin'd to be ſo, upon This account, (among Others) That they have a Contempt or Undervaluation of all Truths, that do not gratifie their Paſſions or Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts; He that is addicted to Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Experimental, is accuſtom'd both to Perſue, Eſteem, and Reliſh many Truths, that do not delight his Senſes, or gratifie his Paſſions, or his Intereſts, but only entertain his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding with that Manly and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Satisfaction, that is naturally af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57680:33"/>
it by the attainment of Clear and Noble Truths, which are its ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine Objects and Delights. And tho' I grant, that the Diſcoveries made by the help of Phyſical or Mechanical Experiments, are not, for the moſt part, of Kin to Religion; yet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that ſome of them do manifeſtly conduce to Eſtabliſh or Illuſtrate Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Theology, which is that, (as, tho' noted already, deſerves to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated) which Reveal'd Religion, and conſequently that of Chriſtians, muſt be Founded on, or muſt Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: Beſides this, I ſay, we may ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue <hi>à fortiori,</hi> That he, that is accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to prize Truths of an Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior kind, becauſe they are Truths, will be much more diſpos'd to value Divine Truths, which are of a much higher and nobler Order, and of an Ineſtimable and Eternal Advantage.</p>
                  <p n="6">
                     <hi>VI.</hi> There is another thing, that is too pertinent to the main Scope of this Diſcourſe to be here pretermitted: and it is, That both the Temper of Mind, that makes a Man moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:57680:33"/>
to be a <hi>Virtuoſo,</hi> and the Way of Philoſophiſing, he chiefly employ's, conduce much to give him a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and yet well grounded and duly limited, Docility; which is a great Diſpoſition to the Entertainment of Reveal'd Religion. In the Vulgar and Superficial Philoſophy, wherein a Man is allowed to think, that he has done his part well enough, when he has aſcrib'd things to a Subſtantial Form, or to Nature, or to ſome Real Quality, whether Manifeſt or Occult, without proving that there are ſuch Cauſes, or intelligibly declaring, How they produce the <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> or Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects referr'd to them; in this Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, I ſay, 'tis eaſie for a Man to have a great Opinion of his own Knowledge, and be puft up by it. But a <hi>Virtuoſo,</hi> that cannot ſatisfie Himſelf, nor dares pretend to ſatisfie Others, till he can, by <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> that may be underſtood and prov'd, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare intelligibly the <hi>manner</hi> of the Operation of the Cauſes he aſſigns, will often find it ſo Difficult a Task
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57680:34"/>
to do ſo, that he will eaſily diſcern, that he needs further Information, and therefore ought to ſeek for it where 'tis the moſt likely to be had; and not only to Admit, but Welcome it, if he finds it. Beſides, the Litigious Philoſophy of the Schools ſeldom furniſhes its Diſciples with better than Dialectical or Probable Arguments, which are not proper, either fully to ſatisfie the Perſon that employs them, or leave his Adverſary without any Anſwer, Plauſible at leaſt, if not full as Probable as the Objection; upon which account, men that have more Wit than ſincere Love of Truth, will be able to diſpute ſpeciouſly enough, as long as they have a mind to do ſo. And as ſuch ſlippery Arguments are not able to Convince even Him that employs them, if he be a Man of Judgment; ſo, if he deals with a witty Adverſary, they will leave him able to Elude any Arguments of the like nature, with which he ſhall be preſs'd. And in effect we ſee, That in the Ariſtotelian Philoſophy there
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57680:34"/>
are divers Queſtions, ſuch as, <hi>whether</hi> the Elements retain their diſtinct Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in a mixt Body? <hi>whether</hi> the Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial Orbs are mov'd by Intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? to omit many others, which are as it were <hi>ſtated Queſtions;</hi> and as they have been diſputed from age to age, are like to continue Queſtions for many more, if that Philoſophy ſhall laſt ſo long. But a <hi>Virtuoſo,</hi> that is wont in his Reaſonings to attend to the Principles of Mathematicks, and ſound Philoſophy, and to the clear Teſtimonies of Senſe, or well verifi'd Experiments, acquires a Habit of diſcerning the Cogency of an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or way of Probation; and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily diſcerns, That Dialectical Subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and School Tricks, cannot ſhift off its force, but finds more Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in Embracing a Demonſtrated Truth, than in the vain Glory of Diſputing ſubtilly againſt it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>VII.</hi> Another thing that may diſpoſe a ſtudious Searcher of Truth, (not by Speculations only, but) by Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for Theology, is, that his
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57680:35"/>
Inquiſitiveneſs, and Courſe of Studies, makes him both Willing and Fit to ſearch out and diſcover Deep and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obvious Truths.</hi> I have with trouble obſerv'd, That the greater part of the Libertines we have among us, being Men of <hi>Pilate</hi>'s humor, (who, when he had ſcornfully ask'd <hi>what is truth?</hi> would not ſtay for an Anſwer) do, with great Faſtidiouſneſs, decline the Study of all Truths that require a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and Setled application of Mind. Theſe Men are, for the moſt part, a ſort of Superficial and Deſultory Wits, that go no further than the Out ſide of things, without penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting into the Receſſes of them; and being eaſily tir'd with contemplating <hi>one,</hi> paſs quickly to <hi>another;</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration whereof they, with the ſame Lightneſs, forſake. And upon this account, among others, it is, that this ſort of Men, tho' often much ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded by others, becauſe the Moſt are but Superficial, as well as They, do almoſt as ſeldom make good Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, as good Chriſtians. For
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57680:35"/>
tho' <hi>all</hi> the good Arguments, that may be brought to evince the Truth of Natural (and Reveal'd) Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, be not Abſtruſe; yet <hi>ſome of the chief</hi> ones, eſpecially thoſe that prove the Exiſtence and Special Providence of God, and the Souls Immortality, are, if not of a Metaphyſical, yet at leaſt of a Philoſophical, nature; and will ſcarce be clearly underſtood, and duely reliſh'd, but by a Perſon capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of, and ſomwhat accuſtom'd to, Attentive and Laſting Speculations, (as in another Paper has been more fully declar'd.) <note place="margin">About ſome Cauſes of Atheiſm.</note>But now, a Man addicted to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute Diſcoveries of Truths, not only by Serious Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, but by intricate and laborious Experiments, will not eaſily be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terr'd from effectually proſecuting his End, by the Troubleſomneſs or Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties that attend the clearing of thoſe Notions, and Matters of Fact, whereon Solid Arguments for Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, or Reveal'd, Religion, are found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; how remote ſoever thoſe Truths
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:57680:36"/>
may be from vulgar Apprehenſions. In ſhort, whereas a Superficial Wit, ſuch as is frequently found in Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins, and often helps to make them ſuch, may be compar'd to an <hi>ordinary Swimmer,</hi> who can reach but ſuch things as float upon the Water; an Experimental Philoſopher may be compar'd to a <hi>skilful Diver,</hi> that cannot only fetch thoſe things that lye upon the Surface of the Sea, but make his way to the very Bottom of it; and thence fetch up Pearls, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, and other precious things, that in thoſe Depths lye conceal'd from other men's Sight and Reach.</p>
                  <p>We have already ſeen, that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental Philoſophy is, in its own nature, friendly to <hi>Religion in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherefore I ſhall now add, That the Reverence I pay Experience, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially as it gives both Grounds and Hints to rational Notions and Concluſions, does not a little conduce to the Aſſent I give to the Truth of <hi>the Chriſtian Religion in particular.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:57680:36"/>This excellent Religion is recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to well diſpoſed Minds, by a greater Number of Prerogatives, and other Arguments, than it were proper for me to inſiſt on in this Diſcourſe: And yet my Deſign enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges me to conſider a few of them ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what particularly.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. And firſt, I ſhall obſerve, That, whereas the three grand Arguments, that conjointly evince the Truth of the Chriſtian Religion in general, are (at leaſt in my opinion) <hi>the</hi> Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the Doctrine, which makes it worthy to have proceeded from God; <hi>the</hi> Teſtimony of the Divine Miracles, that were wrought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend it; <hi>the</hi> great Effects, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd in the World by it. Two of theſe three Arguments (for the firſt is of a more Speculative nature) are bottom'd upon <hi>matters of fact,</hi> and conſequently are likely to be the moſt prevalent upon thoſe that have a great Veneration for Experience, <hi>and are duly diſpos'd to frame ſuch pious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, as it warrants and leads them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
                     <pb n="52" facs="tcp:57680:37"/>
                     <hi>to make.</hi> This laſt Clauſe I add, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, <hi>though</hi> I have formerly more than Intimated ſomthing of the like Import, <hi>yet</hi> 'tis ſo neceſſary to my Deſign that you ſhould take ſpecial notice of it, that I muſt not here o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to advertiſe you, That, when, in this Diſcourſe, I ſpeak of an Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Philoſopher, or Virtuoſo; I do not mean, either, on this hand, a Libertine, tho' Ingenious; or a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſualiſt, though Curious; or, on that hand, a mere Empirick, or ſome vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Chymiſt, that looks upon nothing as Experimental, wherein Chymiſtry, Mechanicks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are not employ'd; and who too often makes Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, without making Reflection on them, as having it more in his aim to Produce Effects, than to Diſcover Truths. But the Perſon I here mean, is ſuch a one, as by attentively look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about him, gathers Experience, not from his own Tryals alone, but from divers other <hi>matters of fact,</hi> which he heedfully obſerves, though he had no ſhare in the effecting them; and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:57680:37"/>
on which he is diſpos'd to make ſuch Reflections, as may (unforcedly) be apply'd to confirm and encreaſe in him the Sentiments of <hi>Natural Religion,</hi> and facilitate his Submiſſion and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence to the <hi>Chriſtian Religion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>An Experimental Philoſopher, thus diſpos'd, will, with the Divine Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, (which he will be careful to Implore) find pregnant Motives to the Belief of Chriſtianity, in the two laſt of the three Arguments of its Truth, that I lately propos'd. That which is drawn from the Effects of this Religion in the World, as it is laſt nam'd, ſo I ſhall defer the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of it, till I have treated of the other; namely the Teſtimony of Divine Miracles, whoſe Difficulty makes it requiſite for us to conſider it the more Attentively, and diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declare the Grounds, upon which Experience may be eſteemed a good Topick on the preſent occaſion. For the clearing of this matter, I ſhall repreſent to you, That the word <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience</hi> may admit of divers Senſes,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:57680:38"/>
whereof one is far more comprehenſive than another; and likewiſe of ſeveral Diviſions and Diſtributions. For, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides its more reſtrained acceptation, it is ſomtimes ſet in contra-diſtinction to <hi>Reaſon,</hi> ſo as to comprehend, not only thoſe <hi>Phaenomena</hi> that Nature or Art exhibits to our Outward Senſes, but thoſe things that we perceive to paſs Within our ſelves; and all thoſe ways of Information, whereby we attain any Knowledge that we do not owe to abſtracted <hi>Reaſon.</hi> So that, without ſtretching the Word to the utmoſt Extent of which 'tis capable, and to which it has been enlarg'd; it may be look'd upon as ſo compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive a Term, that I think it may be of ſome importance to my preſent deſign, and perhaps to Theology it ſelf, to propoſe to you a Diſtribution of Experience, that will not, I hope, be found uſeleſs to clear the Extent of that Term. I ſhall then take the freedom to enlarge the Signification of the Word beyond its commoneſt Limits, and divide it, for diſtinctions
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:57680:38"/>
ſake, into <hi>Immediate</hi> and <hi>Vicarious</hi> Experience; or rather ſomwhat leſs Compendiouſly, but perhaps more Commodiouſly, into <hi>Perſonal, Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical,</hi> and <hi>Supernatural,</hi> (which may be alſo ſtyl'd <hi>Theological:</hi>) referring the Firſt of the three Members of this diſtribution to <hi>Immediate Experience,</hi> and the two others, to <hi>Vicarious.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I call that <hi>Perſonal Experience,</hi> which a Man acquires immediately by himſelf, and accrews to him by his own Senſations, or the exerciſe of his Faculties, without the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of any external Teſtimony. 'Tis by this Experience that we know, that the Sun is bright; Fire, hot; Snow, cold, and white; that upon the want of Aliments we feel Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; that we <hi>hope</hi> for future Goods; that we <hi>love</hi> what we judge <hi>good,</hi> and <hi>hate</hi> what we think <hi>evil;</hi> and diſcern that there is a great Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a Triangle and a Circle, and can diſtinguiſh them by it.</p>
                  <p>By <hi>Hiſtorical Experience,</hi> I mean that, which tho' it were perſonal in

ſome Other man, is but by his Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Teſtimony, whether imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately or mediately, conveyed to us.

                  <p>By <hi>Theological Experience,</hi> I mean that, by which we know what, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing there is ſome Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, God is pleas'd to relate or declare concerning Himſelf, his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, his Actions, his Will, or his Purpoſes; whether <hi>immediately,</hi> (or without the Intervention of Man) as he ſomtimes did to <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>Moſes,</hi> and Conſtantly to Chriſt our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour: Or by the <hi>Intervention</hi> of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, Prophets, Apoſtles, or Inſpir'd Perſons; as he did to the Iſraelites, and the Primitive Chriſtian Church; and does ſtill to us, by thoſe written Teſtimonies we call the <hi>Scriptures.</hi>

                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:57680:39"/>By <hi>Perſonal Experience,</hi> we know that there are Stars in Heaven; by <hi>Hiſtorical</hi> Experience, we know that there was a new Star ſeen by <hi>Tycho</hi> and other Aſtronomers, in <hi>Caſſiopaea,</hi> in the Year 1572. and by <hi>Theologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Experience we know, that the Stars were made on the Fourth Day of the Creation.</p>
                  <p>By this you may ſee, That I do not in this Diſcourſe take <hi>Experience</hi> in the ſtricteſt ſenſe of all, but in a greater latitude, for the knowledge we have of any matter of Fact, which, without owing it to Ratiocination, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we acquire by the Immediate Teſtimony of our Own Senſes and other Faculties, or accrews to us by the Communicated Teſtimony of Others. And I make the leſs ſcruple to take this Liberty, becauſe I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that, even in common Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, the word <hi>Experience</hi> is not always meant of that which is <hi>Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate,</hi> but is often taken in a latitude. As when we ſay, that Experience teaches <hi>us,</hi> who perhaps were never
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57680:40"/>
out of <hi>England,</hi> that the Torrid Zone is Habitable, and Inhabited; and perſuades learned men, that never had opportunity to make nice Coele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial Obſervations, that Stars may be Generated and Periſh, or at leaſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to Appear, and then Diſappear, in the Coeleſtial Region of the World. And on this kind of Hiſtorical Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, conſiſting of the Perſonal Obſervations of <hi>Hippocrates, Galen,</hi> and other Phyſicians, tranſmitted to us, a great part of the Practice of Phyſick is founded. And the moſt Rational Phyſicians reckon upon, as matters of fact, not only what other Phyſicians have left upon Record, but divers Preſent things, which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves can know but by the Relation of their Patients; as, that a Man has a particular Antipathy to ſuch a thing, which the Doctor perhaps judges fit for him to uſe; or that a Woman with Child longs for this or that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate thing. And Phyſicians re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce theſe and the like matters of fact to <hi>Experience,</hi> as to one of the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57680:40"/>
two Columns of Phyſick, diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from <hi>Reaſon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Since then Learned Men, as well as common Uſe, confine not the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the word <hi>Experience</hi> to that which is <hi>Perſonal,</hi> but employ it in a far greater latitude; I ſee not, why that, which I call <hi>Theological Experience,</hi> may not be admitted; ſince the Revelations that God makes concerning what he has Done, or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes to Do, are but Teſtimonies of things, moſt of them matters of Fact, and all of them ſuch, as, ſo far forth as they are merely Revelations, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be known by Reaſoning, but by Teſtimony: Whoſe being Divine, and relating to Theological Subjects, does not alter its Nature, tho it give it a peculiar and ſupereminent Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
                  <p>Having premis'd and clear'd the propos'd Diſtribution of <hi>Experience,</hi> it will now be ſeaſonable to conſider, how it may be apply'd to the Matters of Fact, that recommend the Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the Chriſtian Religion; and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:57680:41"/>
on this occaſion, I ſhall diſtinctly offer you my Thoughts, in the two follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Propoſitions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Prop. I.</label>
                     <hi>We ought to believe divers things upon the information of Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, (whether Immediate, or Vica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious) which, without that informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we ſhould judge unfit to be believ'd; or antecedently to it, did actually judge contrary to Reaſon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Propoſition may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, either of Perſons, or of Things, and will hold true, as to both.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>firſt,</hi> as to <hi>Perſons;</hi> if your own Obſervation of what occurs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Mankind do not ſatisfy you, that we are oblig'd, after ſufficient Tryal, frequently to alter the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, which upon probable Reaſons we had before entertain'd, of the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, or Prudence, or Juſtice, or Chaſtity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of this or that Perſon; I ſhall refer you to the Records of Hiſtory, or appeal to the Tribunals of Judges. For both in the one, and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57680:41"/>
at the other, you will find but too many Inſtances and Proofs from mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Fact, that Perſons look'd on, even by Intelligent Men, as Honeſt, Virtuous, and perhaps Holy too, have prov'd guilty of Falſeneſs to their Friends, Perfidiouſneſs to their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Diſloyalty to their Husbands or Wives, Injuſtice to their Neighbours, Sacrilege, Perjury, or other Impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to their God: And in the Courts of Juſtice, you will find a great part of the Time employ'd to Detect and Puniſh, <hi>not only</hi> Civil Tranſgreſſions, as Thefts, Cheats, Forgery, Falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſs, Adultery, and the like hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Crimes, perpetrated by thoſe, that, before they were throughly ſifted, paſs'd for Honeſt; <hi>but</hi> you will find Sins againſt Nature, ſuch as So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domy, and other unnatural Luſts, the Murders of Parents by their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and Innocent Children by their Parents, nay, Self-murder too; tho' this be a Crime, which cannot be acted without a violation of what ſeems the moſt Univerſal and Radicated Law of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:57680:42"/>
Nature, (and is acknowledg'd ſo by wicked Men) <hi>Self-preſervation.</hi> But it will not be neceſſary more ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſly to prove, that we ought, upon the Teſtimony of Experience, to change the Opinions we thought we had rationally taken up of Perſons; and therefore I ſhall now proceed to make good the Propoſition, in the Senſe I chiefly intended, which is, as it relates to <hi>Things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If Experience did not both Inform and Certify us, Who would believe, that a light black Powder ſhould be able, being duly manag'd, to throw down Stone-Walls, and blow up whole Caſtles and Rocks themſelves, and do thoſe other Stupendous things, that we ſee actually perform'd by <hi>Gun<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>powder,</hi> made uſe of in Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and in Mines? Who would think, that two or three grains of <hi>Opium,</hi> ſhould ſo ſtupify a large Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Body, as to force a Sleep, and oftentimes even without That, ſuſpend the ſharpeſt Torments, in the Cholick, Gout, and other the moſt painful
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:57680:42"/>
Diſeaſes, and that in Patients of quite different Ages, Sexes, and Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; in whom alſo the Diſeaſes are produc'd by Differing, or even by Contrary, Cauſes? Who would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that the Poyſon adhering to the Tooth of a Mad Dog, tho' per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſo little as to be ſcarce diſcerna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by Senſe, ſhould be able, after the ſlight Hurt is quite heal'd, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the warm, and ſtill perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, Body of the bitten perſon, not only for ſome Days or Months, but ſometimes for very many Years? And after, having lurk'd all that while, without giving any trouble to the Patient, ſhould on a ſudden pervert the whole Oeconomy of his Body, and put him into a Madneſs like that of the Dog that bit him, diſcovering it ſelf by that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as Admirable as Fatal, Symptom of <hi>Hydrophobia?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, beſides a multitude of Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that may be given of Truths, that, were it not for <hi>Experience,</hi> we ſhould refuſe to believe; becauſe the ſmall Strength of ſuch Agents, ſeems alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:57680:43"/>
diſproportionate to the Effects aſcrib'd to them: Many other Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces might be alleg'd, wherein we aſſent to Experience, even when its Informations ſeem contrary to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and that which, perhaps, we did actually and without ſcruple take to be True.</p>
                  <p>Since Gravity is the Principle, that determins Falling Bodies to move to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Center of the Earth; it ſeems very rational to believe, with the Generality of Philoſophers, that therein follow <hi>Ariſtotle;</hi> That, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as one Body is more heavy than another, ſo it ſhall fall to the ground faſter than the other. Whence it has been, eſpecially by ſome of the Peripatetick School, inferr'd, that of two Homogeneous Bodies, whereof one does, for Example, weigh ten pounds, and the other but one pound; The former being let fall from the ſame height, and at the ſame time, with the latter, will reach the ground ten times ſooner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="65" facs="tcp:57680:43"/>But notwithſtanding this plauſible Ratiocination, Experience ſhews us, (and I have purpoſely try'd it) that (at leaſt in moderate heights, ſuch as thoſe of our Towers, and other Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated Buildings) Bodies of very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal weight, let fall together, will reach the Ground at the ſame time; or ſo near it, that 'tis not eaſy to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any difference in the Velocity of their Deſcent.</p>
                  <p>'Tis generally taken for granted by Naturaliſts, as well as others, that Strong and Loud Noiſes, as they are heard much farther off than Fainter <hi>Sounds,</hi> ſo, if the Sonorous Bodies be equally diſtant from the Ear, the very Strong Sound will arrive much ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er at it, than the other; and yet by the Experiments of the Moderns about the Velocity of Sounds, (in making divers of which, I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to be accurate) it appears, that Weaker Sounds are (at leaſt as to Senſe) tranſmitted through the Air as ſwiftly as Stronger ones. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, 'tis often obſerv'd, that when
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:57680:44"/>
Cannons and Muskets are diſcharg'd together, the Noiſes of both arrive alſo together at the Ear; which would not be, if the Sound of a Cannon were any thing near as much Swifter, as 'tis Louder, than that of a Musket.</p>
                  <p>It ſeems irrational to conceive, that a Smaller and Weaker <hi>Loadſtone,</hi> may draw away a piece of Steel from a Larger and Stronger; and yet Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience (which both others and I have made) evinces, that in ſome caſes, this Paradox is a Truth.</p>
                  <p>It has generally, by Philoſophers as well as other Men, been look'd upon as manifeſt, and conſonant to Reaſon, that Cold condenſes Water more or leſs, according as the degree of the Cold is; and (conſequently) that <hi>Ice</hi> is Water reduc'd into a leſſer Volume. But 'tis plain, by Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments carefully made, (ſome of which I have elſewhere publiſh'd) that by Glaciation, Water is rather Expan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; or at leaſt, that Ice takes up more room, than the Water did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:57680:44"/>
it was Congeal'd. And of this ſort of Inſtances, where we believe, upon the Authority of Experience, things that are contrary to what we ſhould otherwiſe judge to be a Dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate or Concluſion of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; <note place="margin">An Eſſay of Improbable Truths.</note>I could add many, if I thought it as needful in this place, as in ſome other Papers, where I have given them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.</p>
                  <p>And now it will be ſeaſonable to put you in mind, that in one part of the Propoſition, hitherto diſcours'd of, it appears, That I deſign'd to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the force of the Arguments, grounded upon Experience, to that which is not Immediate, but Vica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious; that is, not perſonally <hi>our own,</hi> but <hi>communicated</hi> by others; provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it be competently Atteſted, and duly Convey'd to Us.</p>
                  <p>There will need but a little Reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on what is judg'd reaſonable, and freely practis'd, by Philoſophers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to Juſtify this Propoſition. For how many Concluſions have the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:57680:45"/>
Modern Naturaliſts admitted, tho' not only Abſtracted Reaſon never led Men to make them, but plauſible Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, and the Notions and Axioms of the moſt generally receiv'd Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, were repugnant to them. Thus, That in Heaven it ſelf there ſhould be Generations and Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, was not only Unobſerv'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the time of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> (who thence argues the Incorruptibility of Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial Bodies) but is Contradicted by his Arguments; and yet both many others, and I, have ſeen great Spots (perhaps bigger than <hi>England,</hi> or than <hi>Europe</hi> it ſelf) Generated and Diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated on or near the Surface of the Sun; and ſeveral of the Modern Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers and Aſtronomers, having never had the good fortune to ſee any of theſe, (which indeed of late years have but rarely appear'd) muſt take theſe <hi>Phaenomena</hi> upon the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of thoſe that have obſerv'd them. And much more muſt they do ſo, who, in ſpight of the Vulgar Philoſophy, which made all Comets Sublunary,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:57680:45"/>
believe, there were Coeleſtial, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps Firmamentary, Comets. For, that they were above the Concave of the Moon's Orb, we muſt believe upon the affirmation of thoſe that obſerv'd them, which very few have done themſelves. And the height of the famous Comet, or Diſappearing Star, in <hi>Caſſiopaea,</hi> in the Year 1572. whereon ſo much ſtreſs is laid by our Philoſophers and Mathematicians, is admitted and urg'd, chiefly upon the belief they have, not only of <hi>Tycho</hi>'s Veracity, but his Skill in obſerving the Motions and <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of that Coeleſtial Light, and particularly its having no <hi>Parallax.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In ſhort, the great Architect of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental Hiſtory, Sir <hi>Francis Bacon,</hi> when he divides it but into three parts, aſſigns the ſecond of them to what he calls <hi>Praeter-Generations;</hi> ſuch as Monſters, Prodigies, and other things; which being (as to Us) but Caſualties, all thoſe that happen'd in other Times and Places than we have liv'd in, (and thoſe will be confeſs'd
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:57680:46"/>
to be incomparably more than any of us has perſonally obſerv'd) we muſt take upon the Credit of others. And yet Theſe, (vicarious Experiments) by Suggeſting new Inſtances of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's Power, and uncommon ways of Working; and by Overthrowing, or Limiting, received Rules and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, afford us a conſiderable and inſtructive part of Natural Hiſtory, without which, it would not be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo Sound, or ſo Compleat.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Prop. II.</label> After what has been hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto diſcours'd, it may be, I hope, both ſeaſonable and warrantable to advance to, and aſſert, our Second Propoſition; <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>we ought to have a great and particular regard to thoſe things that are recommended to our Belief, by what we have reduc'd to Real, tho' Supernatural, Experience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For, 1. 'Tis manifeſt, that the moſt rational Men ſcruple not to believe, upon competent Teſtimony, many things, whoſe Truth did no way ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:57680:46"/>
to them by the conſideration of the nature of the Things themſelves; nay, tho' what is thus believ'd upon Teſtimony be ſo Strange, and, ſetting aſide that Teſtimony, would ſeem ſo Irrational, that antecedently to that Teſtimony, the things at laſt admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as Truths, were actually rejected as Errors, or judg'd altogether unfit to be Believ'd. And I muſt here deſire you to conſider, that the Points wherein Experience over-rules that, which, before it ſuperven'd, was judg'd to be moſt agreeable to Reaſon, concern things merely Natural or Civil, whereof Human Reaſon is held to be a proper Judge: Whereas many of the Points recommended by Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural Experience, concern things of a Superior Order; <hi>many</hi> of which are not to be Adaequately eſtimated by the ſame Rules with things merely Corporeal or Civil; and <hi>ſome</hi> of which, as the Eſſence and manner of Exiſtence, and ſome peculiar Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, of the Infinite God, involve or require ſuch a knowledge of what
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:57680:47"/>
is Infinite, as much paſſes the reach of our limited Intellects.</p>
                  <p>But this is not all. For, 2. You may conſider in the next place, that, whereas 'tis as Juſtly as Generally granted, that the better qualify'd a Witneſs is, in the capacity of a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the Stronger Aſſent his Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony deſerves; we ought of all the things that can be recommended to us by Teſtimony, to receive thoſe with the higheſt degree of Aſſent, that are taught us by God, by the interven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe Perſons, that appear to have been Commiſſion'd by Him to declare his Mind to Men. For the two grand Requiſites of a Witneſs, being the <hi>knowledge</hi> he has of the things he delivers, and his <hi>faithfulneſs</hi> in truly delivering what he knows; all Human Teſtimony muſt on theſe accounts be inferior to Divine Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony: Since this (later) is warranted both by the Veracity of God, (which is generally acknowledg'd by thoſe that believe his Exiſtence) and by his boundleſs Knowledge; which makes
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:57680:47"/>
it as impoſſible he ſhould be Deceiv'd himſelf, as the other does, that he ſhould Deceive us. And, becauſe that, for the delivery of the Divine Teſtimony we are ſpeaking of, it has oftentimes pleas'd God, who is a moſt Free, as well as a moſt Wiſe, Agent, to make uſe of Unpromiſing Perſons as his Inſtruments; I ſhall not on this occaſion altogether overlook this Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, That an Experimental Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher <hi>ſo</hi> often encreaſes his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Natural things, by what He learns from the Obſervations and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes, even of Mean, and perhaps of Illiterate, Perſons, (ſuch as Shepherds, Plowmen, Smiths, Fowlers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are converſant with the Works of Nature; <hi>that</hi> He is not only Willing to admit, but often Curious to ſeek for Informations from them, and therefore is not like to find much repugnancy in receiving the Doctrines of Reveal'd Religion, ſuch as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, if the Teachers of it were honeſt Men, and had opportunity to know the Truth of the Things they
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:57680:48"/>
deliver, tho' they were Fiſhermen, Tentmakers, or ſome other Mean Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</p>
                  <p>And indeed, (to enlarge a little upon a Subject that, I fear, has ſcarce been conſider'd) ſuch a perſon as our <hi>Virtuoſo,</hi> will, with both great Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs, and no leſs Advantage, Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe himſelf in peruſing, with great Attention, and much Regard, the Writings of the Apoſtles, Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, and Ancient Prophets; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding any Meanneſs of their Firſt Condition, or of their Secular Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments. And in theſe Sacred Writings, He will <hi>not only</hi> readily ſuffer himſelf to be inſtructed in theſe Grand and Catholick Articles of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which, becauſe of their Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity or very great Uſefulneſs, are to be met with in many places, and in variety of Expreſſions, by honeſt and duly diſpos'd Readers: <hi>But</hi> He will, in ſtead of Diſdaining ſuch Tutors, both Expect, and carefully Strive, to Improve his Knowledge of Divine Things in general, even by thoſe
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:57680:48"/>
Hints, and Incidental Paſſages, that a careleſs or ordinary Reader would Overlook, or not expect any thing from. For, <hi>as</hi> the Faecundity of the Scriptures is not wont to be enough diſcern'd, when the Sacred Writers tranſiently touch upon, or glance at, a great many Subjects, that they do not expreſly handle, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are not vulgarly taken notice of; <hi>ſo</hi> the Docility we have aſcrib'd to our <hi>Virtuoſo,</hi> will make him repoſe a great deal of Truſt in the Teſtimony of Inſpir'd Perſons, ſuch as Chriſt and his Apoſtles, about Things of all ſorts, either uſually taken notice of or not, that relate to Objects of a Supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Order; eſpecially if among theſe, God himſelf, and his Purpoſes, be compriz'd, ſince divers of thoſe things are <hi>not knowable without Revelation,</hi> and others are <hi>beſt known by it.</hi> And to be allow'd to ground a Belief about ſuch things, on the Relations and other Teſtimonies of thoſe that were in the Scripture-Phraſe,<note place="margin">Luke 1. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>Eye Witneſſes and Miniſters</hi> of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:57680:49"/>
the things they ſpeak of, will by our <hi>Virtuoſo</hi> be juſtly reputed ſuch an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, in order to the Knowledge of things Divine, as the conſulting with Navigators and Travellers to <hi>America,</hi> is, to him that is curious to learn the State of that New-world. For an ordinary Sea-man or Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, that had the opportunity with <hi>Columbus</hi> to ſail along the ſeveral Coaſts of it, and paſs up and down thorow the Country, was able at his return to Inform Men of an hundred things, that they ſhould never have learn'd by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Philoſophy, or <hi>Ptolomy</hi>'s Geography; and might not only Acquaint them with divers par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, conſonant to the Opinions which their formerly receiv'd Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicks and Coſmography did ſuggeſt, but alſo Rectify divers Erroneous Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions and Miſtakes, which till then they thought very agreeable to the Dictates of thoſe Sciences, and ſo to Reaſon. And, <hi>as</hi> one, that had a candid and knowing Friend inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate with <hi>Columbus,</hi> might better rely
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:57680:49"/>
on His Informations about many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of the Natural Hiſtory of thoſe Parts, than on thoſe of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred School-Philoſophers, that knew but what they learned from <hi>Ariſtotle, Pliny, Aelian,</hi> and the like ancient Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turaliſts; <hi>ſo,</hi> and much more, may we rely on the Accounts given us of Theological Things, by the Apoſtles, and conſtant Attendants of him that lay in the <note place="margin">John I. 18.</note>
                     <hi>Boſom of God his Father,</hi> and Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd them to declare to the World <note place="margin">Act. XX. 27.</note>
                     <hi>the Whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of God,</hi> as far as 'twas neceſſary for Man to know.</p>
                  <p>We know, that Fuller Try als are allow'd, among Ingenious Men, to rectify the Informations of the more Imperfect Ones; and therefore I ſhall add, that, tho' the Innate Notions and Sentiments, that Nature gives us of the Attributes and Mind of God, be highly to be priz'd; yet the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations that Theological Experience affords of thoſe Abſtruſe things, is far more Excellent and Compleat.

And we know, that in the Sea, there are ſome Abyſſes ſo deep, that the Seaman's Sounding-Lines have never been able to reach to the bottom of them; and where they are not Unfathomable, all we are wont to do by our Soundings, is, to fetch from the bottom ſome little Gravel, or Mud, or Shells, or ſome ſuch thing, that ſticks to the tallow'd end of the Plummet, and gives us but a very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect account of the Bottom, even of the Shallower Parts of the Sea: But if a Skilful Diver be employ'd, he will not only tell us, whether the Bottom be Muddy, Gravelly, or Sandy; but will be able to give us a kind of Topography of that Subma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine Land, and acquaint us with many Surprizing Particulars, that we ſhould never otherwiſe have Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd, or perchance ſo much as Dream'd of. And peradventure it may be no <hi>Hyperbole</hi> to ſay, that the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:57680:50"/>
Informations of a Plummet, which reaches not to Some Depths, and brings but a very ſlender account of Soils that lye in Any, are not more ſhort of thoſe of a Diver, than the Informations Philoſophy gives us of ſome Divine things, are of thoſe compleater Ones that may be had from the Holy Scriptures. And when I remember, how many Opinions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Submarine Parts, that I, among many other Men, thought Probable, I found cauſe to Change, upon the Converſation I had with a famous Diver, that ſometimes, by the help of an Engine, ſtay'd ſeveral hours at the bottom of the Sea; I find the leſs Reluctancy, to ſuffer Opinions about Divine Matters, that before ſeem'd probable to me, to be Rectifi'd by the fuller Diſcoveries made of thoſe things by the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>You may find ſome things apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Confirmation of what has been newly deliver'd, in an Eſſay, (which you may ſee when you pleaſe)
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:57680:51"/>
that conſiders the Bounds and Uſe of Experience in Natural Philoſophy. Wherefore remembring, that, before this late Excurſion, I was ſpeaking of Miracles, I ſhall now reſume the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and proceed to tell you, that I have the more inſiſted upon the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles that may be pleaded to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the Chriſtian Religion, becauſe I thought, that an Argument grounded on Them is little leſs than Abſolutely Neceſſary, to Evince, that any Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion that Men believe to be Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally Reveal'd, and conſequently that the Chriſtian, does really pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from God.</p>
                  <p>For, tho' the Excellency of the Chriſtian Doctrine, and other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current Motives, may juſtly perſuade me, that 'tis <hi>worthy</hi> and <hi>likely</hi> to be given by God; yet that <hi>de facto</hi> this Doctrine comes from Him by way of Supernatural Revelation, I can ſcarce be ſufficiently Aſcertained, but by the Miracles wrought by Chriſt and his Diſciples, to Evince, that the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine they Preach'd, as Commiſſion'd
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:57680:51"/>
by God to do ſo, was indeed His, being, as ſuch, own'd by Him. But theſe Miracles having been wrought (when 'twas moſt fit and needful they ſhould be wrought) in the firſt Ages of the Church; We, that live at ſo great a diſtance from them, can have no knowledge of them by our Own Senſes, or Immediate Obſervation; but muſt Believe them upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the formerly mention'd Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical or <hi>Vicarious Experience,</hi> which is afforded us by the duly tranſmitted Teſtimony of thoſe, that were them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves (to ſpeak once more in an Evangeliſt's phraſe)<note place="margin">Luke I. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>Eye-Witneſſes and Miniſters</hi> of the things they relate. And ſince we ſcruple not to believe ſuch ſtrange Prodigies, as Celeſtial Comets, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing and Reappearing Stars, Iſlands founded by Subterraneal Fires in the Sea, Darkenings of the Sun for many months together, Earthquakes reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing above a thouſand miles in length, and the like amazing Anomalies of Nature, upon the credit of Human
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:57680:52"/>
Hiſtories; I ſee not, why <hi>that</hi> Vica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Experience ſhould not more be truſted, which has divers peculiar and concurrent Circumſtances to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it, and particularly the Death that moſt of the firſt Promulgators chearfully Suffer'd to Atteſt the Truth of it, and the Succeſs and Spreading of the Doctrine authoriz'd by thoſe Miracles, and receiv'd chiefly upon their account. To which things, ſome perhaps would add, that 'tis leſs incredible, that the <hi>Author of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> ſhould, for moſt weighty pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, make ſtupendous Alterations of the courſe of Nature; than that <hi>Nature her ſelf,</hi> for no ſuch end, ſhould by ſuch Prodigies, as are newly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, as it were, throw her ſelf out of her own Courſe.</p>
                  <p>Miracles being ſo neceſſary to the eſtabliſhment of Reveal'd Religion in general, it may be look'd upon as a farther Diſpoſition in our <hi>Virtuoſo</hi> to receive the Chriſtian Religion, that the Philoſophy, he cultivates, does much conduce to enable him to judge
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:57680:52"/>
aright of thoſe ſtrange things, that are by many Propos'd as Miracles, and Believ'd to be ſo.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>firſt,</hi> the knowledge he has of the Various, and ſometimes very Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful, Operations of ſome Natural things, eſpecially when they are skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully improv'd, and dexterouſly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd by Art, particularly Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, Mechanicks, and Chymiſtry, will qualify him to diſtinguiſh, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween things that are only <hi>ſtrange</hi> and <hi>ſurprizing,</hi> and thoſe that are truly <hi>miraculous:</hi> So that he will not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the Effects of Natural Magick, for thoſe of a Divine Power. And by this well-inſtructed Warineſs, he will be able to diſcover the Subtil Cheats and Colluſions of Impoſtors; by which, not only Multitudes of all Religions, eſpecially Heathen, but even Learned Men of moſt Religions, for want of an inſight into real Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, have formerly been, or are at this day, deluded, and drawn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Idolatrous, Superſtitious, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Erroneous, Tenents or Practices.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="84" facs="tcp:57680:53"/>And <hi>on the other ſide,</hi> the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge our <hi>Virtuoſo</hi> may have of what <hi>cannot</hi> be juſtly expected or pretended from the Mechanical Powers of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, will enable him to diſcern, that divers things are not produceable by Them, without the intervention of an Intelligent Superior Power; on which ſcore he will frankly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and heartily believe, divers Effects to be truly Miraculous, that may be plauſibly enough aſcrib'd to other Cauſes in the Vulgar Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy; where Men are taught and wont to attribute Stupendous unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Effects to Sympathy, Antipathy, <hi>Fuga vacui,</hi> Subſtantial Forms, and eſpecially to a certain Being preſum'd to be almoſt Infinitely Potent and Wiſe, which they call <hi>Nature:</hi> For This is repreſented as a king of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs, whoſe Power may be little leſs than boundleſs; as I remember <hi>Galen</hi> himſelf compares it to that of God, and ſaith, that He could not do ſuch a thing, becauſe Nature cannot; and Cenſures <hi>Moſes</hi> for ſpeaking as if he
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:57680:53"/>
were of another Mind. The whole Paſſage is ſo weighty, that I thought fit to direct you to it in the Margent<note place="margin">Gal. de <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſu part. Lib. XI. Cap. XIV.</note>, tho', to comply with my haſt, I forbear to tranſcribe and deſcant upon ſo prolix a One, and add to it divers other Paſſages that I have met with in famous Authors; who, for want of knowing the true Extent of the Powers of Matter and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, left to themſelves in the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Courſe of things, Aſcribe to Natural Cauſes, as they call them, ſuch Effects as are beyond their reach, unleſs they be Elevated by Agents of a Superior Order.</p>
                  <p>I know it may be objected, that the hitherto-mention'd Diſpoſitions, that Experimental Knowledge may give a Man, to Admit the Hiſtories of the Miracles recorded in the Goſpel; and likewiſe to Expect, that God will be able to perform the Promiſes and Menaces that are in his name deliver'd there, may be countervail'd by this, That thoſe, who are ſo much acquainted
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:57680:54"/>
with the Myſteries of Nature, and her various and ſtrange ways of Working, as a <hi>Virtuoſo</hi> may well be, may by that Knowledge be ſtrongly tempted to think, that thoſe ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing things that other Men call Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, are but Effects of Her Power; the Extent of which, is not eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd by ordinary Men, nor ſafely defin'd by Philoſophers themſelves. But this Objection being plauſible enough, to make me think it deſerv'd to be ſeriouſly conſider'd, I took an occaſion that was once offer'd me, to examine the validity of it in a Paper by it ſelf: And this being at your command, I ſhall refer you to it. And I hope, that in the mean time it may ſuffice to ſay, That to make it reaſonable to judge this or that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Performance, a Supernatural One, it is not at all neceſſary, that it ſurpaſs the whole Power of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that is, of Phyſical Agents; provided, it ſurpaſs the power of that Cauſe, or that complex of Cauſes, from which, the Effect muſt in reaſon,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:57680:54"/>
if it be purely Natural or Phyſical, be ſuppos'd to have proceeded. As for inſtance, That a Fiſherman or two ſhould ſpeak other Languages than their own, does not at all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the power of Nature, if they employ'd a competent time in learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them. But that a great number of Fiſhermen, and other Illiterate Perſons, ſhould all on a ſudden be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Linguiſts, and in an hour's time be able to ſpeak intelligibly to a great number and variety of Nations in their reſpective Languages, as the New Teſtament relates, that the Apoſtles and their Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions did on the day of Pentecoſt<note place="margin">See Acts II.</note>: That gift of Tongues, I ſay, was an Ability, which in thoſe circumſtances of Place, Time, and Perſons, wherein 'twas exercis'd, may juſtly be concluded to have been Supernatural or Miraculous.</p>
                  <p>I fear you will think, I have dwelt too long upon the Argument for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, drawn from that ſort of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Fact we call Miracles; tho'
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:57680:55"/>
the uncommon way that my Deſign led me to repreſent them in, would not permit me to make it out in few words. Wherefore I ſhall now paſs on to another Argument, in favour of the ſame Religion, that is afforded by Experience, being drawn from the ſtrangely ſucceſsful Propagation, and the happy Effects of Chriſtianity, in the World. But having formerly had occaſion to diſplay this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in a ſeparate Paper, which you may command a Sight of, if I ſhall not have time to annex a Tranſcript of it to the later Sheets of this <hi>Firſt Part</hi> of the preſent Eſſay, I will refer you for more ample Proof to That Writing, and content my ſelf in this place briefly to touch ſome of the Heads, and ſubjoyn a Reflection or two that you will not meet with in that Paper.</p>
                  <p>'Tis a notorious Matter of Fact, that in leſs than half an Age, the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion was ſpread over a great part of the then known World; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch, that in a few Years after it
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:57680:55"/>
began to be preach'd, the Apoſtle of the Gentiles could tell the <hi>Romans</hi> with Joy, that <hi>their</hi> Faith (<hi>i. e.</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Goſpel) <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 8.</note>
                     <hi>was ſpoken of throughout the whole World.</hi> And in the Second Century, <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and other fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Writers, ſhew, that the Goſpel had already numerous Proſelytes, in a great number of different King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and Provinces. But I forbear to mention, what he and others have magnificently ſaid of the Succeſs of the Goſpel, becauſe I had rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer you to the plain Narratives made of it by <hi>Euſebius, Socrates Scholaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> and other grave Authors; being of opinion, that mere Hiſtorians may give to a Philoſophical Reader, a more Advantageous <hi>Idea</hi> of the Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of that excellent Doctrine, than eloquent Orators, as ſuch, can do. This wonderful quick progreſs of this Religion being aſcertain'd to our <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuoſo,</hi> by a Thing he is ſo much ſway'd by, as Experience; it does not a little diſpoſe him to Believe the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:57680:56"/>
Truth of ſo prevalent a Religion. For, <hi>If</hi> he conſiders the Perſons that firſt promulgated it, They were but half a ſcore of Illiterate Fiſhermen, and a few Tent-makers, &amp; other Tradeſmen. <hi>If</hi> he conſiders the Means that were employ'd to Propagate this Doctrine, he finds, that they had neither Arms, nor External Power, to Compel Men to receive it; nor Riches, Honours, or Preferments, to Bribe or Allure them to it; nor were they Men of Philoſophical Subtilty, to intrap or entangle the Minds of their Auditors. Nor did they make uſe of the pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous Ornaments of Rhetorick, and fetches of Oratory, to inveagle or entice Men; but treated of the moſt Sublime and abſtruſe Matters, in a moſt Plain and unaffected Style, as became Lovers and Teachers of Truth. <hi>If</hi> he conſiders the nature of the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, that in little time obtain'd ſo many Proſelytes, he will find, that, inſtead of being ſuited to the Natural Apprehenſions, or the Receiv'd Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, of Men; and inſtead of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:57680:56"/>
their corrupt Affections, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying with ſo much as their Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centeſt Intereſts; it preſcrib'd ſuch Mortifications, and ſuch great ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Life, and high degrees of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, as no Legiſlator had ever dar'd to impoſe upon his Subjects, nay, nor any Philoſopher on his Diſciples. And this Doctrine was propos'd in ſuch a way, and was accompany'd with Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of ſuch Hardſhips and Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, that ſhould in thoſe times be the portion of its ſincere Profeſſors, as if the Law-giver had deſign'd ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Fright Men from his Doctrine, than Allure them to it; ſince they could not believe what he ſaid, and foretold, to be true, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, that they ſhould be made great Sufferers by that Belief. <hi>If</hi> our <hi>Virtuoſo</hi> conſiders the Oppoſition made to the Progreſs of the Goſpel, he will find cauſe to wonder, that it could ever be ſurmounted. For the Heathens, which made by far the greateſt part of the World, were deeply engag'd in Polytheiſm, Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:57680:57"/>
Magical Rites and Superſtitions, and almoſt all kind of Crimes, and ſome of theſe were ſhameleſs De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baucheries, which oftentimes made a part of their Worſhip. And the Jews were by the corrupt Leaven of the Phariſees, and the impious Errors of the Sadduces, and the General Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes of the Nation about the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Office, and Kingdom, of the <hi>Meſſias;</hi> and by their dotage upon their vain Traditions, and numerous Superſtitions, grounded upon them: The Gentiles, I ſay, and the Jews, who were thoſe that were to be Converted, were, on theſe and other accounts, highly Indiſpos'd to be made Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes. Eſpecially when they could not own themſelves to be ſuch, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out expoſing their Perſons to be hated and deſpiſed, their Poſſeſſions to be confiſcated, their Bodies to be impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon'd and tormented, and oftentimes their Lives to be, in as Ignominious as Cruel ways, deſtroy'd. And whilſt the Secular Magiſtrates made them ſuffer all theſe Miſchiefs, the Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:57680:57"/>
Prieſts, the Subtil Philoſophers, and the Eloquent Orators, perſuaded the World; that they Deſerv'd yet more than they Endur'd; and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd all their Learning and Wit to make the Religion Odious and Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, as well as the Embracers of it Miſerable: Accuſing the Martyrs, and other Chriſtians, of no leſs than Atheiſm, Inceſt, and the inhuman ſhedding and drinking the innocent Blood of Infants. Theſe and the like Matters of Fact when our <hi>Virtuoſo</hi> reflects on, and conſiders by what un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>promiſing Means, (as far as they were but Secular) ſuch ſeemingly inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mountable Difficulties were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd; He cannot but by this Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Experience be inclin'd to think, that Effects, ſo diſproportionate to the Viſible Means, could not be brought to paſs without the peculiar Aſſiſtance and extraordinary Bleſſing of God: By whom thoſe ſucceſsful Preachers averr'd themſelves to be Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated. For, that the Supernatural help, the Chriſtian Doctrine appears
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:57680:58"/>
to have had, was Divine, not Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical, will ſeem evident to our <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuoſo,</hi> from the Nature, Tendency, and Effects, of the Doctrine it ſelf; which expreſly teacheth, <hi>that</hi> there is but one God; <hi>that</hi> He alone is to be Worſhipp'd, and not Idols, nor any of the Heathen <hi>Daemons</hi> or Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; <hi>that</hi> the Devils are Wicked, Apoſtate, Malicious, and Miſerable Creatures, that are Hated of God, and do extremely Hate Mankind; and <hi>that</hi> thoſe Vices, as well as Rites of Worſhip that they have eſtabliſh'd in the World, were Abominable to God, and would be by degrees De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd by him: As in effect they ſoon began to be in many places of the World, where the Worſhippers of Chriſt caſt the Devil out of His Temples, out of Mens Veneration, &amp; oftentimes out of their Bodies too.</p>
                  <p>One Circumſtance there is of the Propagation of the Goſpel, which, tho' it may ſeem more Extrinſecal than thoſe hitherto mention'd, is yet too conſiderable to be here pretermitted;
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:57680:58"/>
ſince it is this, That the Quick Spread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Succeſs of the Chriſtian Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine in the World, was Foretold both by the Prophets of the Old Teſtament, and the Author and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgators of the New. For it being notorious, that there have been divers Errors and Superſtitions, that have with too much Celerity been ſpread far and wide in the World; either by mere Accidents, (as they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted) that were very friendly to them, or by the Induſtry and Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Men: This, I ſay, being ſo, it ought to be no ſmall Satisfaction to Equitable Judges, that the Quick Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, and Notable Effects, of the Chriſtian Religion, were Foretold, partly by the Ancient Prophets, and partly by the <hi>Meſſias</hi> and his Apoſtles. For by theſe accompliſh'd Predictions it may appear, that the wonderful Succeſs of the Goſpel was not an Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Chance, but was long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore determin'd by Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as a Work ſit to be Dear to God, and to be accompliſh'd in a
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:57680:59"/>
wonderful way by his Peculiar Aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, (as will by and by be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more fully declar'd.) That the Triumphs of the Goſpel were Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told by ſeveral of the Old Prophets, may appear by their yet Extant Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings; ſome of which are alleg'd to that purpoſe, by thoſe Writers of the New Teſtament, that were endow'd with the ſame Prophetick Spirit. And if you pleaſe to conſider the Paſſages cited in the Margent, you will eaſily grant, that thoſe Ancient Inſpir'd Writers<note place="margin">

Nation, to the Chriſtian Doctrine; <hi>yet</hi> there are divers Paſſages in the New Teſtament, that are Real, tho' ſome of them Unheeded, Prophecies of the wonderful Progreſs of the Goſpel, and the large Extent of the Kingdom of the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> Thus Chriſt foretold, that his twelve Apoſtles ſhould be his Witneſſes, not only in <hi>Judaea</hi> and <hi>Samaria,</hi> but to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt parts of the Earth.

To which may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that ten or twelve Fiſhermen (called the <hi>Apoſtles</hi>) were ſent to Convert all Nations to the Worſhip of a Crucify'd Perſon; which would have been a ſtrange Commiſſion to be given ſuch Men at that time, if their Maſter, who ſent them, had not Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen the Succeſs, as well as Known the Truth, of the Doctrine he ſent them to Preach. The quick Diffuſion of the Chriſtian Faith, and the ſwift Growth of the Chriſtian Church from deſpicable Beginnings, to a Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs very Diſproportionate to them, are more than intimated, by what Chriſt ſays of the Leaven hid in a great quantity of Meal; and of the Muſtard Seed that quickly grows (in the hot and fertile Country of <hi>Judaea</hi>) to a wonderful Bigneſs and Height; ſince theſe Paſſages, that perfunctory Readers look on but as mere Parables, were really Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, that quickly began to be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly Fulfill'd. And it may bring no
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:57680:60"/>
ſmall Authority to the Predictions of the New Teſtament, that when di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of them were made, there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd no Likelihood that they ſhould ever be made good. When a Poor Virgin, that was betroth'd to a Carpenter, confidently pronounces, that <hi>all Ages ſhould call her Bleſſed;</hi> what probability was there, that what ſhe ſaid, ſhould ever come to paſs? <note place="margin">Mat. 26. 13.</note>And when another Private Woman, then living in a Village, had it foretold her, that a cenſur'd Action of hers ſhould be reported through the whole World, to her great Praiſe; what ſober Man, that were not a Prophet, would venture to loſe his Credit, by making ſuch a Promiſe? And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſince we ſee ſuch unlikely Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions actually Accompliſh'd, it may well convince an unbyaſs'd Man, that the Authors of them, as well as the ancient <hi>Seers,</hi> were really endow'd with a truly Prophetick Spirit; and that the Events by That Foretold,

were not Effects of Chance or Policy, but of Divine Providence.</p>
                  <p>I thought it not improper, to make the mention of theſe <hi>Predictions</hi> follow ſo cloſe the Diſcourſe of the Miracles, becauſe true Prophecies of Unlikely Events, fulfill'd by Unlikely Means, are <hi>ſupernatural</hi> Things; and, as ſuch, (eſpecially their Author and Deſign conſider'd) may properly enough be reckon'd among <hi>Miracles.</hi> And I may add, that theſe have a peculiar advantage above moſt other Miracles, on the ſcore of their Duration: Since the manifeſt Proofs of the Predictions continue ſtill, and are as viſible as the Extent of the Chriſtian Religion; and ſome of them are ſtill more and more accompliſh'd, by the Converſions made of multitudes of Infidels, in ſeveral vaſt Regions of <hi>America,</hi> (to name no other Countries.) So that if we may call ſome Miracles <hi>tranſient</hi> ones, ſuch as the Turning Water into Wine at a Wedding-feaſt in <hi>Galilee;</hi> and the Darkening of the Sun, when the Moon was Full, at the Crucifixion
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:57680:61"/>
of Chriſt: Accompliſh'd Predictions may be ſtyl'd <hi>permanent</hi> ones; and their difference may be ſet forth by the differing States of the Moſaick <hi>Manna:</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Exod. XVI. 14, 21, 26, 33.</note>For, tho' both that which fell daily (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept on the Sabbath) in the Wilderneſs, and that which was laid up in a pot before the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, were Supernatural Producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; yet, whereas a portion of the Former outlaſted not two or three days, That kept in the pot was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd many Ages, and continu'd to be (as it was foretold it ſhould) a Viſible Miracle.</p>
                  <p>There is another Reaſon, why the wonderful Propagation of the Goſpel ſhould be annex'd to the Argument drawn from Miracles, in favour of the Chriſtian Religion. For the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of it, both Pretended and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal'd to Miracles, as Proofs of the Truth of their Doctrine: And if we conſider the great Diſadvantages they lay under, and the powerful Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all ſorts that they met with
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:57680:62"/>
and ſurmounted; it cannot reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be thought, that ſuch Unlikely Men ſhould ſo Succesfully preach ſo Uninviting a Doctrine, unleſs it were confirm'd by Conſpicuous Miracles. Or at leaſt, if ſo uneaſy and perſecuted a Religion was propagated without Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, that Propagation it ſelf (as one of the Fathers well obſerves) may juſtly paſs for a Miracle; and be no leſs fit than another, to Confirm the Religion ſo admirably Propagated.</p>
                  <p>The paſt Diſcourſe has, I hope, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted, that a <hi>Virtuoſo</hi> has ſome Helps, that other Men, generally ſpeaking, have not, to make him judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly approve the Arguments for the Truth of the Chriſtian Religion, that are grounded on the Miracles wrought in its favour, and the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Succeſs of it in the World. But, becauſe a Reveal'd Religion, how true ſoever it be, can ſcarce be prov'd but by Moral Demonſtrations; and becauſe for this reaſon, it is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſufficient, that the Arguments be good in their kind, but there are
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:57680:62"/>
ſome Qualifications requir'd in the Minds of them that are to be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd by them; I ſhall now add, that Experimental Philoſophy does alſo Diſpoſe the Minds of its Cultivaters to receive due Impreſſions from ſuch Proofs, as Miracles do, as well as other Topicks, afford the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
                  <p>Another thing then that qualifies an Experimentarian for the reception of a Reveal'd <hi>Religion,</hi> and ſo of Chriſtianity, is, that an Accuſtomance of endeavouring to give Clear Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Nature, and diſcover the weakneſs of thoſe Solutions that Superficial Wits are wont to make and acquieſce in, does inſenſibly work in him a great and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous <hi>Modeſty</hi> of Mind. And on the ſcore of this <hi>Intellectual,</hi> as well as <hi>Moral,</hi> Virtue, not only he will be very inclinable, both to Deſire and Admit further Information, about things which he perceives to be Dark or Abſtruſe; but he will be very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apt to take, for the adaequate Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:57680:63"/>
of Truth, a thing ſo Imperfectly inform'd, and Narrowly limited, as his mere or abſtracted Reaſon; (as I think I have elſewhere intimated, that One may call That, which is furniſh'd only with its own, either Congenite, or very eaſily and very early Acquir'd, Notions and <hi>Idaea's,</hi> and with Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Notices.) And <hi>tho</hi>' a vulgar Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher, that allows himſelf to refer the Obſcureſt things in Nature to Subſtantial Forms, Real Qualities, Sympathy, Antipathy, and ſome few other Terms, which, to be employ'd by him, Need not, and perhaps for their darkneſs Cannot, be clearly Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood; and by which he pretends to explain all things in Nature; and may indeed explicate one thing as well as another: <hi>Tho</hi>' (I ſay) ſuch a Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tular Philoſopher may preſume, that he underſtands every thing; and may be eaſily tempted to think, <hi>that</hi> he muſt not hope, nor deſire to learn from leſs able Men than his firſt Teachers; and <hi>that,</hi> That cannot be <hi>true,</hi> or be <hi>done,</hi> which agrees not with his <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy;</hi>
                     <pb n="105" facs="tcp:57680:63"/>
                     <hi>yet</hi> a Sober and Experienc'd Naturaliſt, that knows what Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties remain, yet unſurmounted, in the preſumedly clear Conception and Explications even of things Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real, will not, by a lazy or arrogant preſumption, that his knowledge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout things Supernatural is already ſufficient, be induc'd to Reject, or to Neglect, any Information that may encreaſe it.</p>
                  <p>And this frame of Mind is a very happy one, for a Student in Reveal'd Theology, where Cautiouſneſs is not more Neceſſary for the avoiding of Errors, than Docility is Advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for the Learning of Truth: Since the knowledge and goodneſs of the Divine Teacher is ſuch, that a Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, to improve his Intellect, needs but bring a Mind fitted to receive the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine Informations, that are moſt liberally offer'd, (in the Scripture) and will never deceive Him, that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys, together with ſervent Prayers, a due Care not to miſtake the Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="106" facs="tcp:57680:64"/>An aſſiduous Converſation with the exquiſitely Fram'd, and admirably Manag'd, Works of God, brings a Skilful Conſiderer of them to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver from time to time, <hi>ſo</hi> many things to be Feazable, or to be True, which, whilſt he argu'd but upon grounds of incompetently Inform'd Reaſon, he judg'd Falſe or Unpracticable; <hi>that</hi> little by little he acquires a Habit of receiving ſome ſorts of Opinions, and eſpecially thoſe that ſeem unfriendly to Religion, but as Probationers, with a diſpoſition to Reform or Diſcard them upon further Information. And This, <hi>as</hi> he is reſolv'd to Submit to, in caſe he meets with it, <hi>ſo</hi> he is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to Receive, if not to Expect it, by having often found himſelf oblig'd, upon ſubſequent Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to mend or lay aſide his former Opinions, tho' very agreeable to the beſt Light he had to judge by, when he entertain'd them. As, tho' it ſeems a viſible Truth, that the <hi>Diſcus</hi> of <hi>Venus</hi> is, in all reſpects to the Sun, totally Luminous; yet when the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſcope
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:57680:64"/>
diſcovers her to have her Full and her Wane, like the Moon, he will believe this further Obſervation, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the firſt made with his Naked Eyes.</p>
                  <p>And indeed, I have ſometimes doubted, whether to be vers'd in Mathematicks, and other Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive parts of Philoſophy, bring a greater advantage to the Mind, by Accuſtoming and Aſſiſting it to Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine Strictly Things propos'd for Truths, and to Evince Strongly the Truths a Man knows, to Others; than by Fitting him to Diſcern the force of a good Argument, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit willingly to Truths clearly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd, how little ſoever he may have expected to find ſuch Concluſions true. 'Twill not be difficult to apply theſe Reflections to our preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; ſince there are ſeveral paſſages in the Scripture that ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, both <hi>that</hi> Multitudes perſiſt in a Criminal Infidelity, out of an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weaning Conceit of their own Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and a readineſs to be ſway'd
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:57680:65"/>
rather by ſtrong Prejudices, than by the ſtrongeſt Arguments that would remove them; and, <hi>that</hi> Docility is a very happy diſpoſition to the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of Reveal'd Religion: In reference to which, this Qualification will be the more eaſily found in our <hi>Virtuoſo;</hi> becauſe, whereas the things, about which he has been accuſtom'd to be ſenſible of his Ignorance, or deſire further Inſtruction, are within the Sphere of Nature, and the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of Philoſophy; many of the things that Reveal'd Religion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, (ſuch as are the Decrees, the Purpoſes, the Promiſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of God, and his moſt peculiar manner of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſting and Operating) are things ſo Sublime and Abſtruſe, that they may well be look'd upon as of an higher Order than merely Phyſical Ones, and cannot be Satisfactorily reach'd by the mere Light of Nature. 'Tis true, that our Philoſopher, becauſe he is ſo, will examine more ſtrictly, than Ordinary Men are Wont or Able to do, the Proofs brought for this or that
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:57680:65"/>
propos'd Revelation. But that is no diſadvantage to a Supernatural Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, ſuch as the Chriſtian; if it be, as we now ſuppoſe it to be, <hi>True;</hi> and the real Truth about Religion it ſelf, does not require Credulity, but only Docility. And perhaps this matter may be illuſtrated, by comparing what happens to a Philoſopher in the Examen of Opinions, and to a Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt in that of Metals. For if a Piece of Coin, that Men would have paſs for true Gold, be offer'd to an Ordinary Man, and to a Skilful Refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; <hi>tho</hi>' the later will examine it more ſtrictly, and not acquieſce in the Stamp, the Colour, the Sound, and other Obvious Marks, that may ſatisfy a Shopkeeper, or a Merchant; <hi>yet</hi> when he has try'd it by the Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer ways of Examining, ſuch as the Touchſtone, the Cupel, <hi>Aqua-fortis, &amp;c.</hi> and finds it to hold good in thoſe Proofs, he will readily and frankly acknowledge, that 'tis true Gold, and will be more thorowly Convinc'd of it, than the other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:57680:66"/>
whoſe want of Skill will make him ſtill apt to retain a Diſtruſt, and render him indeed more eaſy to be Perſuaded, but more difficult to be fully Satisfy'd. On the like account; <hi>tho</hi>' our <hi>Virtuoſo</hi> will examine with more Strictneſs and Skill, than Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Men are able, Miracles, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, or other Proofs, ſaid to be Supernatural, that are alledg'd to Evince a Reveal'd Religion; <hi>yet</hi> if the certain and genuine Characters of Truth appear in it, He will be more thorowly Convinc'd of it than a leſs Skilful Man, whoſe want of good <hi>Criteria,</hi> (or Touchſtones) and Sound Judgment, will incline him to be Diffident, and to be ſtill afraid of having been Impos'd on.</p>
                  <p>I expect, in the mean time, that you ſhould here Object againſt what has been ſaid in the later Leaves of the paſt Diſcourſe, that it hath <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded</hi> the Human Intellect, by aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing ſo much to Experience, Natural or Supernatural, that it has left nothing for Reaſon to do, unleſs ſervilely to Obey.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="111" facs="tcp:57680:66"/>But, tho' this Objection be plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, yet the Anſwer to it will not be very difficult, if the Matter it ſelf be duly conſider'd, and Reaſon be brought to act, even on this occaſion, not as an Intereſſed Party, but an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byaſs'd Judge.</p>
                  <p>For we have already ſhewn, that Rational Philoſophers ſcruple not to Alter or Renounce the Opinions, that Specious Reaſons had Suggeſted to them, when once they either find thoſe Opinions Contradicted by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, or meet with other Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions more Conformable to Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. And <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf, <hi>tho</hi>' he be accus'd to have, perhaps the firſt of all the Ancient Naturaliſts, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted <hi>Phyſicks,</hi> by wreſting them to a compliance with Logical and Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſical Fancies; <hi>yet</hi> even He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes, not only that in the Science of Nature, Reaſon ought to comport with the <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> and the <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena</hi> with <hi>Reaſon;</hi> but that to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to plauſible Ratiocinations, with the neglect of Senſible Obſervations,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:57680:67"/>
is a Weakneſs, or Diſeaſe, (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) of Mind. I will not here mention what I ſay in another Paper, by way of attempt to ſettle the Bounds of Reaſon and Experience, in reference to Natural Philoſophy; but it may concern our preſent Argument, to imploy a few Lines in this place, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the further clearing the lately propos'd Objection. We may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve then, that, whether or no it be True, which is taught by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and commonly receiv'd in the Schools, that the Underſtanding is like Blank Paper; and that it receives no Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but what has been convey'd to it through the Senſes: Whether, I ſay, this be or be not admitted, 'tis plain, that the Notions which are either Congenite with the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, or ſo eaſily and early Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd by it, that divers Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers think them Innate, are but very few, in compariſon of thoſe that are requiſite to Judge aright, about any one of a multitude of things, that occur, either in Natural
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:57680:67"/>
Philoſophy, or Theology. For in the Divine Nature, Power, Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and other Attributes, there is a Faecundity that has produc'd a World of Contrivances, Laws, and other things, that exceedingly ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs both the Number and Variety, that the dim and limited Intellect of Man could reach to, by framing and compounding <hi>Idaea's,</hi> without the aſſiſtance of the Patterns, afforded by the Works and Declarations of God.</p>
                  <p>On the account of the ſame Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative of the Divine Knowledge, it muſt frequently happen, that the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Opinions, Men take up, of the Works and Mind of God, upon the mere Suggeſtions of the Abſtracted Reaſon, (if I may ſo call it) newly ſpoken of, muſt not only be almoſt always very <hi>deficient,</hi> but will be oftentimes very <hi>erroneous.</hi> Of which, we ſee evident proofs in many of the Opinions of the Old Philoſophers, who, tho' Men of ſtrong Natural parts, were miſled by what they miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:57680:68"/>
for Reaſon, to maintain ſuch things about the Works and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of Nature, as We, who, by the favour of Experience and Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſtand in a much clearer Light, know to be Falſe, and often juſtly think utterly Extravagant.</p>
                  <p>The Importance of the Subject lately ſpoken of, and its being too little Conſider'd, may make it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to be Inculcated; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall ſubjoyn on this occaſion, that That which I have lately call'd <hi>Abſtracted Reaſon,</hi> is but a narrow Thing, and reaches but to a very ſmall ſhare of the Multitude of Things knowable, whether Human or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, that may be obtain'd by the help of further Experience, and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural Revelation. This Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, furniſh'd with no other Notices than it can ſupply it ſelf with, is ſo narrow and deceitful a Thing, that He that ſeeks for Knowledge only within Himſelf, ſhall be ſure to be quite Ignorant of far the greateſt part of Things, and will ſcarce eſcape
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:57680:68"/>
being Miſtaken about a good part of Thoſe he thinks he knows.</p>
                  <p>But, notwithſtanding what has been hitherto ſaid, I am far from intending to deny Reaſon any of its juſt Prerogatives. For I ſhew in another Paper, that Experience is but an Aſſiſtant to Reaſon, ſince it doth indeed ſupply Informations to the Underſtanding; but the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing remains ſtill the Judge, and has the Power or Right, to Examine and make uſe of the Teſtimonies that are preſented to it. The Outward Senſes are but the Inſtruments of the Soul, which Hears by the intervention of the Ear, and in reſpect of which, the Eye it ſelf is but a more Immediate Optical Tube; and the Senſe does but Perceive Objects, not Judge of them. Nor do the more wary among the Philoſophers, truſt their Eye, to Teach them the Nature of the viſible Object; but only employ it to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> it exhibits, and the Changes that happen to its ſelf by the action of it. And whereas 'tis
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:57680:69"/>
confeſs'd, that the Senſories may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us, if the Requiſites of Senſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be wanting; as when a Square Tower appears Round at a great diſtance, and a Straight Stick half in the Water, appears Crooked, becauſe of the double <hi>Medium;</hi> 'tis the part of Reaſon, not Senſe, to Judge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther none of the Requiſites of Senſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be wanting; which (give me leave to add) oftentimes requires, not only Reaſon, but Philoſophy; and then alſo 'tis the part of Reaſon to Judge, what Concluſions may, and what cannot, be ſafely grounded on the Informations of the Senſes, and the Teſtimony of Experience. So that when 'tis ſaid, that Experience Corrects Reaſon, 'tis ſomewhat an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper way of Speaking; ſince 'tis Reaſon it ſelf, that, upon the Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Experience, Corrects the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhe had made before.</p>
                  <p>And this (borrow'd from the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd Paper, becauſe 'twas never Publiſh'd) prompts me to illuſtrate the Uſe of Reaſon, by comparing her
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:57680:69"/>
to an able Judge, who comes to Hear and Decide Cauſes in a ſtrange Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. For the General Notions he brings with him, and the Dictates of Juſtice and Equity, can give him but a very ſhort and imperfect Knowledge of many things, that are requiſite to frame a right Judgment, about the Caſes that are firſt brought before him; and before he has heard the Witneſſes, he may be very apt to fall into Prejudicate Opinions of things, (whether Perſons or Cauſes.) But when an Authentick and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Teſtimony has clear'd Things to him, he then pronounces, according to the Light of Reaſon, he is Maſter of; to which, the Witneſſes did but give Information, tho' That ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Information may have oblig'd him, to lay aſide ſome Prejudicate Opinions he had entertain'd before he receiv'd it. And what is ſaid of <hi>Natural Experience,</hi> in reference to the Underſtanding, may, with due alteration, be apply'd to <hi>Supernatural Revelation:</hi> For here alſo the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:57680:70"/>
is to Examine, whether the Teſtimony be indeed Divine; and, whether a Divine Teſtimony ought to be (as It will eaſily perceive it ſhould) Believ'd, in what it clearly Teaches; to omit other Uſes of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, (about Theological Matters) which belong not to this place; where it may ſuffice to have ſhewn, that Reaſon is not Degraded from the Dignity that belongs to her, of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving and Judging; tho' ſhe be Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by her own Dictates, to take in all the Aſſiſtance ſhe can, from Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, whether Natural, or Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural; and by the fuller Accounts of things ſhe receives from thoſe Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, to Rectify, if need be, her former and leſs mature Judgments.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, Thoſe that cry up Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted Reaſon, as if it were Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient, exalt it in <hi>Words;</hi> but we that Addreſs Reaſon to Phyſical and Theological Experience, and direct it how to Conſult them, and take its Informations from them, exalt it <hi>in Effect;</hi> and Reaſon is much leſs uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:57680:70"/>
ſerv'd, by the former ſort of Men, than by the later; ſince whilſt <hi>thoſe</hi> do but <hi>flatter</hi> it, <hi>theſe</hi> take the right way to <hi>improve</hi> it.</p>
                  <p>I hope you will not imagine, that I have, in the foregoing part of this Letter, ſaid all that I could ſay perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently. For, being mindful of the Brevity becoming an Epiſtolary Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, I omitted ſeveral Arguments, that would have challeng'd their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in a juſt Treatiſe; and have but Touch'd upon moſt of thoſe I have mention'd; tho' Reaſonings of this kind are uſually like Tapeſtry, which loſes much by being look'd on whilſt the Hangings are Folded up, which ſhould be diſplay'd to their full Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions.</p>
                  <p>But having offer'd you <hi>ſome</hi> things, which perhaps you have not met with elſewhere; and having, tho' but tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiently, <hi>touch'd</hi> upon the Grounds of divers other conſiderable Arguments; I hope that your Learning and Saga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, will both Supply what you will diſcern to have been Omitted, and

Enforce what has been but Intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and then I ſhall not deſpair, that what I have ſaid may ſuffice to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade you, that <hi>Experimental Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy</hi> may greatly Aſſiſt a well-diſpos'd Mind, to yield an Hearty and Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Aſſent to the Principles of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.

                  <p>AFter the Author had begun the <hi>Second Part</hi> of his <hi>Chriſtian Virtuoſo,</hi> and made ſome Progreſs in it, which he deſigned to continue till he had Compleated it; he was obliged to leave the Country, where he enjoyed ſome Leiſure, and to remove to <hi>London;</hi> where Sickneſs, and Buſineſs, and a Multitude of Viſits he could not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void receiving, did ſo diſtract him, that theſe Remora's, added to the Fertility of the Subjects that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained to be Treated of, which he found much greater than he was at firſt aware of, made him lay aſide the Materials he had prepared for the <hi>Second Part,</hi> to a fitter Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, and comply with the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
<pb facs="tcp:57680:73"/>
he had, to publiſh ſome Tracts that required more haſte. And 'tis for the like Reaſons, that having at preſent ſome other Eſſays of a quite differing Nature in the Preſs, he is obliged to postpone his reſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming and finiſhing the <hi>Second Part</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian Virtuoſo</hi> (which will require more Sheets than the former) for ſome longer time; thô yet to Comply with the Solicitations of the Printer, he conſents both to let the <hi>Firſt Part</hi> come abroad, and (to make the Book of a more decent ſize) add to it, by way of Subſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, a Diſcourſe that is of Affinity enough to the other, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of ſome of the Points it han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, and more upon that of its Scope; and that will not be Ill received, if it have the good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to find the Publick as kind to it, as Private Peruſers have been.</p>

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p n="1">1. I Can neither admire nor blame the Curioſity you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, to receive ſome Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction about the important Diſtinction that is made uſe of, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of ſome Myſteries of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion; namely, that <hi>they are indeed above Reaſon, but not againſt Reaſon.</hi> For though divers Learned Men have, eſpecially of late, employed it; yet I perceive you and your Friends <hi>N. N.</hi> think, that they have not done it ſo clearly, as <hi>both</hi> to prevent the Exceptions of Infidels, or render them more groundleſs; <hi>and</hi> at leaſt, to obviate the Surmiſes of thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who have been perſuaded to look upon this Diſtinction, but as a fine Evaſion, whereby to elude ſome Objections that cannot otherwiſe be
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57680:74"/>
anſwered. And indeed, as far as I can diſcern by the Authors wherein I have met with it, (for I pretend not to judge of any others,) there are <hi>divers</hi> that employ this Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, <hi>few</hi> that have attempted to explain it, (and that I fear, not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently) and <hi>none</hi> that has taken care to juſtifie it.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. In order to the removal of the Difficulties that you take notice of, I ſhall endeavour to do theſe Two things: 1. To declare in what ſenſe I think our Diſtinction is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. And, 2. To prove that it is not an Arbitrary or Illuſory Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but grounded upon the Nature of Things.</p>
                  <p>Though I do not deſire to impoſe my Sentiments on any Man, much leſs on You; yet becauſe I, as well as others, have had ſome occaſions to make uſe of the Diſtinction we are conſidering; I think myſelf obliged, before I go any further, to acquaint you in what ſenſe I underſtand it.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:57680:74"/>III. By ſuch things then in Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, as may be ſaid to be <hi>above Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> I conceive ſuch Notions and Propoſitions, as mere Reaſon, that is, Reaſon unaſſiſted by ſupernatural Revelation, would never have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd to us: Whether thoſe things be to our finite Capacities, clearly comprehenſible or not. And by things <hi>contrary to Reaſon,</hi> I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand ſuch Conceptions and Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, as are not only undiſcovera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by mere Reaſon, but alſo, when we underſtand them, do evidently and truly appear to be repugnant to ſome Principle, or to ſome Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, of Right Reaſon.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. To illuſtrate this Matter a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, I ſhall propound to you a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon drawn from that Senſe, which is allow'd to have the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Cognation with the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which I preſume you will rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily gueſs to be the Sight. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe then, that on a deep Sea, a Diver ſhould bid you tell him, What you can ſee there; That which you
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57680:75"/>
would anſwer, would be, that you can ſee into a Sea-green Liquor, to the depth of ſome Yards, and no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: So that if he ſhould farther ask you, Whether you ſee what lies at the Bottom of the Sea, you would return him a Negative Anſwer. If afterwards the Diver letting himſelf down to the Bottom, ſhould thence bring up and ſhew you Oyſters or Muſcles with Pearls in them; you would eaſily acknowledge, both that they lay beyond the reach of your Sight, and conſequently argued an Imperfection in it; thô but ſuch an Imperfection, as is not Perſonal but Common to you with other Men, and that the Pearls have the genuin Colour and Luſtre, that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally belongs to ſuch Gems. But if this Diver ſhould pretend, that each of theſe Pearls he ſhews you, is as large as a Tennis-Ball, or ſome of them bigger than the Shells they were inclos'd in, and that they are not round but cubical, and their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour not White or Orient, but Black
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57680:75"/>
or Scarlet; you would doubtleſs judge what he aſſerts, to be not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (or not ſo properly,) undiſcernable by your Eyes, but contrary to the Informations of them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would deny what he affirms. Becauſe, that to admit it, would not only argue your Sight to be Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, but Falſe and Deluſory; thô the Organ be rightly qualified, and duly applied to its proper Objects.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. This Illuſtration may give you ſome ſuperficial Notion of the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt a thing's being <hi>above Reaſon,</hi> and its being <hi>contrary to it.</hi> But this may better appear, if we conſider the Matter more diſtinctly. And to offer ſomething in order to this, I ſhall beg leave to ſay, that, in my Opinion, the things that may be ſaid to be <hi>above Reaſon,</hi> are not all of One ſort, but may be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd into Two kinds, differing enough from each other.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. For it ſeems to me, that there are ſome Things, that Reaſon by its own Light cannot <hi>Diſcover;</hi> and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57680:76"/>
others, that, when propos'd, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>Comprehend.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">VII. And Firſt, there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Truths in the Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that Reaſon left to itſelf, would never have been able to find out, nor perhaps to have ſo much as dream'd of: Such as are moſt of Thoſe that depend upon the Free Will and Ordination of God, as, That the World was made in ſix Days, That Chriſt ſhould be Born of a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, and That in his Perſon there ſhould be united Two ſuch infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtant Natures as the Divine and Human; and That the Bodies of Good Men ſhall be rais'd from Death, and ſo advantageouſly chang'd, that the Glorified Perſons ſhall be like, or equal to, the Angels.</p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. Of this kind of Theological Truths, you will eaſily believe, that 'twere not difficult for me to offer divers other Inſtances; and indeed there are many Truths, and more I think than we are wont to imagine, that we want <hi>Mediums,</hi> or Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57680:76"/>
to diſcover, thô, if they were duly propos'd, they would be intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible to us: As, for my part, when by looking on the Starry Heaven, firſt with my naked Eyes, and then with Teleſcopes of differing Lengths, I did not only diſcry more and more Stars, according to the Goodneſs of the Inſtruments I imployed, but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd great Inducements to think, that there are in thoſe ineſtimably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Regions, many Celeſtial Lights, that only the Want of more reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Teleſcopes conceal from our Sight.</p>
                  <p n="9">IX. And thus much I preſume you will cloſe with the more eaſily, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it diſagrees not with the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of ſome few (for I dare ſay not, many) Orthodox Divines. But I muſt take leave to add, that beſides theſe myſterious Truths, that are too remote, and hidden, to be <hi>Detected</hi> by Human <hi>Reaſon;</hi> there is another ſort of Things, that may be ſaid to be <hi>above Reaſon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:57680:77"/>X. For there are divers Truths de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by Revelation, (contained in the Holy Scriptures,) that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly would never have been found out by mere natural Reaſon; but are ſo abſtruſe, that when they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed as clearly, as proper and unambiguous Expreſſions can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them in; they do nevertheleſs ſurpaſs our dim and bounded Reaſon, on one or other of thoſe Three ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts that are mentioned in a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue <hi>about things tranſcending Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;</hi> namely <hi>either,</hi> as not clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>conceivable</hi> by our Underſtanding, ſuch as the Infiniteneſs and Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Divine Nature; <hi>or inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable</hi> by us, ſuch as the Manner, how God can create a rational Soul; or how, this being an immaterial Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, it can act upon a Human Body, and be acted on by it; (which Inſtance I rather choſe, than the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of Matter, becauſe it may be more eaſily proved) <hi>or elſe aſymme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trical,</hi> or unſociable; that is, ſuch, as we ſee not how to reconcile with
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57680:77"/>
other Things, which alſo manifeſtly are, or are by us acknowledged to be, true; ſuch as are the Divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of future Contingents, and the Liberty that belongs to Man's Will, at leaſt in divers Caſes.</p>
                  <p n="11">XI. It will not perhaps be impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to obſerve, on this occaſion, that, as of Things that are ſaid to be above Reaſon, there are more kinds than one; ſo there may be a Difference in the Degrees, or, at leaſt, the Diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nableneſs, of their Abſtruſeneſs.</p>
                  <p n="12">XII. For <hi>ſome things</hi> appear to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, or diſtreſs, our Underſtandings, almoſt as ſoon as they are propos'd, at leaſt, before they are attentively look'd into. As, what is ſaid to be Infinite, either in Extent or Number. But there are <hi>other things,</hi> the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions whereof, as they firſt ariſe from the things conſidered in groſs, and as it were indefinitely, are ſuch, as do not choque or perplex our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings; and are ſo far intelligible, that they may be uſefully employ'd in ordinary Diſcourſe. But when we
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57680:78"/>
come to make a deep Inſpection into theſe, and proſecute to the uttermoſt the ſucceſſive Inferences that may be drawn from them; we reaſon our ſelves into Inextricable Difficulties, if not flat Repugnancies too. And to ſhew you, that I do not ſay this <hi>gratis;</hi> be pleas'd to conſider with me, that, we uſually diſcourſe of <hi>Place,</hi> of <hi>Time,</hi> and of <hi>Motion;</hi> and have certain general indeterminate Conceptions, of each of theſe; by the help of which, we underſtand one another, when we ſpeak of them; Thô, if we will look thorowly into them, and attentively conſider all the Difficulties, that may be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd by ſuch an Inſpection; we ſhall find our Reaſon oppreſs'd by the Number and Greatneſs of the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, into which we ſhall argue ourſelves; or, at leaſt, may be argued by others; thô theſe Men, who do make ſuch ſhrewd Objections againſt the Hypotheſis, we embrace, will hardly be able themſelves to pitch on any, that will not allow us to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57680:78"/>
repay them in the ſame coin.</p>
                  <p n="13">XIII. What has been newly ſaid, may, I hope, aſſiſt us to clear a Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, or Scruple, (about the Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction we treat of,) which ſince it ſprung up in my own Mind, may very probably occur alſo to your Thoughts; namely, That if any Theological Propoſition be granted to ſurpaſs our Reaſon; we cannot pretend to believe it, without diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, that we do not ſufficiently conſider what we ſay: Since we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to exerciſe an act of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, in embracing ſomewhat that we do not underſtand, nor have a Notion of.</p>
                  <p n="14">XIV. But on this occaſion we may juſtly have recourſe to a Diſtinction, like That I have lately intimated. For, in divers caſes, the Notions, Men have of ſome Things, may be diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent enough, ſince the one is more obvious and ſuperficial, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more Philoſophical or accurat. And of theſe Two differing kinds of Conceptions, I have already offer'd
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57680:79"/>
ſome Inſtances in the very differing Notions, Men have of Place and Time: Which, thô familiar Objects, I elſewhere ſhew to be each of them of ſo abſtruſe a Nature, that I do not wonder to find <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf complaining of the Difficulty that there is to give a clear, and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptionable, Notion of <hi>Place;</hi> nor to find ſo acute a Wit as <hi>St. Auſtin,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuouſly confeſſing his Diſability to explicate the Nature of <hi>Time.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="15">XV. And what is ſaid of the great Intricacies, that incumber a deep Scrutiny into theſe familiar Objects of Diſcourſe, will hold, as to the Diviſibility of Quantity; as to Local Motion; and as to ſome other Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary things; whoſe Abſtruſeneſs is not inferior in Degree, thô differing as to the Kinds of things, wherein it conſiſts.</p>
                  <p n="16">XVI. By ſuch Inſtances as theſe, it may appear, that without talking as Parrots, (as your Friends would inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, that thoſe that uſe our Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions muſt do;) or as irrational
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57680:79"/>
Men; we may ſpeak of ſome Things that we acknowledge to be on ſome account or other above our Reaſon; ſince the Notions we may have of thoſe Things, however dim and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, may yet be of uſe, and may be in ſome meaſure intelligible, thô the Things they relate to, may, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other reſpect, be ſaid to tranſcend our Underſtanding; becauſe an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive Conſiderer may perceive, that ſomething belongs to them, that is not clearly comprehenſible, or does otherwiſe ſurpaſs our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon (at leaſt in our preſent State.)</p>
                  <p n="17">XVII. Having diſpatch'd the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, that requir'd this Digreſſion: I ſhall now ſtep again into the Way, and proceed in it by telling you, that any <hi>one</hi> appoſite Inſtance may ſuffice to clear the former part of the Expreſſion that is imploy'd, when 'tis ſaid that a Myſtery, or other Article of Faith, is <hi>above</hi> Reaſon, but not <hi>contrary</hi> to it: For if there be ſo much as <hi>one</hi> Truth, which is acknowledg'd to be ſuch, and yet
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57680:80"/>
not to be clearly and diſtinctly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible, it cannot juſtly be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, that to make uſe of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction we are treating of, is to ſay ſomething, that is not intelligible, or is abſurd. And it will further juſtify the Expreſſion quarrelled at, if we can make it appear, that it is neither Impertinent or Arbitrary, but groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on the Nature of Things. And this I ſhall endeavour to do, by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that though I admit Two ſorts of Things, which may be ſaid to be <hi>above</hi> Reaſon, yet there is no neceſſity, that either of them muſt (always) be <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to</hi> Reaſon.</p>
                  <p n="18">XVIII. As for the firſt ſort of Things ſaid to ſurpaſs Reaſon, I ſee not, but that Men may <hi>be unable,</hi> without the Aſſiſtance of a more knowing Inſtructer, to diſcover ſome Truths; and yet <hi>be able,</hi> when Theſe are revealed or diſcovered to them by that Inſtructer, both to underſtand the diſcloſed Propoſitions by their own Rational Faculty, and approve them for True, and fit to be embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57680:80"/>
The Intellect of Man being ſuch a bounded Faculty as it is, and naturally furniſhed with no greater a ſtock or ſhare of Knowledge, than it is able by its own Endeavours to give itſelf, or acquire; 'twould be a great Unhappineſs to Mankind, if we were obliged to reject, as repugnant to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, whatever we cannot diſcover by our own natural Light; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, to deny our ſelves the great Benefits we may receive from the Communications of any higher and more diſcerning Intellect. An In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to my preſent purpoſe may be found among Rational Souls them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, though univerſally granted to be all of the ſame Nature. For, thô a Perſon but ſuperficially acquainted (for Example) with Geometry, would never have diſcovered by his own Light, that <hi>the Diameter of a Square is incommenſurable to the Side;</hi> yet when a skilful Mathematician dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouſly declares, and by a Series of Demonſtrations proves, that noble Theorem; the Diſciple by his now
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57680:81"/>
inſtructed Reaſon will be able, both to underſtand it, and to aſſent to it: Inſomuch, that <hi>Plato</hi> ſaid, that <hi>he was rather a Beaſt than a Man that would deny it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="19">XIX. Other Inſtances may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to exemplify the Truth newly mentioned. And indeed, there is not ſo much as a ſtrong Preſumption, that a Propoſition or Notion is therefore repugnant to Reaſon, becauſe it is not diſcoverable by It; ſince it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together extrinſecal and accidental to the Truth or Falſity of a Propoſition, that we never heard of It before; or that we could never have found It out by our own Endeavours; but muſt have had the Knowledge of It imparted to us by another. But then this Diſability to find out a thing by our own <hi>Search,</hi> doth not hinder us from being able by our own <hi>Reaſon,</hi> both to underſtand it when duly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and to diſcern it to be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Dictates of right Reaſon. To induce you to aſſent to the later part of this Obſervation, I ſhall add,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57680:81"/>
that theſe Intellectual Aſſiſtances may oftentimes not only <hi>enlighten,</hi> but <hi>gratify,</hi> the Mind, by giving it ſuch Informations, as both <hi>agree with</hi> its former maimed or imperfect No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices, and <hi>compleat</hi> them. When, for example, an antique Medal, half con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed with Ruſt, is ſhewed to an unskilful Perſon, though a Scholar; he will not by his own Endeavours be able to read the whole Inſcription, whereof we ſuppoſe ſome parts to be obliterated by Time or Ruſt; or to diſcover the Meaning of it. But when a knowing Medaliſt becomes his Inſtructer, he may then know ſome (much defaced) Letters, that were illegible to him before, and both underſtand the Senſe of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, and approve it as genuine and ſuitable to the Things, whereto it ought to be congruous. And becauſe divers Philoſophical Wits are apt, as well as you, to be ſtartled at the name of <hi>Myſtery,</hi> and ſuſpect, that becauſe it implies ſomething ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſe, there lyes hid ſome Illuſion
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57680:82"/>
under that obſcure Term: I ſhall ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to add, that agreeably to our Doctrine we may obſerve, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers things that relate to the Old Teſtament, are in the New called Myſteries, becauſe they were <hi>ſo</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Moſaick Diſpenſation; thô they ceaſe to be <hi>ſo,</hi> now that the Apoſtles have explained them to the World. As the calling of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles into the Church of God, is by their Apoſtle called a <hi>Myſtery;</hi> becauſe, to uſe his Phraſe, it <note place="margin">Coloſſ. I. 26. Eph. III. 3, 5, 6.</note>
                     <hi>had been hid from Ages and Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:</hi> Though he adds, <hi>But now 'tis made manifeſt to his Saints.</hi> And the ſame Writer tells the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that he <note place="margin">1 Corinth. XV. v. 51, 52.</note>
                     <hi>ſhows them a Myſtery,</hi> which he immediately explains, by foretelling, that <hi>all</hi> pious Believers ſhall not dye, becauſe that <hi>thoſe that ſhall be found alive at the coming of Chriſt, ſhall not ſleep, but be changed;</hi> as the other <hi>Dead ſhall be raiſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible.</hi> Which ſurpriſing Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57680:82"/>
though becauſe it could not be diſcovered by the Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor of the Writings of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> he calls a Myſtery; yet it is no more ſo to us, now that he hath ſo expreſly foretold it, and therefore declared it.</p>
                  <p n="20">XX. Other Inſtances I content myſelf to point at in the Margin, that I may paſs on to confirm the Obſervation I formerly intimated;<note place="margin">See <hi>Mat. XIII.</hi> 11. <hi>Epheſ. V.</hi> 31.</note> that divers things which the Scripture teaches beyond what was known, or (in probability) are diſcoverable by natural Light, are ſo far from being <hi>againſt Reaſon,</hi> by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (in the ſenſe declared) <hi>above it;</hi> that theſe Diſcoveries ought much to recommend the Scripture to a ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Mind; becauſe they do not only Agree with the doubtful or imperfect Notions we already had of things, but Improve them, if not Compleat them. Nay, I ſhall venture to add, that theſe Intellectual Aids may not ſeldom help us to diſcern, That ſome

Things, which not only <hi>are</hi> above Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but at firſt ſight <hi>ſeem to be</hi> againſt it; are really reconcileable to Reaſon, improved by the new Helps, afforded it by Revelation. To illuſtrate this by a Philoſophical Inſtance, when <hi>Gallileo</hi> firſt made his Diſcoveries with the Teleſcope, and ſaid, That there were Planets that moved about <hi>Jupiter;</hi> He ſaid ſomething, that other Aſtronomers could not diſcern to be True, but nothing that they could prove to be Falſe. And even when ſome Revelations are thought not only to <hi>tranſcend Reaſon,</hi> but to <hi>claſh with it;</hi> it is to be conſidered, Whether ſuch Doctrins are really re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to any abſolute Catholick Rule of Reaſon, or only to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, which ſo far depends upon the Meaſure of acquired Information we then enjoy, that, though we judge it to be Irrational, yet we are not ſure, that the Thing, this Judgment is grounded on, is clearly and fully enough known to us. As, to reſume the former Example, when <hi>Gallileo,</hi>
                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:57680:83"/>
or ſome of his Diſciples, affirmed <hi>Venus</hi> to be ſometimes Horned like the Moon; thô this Aſſertion were repugnant to the unanimous Doctrine of Aſtronomers, who thought their Opinion very well grounded, on no leſs a Teſtimony than That of their own Eyes; yet in effect the Proof was incompetent, becauſe their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſiſted Eyes could not afford them ſufficient Information about this caſe. And ſo, when <hi>Gallileo</hi> ſpoke of Hills and Valleys, and Shadows, in the Moon, they were not ſtraight to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject what he taught, but to have, if not a kind of implicit Faith, yet a great Diſpoſition to believe what he delivered, as upon his own Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, about the Figure and Number of the Planets. For they knew, that he had, and had already ſucceſsfully made uſe of, a Way of diſcovering Coeleſtial Objects, that they were not Maſters of; nor therefore competent Judges of all the Things, though they might well be of many, that he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to be diſcoverable by it. And
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57680:84"/>
though they could not ſee in the Moon what he obſerved, (Valleys, Mountains, and the Shadows of theſe) yet they might juſtly ſuſpect, that the Difference of the <hi>Idea</hi> that they framed of that Planet, and that which he propoſed, might well proceed from the Imperfection of their unaided Sight; eſpecially conſidering, that what he ſaid, of the differing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of what is there analogous to Sea and Land, did rather Correct and Improve, than abſolutely Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, their former Notices. For he allowed the Spots they ſaw, to be darker Parts of the Moon, and gave Cauſes of that Darkneſs; which their bare Eyes could not have led them to any ſuch Knowledge of. And the Non-appearance of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous Parts of the Moon in that form to the naked Eye, might well be imputed to the great Diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them and us, ſince at a far leſs Diſtance ſquare Towers appear round, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:57680:84"/>XXI. It now remains, that I ſay ſomething, that may both make ſome Application of the Form of Speech hitherto diſcourſed of, and afford a Confirmation of the Grounds where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I think, it may be juſtified. This I am the rather induced to do, becauſe I expect it will be objected, that he that acknowledges, that the Thing he would have us believe, tranſcends our Reaſon, has a Mind to deceive us, and procures for himſelf a fair opportunity to delude us, by employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Arbitrary Diſtinction, which he may apply as he pleaſes.</p>
                  <p n="22">XXII. But to ſpeak firſt a word or two to this laſt Clauſe; I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that ſuch a Diſtinction is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable enough of being miſapplied: And I am apt to think, that, by ſome School-Divines, and others, it has been ſo. But, ſince there are other Diſtinctions that are generally and juſtly received by Learned Men, and even by Philoſophers themſelves, without having any Immunity from being capable to be perverted; I
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57680:85"/>
know not, why the Diſtinction, we are conſidering, ſhould not be treated as favourably as they. And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the Queſtion at preſent is not, <hi>whether</hi> our Diſtinction may poſſibly be miſapplied by raſh or impoſing Men; but <hi>whether</hi> it be grounded on the Nature of Things. To come then to the Thing it ſelf, I conſider, that for an Opinion to be <hi>above Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> in the ſenſe formerly aſſigned, is ſomewhat, that (as was noted in reference to the firſt ſort of Things, that ſurpaſs it) is Extrinſecal and Accidental to its being True or Falſe. For to be <hi>above our Reaſon,</hi> is not an Abſolute thing, but a Reſpective one, importing a Relation to the Meaſure of Knowledge, that belongs to the Human Underſtanding, ſuch as 'tis ſaid to tranſcend: And therefore it may not be <hi>above Reaſon,</hi> in reference to a more enlightned Intellect; ſuch as <hi>in probability</hi> may be found in Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Beings of an higher Order, ſuch as are the Angels; and, without per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure, is to be found in God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:57680:85"/>
Whom, when we conceive to be a Being Infinitely perfect, we muſt aſcribe to him a perfect Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and boundleſs Knowledge. This being ſuppoſed, it ought not to be denied, that a Superior Intellect may both comprehend ſeveral Things that we cannot; and diſcern ſuch of them to be congruous to the fixt and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Idea's</hi> of Truth, and conſequently agreeable to one another, as dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſighted Mortals are apt to ſuſpect, or to think, to be ſeparately Falſe; or, when collated, Inconſiſtent with one another. But to lanch into this Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, would lead me farther than I have time to go. And therefore I ſhall content my ſelf to offer you one Argument, to prove, That of Things that may be ſaid to be <hi>above Reaſon,</hi> in the Senſe formerly explained, it is no way impoſſible, that even ſuch an one ſhould be true, as is obnoxious to Objections not directly anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. For I conſider, that of Things <hi>above Reaſon,</hi> there may be ſome which are really <hi>contradictory</hi> to one
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57680:86"/>
another, and yet each of them is maintainable by ſuch Arguments, as very Learned and Subtle Men do both Acquieſce in, and Enforce, by loading the Embracers of the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite Opinion, with Objections they cannot directly anſwer.</p>
                  <p n="23">XXIII. This I take to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, in the caſe of the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy about the endleſs Diviſibility of <hi>Quantity;</hi> as, ſuppoſe, of a ſtraight Line. For many eminent Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians, and a greater number of Naturaliſts, and in particular almoſt all the Epicureans, and other Ato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts, ſtifly maintain the Negative. The Affirmative is nevertheleſs aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and thought to be Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically demonſtrated, by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in a peculiar Tract; and both by His School, and by ſeveral excellent Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metricians beſides. And yet in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, the Aſſertions of theſe Two contending Parties are truly Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory; ſince, of neceſſity a ſtraight Line propoſed muſt be, at leaſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally, diviſible, into Parts that are
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57680:86"/>
themſelves ſtill further diviſible; or, it muſt not be ſo, and the Subdivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions muſt at length come to a ſtop. And therefore one of the oppoſite Opinions muſt be true. And 'tis plain to thoſe, that have, with compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Skill and Attention, impartially examined this Controverſy, that the ſide that is pitched upon, whichſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be, is liable to be expoſed to ſuch Difficulties, and other Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, as are not clearly anſwerable; but confound and oppreſs the Reaſon of thoſe that ſtrive to defend it.</p>
                  <p n="24">XXIV. I have, Sir, the more largely diſcourſed of the foregoing Diſtinction; not only, becauſe I did not find my ſelf to have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by others; but, becauſe I look upon the explaining and juſtifying of it to be of Importance, not alone to the Defence of ſome Myſteries of the Chriſtian Religion, but (what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps may have eſcaped your Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation) of ſome important Articles of Natural Theology it ſelf. For though Natural Religion taught di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57680:87"/>
Heathen Philoſophers, ſuch Truths as theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> The Produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Rational Soul or Mind, which is an Immaterial Subſtance; the Formation of the World out of the Univerſal Matter, though this Action required, that an Incorporeal Subſtance gave Motion to a Body; <hi>that</hi> God knows Men's Thoughts and Intentions, how carefully ſoever they ſtrive to hide them; and <hi>that</hi> God foreknows the Events of the free Actions of ſuch Men, as are not to be born theſe many Ages; though, I ſay, theſe, and ſome other Sublime, Truths, were by divers Men embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced before the Goſpel began to be Preached; yet when I attentively conſider, how hard it is to conceive the <hi>Modus</hi> of theſe Things, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain how ſome of them can be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; and alſo, how ſome of the Divine Attributes, as Eternity, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſity, Omnipreſence, and ſome others, belong to God; and how ſome Actions, as the Moving of Bodies, and the Creation of Human
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57680:87"/>
Minds, with all their Noble Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, are Exercis'd by Him: When I conſider ſuch Things, I ſay, I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that, to my appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, there are ſome Doctrine allowed to have been diſcovered by the mere Light of Nature, that are liable to ſuch Objections from Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical Principles, and the ſetled order of Things corporeal; as, if they be urged home, will bring thoſe that are Ingenuous to acknowledge, that their Intellects are but dim and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, and indeed diſproportionate to the ſublimeſt and moſt myſterious Truths; and that they cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly comprehend them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and anſwer all the Difficulties that incumber them; though they find themſelves obliged to admit them, becauſe of the weighty Poſitive Reaſons, that recommend thoſe Heteroclite Truths to their Aſſent.</p>
                  <p n="25">XXV. If you ſhould now tell me, that, after all I have ſaid, 'tis plain, that the queſtion'd Diſtinction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if it were granted, might be of very
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57680:88"/>
bad conſequence; as affording ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to any Unintelligible Stuff, that ſome bold Enthuſiaſt, or conceited Philoſophizer, may obtrude under the Venerable Title of a <hi>Myſtery,</hi> above the Juriſdiction of Reaſon; and, that though the Diſtinction were admitted, it would not be a good Proof of any diſputed Article of the Chriſtian Religion: If, I ſay, this ſhall be objected, I ſhall anſwer, (what in part is intimated already) That I do not deny, but that our Diſtinction is liable to be ill employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but that this is no other Blemiſh than what is common with it to divers other Diſtinctions, that are without ſcruple Admitted, becauſe they are uſeful; and not Rejected, becauſe they have not the Privilege, that they can never be miſapplied: And therefore, both in reference to thoſe Diſtinctions, and to That we have been Treating of, it becomes Men to ſtand upon their Guard, and ſtrictly examine, how far the Notion, or Doctrine, propoſed as a Myſtery,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:57680:88"/>
does require, and is entituled to, the benefit of this Diſtinction. I ſhall alſo readily grant the greateſt part of the ſecond Member of your Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. For I think it were great Weakneſs in a Chriſtian, to urge our Diſtinction as a poſitive Proof: Since, thô it be Extrinſecal to an abſtruſe Notion, to be, or not to be, <hi>above Reaſon;</hi> (as was juſt now noted to another purpoſe,) yet, generally ſpeaking, that Abſtruſeneſs is leſs fit to bring credit to a Conception, or a Doctrine, than 'tis to make it to be diſtruſted. Nor are Chriſtians ſuch fond Diſcourſers, as to pretend, That ſuch an Article of Religion ought to be believed, Becauſe 'tis <hi>above Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> as if that were a proof of its Truth; but only, that if it be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe well proved, it ought to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, Notwithſtanding its being <hi>above Reaſon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="26">XXVI. And this I ſhall repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in favour of thoſe that believe theſe abſtruſe Articles, that are clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57680:89"/>
revealed in the Scripture, upon the Authority of the Divine Revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler; (who never deceives Others, nor can be Himſelf deceived,) that <hi>ſince,</hi> as we have lately ſhewn by the contradictory Opinions about the Diviſibility of Quantity, ſome Doctrines muſt be true, whoſe Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties do not appear to be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mountable by our dim Reaſon; and <hi>ſince</hi> the Perfectneſs of God's Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge permits us not to doubt, but that He certainly knows which of the two Contending Opinions is the True; and can declare ſo much to Men: It would not be a ſure ground of rejecting a Revealed Article, to alledge, that 'tis encumber'd with confounding Difficulties, and lya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to many and weighty Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
                  <p n="27">XXVII. And, (to add ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what that may help to defend ſome Truths of Natural, and others of Revealed, Religion) That a thing may be rationally aſſented to, upon
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:57680:89"/>
clear poſitive Evidence, though we cannot directly anſwer the Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, that a Speculative and Subtle Wit may deviſe againſt it; is a Truth, which, as important as it is to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in general, and the Chriſtian Religion in particular, I think one may ſufficiently manifeſt by this one Inſtance, That, becauſe we can walk up and down, and ſo remove our Bodies from Place to Place, by this one Argument, I ſay, we are juſtly ſatisfied, that there is Local Motion in the World, notwithſtanding all the Specious and Subtle Arguments, that <hi>Zeno</hi> and his Followers have employed to impugne that Truth: Againſt which, they have alleged ſuch Difficulties, as have not only puzzled and perplexed, but (for ought yet appears) <hi>nonplus'd</hi> the Antient Philoſophers, and, I doubt, thoſe Moderns too, that have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to give clear Solutions of them.</p>
                  <p n="28">
                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:57680:90"/>XXVIII. If now, Sir, we look back upon what hath hitherto been diſcourſed, I hope you will allow me to gather thence the Concluſion I aim at, which is, that There is no neceſſity, that every Notion or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that may be found deliver'd in the Holy Scriptures, that ſurpaſſes <hi>our Reaſon,</hi> muſt therefore be <hi>contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory to it:</hi> And that, in caſe the Chriſtian Religion be True, and it's Myſteries or other Articles divinely Revealed; 'tis not enough, for the Confutation of any of them, to reject the Expreſſion, <hi>that 'tis above Reaſon, but not contrary to it;</hi> as if it invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved an unintelligible or groundleſs Diſtinction: For thô This will not evince the Truth of a Myſtery, ſince That muſt be Eſtabliſh'd upon its proper Grounds and Arguments; yet it will keep it from being Therefore Abſurd or Falſe, becauſe it tranſcends our Reaſon: Since to do ſo, may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long almoſt indifferently to a Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical Notion, and a Myſterious
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:57680:90"/>
Truth. And if the Expreſſion be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to juſtify any thing, that, thô ſtyl'd a Myſtery, is but a pretended One; the Error will lye, not in the Groundleſneſs of the Diſtinction, but the Erroneouſneſs of the Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I am,</p>

                  <p>I Do not wonder, that a great Soul, like yours, ſhould enquire, What aſpect Religion, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly that of Chriſtians, has upon <hi>Greatneſs of Mind:</hi> But, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, I ſomewhat marvel, that you ſhould be put upon the Enquiry, by the Suggeſtions of ſuch a Libertine as Mr. <hi>N. N.</hi>'s confidently pretending, that his Atheiſtical and Senſual Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples are much more friendly, than the Doctrines of Chriſtianity, to a noble Frame of Mind. Wherefore I dare not permit the Senſe I have of my own Weakneſs, how great and juſt ſoever, to keep me from preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you with my Thoughts; and the rather, becauſe I preſume you are not indiſpoſed to receive a Satisfaction in this Point, ſince you ſeem to expect
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57680:93"/>
it from a Pen that is no better than mine; which, you well know, muſt not be, on this occaſion, aſſiſted by the Arguments and Ornaments, that the fine Sentences of the Fathers, and other Divines and Humaniſts, might afford to a Perſon that were at lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and furniſhed with a Library. Yet I ſhall not much, either excuſe, or deplore, my being ſo ill accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated for the Task you impoſe upon me; becauſe as you ſeem to deſire but my own Thoughts, ſo I know not, whether common Place-books would afford me any great Aſſiſtance on ſo uncommon a Theme; and, I confeſs, that, when the Matter will bear it, I, as well as you, do leſs care for Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, eſpecially taken from Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, deſigned rather to Perſuade than Prove, in compariſon of thoſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, that are ſuggeſted by a due Conſideration of the Nature of the Thing.

beſides that, your Deſires, and my Haſte, confine me to the Bible and my own Thoughts; the frequent Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Texts of Holy Scripture is exacted by the Nature of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion I am to handle: it being neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, for the evincing of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of Chriſtianity, not to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with <hi>Greatneſs of Mind,</hi> that we <hi>as</hi> well conſider, What thoſe Doctrines are, which ſure will be beſt declared by the Scriptural Texts that contain them, <hi>as</hi> What are the Attributes of <hi>Greatneſs of Mind.</hi>

                     <p>TO proceed then with ſome Method, as well as much Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, I conceive, it will be no unfit Way to come to a Reſolution in our Inquiry, if I <hi>Firſt</hi> ſet down and enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merate the chiefeſt Things, that, in the eſtimation of Intelligent Men, do, as if they were ſo many Ingredients, make up what we call <hi>Magnanimity</hi> or <hi>Greatneſs of Mind,</hi> That not being a ſingle Starr, but a Conſtellation of elevated and radiant Qualities; and <hi>then</hi> ſhew, that Religion, eſpecially That of the Chriſtians, is, at leaſt, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with</hi> each of theſe, if it do not alſo <hi>promote</hi> it. But in this Enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, thô I ſhall, <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> take in ſome Qualities, that are not Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to <hi>Greatneſs of Mind,</hi> but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Acceſſions to it; yet I ſhall not ſcrupulouſly diſtinguiſh thoſe Things that are neceſſary to compleat it, and Thoſe that are partly ſome of them

Signs, and ſome of them Effects of it; hoping from your Equity, that theſe additional Things will be thought to make full amends, if, through Haſte or Miſtake, I ſhould chance to have omitted any Property, that you may judge to belong to the true Notion of Generoſity.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall, in the following Diſcourſe, take it for granted, (and I hope I need not tell you, that I do ſo) that as we think not Maſons, but Jewel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, fit to judge of the Genuineneſs and Value of precious Stones; ſo you will allow me to take the Notion and Meaſures of <hi>Greatneſs of Mind,</hi> not from the Opinions of the Injudicious Vulgar, but the Judicious Eſtimates of Reaſon, improv'd by Philoſophy, and enlightn'd by Natural Theology.</p>
                     <p>I know, the undiſcerning Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, whoſe Judgment ſeems rather lodg'd in the Eye than in the Brain, when they hear Men name <hi>Greatneſs of Mind,</hi> are apt to fancy Something, that, like the Coronation of a King, is attended with Pomp and Splendor,

and a numerous Train of Gazers, and the loud Acclamations of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.

And, <hi>thô</hi> they pay a peculiar Honor and Reſpect to great Virtue in Sovereigns, rather than in Subjects, becauſe in the former, 'tis more diffuſively beneficial, and cannot laſt without reſiſting ſtronger Temptations; <hi>yet,</hi> they do not think, that a great Empire always either finds, or makes, a great Soul. And if Dignities, how high ſoever, be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd by mean Submiſſions, or weak Actions, they think this extrinſecal Greatneſs can no more make a mean Soul <hi>Great,</hi> than high Stilts can make a Dwarf a proper Man. Perhaps, they look upon Many, who, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a great Buſtle and Noiſe in the World, are, by themſelves, and the ſhallow Vulgar, thought great Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, but as Gnats, that are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſmall and worthleſs Creatures, and are really conſiderable for No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, ſave the Noiſe and the Stings wherewith they are able to diſturb Mens Reſt.

And certainly, True <hi>Greatneſs of Mind</hi>
                        <pb n="9" facs="tcp:57680:96"/>
muſt be ſomething that both Reſides in the Soul, and is Perfective of it; neither of which Properties belong to any thing that Fortune can beſtow: and all that outward <hi>Greatneſs</hi> can do, is not to make a Soul Great, but to afford one that is, the opportunity of ſhewing itſelf to be ſo. And all theſe Submiſſions and Reſpects that Cuſtom, or Fear, or Intereſt make Men pay to thoſe, whom, only their Titles, or their Places, or their Power makes Great ones, do as little argue or increaſe the real worth of thoſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied Perſons, as the ſtanding for more than formerly in an account, turns a Braſs Counter into Silver or Gold.

                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Rewards propos'd to Virtue and Piety, by the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> do exceedingly tend to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and heighten Them; whether we conſider the Recompences the Goſpel propounds in this Life, or thoſe that it promiſes in the Next. The great preſent Rewards of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, are, you know, the Approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Good Men, and the Applauſe of a Man's own Conſcience. The Firſt of theſe is as well attainable by Chriſtian Hero's, as by any other; for Virtue loſes neither its Worth, nor Amiableneſs, by being Baptiz'd; and thô in ſome Times and Places leſſer Degrees of it may be diſregar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, or traduc'd, yet, generally ſpeaking, the greater Degrees of it will either invite, or extort, Mens Eſteem. Among the <hi>Roman</hi> Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors, the exemplary Lives and Conſtancy of the Primitive Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, brought it to be Proverbially
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57680:101"/>
ſaid, <hi>That ſuch a Man was a good Man, ſaving that he was a Chriſtian;</hi> and, <hi>Soli Chriſtiani mortis contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tores,</hi> was uſually in Heathen's Mouths. There are divers Qualities, and thoſe more preſs'd by the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, than any other, Inſtitution, that have in them ſo much of Native Lovelineſs, that <hi>St. Paul</hi> might juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay of them, <hi>That he that exerciſes himſelf in them, is,</hi> ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſpeaking, <note place="margin">Rom. XIV. 18.</note>
                        <hi>both ceptable to God, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd by Men.</hi> Nor did thoſe Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues that recommended the Great <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> whilſt he was a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, loſe their Luſtre, or the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration they procured him, when he turn'd Chriſtian, and practis'd them with higher Aims, than that of ſatisfying Himſelf, and pleaſing his People.</p>
                     <p>And as for the Reward of a good Conſcience, which was able to make <hi>Hercules</hi> undergo all his Labors; and made all the other Hero's of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile World; I think, it will not be
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57680:102"/>
doubted, but that this inward Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence is received, not only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Defalcations, but with great Improvements, by him, whoſe Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues flow from Religion. For, to him the Applauſes of Conſcience may well be more acceptable than all the various ſorts of Muſick, <note place="margin">Dan. III. 7.</note>that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemniz'd the Dedication of <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi>'s Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Image, ſince in him Conſcience does not, as in mere Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Men, act only the Part of a Domeſtick Judge, but That of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legate from God himſelf; and its Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions are leſs welcome, as they are Approbations of Reaſon, than as they are the Pledges of Gods Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and of that higher Reward that will be conſequent to it in the Life to come.</p>
                     <p>For theſe Joys, that are plac'd on the other ſide of the Grave, are much the Nobleſt part of the Recompence of Virtue, and proportionable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citements to the Practice of it; and yet, on the account of future Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57680:102"/>
the Chriſtian has much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Motives to Heroick Virtue, than the Heathen Moraliſt, or Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher. For, the poſthume State of Man is ſo dim and uncertain, that we find even the greateſt Men, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Heathens, ſpeak very doubtfully, and not without Ifs and Ands, of a future State, and much more of a future Happineſs, as may be inſtanc'd in <hi>Socrates, Cyrus, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca,</hi> and many others; ſo that they rather ſeem'd to have Wiſh'd, or Hop'd, than Believ'd, their future Felicity: And, I fear, that many of them, finding that happy State de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd chiefly by the Poets, reckon'd it among Poetick Fictions. And thoſe that did, though but wave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly, expect Recompences in the Life to Come, had but poor and mean Idea's ſuggeſted to them of it; the Hopes they were entertain'd with, being of Fortunate Iſlands and the Elyſian Fields, which are not ſo Tranſcendent as to make a diffident Man very forward to quit the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57680:103"/>
of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> that he has here in Poſſeſſion, upon the doubtful hopes of other Gardens in <hi>Elyſium.</hi> Whereas, to excite the Chriſtian to an Heroick Degree of Virtue, he is not allow'd to Hope, but Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be intirely Confident of paſſing out of this World into a Place, to which the Poets <hi>Elyſium</hi> is much more Inferior, than the Poſſeſſion of a Garden is to That of an Empire. To attempt the Deſcription of that Coeleſtial Happineſs, would be, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to my Inclination, to launch out into a Common Place; and were a Work, that if my Haſte did not, my Diſability would, diſſuade me from: And therefore, <hi>though</hi> it be a State made up of the Confluence of all ſort of Things rationally De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireable; <hi>yet,</hi> having only ſaid in general of all the other Goods that it comprizes, that the Scripture tells us, <note place="margin">1 Cor.

                        <hi>Fear him:</hi> I ſhall particularly take notice only of thoſe Parts of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable Reward, that may peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly concern my preſent purpoſe, by being the chief Things that Heroick Souls are wont to Aſpire too; a Good Name, Honour, and Dignity.</p>
                     <p>To have a Good Name for Good Actions, cannot but be a very deſire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Thing, the Applauſe of Wiſe and Good Men, being a loud Eccho from without, that, by repeating it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms the Approbation given by the Conſcience within. But though to do Virtuous and Worthy Actions be the beſt and likelieſt way of acquiring a Good Name, yet 'tis not a certain one: For, ſuch is the Ignorance, the Malice, or the Enmity of a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that no Man is ſure to eſcape be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Miſ-repreſented, or Traduc'd; as, we ſee, that the Sublimity, the Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the regular Courſes of the Stars themſelves, could not hinder wanton Poets, or fanciful Aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, from giving thoſe Luminous Conſtellations the Names not only
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57680:104"/>
of the Nobler Beaſts, as the Lyon, the Eagle, and the Whale; but even of Animals that lie under an ill Name, as the Dog, the Goat, and the Scorpion. And though it be true, that oftentimes Innocency long Clouded, does, like Lightning, break out at laſt; yet oftentimes too, that happens not till Malice and Envy are Dead, becauſe the maligned Perſon is ſo; by which means he does not Live to know he is juſtified; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, if not all, of thoſe miſ-inform'd Men are Dead and gone for whoſe good Opinion he was chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd. But <hi>though</hi> the Chriſtian may, as well as any other, be Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd by Calumny, which often ſerves good Men, (as the Heathen Perſecuters did the Martyrs, when they expoſed them to the Peoples view, cloath'd in the Skins of Beaſts, to make them hideous and hateful;) <hi>yet</hi> he is juſtly cheared by the Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance he has, that there will come a Time when oppreſt and disfigur'd In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency ſhall ſhine forth and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57680:104"/>
and his good Name, as well as his Body, ſhall have a Glorious Reſurrection, even in the Sight of his Accuſers and Enemies, and of all thoſe whom their Slanders did either prevail with, or ſtartle.

                     <p>This Celeſtial Crown compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending, in the Scripture Dialect, both the remaining Parts of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans Reward, Honour and Dignity, or Glory, and Preferment; it will be pertinent to mention ſome Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages that giveit an high Preference about the Crowns of Monarchs here below.</p>
                     <p>And Firſt, Earthly Crowns may ſomtimes be the Fruits and Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences of Worth and Virtue, but are not at all the proofs of them.

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57680:105"/>
and Hiſtory gives us cauſe to wiſh, they were more ſeldom the Acquiſts of Crimes. But the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial Crowns proclaim, thô not the Merit, the Worth of them that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them, being never adjudg'd but to Such, whom previous Graces and Virtues have fitted and qualified for <note place="margin">Col.

                     </p>
                     <p>Beſides, as an Earthly Crown may be acquir'd without Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ſo it may be poſſeſs'd without Happineſs. And if Crimes be made Steps to a Throne, they prove ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Thorns to him that ſits on it, who is there a more Illuſtrious, not a leſs tormented, Malefactor. The Sublimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a Throne, as little as the Height of a Scaffold, keeping a Criminal Perſon from feeling the puniſhments inflicted on him there. As may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by the inſtance<note place="margin">Acts XII. 21.</note> of <hi>Herod Agrippa,</hi> whoſe Throne, and gliſtering Habit, which <hi>Joſephus</hi> takes notice of, thô they procur'd

him not only the Acclamations, but Adorations, of the dazled Multitude, could not protect him from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens'd Juſtice of an higher King than he; ſo that whilſt others treated him as a God, he found himſelf one of the moſt miſerable of Men, and was fain to haſten from a Seat, which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd, but could not protect, his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety. But a Coeleſtial Crown, as it is graciouſly beſtowed for the Supream Recompence of Virtue, and on that account may be called a <hi>Crown of Righteouſneſs;</hi> ſo it always proves a Bleſſing as inſeparable from Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as a Thing is from it ſelf. The Crowns of this World, by the very advantage of being Hereditary, ſhew, that they cannot preſerve the Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors from Death. But the Crown, I ſpeak of, is by the Divine Beſtower of it, called, <note place="margin">Rev. II. 10.</note>
                        <hi>A Crown of Life;</hi> and of it, in reſpect of other Crowns, may be truly ſaid, what <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaid of Wiſdom, in reference to other

Goods, That <note place="margin">Eccl. VII. 12.</note>
                        <hi>the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of it is, that it gives Life to the owner thereof.</hi> And though Earthly Crowns be ſuch Tranſitory Things, that we may obſerve, <note place="margin">Dan. II.</note>that even the Four great Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies of the World were by God repreſented to <hi>Nebuchadnezar,</hi> but as parts of a Dream, whereas the Kingdom promis'd to Chriſtians, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Scripture, <note place="margin">Heb.

                        <hi>A Kingdom that cannot be moved,</hi> as the Believers Crown is, in oppoſition to thoſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Crowns of Lawrel, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn'd the Heads of the Roman Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors, called an <note place="margin">1 Pet.

                        <hi>unwi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering Crown of Glory:</hi> As if the Lawrel plac'd on the Chriſtians Head, could grow and flouriſh in the Wreath, better than it did on the Tree.</p>
                     <p>But all that I have yet ſaid is Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to this laſt Prerogative of the Coeleſtial Crown, that it does not only confer a relative Dignity or
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57680:107"/>
Preeminence, but an eſſential Worth and Excellency; as if the Diamonds, which adorn'd that Crown, ſhould impart their own Sparklingneſs, Tranſparency, and Incorruptibility, to the Perſon that wears it. The higheſt Preferments here below do raiſe a Man above others, without raiſing him above himſelf. By being at the top of a Ladder, a Man comes to an higher Station, but is not really taller than he was; and a Vane, by being plac'd on the top of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Steeple, is not from Iron turn'd into Gold or Silver, but remains ſtill of the ſame baſe Metal it was, and is but a Weather-Cock, and ſo the Sport of the Winds. But a Coele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial Crown is always attended with a Perſonal Improvement, befitting ſo high a Dignity. The Heavenly Coronation has a Virtue like That of the Unction of <hi>Saul,</hi> who, upon his being made King, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to <note place="margin">1 Sam. X. 6.</note>
                        <hi>Prophecy, and was turn'd into an other Man.</hi> And the Reſemblance holds in this
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:57680:107"/>
too, that Chriſt is ſaid, to have made his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed ones, not only <note place="margin">Rev. 1. 6.</note>
                        <hi>Kings, but Prieſts to God and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> as if the Kingly Dignity were not enough, unleſs the Sacred Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a Prieſtly Office were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.

As if the Glorify'd Soul did ſhine, with an undiminiſh'd Splendor, through its happily chang'd Manſion. And we may well ſuppoſe, that this will be a Bright and Noble Structure, if we remember, that the Angels, who, in their Apparitions to good Men, were wont to be very careful not to frighten them, did yet appear with a Majeſtick Splendor; <note place="margin">Mark XVI. 5.</note>and that Angel that the Apoſtles ſaw in our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours Sepulchre is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented

                     <p>THe Author being deſir'd to add yet ſomething to the foregoing Diſcourſes, to give the Book they make Parts of, a Thickneſs more proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to its Largeneſs; he did among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Papers of his, that he turn'd over in Compliance with that requeſt, light upon an Epiſtolary Diſcourſe, which by its very being unfiniſh'd, ſeem'd (by reaſon of its ſhortneſs) the more fit to ſerve the preſent turn. For this Tract having been drawn up in a Countrey, whence the Author was oblig'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move, before he had made any conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Progreſs in his Work; he was eaſily induc'd to put it up in a Bundle of other Writings, which, like this, were laid aſide till he ſhould be at much leiſure to compleat them. But upon the newly mention'd occaſion, finding that among divers looſe and leſſer <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs,</hi> that had been thrown together
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57680:110"/>
in order to the deſign'd Treatiſe, there were 15 or 20 Pages at the beginning that were Coherent enough; he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent they ſhould attend the <hi>Chriſtian Virtuoſo,</hi> becauſe of the affinity of the things deſign'd in both the Papers; which being to recommend the Chriſtian Religion to worthy Souls, 'twas congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous enough that a Diſcourſe which ſhews, That the Chriſtian Religion may very well conſiſt with a Philoſophick <hi>Genius;</hi> ſhould be accompany'd by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that tends to manifeſt, That Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Mind, which comprizes uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon degrees of Virtue, is not only Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with Chriſtianity, but may be highly Promoted by it. Thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on this Aim, will not ('tis hop'd) think it ſtrange, that the Style is a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Rais'd; ſince tho' the Subject be Theological, yet the Writer, (who was then many Years Younger than he now is) being a Perſon of Honour, and writing for a Noble Gentleman, who, like himſelf, was a Layman; 'twas thought not only Allowable but Fit, that the Style ſhould not be altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitable
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57680:110"/>
to the Subject and to the Aim: which was to make Impreſſions on an Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious Perſon, not by dry Precepts, or Languid Diſcourſes, but by exciting him to Heroick Virtue, by the Nobleſt Patterns and <hi>Ideas,</hi> and the moſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Incentives, he could propoſe.</p>
                     <p>And tho' the Diſcouragements lately mention'd, and ſince increas'd by the Authors not being able to find ſome of the principle Materials he had, in looſe Sheets, provided for the following Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; oblige him to lay aſide the thoughts of Compleating it; yet becauſe 'tis very poſſible that ſome Elevated Soul may have a Mind to proſecute the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, or Cultivate ſo noble a Subject; he thought it not amiſs (as little Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of his Method or Way of Treating it) to Subjoyn to the greater Fragment, beſides the Index of the Heads of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, intended for the Firſt Part, 5 or 6 Leſſer Fragments that he lighted on, whilſt he was ſeeking for ſome Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers belonging to the ſame Tract, that ſhould have been, but were not, found in their Company.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Second Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note>ONE of the grand Difficulties, that he, who would be highly Virtuous, muſt expect to ſurmount and Conquer, eſpecially in ſuch a Degenerous age, as ours, is the Temptation that is afforded by the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57680:112"/>
Univerſality of vitious Cuſtoms and Examples. I wiſh 'twere needleſs, ſolicitouſly to prove, either how great an Influence Examples, eſpecially bad ones, have on the generality of Men; or how general bad Examples have been in moſt Ages, and in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular in That we live in. The Scandal given by bad Examples, tho' it be one of the moſt obvious Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, is none of the leaſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. For Intereſt, Baſhfulneſs, and that very Complaiſance and Civility, that is ſo uſually found in well-bred, or good-Natur'd, Perſons, makes them very unwilling to offend or diſoblige the Company they live with; and whom they have ſeveral Inducements rather to pleaſe and gratify by imitation and compliance, than tacitly to reproach by Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to their Sentiments, and Practices. And, in effect, we find, that many that could not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by the Frowns and Threats of the Vitious, have been Debauch'd by their Company and Example.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57680:112"/>
Againſt this powerful Temptation, Religion ſtrongly arms it's Hero, both by Precepts and Precedents. <hi>Thou ſhalt not follow a Multitude to do Evil,</hi> was the Expreſs Command of the Moſaic Law. <hi>Say not thou a Confederacy to all, to whom this People ſhall ſay a Confederacy,</hi> was the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God to his Prophet. Our Saviour makes it an Argument to diſſuade his Diſciples from an anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Solicitude about Meat and Drink and Cloathing, that after all <hi>theſe things the Gentiles</hi> (which are by far the moſt numerous part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind) <hi>do ſeek.</hi> And, upon the ſame ground, he endeavours in the ſame Divine Sermon upon the Mount to keep them from Vain Repetitions in Prayer. And, whereas it may ſeem an Immodeſty to dare to diſſent from others, that vaſtly ſurpaſs us in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; the Heroick Conqueror of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> ſpeaks thus to the whole Body of the Victorious Jewiſh Nation, that they may chooſe to ſerve whom they thought fit, and worſhip either
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57680:113"/>
the Gods whom their Fathers ſerved, or thoſe Worſhipp'd by the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Nations, but as <hi>for me and my Houſe, we Will ſerve the Lord, Be you not conformed to this World,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Paul.</hi> And another Apoſtle, ſpeaking of himſelf and the true Chriſtians of his time, ſcruples not to affirm it paſſionately and roundly, <note place="margin">1 John, 5. 9.</note>
                        <hi>We know that we are of God, and the whole World lies in Wickedneſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nor does Religion furniſh us with Precepts only, to diſobey Cuſtom, and Example, but with Precedents too, of which there are Three ſo illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that I know not how to paſs them by. The Firſt is afforded by <hi>Lot,</hi> who lived in a place, that was grown ſo Proverbial for the Height of Wickedneſs, that to aggravate their Sins by the moſt Hyperbolical Compariſon, we muſt liken them to themſelves; and they were grown ſo wicked, that in a place where an admirable Plenty, and an unbounded Libertiniſme could not but make
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57680:113"/>
them very populous, there could not be found half a Score of good Men, the generality of that curſed People being fallen ſo much not only from Virtue, but from common Honeſty, that they did not reſtrain themſelves ſo much, as to Human Vices. And yet, even the Sins of <hi>Sodom,</hi> which cryed ſo loud as to reach Heaven, and bring down Fire and Brimſtone from thence, diſturbed <hi>Lot</hi>'s Quiet, without deſtroying his Innocence, and an Apoſtle aſſures us, that, that <hi>juſt Man was but vex'd with the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Converſation of the wicked,</hi> not prevail'd with in the leaſt to imitate it.</p>
                     <p>The Next Inſtance of a Religious Courage, inflexible to bad Examples, is afforded us by the three Friends of <hi>Daniel,</hi> who, at the great Solemnity of the Dedication of <hi>Nebuchadnezars</hi> Golden Image; when they had, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that great and ſtern Monarchs Command, the Example not only of many Men but many Nations, and a more numerous Aſſembly of Perſons,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57680:114"/>
conſiderable for Quality and Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, than the World ever ſaw before or ſince, ſingly oppoſed their Naked Conſtancy to the haughty Tyrants Menaces, and the proſtrate World's Example. And yet theſe Men were Courtiers, bred among that ſupple ſort of fine Creatures; that were as accuſtom'd to bow their Conſciences, as their Knees, to their proud Maſter. They had not only Lives to loſe, but the chief Dignities of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Babylon,</hi> then the Queen of Nations. And they could not upon their refuſal quit the ſtatelieſt Palace in the World, without immediately changing it for a burning Fiery Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace.</p>

excepted, the Inequallity was grown ſuch, as gave Vice rather a Monopoly than a Share of Men; or if a Diſtribution were to be admitted, 'twas ſuch a one, as That made of <hi>Saul</hi> and his Army, when all the people were on one ſide, and only he and <hi>Jonathan</hi> on the other: 'Tis ſtrange, that when the World was ſo recent, that many, that were then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live might remember and converſe with one, that for two hundred Years liv'd contemporary with <hi>Adam,</hi> (for ſo we may gather <hi>Methuſala</hi> to have done) Men ſhould ſo ſoon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get all Sentiments of Piety. But yet in <hi>Noah</hi>'s time, the World could not be compared to its preſent State, where thô it be Night in one place, 'tis Day in another; but to the ſtate of <hi>Tohu va Bohu,</hi> or the firſt Chaos, where Darkneſs was over the face of the Univerſal Deep. For the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture tells us, <note place="margin">Gen. 6. 12.</note>
                        <hi>That all Fleſh had corrupted his way upon the Earth, that every Imagination of the thoughts of</hi>
                        <pb n="46" facs="tcp:57680:115"/>
                        <hi>Mans Heart was only evil continually.</hi> And tho' <hi>Noah</hi>'s Family were ſaved with him in the Ark, yet it may be doubted, whether that were a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain token of their being untoucht by the general Contagion. For that wonderful Veſſel contain'd Beaſts clean and unclean, harmleſs and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacious, and in it were ſaved <hi>Wolves</hi> as well as <hi>Lambs,</hi> and <hi>Vultures</hi> as well as <hi>Doves.</hi> And where God gives the Reaſon, why he vouchſafed to receive <hi>Noah</hi> and his Houſe into the Ark, he Expreſſes it thus; <hi>For</hi> thee <hi>have I ſeen Righteous before me in this Generation,</hi> without making mention of any of his Family. Nor, was the Wickedneſs of the Antediluvian World more Univerſal than it was Great; that Mungrel breed were guilty of Sins as Gigantic as Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. The Text ſays, <hi>that the Earth was filled with Violence</hi> through them; and thoſe Impious Rebels againſt their Maker broke the Laws of Nature with an Inſolence, that provoked him to break off the courſe
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57680:115"/>
of Nature to puniſh them, ſince no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs than an Univerſal Deluge of Water could place Limits to ſuch an impetuous and over-flowing Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety. But all theſe ſinful Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, how general ſoever, could not prevail on <hi>Noah</hi> ſo much as to keep him from giving One of a quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Nature; the Scripture calls him an Herald or <note place="margin">2. <hi>Peter,</hi> 2. 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

And his Conſtancy rais'd him as much above the reach of their Temptations, as the Waters that pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed their Sin rais'd his Ark above their drowned Manſions. And now go and compare with any Conſtancy of the following times, where Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue has always had ſome Party, tho' not a numerous one, this unequall'd Singularity of <hi>Noah,</hi> which God himſelf ſeems to have taken ſpecial

But, whatever may be thought of Humility, ſolitarily conſider'd, yet, when we find it in Conjunction with thoſe other Qualities, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to make up Greatneſs of Mind, it adds to their Number; and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

tho<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it does not perhaps ſhine as bright as ſome of them, is as amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as any; and imparts ſomewhat of its own Lovelineſs to all the reſt. And you will not much wonder, that I place this Virtue among thoſe that Conſtellate, if I may ſo ſpeak, an Heroick Mind, if you conſider, whence Humility may in ſuch a Soul proceed, and what difficulties it may ſurmount. For if Wealth, Honour, and other outward Bleſſings exalt our <hi>Hero's</hi> Condition; to be Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, in the midſt of ſuch Advantages, argues a Mind elevated above the Preſents of Fortune, and ſpeaks a Soul Great enough to undervalue thoſe things that ordinary Souls admire; and which even men that paſs for Great, make the Objects of their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, and, when attain'd, of their Pride. And if our <hi>Hero</hi> be ennobled with great Virtues, or famous for great Actions; his Humility argues, that he has ſo rais'd an Idea of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and dares aſpire to ſuch a pitch of it, that he cannot reſt ſatisfy'd
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57680:117"/>
with greater attainments, than Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but ordinarily Virtuous, aim at; and looks upon himſelfas oblig'd and born to an unwearied purſuit of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick and ſtill increaſing Degrees of Excellency. And if a laudable Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, by being extremely difficult, is a mark of a Great Soul, Humility muſt not be deny'd that Character; for This is a Virtue more difficult to Excellent, than to Ordinary, Souls. In other Caſes, a <hi>Hero</hi> is to contend but with his Vices, or his Paſſions, or his open Enemies; but to be Humble, he muſt overcome his Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues too; and that, when they act unitedly as one Body: Since, tho' o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Virtues naturally aſſiſt one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they all conſpire to ruin Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; which, having Pride to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with, is to deal with ſo ſubtle an Adverſary, that ſometimes even by being foil'd he overcomes. And as the <hi>Torpedo</hi> poiſons his Arm that wounds it; ſo ſometimes in the beſt Arguments we employ againſt Pride, the very ſtrength and ſeeming ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs

Let us now therefore examin, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, notwithſtanding, the Wings which we have ſhewn that Religion adds to the Mind, the Cloggs that it faſtens to her, be heavy enough to diſable her to raiſe her ſelf above the pitch of Vulgar Souls; and force her, inſtead of ſoaring aloft, to flutter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Earth.</p>
                  <p>The chief Things, that, as far as I can learn, are alleged, either by <hi>Philédonus,</hi> or more conſidering Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries than he; to ſhew Religion to be either quite Inconſiſtent with, or very Unfriendly to, <hi>Greatneſs of Mind,</hi> are theſe.—</p>
