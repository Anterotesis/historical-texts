            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHEN I desired you to Print these excellent Papers, I told you they were recommended to me by a devout Person, who was a great Judge of Books of Devotion, having given the World one already, which had been well received in three impressions, and would in time furnish'd it with more.

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THO the unhappy decay of true Piety, and the lmmoralities of the Age we live in, may be a discouragement to the multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such Books as this, yet on the other hand this degeneracy of Manners, and too evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent contempt of Religion, makes it (it may be) the more necessary to endeavor to retreive the Spirit of Devotion, and the sacred Fires of of Primitive Christianity. And since 'tis hop'd this ensuing Treatise may somewhat conduce to these noble Ends: It is thought to be no unprofitable Undertaking to commit it to the Press, it being part of the Remains of a very devout Christian, who is long since removed to the Regions of Beatified Spirits, to sing those Praises and Hallelujahs, in which he was very vigorously employ'd, whilst he dwelt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us; and since somewhat of <hi>Preface</hi> is become as it were a necessary part of every <hi>Book,</hi> instead of any particular <hi>Dedication</hi> (which is commonly overstuft with Flattery and Complements) I will only give thee some account of the <hi>Author.</hi> To tell thee who he was, is I think, to no purpose: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will only tell theewhat he was, for that may possibly recommend these following
<pb facs="tcp:62370:5"/>
Thanksgivings, and Meditations to thy use. He was a Divine of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> of a very comprehensive Soul, and very accute Parts, so fully bent upon that Honourable Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in which he was engaged; and so won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully transported with the Love of God to Mankind, with the excellency of those Divine Laws which are prescribed to us, and with those inexpressible Felicities to which we are entitled by being created in, and redeemed to, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Image, that he dwelt continually amongst these thoughts, with great delight and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, spending most of his time when at home, in digesting his notions of these things into writing, and was so full of them when abroad, that those that would converse twith him, were forced to endure some discourse upon these subjects, whether they had any sense of Religion, or not. And therefore to such he might be sometimes thought troublesome, but his company was very acceptable to all such as had any inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to Vertue, and Religion.</p>
            <p>And tho he had the misfortune to come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad into the World, in the late disordered Times when the Foundations were cast down, and this excellent Church laid in the dust, and dissolved into <hi>Confusion</hi> and <hi>Enthusiasme;</hi> yet his Soul was of a more refin'd allay, and his Judgment in discerning of things more solid, and considerate then to be infected with
<pb facs="tcp:62370:6"/>
that Leaven, and therefore became much in love with the beautiful order and <hi>Primitive</hi> Devotions of this our excellent Church. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch that I beleive, he never failed any one day either publickly or in his private Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set, to make use of her publick Offices, as one part of his devotion, unless some very unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able business interrupted him. He was a man of a cheerful and sprightly Temper, free from any thing of the sourness or formality, by which some great pretenders to Piety rather disparage and misrepresent true Religion, than recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it; and therefore was very affable and pleasant in his Conversation, ready to do all good Offices to his Friends, and Charitable to the Poor almost beyond his ability. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing removed out of the Country to the service of the late Lord Keeper <hi>Bridgman,</hi> as his Chaplain, he died young, and got early to thoses blissful Mansions, to which he at all times aspir'd.</p>

               <p>From all Eternity thou didst ever live the best of lives, without end or beginning.</p>
               <p>Nor didst thou approach to it, nor canst thou remove from it.</p>
               <p>In all operations therefore at once, art thou ever infinite. To whom nothing can be added, out of whom nothing can be taken; from everlasting to everlasting, including all things.</p>

                  <l>And the light of it, O Lord:</l>
                  <l>The sweet combinations of private love</l>
                  <l>Particular friendships,</l>
                  <l>Carried in the Bark of our Nations wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare,</l>
                  <l>Will all be laid waste in its desolation.</l>
                  <l>Those amiable objects; so full of beauty,</l>
                  <l>And Heavenly commerce; in Angels eyes!</l>
                  <l>Each of whom is</l>
                  <l>An incarnate Cherubim,</l>
                  <l>A Member of Jesus Christ,</l>
                  <l>A penitent Transgressor.</l>
                  <l>O what wonders do mine eyes behold!</l>
               </lg>
               <p>There is more joy in Heaven for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of one Sinner, than for ninety nine just persons that need no repentance.</p>
               <p>For every Prodigal returning unto thee, There is another Jubilee and Feast in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p>For this cause therefore return thou on high, and come and Save us!</p>
               <p>My Goodness extendeth not to thee, but to the Saints and to the excellent in the earth in whom is all my delight.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Bereave me not, O Lord, of these delights,</l>
                  <l>These Kings Daughters,</l>
                  <l>Holy Sons, Saints and Angels,</l>

               </lg>
               <p>O let them walk in thy ways, and keep thy charge, then shall they judge thy House and keep thy Courts, and have Places given them to walk among those that stand by.</p>
               <p>Let me see, O Lord, the grand mystery of thy spiritual Building, The Union of Souls in the Government of Nations, the perfect clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of those living Stones; constituting a Temple, one Temple entire unto thee;</p>
               <p>The two Pillars of the Earth strengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing each other;</p>
               <p>Religion rooting Justice within,</p>
               <p>Justice fencing Religion without, And both making an Arch of Government im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movable.</p>
               <p>These two Pillars as steady as they are, will except (they have an upholder) cleave and bend.</p>
               <p>And the whole frame sink with them.</p>
               <p>Therefore, O Lord, do thou support him that beareth them up.</p>
               <p>Thy Spirit hath compared our Princes to a nail driven into a wall, whereon are hanged all both the Vessels of service, and instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Musick,</p>
               <p>Firm may this nail abide, and never stir, For if it should, all our Cups would batter with the fall, the musick of our Quire be marr'd.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Both Church and Country put into danger.</l>
                  <l>Let me see the the combination of our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian state,</l>

               <p>Make our Sons and Daughters like Corner Stones, polished after the similitude of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,</p>
               <p>A celestial Blessing to heavenly eyes.</p>
               <p>Thy people walking in the Land of the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in the light of prosperity, Truth and.

               <p>Make me not void of such, O Lord, by our Desolations.</p>
               <p>O continue them that I may excercise the the works of Justice and Mercy and Charity among them; may be, not as a Beast in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solate Wilderness,</p>
               <p>Spoiled of all occasions of vertue; But a fruitful Tree in the paradice of God, laden with more than Apples of Gold in pict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures of Silver, more precious than Rubies,</p>
