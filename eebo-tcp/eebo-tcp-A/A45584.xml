         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
            <p>TO offer any Account of the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of <hi>Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical
Writers</hi> by Monſieur <hi>Du Pin,</hi> or to give
a Character of it, would be Labour to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
ſeeing it is ſo well known here by the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate
<hi>Tranſlation</hi> of it which hath been Publiſhed.</p>
            <p>Monſieur <hi>Du Pin's</hi> Performance in that Work, as well
as Undertaking, did at firſt receive the Approbation of
many Learned <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> as they have ſtill the
general Applauſe amongſt <hi>Proteſtants:</hi> But the <hi>Eſteem,</hi>
which the <hi>latter</hi> had of this Work, tended to the Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
of the Author, raiſing Jealouſies in thoſe of his <hi>own
Communion,</hi> as if he intended to betray the Church, and
to weaken the Foundation upon which it pretends to ſtand.
What chiefly recommended him to <hi>Proteſtants</hi> was his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity,
in declaring both his <hi>own</hi> Sentiments, and the
Sentiments of the <hi>Fathers.</hi> But this very Thing diſpleaſed
the Heads of his <hi>own Church,</hi> where even <hi>Truth</hi> it
ſelf is not allowed to be ſpoken but when it may ſerve their
<hi>Intereſt.</hi> Nay the more Moderate charged him with <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence</hi>
in delivering Truths very <hi>unſeaſonably:</hi> for
while they were extirpating the Opinions of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> as
damnable <hi>Hereſie,</hi> it was no ways proper to Publiſh a
Book which yields great Advantage to <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and
which ſhews that their Sentiments are more agreeable to
what the Primitive Church and Fathers held, than the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Tenets and Practices of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Theſe
<pb facs="tcp:94359:3"/>
Prejudices and Objections were managed by ſome who did
bear Monſieur <hi>Du Pin</hi> a Perſonal Grudge, and by this
means he was complained upon publickly, and a publick
Cenſure of his Perſon and Books was demanded, which
the Circumſtances of the <hi>French</hi> King alſo required and
made neceſſary, that thereby he might ſoften the Pope,
diſpoſe him to a Reconciliation, and either engage him to
ſide with <hi>France</hi> againſt the Confederate Princes, or at
leaſt to abide <hi>Neutral.</hi> For it was generally believed,
that that Confederacy did firſt ſpring from the Pope,
who ſuſpected that the <hi>French</hi> King deſigned to throw
off his Authority, and who was highly diſpleaſed with
him upon the account of thoſe Propoſitions relating to
the Papal Juriſdiction, which the Aſſembly of the Clergy
had Concerted and Publiſhed, <hi>Anno</hi> 1682.</p>
            <p>Thus Policy and Intereſt required the Condemnation
of Monſieur <hi>Du Pin</hi>'s Works, but ſome deſired to ſave
himſelf, which could be done no other ways than by a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractation
which he long ſtruggled with, but at laſt was
prevailed upon by the Example of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church,
which (it is ſaid) the Archbiſhop of <hi>Paris</hi> urged upon
him very much, ſaying, that it was no ſhame for him,
a ſingle Perſon, to make a Retractation, when a whole
Church had done it, to prevent the inconveniences which
might otherwiſe follow.</p>
            <p>The Tranſlator of theſe Works of Monſieur <hi>Du Pin,</hi>
in his Preface to the Third Volume taketh notice of the
Condemnation and Cenſure that were paſt upon them,
but alſo ſaith that he was not able to procure either a
Copy of them or of <hi>Du Pin</hi>'s Retractation, which hath
moved me to Publiſh them, believing that they will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to the Curious, and uſeful to thoſe who have
bought the Books themſelves, which are not to be the leſs
eſteemed becauſe they are thus Condemned. And notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb facs="tcp:94359:3"/>
the Author's Retractation it doth appear, that the
Proteſtants have Antiquity on their ſide: for as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction
was not voluntary, but forced from <hi>Du Pin,</hi>
ſo it doth not flatly contradict any material point in
his Books, but is merely to be conſidered as a Prudent
and Political Defence to ſave himſelf from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences
of being judged guilty of what was eſteemed
Hereſie.</p>
            <p>Having ſaid that Monſier <hi>Du Pin</hi> was prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon to make his Retraction by the example of the
<hi>French</hi> Church, who, conſidering the preſent Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of their King, did alſo Retract the above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
Propoſitions of the Aſſembly 1682. which were ſo
offenſive to the Pope. I Judge it will not be unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to ſet down their Retraction, which I ſuppoſe is
not not very common, and it is as followeth.</p>
            <q>Ad pedes Sanctitatis Veſtrae provoluti, declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus
nos vehementer, &amp; ſupra id quod dici poteſt,
ex corde dolore, ſuper rebus geſtis in Comitiis
praefatis, quae Sanctitati veſtrae ejuſque Deceſſori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
valde diſplicuerunt, ac proinde quod ibidem
<hi>[circa]</hi> Eccleſiaſticam ac pontificiam authoritatem,
ſive in praejudicium Eccleſiarum, quod à mente noſtrâ
prorſus alienum eſſe teſtamur, deliberatum decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumque
<hi>[videri poteſt]</hi> pro non decreto &amp; non deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berato
habemus &amp; habendum eſſe declaramus.</q>
            <p>The Pope was not pleaſed with the words <hi>circa</hi> and
<hi>videri poteſt,</hi> he judged them too ſoft and general, and
therefore would not accept of this ſubmiſſion of the
Clergy of <hi>France</hi> untill they were changed into <hi>contra</hi>
and <hi>fuit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:94359:4"/>
It is to be remembered that the Quotations in the
following Retractation are marked according to the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Tranſlation of <hi>Du Pin</hi>'s Works. The Remarks
mentioned by <hi>Du Pin</hi> are Critical Obſervations upon
his Hiſtory, which were never Tranſlated, nor yet his
Anſwers to them, and therefore the Quotations out
of them are according to the <hi>Paris</hi> Edition of them.</p>

               <p>It being the
Chief Duty of the Paſtors of the Church to keep the
Doctrine wherewith they are entruſted, ſuch as they
have received from the Apoſtles, whoſe Succeſſors
they are, and not to ſuffer any Perſon to make any
Change in it without due Cenſure; and as Tradition
is the Channel which ſhould convey to us by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted
Courſe, the Catholick Doctrines in all their
Purity, ſo there ſhould be a ſingular Regard had to
Books and Authors which pretend to repreſent the
ſame entire, deriving it from the Source, and tracing
it from Age to Age, even to the preſent Times. We
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94359:5"/>
have therefore judged that we ought to apply our
ſelves carefully to the Examination of a Book printed
ſome Years ſince in this City, under the Title of a
<hi>New Library of Eccleſiaſtick Authors,</hi> &amp;c. of which there
hath already appeared Five Tomes, one after another,
divided into ſeven Volumes. The deſign of this
Work being to treat of all the Eccleſiaſtick Authors,
which have been ſince the firſt Eſtabliſhment of the
Church, to Publiſh what they have Written, and to
give an Account of their Character and Merit, which
the Author profeſſeth to have been performed for the
firſt Eight Ages in thoſe Volumes which he hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
publiſhed, intending to continue thoſe which
follow until the preſent. And we are ſo much the
more concerned to enter upon a narrow Enquiry into
this Book; having underſtood that many Perſons do
find theſe firſt Tomes full of conſiderable Faults. That
nothing in this Affair might paſs without great Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration
and a perfect Scrutiny, we cauſed this Book
to be read by four Doctors in Divinity of the Faculty
of <hi>Paris,</hi> who did read all thoſe Tomes, each apart
by himſelf, and then conferred a long time together
about them, of all which they have given us an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
Account in many Meetings. We have alſo our ſelf
examined this Book with all poſſible Attention, and
have found that this Work is ſo far from being uſeful
to the Church, that it would be on the contrary very
prejudicial, if we ſhould allow the Sale of it. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
we deſired to hear the Author's Defences, that
ſo we might know his Sentiments and preſent Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
for which Cauſe we have granted him as favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
an Audience as was poſſible, for ſeveral Meetings,
in the preſence of the ſame Doctors: And as we
have found in him an entire Submiſſion to all we ſhould
ordain, having put into our Hands a Writing ſigned
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94359:5"/>
by himſelf, which is annexed to theſe Preſents, in
which of the Twelve Articles which we judged chiefly
cenſurable in his Book, he doth retract many Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
advanced by him, and teſtifies in general, that
he ſubmits himſelf to our Judgment without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction
or reſervation. And as this abſolute Submiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
(without which we could not think his Writings
ſufficient, there being in his Book many Propoſitions
cenſurable, which he doth not touch in his Writing)
ſecures his Religion, and obliges us to ſpare his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
ſo there remains nothing more to be done, but
to give Sentence againſt the Doctrine of his Book.
We could have wiſhed that this Work might have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
only a limited Cenſure, and ſo would have
been ſatisfied to have marked out of the Author ſuch
Changes as he ſhould make for ſaving the reſt of it,
without proceeding to a full Condemnation, and to an
entire Suppreſſion of it. But the Evil being almoſt
ſpread through the whole Work, we could not diſpence
with the Condemnation of this Book, but are obliged
to prohibit the Reading it to all Perſons, whom it
hath pleaſed God to ſubmit to our Conduct, for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
the Prejudice which it might otherwiſe do
amongſt People, if ſuch a ſtop were not put to it, that
the Church may receive no more Scandal, nor Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
get any Occaſion of drawing Advantage againſt
the Catholicks. For theſe Reaſons after having im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored
the Grace of the Holy Ghoſt to beſeech his
Guidance of us, we have Condemned, and do Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
the Book, entituled, <hi>A New Library of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtick
Authors,</hi> &amp;c. by Monſieur <hi>Ellies Du Pin,</hi> Doctor
of the Faculty of <hi>Paris,</hi> &amp;c. as containing many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
falſe, raſh, ſcandalous, offenſive to pious Ears,
tending to weaken the Proofs of Tradition about the
Authority of the Canonical Books, and many other
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94359:6"/>
Articles of Faith; Injurious to Oecumenical Councils,
to the Holy Apoſtolical See, and to the Fathers of the
Church; Erroneous and leading to ſeveral Hereſies.
We moſt ſtrictly, and under the Penalties preſcribed
by Law, forbid the Reading of this Book to all our
Dioceſans of either Sex, or the cauſing or adviſing it
to be Read by any Perſon, or having it in their
Houſes, or any other where; enjoyning them under

               <p>THere being ſome Perſons, who after the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of my Books of the <hi>New Library of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtick
Authors,</hi> have teſtified that they were offended
at many places; and thoſe Complaints being carried
to my Lord Archbiſhop of <hi>Paris;</hi> who, in Quality of
proper Judge of Doctrine, hath taken them into his
Conſideration, and named ſome Doctors to ſearch
narrowly into this Work, and make a Relation of the
ſame to him. I do my ſelf acknowledge by a ſerious
Reflection on their Obſervations that there has indeed
dropt from me ſome Expreſſions which are hard, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure,
and that might give ſome Offence to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
ſome alſo which may not be true, and which,
againſt my Deſign, may be brought againſt the Truth,
for which I ſhall always have a Reſpect, and which
I do believe, ought to be maintained in the Church.</p>
               <p>This obligeth me, ſeeing my Lord the Archbiſhop
hath had the Goodneſs to diſcover the ſame to me in
three different Aſſemblies, in which I have not been leſs
touched with his Goodneſs and Paternal Charity, than
inſtructed by his great and clear Light, in the preſence
of the Doctors to whom he committed the Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of my Book, and with whom he himſelf did
Examine it: I ſay, this obligeth me to give, to what
is obſcure in that Work, the Illuſtrations which he
hath judged, and which I may ſelf have perceived ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
to mollify the Expreſſions which are too hard,
and to make an Authentick Declaration concerning
thoſe which may bear an Ill Senſe, that it may appear
that my Sentiments are Orthodox, and that I have
tranſgreſſed only by inadvertency, not ſufficienly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94359:7"/>
the Terms uſed, nor the Conſequences which might

               <p>To keepthe ſame Order which my Lord the Archbiſhop him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
obſerved, when he required an Account of all theſe Places.</p>
               <p n="1">I. I do firſt acknowledge, as I have always owned for
Sacred and Canonical Books, all thoſe which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the Canon of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> Seſſ. 4.
in all their Parts. I am perſuaded that they were all writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by the Inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt; that it is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in any wiſe to doubt of their Canonicalneſs, after the
Deciſion of the Church; and tho' ſome were not received
as Canonical at firſt by ſome particular Churches, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
true that they were owned in the firſt Ages of the
Church, for Books of Holy Scripture, and quoted as ſuch by
many Fathers. Therefore theſe indefinite Expreſſions in
my Book, <hi>The Antient Chriſtians followed the Jewiſh Canon
in the Books of the Old Teſtament</hi> (Prel. Diſſert. p. 27.) <hi>they
did not own any other Canonical Books of the Old Teſtament,
but thoſe which were in the Canon of the</hi> Jews, <hi>Tom.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 181.
ought not to be underſtood generally of all Churches, nor
of all the Fathers in the Three firſt Centuries. My Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
being only, tho' my Terms ſeem more general, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh
the Books which have been always received as Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical
through all Churches, and of which there was never
any Ground to doubt in any Church, called for this cauſe
<hi>Proto-Canonical,</hi> from thoſe who have not always been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
as ſuch through all the Churches, and of whoſe Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calneſs
ſome have doubted, named therefore <hi>Deutero Canonical.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I did think that I might hold with <hi>Sixtus Senenſis,</hi> that the
Canonicalneſs of the ſix laſt Chapters of <hi>Eſther</hi> might be called
in queſtion, and that I might ſay with him, that it was an
Addition to the Book of <hi>Eſther,</hi> not comprehended in the
Canon of the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> But ſeeing they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
me, that we ought not to apply this Solution to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
Terms of the Council, which admits all theſe Books
contained in its Catalogue for Canonical, both in whole,
and in all their Parts, as they have been in uſe to be read
in the Catholick Church; <hi>Libros integros cum omnibus ſuis
partibus prout in Eccleſia legi Catholici conſueverunt.</hi> I have
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94359:7"/>
therefore changed my Sentiment, and do now own them
for Canonical, and ſo much the rather, becauſe the Church
hath taken out of them Epiſtles and Prayers to be ſaid in its
Office; and <hi>Origen,</hi> St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> and other Fathers
do quote Paſſages out of them. The moſt part of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
which I formerly brought, do only prove that theſe
Chapters have another Author than the reſt of the Book of
<hi>Eſther,</hi> except as to ſome apparent Contradictions in Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology
or Hiſtory which may be eaſily reconciled.</p>
               <p n="2">II. As to the ſecond Article which concerns Tradition,
of which the Fathers are Witneſſes, and their Writings the
Channel by which it is conveyed to us. I confeſs that I have
forſaken ſome Fathers in Points of Faith, in which I ought
to have defended them, as St. <hi>Juſtin</hi> and St. <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Immortality of the Soul, and the Eternal Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments
of the damned, becauſe of two difficult Paſſages
which ought to be explained by a great many others, where
they do acknowledge the Immortality of the Soul, and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Puniſhments of the damned, as I have remarked of St. <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi>
in the Note <hi>x, p.</hi> 54 by quoting the Paſſages of this Father,
where he calls the Puniſhments of the damned, Eternal, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
this word Eternal to the Puniſhments which ſhould
once have an end: And as we can prove from St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi>
by many of his Paſſages, and particularly by that of the 47th.
Chapter of the Third Book, where he ſaith, That the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
of thoſe who believe not the Goſpel, is not only
Temporal but alſo Eternal; <hi>non ſolum temporalis ſed &amp; aeterna.</hi>
I have not aſcribed the ſame Sentiment to St. <hi>Hilary,</hi> nor
yet to St. <hi>Cyril;</hi> for when I ſaid that St. <hi>Hilary</hi> aſſerted, that
<hi>the wicked ſhould be annihilated by the Fire of Hell,</hi> Tom. 2. p. 76.
<hi>This,</hi> as this Father ſaith, <hi>is not that they ſhould be totally an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilated,
but that they are reduced to an Eſtate which approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to nothing;</hi> non in nihilum diſſoluti, ſed in inane ac leve
aridumque protriti. And as to St. <hi>Cyril,</hi> I confeſs, that by
a miſtake, I have ſlipt into the Verſion of his Paſſage, the
Name of Jeſus Chriſt inſtead of that of God, tranſlating <hi>the
Soul is immortal becauſe of Jeſus Chriſt who gave it immortality,</hi>
where it ſhould be tranſlated, <hi>becauſe of God who gave it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality;</hi>
but I had no intention to aſcribe to him by this,
any Error concerning the Immortality of the Soul.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:94359:8"/>
As to Original Sin, I acknowledge it's a Doctrine of Faith
which hath always been believed in the Church, it is a Truth
of which none ſhall find that I ever doubted, but when I
aſſerted, <hi>that St.</hi> Cyprian <hi>was the firſt that had ſpoken very
clearly of it,</hi> Tom. 1. p. 142. <hi>that the Fathers of the three firſt
Ages ſeem not to be all agreed, whether Children were born in
ſin and worthy of damnation,</hi> p. 180. I did not pretend by
this, to deny that the firſt Fathers did own it, but I intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
only that they had not ſpoke ſo clearly of it as St. <hi>Cyprian.</hi>
However, becauſe this may be brought againſt the Tradition of
this Doctrine, and that moreover I have found that St. <hi>Juſtin,</hi>
St. <hi>Irenaeus, Tertullian,</hi> and <hi>Origen,</hi> do ſpeak very clearly of
Original Sin; I do declare that I will not maintain theſe
Propofitions, nor inſiſt upon the Anſwers which I have given
to the Paſſages of theſe Authors, to prove that they did not
teach Original Sin ſo clearly as St. <hi>Cyprian.</hi> I acknowledge
alſo, that St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> believed Original Sin, even as St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin</hi>
hath explained it ſince, excepting the Puniſhment of
Senſe for Children dead without Baptiſm, and that he hath
not made this Sin conſiſt in the inclination to Evil only, but
alſo in the Guilt which is the Principle of it. In this Senſe
is to be underſtood what I have ſaid of the Agreement of his
Opinion with that of Divines <hi>(Tom.</hi> 3. <hi>Part.</hi> I. <hi>p.</hi> 35.) which
I would not oppoſe to that of St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> as to the main, but
only as to the way of ſpeaking; and as to that Puniſhment of
Senſe inflicted on Children dead without Baptiſm; I would
have it acknowledged, that theſe Two Fathers are entirely
agreed as to the main Point of Doctrine, and that both of
them taught, that Children were born in Sin, and that they
were purged of it by Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>I acknowledge that the Name of the Mother of God,
which the Church giveth to the Virgin, is of Apoſtolical Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
and that it is not only an Expreſſion <hi>Innocent,</hi> but
<hi>Sacred</hi> in all times of the Church, and that not only <hi>we
may,</hi> but alſo that we ought to call the Virgin the Mother
of God, ſeeing ſhe is ſo really; and whereever I have uſed
the Term <hi>Innocent</hi> upon the Occaſion of this Name of the
Mother of God; I have not intended that it had no more
but this Quality, but deſigned to ſhew how far the Obſtinacy
and Error of <hi>Neſtorius</hi> reached, who denied, not only that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:94359:8"/>
we ought to uſe this expreſſion, but even alſo that we might
do it lawfully.</p>
               <p>I do profeſs to own the Doctrine of Purgatory as it is held
in the Church, and as it hath been defined in the Councils of
<hi>Florence</hi> and <hi>Trent,</hi> and that it is a Tenet well eſtabliſhed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Doctrines of the Fathers of the three firſt Ages, and
ſo it muſt not be ſaid Univerſally, as I have done in my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to the Remarks, <hi>P.</hi> 61 and 64. <hi>that we find nothing of it poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
in the Fathers of the firſt three Ages, and that they have
not taught, by their Writings, the Doctrine of Purgatory as we have
it now.</hi> Expreſſions which I only deſigned in reference to
ſome Circumſtances of Purgatory differently explained by
Divines, and which ſhould not prejudice the Faith of the
Church, nor the Subſtance of the Doctrine Defined in the
Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> diſowning whatſoever other Senſe may
be put upon it.</p>
               <p>What I have ſaid in the Anſwer to the Remarks, <hi>P.</hi> 144.
of the New Syſtem which St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> formed about Grace
and Predeſtination, ought to be underſtood only of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
how Grace operateth by it ſelf, and of the free Predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for Glory, and of ſome other Queſtions which are ſtill
debated amongſt Catholick Divines, about which the Church
hath determined nothing; and not of the neceſſity of Grace,
which I have acknowledged always to have been believed in
the Church, <hi>Ibid. P.</hi> 145. And in the abridgment of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the three firſt Ages. It is true, I have ſaid in one
place <hi>that St.</hi> Cyprian <hi>is the firſt who ſpoke very clearly of the
neceſſity of the Grace of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> but I have not pretended
that others did not ſpeak clearly of it, ſeeing I my ſelf have
remarked, when ſpeaking of the Works of St. <hi>Juſtin,</hi> St. <hi>Irenoeus,</hi>
St. <hi>Clement,</hi> and many other Fathers, that they taught it. I
therefore only intended to ſay that St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſpoke of it more
ſtrongly and more frequently than any other.</p>
               <p>When relating the Sentiments of the <hi>Semipelagians,</hi> I did
not ſufficiently diſtinguiſh their Errors, from ſome Catholick
Truths, which they alſo Taught, ſuch as the Death of Jeſus
Chriſt for the Salvation of all Men, I am therefore obliged
to advertiſe that I never intended to confound the one with
the other. It has alſo happened in relating diverſe Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> that I have ſometimes uſed Terms,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:94359:9"/>
which takenſtrictly might lead to Error, as taking <hi>free and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
for the ſame thing, and oppoſing only the neceſſity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint
to liberty;</hi> which is very far from my Thoughts, my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
being to keep by the Definition of the Church, and the
Papal Conſtitutions received by it.</p>
               <p>I acknowledg I was deceived when I ſaid,<hi> That commonly in
the three firſt Ages, they did not give the name of Altar to the
Sacred Table, upon which they Celebrated the Euchariſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I believe concerning the Sacrament of Penance, That in
the Ancient Church they diſtinguiſhed three ſorts of Sins;
Crimes great, hainous, and known ſubjected to Publick Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance;
Sins Venial and very light, which may be remitted
by inward Repentance alone; and Sins Mortal leſs hainous
than the firſt, becauſe Secret, which yet it is neceſſary to
bring under the Diſcipline of the Church, without which
the Remiſſion of a Mortal ſin cannot be obtained; for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
and Abſolution are of Divine Inſtitution, and have
always been believed neceſſary for the Remiſſion of all Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Sins. So that I diſown all the Conſequences and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Inſtances, which may be drawn from what I have ſaid of
<hi>Publick and dayly Repentance,</hi> Tom. 3. Part 1. Part 2. Tom 2.
and when I have ſaid Tom. 5. p. 9. <hi>That Confeſſion of all ſorts
of Sins was a Pious Practice, very common amongſt Chriſtians
in the ſixth Age.</hi> I do not pretend thereby that it was not
in uſe before for Venial Sins alſo, but only that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions
of theſe Sins were at that time become more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
than formerly.</p>
               <p>I acknowledg all that is contained in the ſeventh Canon
of the twenty fourth Seſſion of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and
even as it is diſtinguiſhed there: that is to ſay, the Sentence
which Anathematizes thoſe who believe the Church Errs in
the Point of the indiſſolubility of Marriage as an Article of
Faith; and that Marriage cannot be ſo diſſolved, even in the
caſe of Adultery, as that it ſhould be lawful for either Party
to Marry whilſt the other is living, as being a Doctrin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in the Church from the beginning, and which agrees
with the Doctrin of the Evangeliſts and Apoſtles. And tho
there be ſome Divines, who from the obſervation of <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vicin,</hi>
upon the Remonſtrance of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Ambaſſadors,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:94359:9"/>
occaſioned by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> to the Council, while they were form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this Article, do believe that what is ſaid in the Canon,
<hi>That the Church hath taught, and doth teach, agreeably to the Doctrin
of the Goſpel, and of the Apoſtle concerning the indiſſolubility of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
even in the Caſe of Adultery,</hi> is not an Article of Faith,
yet I think my ſelf obliged to follow what the Council ſaid.
And tho it may be thought that I have ſpoke againſt it, <hi>Tom.</hi> 1.
<hi>p.</hi> 182. in my Anſwer to the <hi>Remarks,</hi> p. 71. and in many
other places, yet I do declare that I had no deſign of denying
that this Doctrin was Evangelical and Apoſtolical, but only to
obſerve, that ſome did practiſe contrary thereunto; and if I
were to handle this matter over again, I ſhould apply my
ſelf as much to prove this Sentiment as I have ſeemed to
neglect it.</p>
               <p>When I bring in <hi>Jobius</hi> the Monk, ſpeaking of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of the Proceſſion of the Son and of the Holy Ghoſt,
and ſaying, <hi>Tom.</hi> 4. <hi>p.</hi> 37. <hi>That the one is called the Son, and
the other the Holy Ghoſt, becauſe ſuch has been the cuſtom, and that
Men do expreſs as they can the differences of the Divine Perſons,
tho they do not comprehend them,</hi> which Sentiment I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended.
I had no deſign to lay that <hi>difference</hi> merely upon
our way of ſpeaking and thinking, as if there was not a very
real one, and altogether independent from our Thoughts
and Expreſſions, betwixt the Generation of the Word and
the Proceſſion of the Holy Ghoſt; the firſt of which is
truly a Generation, and the other is not, but only the
mind of Man can neither conceive nor imagin wherein it
conſiſts.</p>
               <p>I had no Reaſon to commend that of <hi>Socrates</hi> as a judicious
Obſervation, when he ſaith, that the Queſtion <hi>About the day
of the Celebration of</hi> Eaſter <hi>was of ſmall Conſequence,</hi> ſeeing
the Church hath made it a Capital Head of Diſcipline.</p>
               <p n="3">III. As to the third Head which concerns Councils, I do
proteſt that I have always had in my Heart a ſincere and
true reſpect, ſuch as every Catholick ought to have, for
Councils, and I have conſidered the Decrees of General
Councils, in Matters of Doctrin, as Articles of Faith. I
have always acknowledged the advantage, and alſo on ſome
occaſions the neceſſity of aſſembling them; being perſuaded
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:94359:10"/>
that this is the moſt proper and moſt effectual means, and
ſometimes alſo neceſſary to ſuppreſs Error, to eſtabliſh the
Catholick Doctrin, and to remedy the diſorders and abuſes
which the Enemies of the Church would introduce into the
world. Thus, Councils in themſelves muſt always have a
good end, and produce good effects: but it happens ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
through the malice of Men, and the obſtinacy of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
that they do not preſently give Peace, but Debates
continue, and the Enemies of the Church oppoſe their Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
and Error to Juſtice and Truth, which nevertheleſs
hath always the Victory in the end, by the particular Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which God gives to his Church, againſt which the Gates
of Hell, that is to ſay, Hereſies and Errors ſhall never prevail.
It is in this Senſe that I would have underſtood what I have
ſaid, <hi>viz. That it is very ſeldom that General Councils, held up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
matters of Faith, procure the Churches Peace by their deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.</hi>
Which is not, becauſe Councils are not a means of
Peace, or do not always eſpouſe the Party which they ought
to take, but it is through the blindneſs and fury of Hereticks,
who, being incenſed and confounded to ſee themſelves juſtly
condemned, do their utmoſt endeavours againſt the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox
Doctrin Eſtabliſhed infallibly; as I fully explained it by
the inſtances of the <hi>Arians,</hi> and of the Adverſaries of the
Councils of <hi>Epheſus</hi> and <hi>Chalcedon.</hi> But notwithſtanding all
the Attacks and Oppoſitions of Hereticks, the Definitions of
Councils are the Rule of Faith, and all thoſe who will not
acknowledge them are without the Church, all Catholicks
ſhould ſubmit unto them, and all thoſe who do not ſubmit
are Hereticks. So that the Church is at Peace within it ſelf,
and is only troubled from without by the Perſecution, the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks,
and Violence of thoſe who are not of it. It is thus
that I would have my words taken, having never had any
intention to maintain, nor even to ſay, that after the Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Faith by a General Council, thoſe who do not ſubmit
to it could belong to the Church.</p>
               <p>The diſtinction which I have uſed in many places, <hi>Tom.</hi> 1.
of <hi>Articles Fundamental and not Fundamental, Principal and
not Principal,</hi> is very different from the Senſe which Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
give to theſe Terms; for by <hi>Articles Fundamental and
Principal,</hi> I underſtand thoſe which we are obliged to believe
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:94359:10"/>
Explicitely, or which are contained in the Creed and not in
the Senſe of Hereticks, who pretend that there may be Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
framed by the Church which may be denied.</p>
               <p>Tho I believe not that I have given any occaſion of doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Orthodoxy of my Faith concerning <hi>the Hypoſtatical
Union of the two Natures in Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> however, becauſe
a Catholick Doctor cannot be far enough from all ſort of ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Hereſie, I proteſt before God, that I do believe
firmly that there are in Jeſus Chriſt two Natures, united in
one only Perſon by an Hypoſtatical Union, to wit, the Divine
Nature and the Humane; that Jeſus Chriſt is both true God,
and true Man together, and that I am ready to defend this
Catholick Truth even to the laſt drop of my blood. That I
do Anathematize the Error of <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> his Perſon, and
Party, and that I have a ſincere and true reſpect for the Holy
Council of <hi>Epheſus.</hi> And becauſe ſome have judged, that
without any deſign, there has eſcaped me, in my Relation,
things which may give a diſadvantageous Idea of that Affair,
and Omitted Matters of Fact which may be to its advantage.
I thought it my duty to make here a ſhort review for taking
away all occaſion of Scandal and Complaint. Having ſaid,
Tom. 3. Part 2. p. 191. <hi>That St.</hi> Cyril <hi>did advertiſe the Monks
of</hi> Egypt, <hi>that it were better not to move theſe kinds of abſtracted
queſtions, which could not be of any uſe.</hi> This ought not to be
applied to the Defenders of the Catholick Doctrin againſt
<hi>Neſtorius,</hi> but to that Heretick and his Party who excited theſe
Debates, by ſowing their Novelties, and publiſhing their
Errors.</p>
               <p>That Expreſſion which I uſed, <hi>p.</hi> 192. <hi>viz. St.</hi> Cyril <hi>fearing that
thoſe of his Party:</hi> having given occaſion to ſome to think that
I did conſider St. <hi>Cyril</hi> as the Head of a Party like to that of
<hi>Neſtorius,</hi> this obligeth me to declare that there is nothing
farther from my Thought, and that on the contrary I do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
St. <hi>Cyril</hi> as a Defender of the Catholick Doctrin, and
<hi>Neſtorius</hi> as the Head of a Hereſie. And therefore if any
think, that the word <hi>Party</hi> cannot be taken in a good
Senſe, I beg Pardon for having uſed it in that place, and
elſewhere, declaring that it was never my Thought to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
or to put into the Ballance the Cauſe of the Church, of
which St. <hi>Cyril</hi> was the Defender, with that of <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> who
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:94359:11"/>
was in Hereſie. I forgot to advertiſe, that the Reproaches,
contained in the Letter of the Emperor to St. <hi>Cyril,</hi> related
<hi>p.</hi> 195. were not true, and that this Prince was ſurpriſed by
the Enemies of this Saint.</p>
               <p>I have obſerved in two different places, <hi>p.</hi> 196. and <hi>p.</hi> 214.
That the Council was lawfully held before the arrival of thoſe
from the Eaſt, ſeeing the time of its Indiction was paſſed, and
that they themſelves believed that they might begin it without
them. I add now, that as the Letter of St. <hi>Cyril</hi> to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
imports, they could not put off the Council longer,
becauſe there were Biſhops who could not ſtay longer in a
Country ſo far from their own; that many Biſhops were in
danger of dying, becauſe the Air of <hi>Epheſus</hi> did not agree
with them; that ſome were already Dead, and that all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
that the Council might be held as ſoon as poſſible.
Having obſerved, <hi>p.</hi> 196. <hi>That the Biſhops did aſſemble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
altho the Legats from the Holy See were not come, and
notwithſtanding the oppoſition of threeſcore and eight Biſhops,</hi> yet
I intended not by this to inſinuate, that they were in the
wrong for aſſembling themſelves; nor that there was any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
due to that oppoſition. As to the number of the Biſhops
of the Council, having ſaid <hi>That the Subſcriptions prove one
hundred and ſixty.</hi> I juſtifie ſufficiently what the Council
ſaith, <hi>viz.</hi> That they were near two hundred, and do ſhew
the falſhood of what is alledged by the Eaſterns that they
were only fourſcore.</p>
               <p>P. 196. Having related that <hi>Candidian.</hi> ſaid, <hi>That he had
read his Commiſſion againſt his will;</hi> it muſt be remarked, that
this bribed Officer is not to be believed in this matter, and
that 'tis only a pretence which he hath ſince invented.</p>
               <p>P. 197. Having related all that paſſed in the firſt Seſſion of
the Council of <hi>Epheſus:</hi> I had no intention to accuſe that
Council of Precipitation in its Judgment; and I do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
truly that there was none, becauſe the matter was
wholly prepared, and, as I have ſaid elſewhere, 'tis evident
that <hi>Neſtorius</hi> was in an Error.</p>
               <p>When I ſaid, <hi>That there were in the Subſcriptions of
the Letters from the Eaſterns more than fifty Biſhops, tho
St.</hi> Cyril <hi>only obſerves thirty ſix.</hi> I intended not to accuſe
<hi>St.</hi> Cyril of falſhood, but it may be that the Eaſterns might
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:94359:11"/>
get ſome Biſhops, who were not preſent, to ſign afterwards.</p>
               <p>All that is ſaid by <hi>Candidian</hi> deſerves no Credit, being
related by a Man ſuſpected and Bribed: nor ought we
to give any more Faith to what the Eaſterns write in their
Letters, nor to what <hi>Acacius</hi> of <hi>Berea</hi> ſaith of the Corruption
of the Emperors Officers by <hi>John</hi> the Phyſician, and Friend
of St. <hi>Cyril,</hi> of which I have ſpoken.</p>
               <p>Having<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſaid <hi>That the event of what paſſed at</hi> Epheſus,
<hi>was, if I may ſo ſay, under the Power of the Emperor, and that
the ſucceſs of the Council depended upon the Reſolutions the Court
ſhould take,</hi> I did not thereby intend, that the Definition of the
Council of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and the Condemnation of <hi>Neſtorius</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
on the Will of the Emperor, as to the Right and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
of ſubmitting thereto, but only as to the External Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
and Publication. For it muſt have happened, if the
Emperor had continued to be deceived, that he would have
Perſecuted the Catholicks, oppoſed the Truth, and protected
Violence and Error for ſometime; but this is nothing to the
Validity of the Council, or the Solidity of its Deciſion,
which no ways depended on the Judgment of the Emperor,
nor on the Reſolutions of the Court.</p>
               <p>Having ſaid <hi>P.</hi> 201. <hi>That the Emperor conſented to the depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of</hi> Neſtorius, <hi>and to that of St.</hi> Cyril <hi>and</hi> Memnon, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of their Caballing.</hi> I deſigned not to approve this Conduct
of the Emperor, nor to accuſe St. <hi>Cyril</hi> of Caballing, but only to
mark, that the Emperor was prepoſſeſſed falſly by <hi>Acacius</hi> of
<hi>Berea,</hi> that St. <hi>Cyril</hi> and <hi>Memnon</hi> had Caballed together.</p>
               <p>Tho it ſeems to me, that I have given very ſolid Anſwers to
the Objections, which I have brought againſt the Council of
<hi>Epheſus;</hi> nevertheleſs, becauſe ſome have been offended at
the Objections, I agree with them, that I had done better
not to have related them in a <hi>Frenck</hi> Book. We may alſo
add to the Anſwers, that there was nothing done in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
with Precipitation. That all the Matter was prepared and
diſcuſſed beforehand. That St. <hi>Cyril</hi> held it not only at the
time when it ought to have been held, but that it was morally
impoſſible to delay it. That the <hi>Zeal</hi> which actuated this
Father was commendable and according to knowledge. That
there came Biſhops from the fartheſt parts who arrived much
before <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Antioch.</hi> That 'tis certain that <hi>John</hi> of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch</hi>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:94359:12"/>
deſigned not to come to the Council; and that he was
very glad to have it begun, that he might have a pretext for
keeping away from it. That <hi>Neſtorius</hi> was ſufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
out of his own Writings of not admitting a real and
Hypoſtatical Union in Jeſus Chriſt. That there is no regard
to be had to the Judgment of <hi>Iſidorus Dam.</hi> who only ſpoke
by confuſed Reports. That the Error of <hi>Neſtorius</hi> was ſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
and ſo horrible, that it was juſt to Condem it in ſuch
Terms as might denote the horror which we ought to have for
his Hereſie, ſuch as theſe, <hi>Neſtorius</hi> another <hi>Judas, Tom.</hi> 3.
<hi>Part</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 2 14. That they did examin carefully, and related
faithfully the Extracts of <hi>Neſtorius</hi>'s Books in this Synod; and
laſtly, that all was tranſacted there Legally and Canonically.
As to the Sentiment of <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> it is true that he never durſt
openly ſay, that there were two Chriſts and two Perſons, but
he ſaid what was equivalent, denying the Hypoſtatical Union
of the two Natures, admitting only a Moral Union betwixt
them, as appears by a great many paſſages in his Writings.
He held not the Error of <hi>Paulus Samoſatenus,</hi> and of <hi>Arius</hi>
concerning the Divinity of the Word, who did not admit of
any Union of the Divine Nature with the Human, as Father
<hi>Garner</hi> hath obſerved before me, but he erred expreſly, and
in formal Terms, concerning this Union, admitting only,
betwixt the two Natures, an Union Moral and Apparent,
and not Real and Subſtantial: of which Error it was eaſie to
convince him by his Writings, tho he diſguiſed it in ſome
places. So when I ſay. <hi>Tom.</hi> 3. <hi>Part</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 42. <hi>That if we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
to his Writings, it doth appear that he hath maintained, that
the Word was united with the Humane Nature by a very intimate
and ſtrict union.</hi> However, this is not to to be underſtood of
his true Sentiment, nor of all that he hath ſaid, but only of
ſome places in which he hath affected, as Hereticks do, the
uſe of Catholick Terms. For in many other place he diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
viſibly his Error, as I have marked <hi>Page</hi> 43. <hi>p.</hi> 215. and
if their be any Expreſſions in my Work which may give ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Idea of him, I declare that 'tis againſt my intention, and
I do beſeech the Reader to take them in this Senſe. And when
Iſaid <hi>p.</hi> 42. <hi>That he always ſaid that he could not own that God
was born, that God ſuffered, that God died, and that his Error
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:94359:12"/>
conſiſted only in this;</hi> I in no wiſe pretend to make it conſiſt
only in the refuſal which he made of theſe Expreſſions, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
that he did really admit a Moral Union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the two Natures, and that he would have two Perſons
in Jeſus Chriſt, which was the reaſon why he would not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the Conſequences of the Unity of one Perſon alone.</p>
               <p>Theſe words in the beginning of the Hiſtory of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of<hi> Chalcedon, Tom. 3. Part 2. p. 230. That this Aſſembly had
turned into a confuſed Rout, if the Commiſſaries of the Emperor
had not put a ſtop to the tumultuary Exclamations which were
made there, by advertiſing the Biſhops that it was unworthy of
them to behave themſelves after ſuch a manner. </hi>I ſay, theſe
words not appearing reſpectful enough to that Council which
I honour, I wiſh I had not uſed them, tho' I did it inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently,
and without any bad intention.</p>
               <p>When I ſaid, <hi>Tom.</hi> 4. <hi>pag.</hi> 146. <hi>That it had been better not to
have moved the affair of the three Chapters,</hi> I deſigned that
this Cenſure ſhould only fall upon what preceded the time
of the Council, and on the Perſon of <hi>Theodorus,</hi> who ſtirred
up <hi>Juſtinian</hi> to puſh on this Affair. As to the Council, I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
that as Affairs ſtood then, and ſeeing how far the
Aſſembly was carried on, that it was abſolutely neceſſary for the
good of the Church to paſs the Condemnation of the three
Chapters, and that all the Catholicks ought to have ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to it; that they had reaſon to condemn <hi>Theodorus</hi> after
his Death, and that that Conduct of Anathematizing the Dead
may be followed, as the Church hath often done ſince; that
they had reaſon alſo to condemn the Letter of <hi>Ibas,</hi> and the
Writings of <hi>Theodoret,</hi> thus I diſown what I have ſaid to the
contrary, <hi>p.</hi> 146. and what follows.</p>
               <p>As to the matter of <hi>Images,</hi> the Worſhip of which is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
in the ſecond Council of <hi>Nice.</hi> I acknowledge that this
Council is a General and Lawful one, and that therefore
there is a perfect ſubmiſſion due to it, acknowledging for an
Article of Faith all which it hath decreed, and that all its
Proofs are not drawn from ſuppoſed Monuments, and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryphal
Paſſages of the Scripture and Fathers which prove no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
that there are there very ſolid Proofs and unanſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
drawn either from Scripture, or the Writings of the
Fathers, or other Pieces of Antiquity. I did not intend to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:94359:13"/>
make any compariſon betwixt this Council and the falſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> againſt <hi>Images,</hi> nor to ſpeak of them as two
oppoſite Parties. I believe very firmly in the one, what I deteſt
in the other, acknowledging with the firſt, a Worſhip Relative,
True and Sincere to be paid to <hi>Images,</hi> out of Reſpect to what
they repreſent, according as it is explained in the Council of
<hi>Trent.</hi> And when I ſaid, <hi>Tom.</hi> 5. <hi>p.</hi> 146. <hi>That Image-worſhip was
eſtabliſhed by the ſimpler and weaker ſort, who ſeeing the Saints
drawn upon Tables for the Inſtruction of thoſe who could not
read, could not forbear to teſtify by external Signs, the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
which they had for the things they repreſented; and that
this worſhip of Images thus eſtabliſhed, was moreover fortified by
the Miracles which were aſcribed to them.</hi> I did not intend
that this was the only Origin of the worſhip of Images, nor
the reaſon of the Progreſs which it made, which was eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
and approved by the Church for very good Reaſons;
and I do acknowledge, that to give it no other Origin, nor
any other Progreſs than this, ſhould be to leſſen the Reſpect
we have for them, and very far from promiting it as I ought.</p>
               <p>What I have ſaid, <hi>page</hi> 147. <hi>That we cannot condemn as
Hereticks, thoſe who will not admit Image-worſhip for ſome
particular Reaſons, either becauſe the Practice of their Church
is otherways, or becauſe they fear thoſe outward Duties ſhould
be miſtaken for Adoration;</hi> or Laſtly, <hi>Becauſe they do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Worſhip of Images to be ſufficiently warranted, ſeeing
to prove it they have alledged a great number of falſe Pieces,
or of impertinent Paſſages that prove nothing.</hi> And what I have
ſaid in the ſame place, <hi>Moreover the proceeding of thoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
could not be blamed, who to ſettle Peace in the Church, and
to re-unite two oppoſite Parties; of which, the one were for
breaking down all Images, and the other for honouring of them,
endeavouring to make their own uſage to be received every where,
and wrote to the Pope reſpectfully about it.</hi> I ſay, theſe are
Expreſſions which have eſcaped me, which I wiſh I had not
uttered; becauſe beſides that, they are too indefinite, and that
taking them in the ut-moſt extent, they may give ground
to think that we ought not at this time to condemn any
who ſhould refuſe by ſome one of theſe Reaſons to honour
Images, tho' my intention was to apply them only to the
Church of <hi>France</hi> in the time of <hi>Charlemain,</hi> to which I have
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:94359:13"/>
afterwards fixed them. Beſides this, they may give occaſion
to think that we may conſider the <hi>Iconolaſts,</hi> as a Party to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated
in the Church, and whom the <hi>French</hi> did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
as Hereticks, tho' it be certain that theſe Enemies of
the Orthodox Faith have always been looked upon as ſuch
by all Catholicks, and that it is certain that the <hi>Iconoclaſts</hi>
and <hi>Claudius</hi> of <hi>Turin,</hi> who was of their Sentiment, were
conſidered as Hereticks, even by thoſe of our <hi>French</hi> who
did not own the Adoration of Images. Therefore left my
words be ſo taken, I am here obliged to ſay, that I never
believed that theſe very Perſons, who do not yet acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the Second Council of <hi>Nice</hi> for lawful, ſhould conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the <hi>Iconoclaſts</hi> as being within the Church, or that they
ſhould tolerate them in it. And when I ſaid, <hi>p.</hi> 133. <hi>That
the Emperor</hi> Conſtantine Copronimus <hi>deſigned to have his
Diſcipline received every where,</hi> ſpeaking of his Deſign to
break down Images, I did not underſtand it of the Heretical
Doctrine of the <hi>Iconoclaſts,</hi> nor did I intend that it ſhould be
thought no Hereſy to uſe Images after that manner.</p>
               <p>When I ſaid, <hi>p.</hi> 148. <hi>That it were fitting to ſuffer no Image
of the Deity and Trinity,</hi> I did not intend to condemn theſe
Images, and I have ſpoken too generally, <hi>that all the moſt
zealous Defenders of Images have condemned them,</hi> which is only
to be found in ſome. I do acknowledge that the Celibacy
of Prieſts and Deacons is a Practice very Holy and moſt
Praiſe worthy, commonly obſerved in the Church from the
firſt three Centuries: and I did not intend to ſay any thing
to the contrary, <hi>Tom.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 183. <hi>Tom.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 248, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">IV. As to the fourth Article which concerns <hi>the Primacy
of the Holy See,</hi> I ought to have collected with more Care what
the Councils, the Fathers, and other Eccleſiaſtical Authors
have ſaid of the <hi>Primacy of the Holy See,</hi> and of the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to have taken occaſion to
remark to the Reader the extent of this Primacy, its Divine
Inſtitution, and its Juriſdiction in all the Church, without
doing prejudice to the true Priviledges of particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
and to the Rights of Biſhops. This did not happen
becauſe I do not believe, or have not always believed this
Primacy of Juriſdiction over all the Church to be of Divine
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:94359:14"/>
Inſtitution, as I have obſerved it, <hi>Tom.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 90. and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
in theſe very Terms, <hi>The Biſhop of the Church if</hi> Rome
<hi>was in poſſeſſion of the Primacy, which he received from Jeſus
Chriſt, as being Succeſſor of St.</hi> Peter, <hi>Prince of the Apoſtles:
This Primacy was given him with great Priviledges and great
Prerogatives in all the Church, for maintaining in it the Faith,
and for cauſing the Holy Canons to be obſerved.</hi> But I ſhould
have inſiſted more upon it, and ought to have ſpoken of it
oftner, to confirm it by greater Proofs, and not to have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected
the doing of this as I may ſeem to have done, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by omitting very fair Paſſages of Antiquity upon this
Head, or not giving theſe Paſſages all their force in my
Tranſlations; as when I bring the Paſſage of the 53 Epiſtle
of St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> to Pope <hi>Cornelius,</hi> I have omitted theſe words;
<hi>Nec cogitare eos eſſe Romanos quorum fides Apoſtolo predicante
laudata eſt, &amp; ad quos perfidia habere non poſſit acceſſum,</hi> and to
ſome other Paſſages which are of the ſame Subject. Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Condemnation of <hi>Neſtorius</hi> by the Council of <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi>
I have tranſlated theſe words, <hi>Coacti per ſacros Canones
&amp; Epiſtolam Celeſtini, thus we have been conſtrained according
to the Letter of</hi> Celeſtine, which ought to have been lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
tranſlated thus, <hi>We have been conſtrained by the Holy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,
and by the Letter of</hi> Celeſtine. As alſo the Council of
<hi>Calcedon</hi> ſpeaking of the re eſtabliſhment of <hi>Theodoret</hi> in his
Biſhoprick by Pope St. <hi>Leo;</hi> I have uſed an Expreſſion which
doth not give the Terms of the Council all their force; for,
<hi>reſtituit ei Epiſcopatum,</hi> is tranſlated thus, <hi>he owned him for
Biſhop.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When I ſaid in the Advertiſement of <hi>Tom.</hi> 5. <hi>That the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
ſerved to enlarge the Authority of the Pope;</hi> theſe words
ought to be underſtood of the actual extent of his Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and not of his right of Primacy.</p>
               <p>When I made mention of the Complements, <hi>Tom.</hi> 3.
<hi>Part</hi> 1. and <hi>Part</hi> 2. which St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> and <hi>Theodoret</hi> gave
to the greatneſs of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> when writing
to the Popes, I did not deſign Complements which are not
founded upon Truth, but do acknowledge that theſe Praiſes
are very true.</p>
               <p>I cannot but diſapprove the Liberty which I have taken
to ſpeak of ſome Holy Popes with very little reſpect, and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:94359:14"/>
amongſt others, of Pope St.<hi> Cornelius, </hi>whom I have too much
accuſed of<hi> Weakneſs </hi>in the Defence of St.<hi> Cyprian; </hi>of Pope
St.<hi> Stephen, </hi>whom I have taxed with<hi> exceſſive Paſſions, Heat,</hi>and<hi> Fierceneſs. </hi>Tom.<hi> 1. </hi>p.<hi> 118, &amp;c. </hi>and of whom I ſaid,<hi> That
it was very probable that he fell into the Error of Re-baptizing
all Hereticks, however they had been baptized; </hi>of Pope<hi> Zoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi>by ſaying,<hi> That he had a deſign to enlarge his Authority,
for which cauſe it was that he entered upon the defence of </hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtius;
of St.<hi> Innocent, </hi>by obſerving<hi> that he was very jealous
of the Greatneſs and Authority of the Church of </hi>Rome,<hi> and very
tenacious of his Rights, and that he wrote tolerably well; </hi>of
St.<hi> Leo, </hi>of whom I ſaid,<hi> Tom. 3. Part 2 p. 110. That he ſought
all occaſions to ſhew his Authority; </hi>and of what I may have
ſaid in ſome other places.</p>
               <p n="5">V. As to the fifth Article, which concerns Hereſy and
Hereticks, I may in ſome places have ſpoken of them, tho'
contrary to my intention, in ſuch a manner as does not ſeem
to beget a due averſion to them, and which doth not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
preſerve the Reader, treating too gently thoſe who
furthered or ſupported them. I wiſh I had not ſaid of <hi>Euſebius
That we cannot refuſe him the Quality of a Saint without raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi>
after having aſſerted <hi>that he never approved the Term
Conſubſtantial, altho' he eſtabliſhed a perfect equality betwixt the
Father and the Son.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I did only tranſlate the Paſſage of <hi>Gennadius</hi> about <hi>Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantius,</hi>
and as he ſaid, <hi>That this Man had advanced Frivola,</hi>
I have heedleſly tranſlated this Term by <hi>Bagatels,</hi> tho' it
may bear another ſignification, and point out Errors which
have no foundation: But I do not pretend by this, any ways
to excuſe <hi>Vigilantius</hi> from Errors which he hath advanced
againſt the Invocation of Saints, and the Veneration of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,
nor yet to approve wholly the Sentiment of <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">VI. As to the Sixth Article which concerns <hi>the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements
which I have given to the fourth and fifth Tome.</hi> I
acknowledge that in the <hi>three firſt Pages</hi> there are Expreſſions
very hard, and if they be taken literally and generally, and
not according to my Intention, they are capable of offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:94359:15"/>
Pious Perſons, therefore I wiſh theſe Pages were torn out.
But however Proteſtantss would be in the wrong to draw from
them any Conſequence to the prejudice of the Church, which
I do acknowledge immoveable in her Faith and in her Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
tho' ſhe may change in her Diſcipline. I do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
in particular, that to celebrate the <hi>Maſs</hi> every Day, is a
practice Holy and Commendable which I never deſign to
diſapprove no more than the frequent Confeſſion of Venial
Sins.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. As to the ſeventh Head which concerns the Fathers,
I acknowledge that I have ſpoke of ſome of them in Terms
which teſtify too little reſpect for them; as relating, <hi>Tom.</hi> 1.
<hi>p.</hi> 60. The Judgment of <hi>Phocius</hi> upon the Works of St. <hi>Irenaeus,</hi>
where I ſhould have remarked, that what <hi>Phocius</hi> ſaid in this
place had a reſpect to other Works than thoſe we now have.
It ſeems to me that I have drawn the Picture of <hi>Novatian</hi> too
favourably, and that that of Pope St. <hi>Cornelius</hi> is not favourable
enough. I cannot approve of what I have ſaid of St. <hi>Gregory
Nazianzen, That he had much Piety, but little Conduct and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy
in Buſineſs; that he undertook readily great Matters, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
himſelf preſently of having undertaken them; that he had
in his Life-time there Biſhopricks, and nevertheleſs it cannot be ſaid
that he was lawful Biſhop of any one; that his Humour was Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grine
and Satirical; that he loved Raillery and ſpared no body.</hi>
I wiſh I had not ſaid of St. <hi>Epiphanius, that he had no Judgment,
nor Conduct, nor Policy.</hi> As I approve of what I ſay of St. <hi>Jerome,
that he was without doubt the moſt learned of all the Fathers,</hi> ſo
I diſapprove of what I ſaid afterwards, <hi>p.</hi> beginning with
theſe words; <hi>that he turned his Adverſaries into ridicule,</hi> &amp;c.
When I ſaid of <hi>Severus Sulpitius, that he was too credulous of
Miracles;</hi> and of St. <hi>Paulinus, that he was too much inclined to
believe Miracles, and to have a veneration for Relicks.</hi> I did
not deſign to obſtruct the Belief of Miracles well confirmed,
nor the Veneration due to Relicts well atteſted. By what I
have ſaid of St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> it doth appear how much I eſteem
this Father, whom I own to be one of the greateſt Doctors
of the Church, and moſt obſervant of Tradition, which he
hath only illuſtrated in all that he hath written concerning
the Doctrines of Faith, therefore it ſhould not be taken in ill
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:94359:15"/>
part what I have ſaid, <hi>p. Tom.</hi> 3. <hi>Part</hi> 1. <hi>that be very often
runs away from the Sentiments of thoſe who preceded him to follow
a way altogether New, whether in the Explication of Scripture,
or in the Opinions of Divinity.</hi> Here I did not underſtand
Matters of Faith, but ſome Queſtions which are only regarded
by Divines as ſimple Opinions. In the Character which I
have given of this Father, there may be Expreſſions which are
very hard above all in theſe Pages.</p>
               <p>I have ſpoke with very little reſpect of St. <hi>Cyril</hi> his ſtile and
manner of Expreſſion, when I ſaid, <hi>Tom.</hi> 3. <hi>Part</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> and
<hi>that it is eaſy to write great quickly Volumes of this nature,</hi> &amp;c.
And to what I have obſerved of him to his diſadvantage drawn
from <hi>Phocius,</hi> I ſhould have added what the ſame Author ſays
in his favour, <hi>that he preſſed Hereticks ſo ſtrongly by Texts of
Scripture, and by Logical Reaſonings, that they knew not where to
turn themſelves.</hi> I have teſtified ſufficiently the Reſpect and
Eſteem which I have for St. <hi>Leo;</hi> and when I ſaid, <hi>that he was
not very fertile upon the points of Morality, which he treated very
drily, and after a manner which rather diverted than affected.</hi>
I deſigned only to mark that he did not treat Matters of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
ſo largely and ſo much as other Fathers, tho' I do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
that his Sermons are very uſeful, and his manner
of expreſſing things as capable to perſuade as to pleaſe.</p>
               <p>In the Elogy which I have given to St. <hi>Chryſologus,</hi> I ſhould
have ſtopt at what I ſaid, <hi>p.</hi> without adding, <hi>that he had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
great or high to merit the Name of</hi> Chryſologus. When
I ſaid, ſpeaking of the Book of the <hi>Celeſtial Hierarchy,</hi> and of
that of <hi>Myſtical Divinity, that nothing ſolid, profitable, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
could be drawn from them;</hi> I have ſpoken ſo only
in reference to Popular Inſtructions, acknowledging that there
are in this Book things very good and very profitable for Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity.</p>
               <p>Finally, if there be any other place in my Hiſtory which
may be contrary to the reſpect due to the Holy Fathers, or any
Terms which may be conſtrued to their diſadvantage, it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
my Intention.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. As to the Eighth Article, which concerneth Peniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials,
Caſuiſts, and Scholaſtick Divines; what I have ſaid of the
two firſt in the Advertiſement of the 5 <hi>Tom. p.</hi> I did not
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:94359:16"/>
mean of all Penitentials, nor of all Caſuiſts acknowledging
that there are of them who are profitable and good. As alſo
when I ſaid in my anſwer to the <hi>Remarks, that Scholaſtick Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
would forget nothing of all that might have a reference to
their Metaphyſical Queſtions, whereas theſe good Divines,</hi> &amp;c. I
intended not here to oppoſe good Divines to good Scholaſticks,
but only to thoſe Scholaſticks who inſiſt too much upon ſubtile
Queſtions and Logical Difficulties, without applying themſelves
to the Study of the Scriptures and Tradition, acknowlegding,
that there are good Scholaſtick Divines and that this Science
is uſeful.</p>
               <p>When I ſaid, that St. <hi>Thomas quoted Fathers careleſly, and with
little Judgment,</hi> I intended only that this Saint, as well as many
Writers of his time, did not quote the Authors with any cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
exactneſs, which was the Effect of the Age he lived in,
rather than a perſonal Fault.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. As to the Ninth Article which concerns <hi>the Extracts I
have given of Authors;</hi> it is true, that I have not ſet my ſelf
ſufficiently to diſtinguiſh what is good from what is amiſs in
them, nor to anſwer the difficult Paſſages for enabling the
Readers how to guard themſelves.</p>
               <p n="10">X. As to the Tenth Article, which concerneth <hi>Critical
Queſtions,</hi> I own that we ought to regard the <hi>Apoſtles Creed</hi> as
a formulary of Faith, drawn up by them as to the Subſtance, tho'
ſome Terms were not the ſame in all Churches And as to
the <hi>Inſtitution of Lent,</hi> that we ought to ſay with St. <hi>Leo,</hi> St. <hi>Jerom,</hi>
and other Fathers, that it is of Apoſtolical Inſtitution, and that
the Paſſages, which I have related, do not prove the contrary.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. As to the Eleventh Article, which concerneth Miracles,
Revelations, Apparitions, and pious Practices; when I ſaid that

Speaking of the Wax Candles which they light in honour
of the Martyrs, and relating a paſſage of St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> Tom. 3.
Part 1. p. When I remarked <hi>That in the times of this
Father it was not the cuſtom to light them at Noon,</hi> I intended
not to blame the preſent Cuſtom of the Church, nor to take
from it the Authority which it hath from Antiquity. It muſt
be added that St. <hi>Jerom</hi> does not condemn thoſe who lighted
Wax Candles at Noon out of Devotion, and he teſtifies that
they did it in the Eaſt in all Churches while the Goſpel was a
reading.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. Finally, As to the laſt Head, which concerneth ſome
paſſages, where I ſeem not to have comprehended the Senſe
of the Authors; I make no difficulty of acknowledging that
this may have happened many times, it being very hard not
to be deceived in ſo great a Work, and to keep always an
equal application in reading ſo many great Volumes. But as
I have only done it through inadvertency, ſo I ſhall be always
obliged to thoſe who will advertiſe me of it, and be ready to
ſet me right.</p>
               <p>In particular, I do acknowledg that, <hi>Tom.</hi> 3. <hi>Part</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 52.
I have ill underſtood the Sentiment of <hi>Philoſtorgius</hi> on the
Second Book of <hi>Maccabees,</hi> who doth not ſay that it is <hi>of leſs
Authority than the Firſt,</hi> but of <hi>another Author.</hi> That <hi>Hipatius</hi>
doth not ſay in the Conference with the <hi>Severians, That we
muſt not regulate our ſelves by what every Apoſtle hath Written
and Practiſed concerning the Obſervation of Legal Ceremonies,
but only by what every one hath Practiſed.</hi> That the paſſage of
<hi>Caſſian</hi> related <hi>Tom.</hi> 3. <hi>Part</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 13 ſhould not be underſtood
of the <hi>Law and Obligation to obſerve Lent,</hi> but of the Reaſon
of its Inſtitution. That St. <hi>Jerom</hi> ſaid not in the one hundred
and twenty ninth Letter <hi>That ſome Churches, both</hi> Greek <hi>and</hi>
Latin <hi>received not the Epiſtle to the</hi> Hebrews, <hi>nor the</hi> Revelation,
but only that ſome <hi>Latin</hi> Churches did not receive the Epiſtle
to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> no more than ſome <hi>Greek</hi> Churches the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi>
notwithſtanding that it is authorized by the Teſtimony
of the Antients, and after this manner the Extract of that
Letter muſt be rectified, <hi>p. Tom.</hi> 3. <hi>Part</hi> 1. Behold the
principal things which have been obſerved to me; if there be
yet any other thing in my Works which cauſes any difficulty,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:94359:17"/>
I ſhall he always ready to clear it, to change it, to correct it,
and even to revoke it, if need be; my only deſign, in Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
being to ſeek the Truth, and to Edifie the Church. I
acknowledge with St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> that it is a great favour which
God doth to Authors, when he giveth them the means of
rendering their Works more learned and more exact, by the
Cenſures of thoſe who read them and examin them; and I
do very readily apply to my ſelf theſe words; <hi>Ego autem cum
per eos qui meos labores legunt non ſolum doctior verumetiam e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendatior

I do conſider it as the greateſt happineſs which could befal
me, to have for my Judge the moſt able and learned Prelate
of the Kingdom, to whoſe Judgment I ſhall ever think it my
glory to ſubmit, as I am obliged to it, without Reſtriction
and without Reſervation.</p>

               <p>THIS day the Kings Council entered the Court, and
by <hi>Monſieur Chreſtien Francois de la Moignon,</hi> Advocate
to our Lord the King, did acquaint them, that they thought
it was their Duty to inform them, that the Archbiſhop of
<hi>Paris</hi> had lately Condemned a Book Entituled <hi>Novelle Biblio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theque
des Auteurs Eccleſiaſtiques,</hi> written by Monſieur <hi>Ellies
Du Pin,</hi> Doctor in Divinity of the Faculty of <hi>Paris,</hi> becauſe
it contained Propoſitions contrary to ſound Doctrin. That
the Cognizance of every thing that relates to the Faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the Church, and the deciſion of theſe Matters to the
Biſhops within their reſpective Dioceſe. The ſuppreſſion
of the Books which they Condemn, and the afflictive puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of thoſe who perſiſt in Opinions which haue been
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:94359:17"/>
Cenſured by the Biſhops, belongs to the King's Officers, and
chiefly to this Court, which is the Depoſitory of Sovereign
Juſtice. That they had nothing to object againſt the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of this Book, becauſe he has ſubmitted himſelf to the
Judgment of his Biſhop; and becauſe it appears by a Writing
which he has publiſhed, that he has retracted ſome of thoſe
Propoſitions which had advanced, and explained the reſt
in ſuch a manner as frees them from all ſuſpition of Error;
that they are willing to believe, that the Faults which Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>Ellies Du Pin</hi> fell into, and which deſerved the Cenſure
pronounced againſt him, proceeded rather from the greatneſs
of the Work which he undertook, than from any formed
deſign of introducing new Opinions; and beſides, that there
is a great deal of Learning in his Books. That they were
obliged to take notice to this Court upon this occaſion, of
the care, the application, and vigilauce, which Monſieur the
Archbiſhop of <hi>Paris</hi> ſhews to preſerve ſound Doctrine in his
Dioceſe, and to ſtiffle every thing in the beginning which may
diſturb the Peace and Tranquility of the Church. And
therefore that they could omit nothing in thoſe Stations in
which they had the Honour to be placed, that was neceſſary
to ſecond ſuch good Deſigns; upon which account they were
obliged to demand of this Court, that thoſe Books, which
the Archbiſhop had condemned, might be ſuppreſſed, and
that all Bookſellers ſhould be forbidden to ſell them, till they
ſhall be Corrected according to the Writing of the ſaid <hi>Du
Pin,</hi> annexed to Monſieur the Archbiſhop's Cenſure; and
that the Corrections ſhall have been approved by him. The
King's Learned Council withdrawing, the Matter was taken
into deliberation, and the Court did forbid all Bookſellers,
and others, to ſell or keep by them any Copies of the ſaid
Books, which have hitherto been Printed. And it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
that they ſhould be brought forthwith into the Office
of this Court to be ſuppreſſed, with very expreſs Prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
