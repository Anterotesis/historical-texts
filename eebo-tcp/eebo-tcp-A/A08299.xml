            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

nothing doth true godlines shew it selfe more, then in faithful prayer, with the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere practise of a holy life.

that man, and happie is that family, that haue the holy exercise of prayer in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall vse, though in continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all warre with <hi>Satan,</hi> and his Angels, and instruments.

If such curiositie and carefulnesse be necessarily obserued, in our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication with men, whose breath is in their nosthrels: how much more obseruant and carefull ought we to bee, when wee addresse our selues to speake vnto the <hi>Maiestie of the immortal God?</hi> To intrude abruptly into the presence of this great God, &amp; vnaduisedly to speake vnto him, becommeth not a petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner, but bewrayeth an vnsan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, and an vnprepared heart; rather tempting and dishonouring,
<pb facs="tcp:21499:15"/>
then glorifying of the name of God. And therefore, before we presume to present our petitions to God, in hope to be heard; we must prepare ourselues, not in our outwardge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, onely in eloquence of words, and Pharisaicall outward holines: But in rightly ordering, and dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the affections of the inner man; which, if they be set on carnall, or earthly <hi>vanities,</hi> if our hearts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in <hi>the fruits of the flesh,</hi> and <hi>the vnprofitable works of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:</hi> (though our words be neuer so good of themselues) we may feare the reward of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> his wife, who brought a <hi>part of their substance</hi> (hypocritically conceiling the rest) and layd that part at the <hi>Apostles</hi> feet. So, if we come vnto God, giuing him good words, keeping backe our hearts, to serue our owne carnall and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane appetites: Shall we thinke that God will be content with the
<pb facs="tcp:21499:16"/>
leaues of our good words, when we giue the fruits of our hearts to the world? will God take such <hi>hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites</hi> by the hand? we must know, that vnlesse we can truely and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feinedly cast off our <hi>carnall thoughts, corrupt desires,</hi> and <hi>sinnefull affections,</hi> it cannot be that God, who <hi>loueth holinesse and truth, in the inward affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> can looke vpon vs, as vpon his <hi>children,</hi> who speake vnto him, as to a <hi>father,</hi> with counterfeit words, proceeding from vnsanctified hearts. When wee come therefore vnto God in prayer, <hi>we must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from all iniquitie,</hi> knowing that <hi>he heareth not sinners,</hi> such as the <hi>promises</hi> of God cannot win to obedience; nor his threates in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force to <hi>forsake their sinnes;</hi> who yet will aduenture to rush rashly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the presence of God, in a formall kind of praying with the lips, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any premeditation preparation,
<pb facs="tcp:21499:16"/>
or reformation of the heart, at all. These offer <hi>wordes</hi> for <hi>deedes: Leaues</hi> for <hi>Fruit: Wolues</hi> for <hi>Lambes;</hi> and all maner, halt, lame, blinde, and blemished <hi>sacrifices,</hi> and yet would seeme holy: And so, instead of a blessing, procure a curse vnto themselues for their hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie. Wee must consider that <hi>God is a iealous God, &amp; holdeth none guiltlesse, that taketh his name in vaine,</hi> as they manifestly doe, <hi>that come neere him with their lips, when their hearts are farre from him.</hi> It is a kind of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall adultery, outwardly to seeme wholy to be gods, and yet inwardly to be meere worldlings. Before we open our mouthes therefore, to God, we must cast out of the Temple of God, (which is our heart) <hi>all buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and sellers,</hi> as <hi>Christ</hi> did out of <hi>the Temple of Ierusalem:</hi> for as long as our hearts doe harbour the desires of worldly profits, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall

And therefore, good Father, confirme my repentace, renue mine obedience, strengthen my faith: Make me a liuely member of <hi>Christ,</hi> that as I haue this day pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to become a new creature, and thou hast renued againe to me,

So shall I be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured, that thou wilt neuer faile in thy sacred couenant of grace to me, being euer the same, yea, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. Thou, Lord, knowest my strong corruptions, and the feeble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of my naturall power to resist sinne, and what strong and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full aduersaries there lie in wayte for my soule, laying continuall snares to entangle mee anew, to make (if it were possible) this my reuniting into thee in Christ of none effect, and to seduce me again into the wayes of vngodlines.

A preposterous rule of godlesse men: who, though they know, that as sure as they liue, they shall die; and as sure as they liue, and shall die, so sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they shall liue or die eternally, yet, being deluded by the opinion of their strength, and health, and bewitched by their vaine, idle, and forbidden lusts of the flesh, and the minde, they delay their preparation to die wel, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the time they haue no power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme their wicked liues past: So that their present liuely carnall life, is a begun spirituall death: And the time of their foolishly prefixed repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, is the beginning of their end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse condemnation. But the truely wise indeed, guided by grace, haue the time of their dissolution continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally before their eyes, and in a holy meditation of death, prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to die daily, thinking euery day they rise, that that is the day of their dissolution: and when they betake them to their nightly rest, they recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them to their beds, as to their
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:21499:86"/>
graues, and perswade themselues, that that night may be the day-spring of their spirituall and neuer ending life. Such as thus prepare themselues, haue neuer any feare to die; but in their hearts wish to be dissolued, and to be with Christ And because that this holy preparation is not wrought, neither can a man desire, to leaue, and remoue out of this earthly tabernacle by nature, they cannot but naturally feare to die. And therefore, when the messengers of death begin to summon men, vnprepared to their graues, they cannot but entertaine horror, in stead of hope, and despaire, in stead of as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance of the life to come. How much then doth it concerne all men to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon sinne betimes, and to seek at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement with God by well doing, to walke before God, and to be vpright? Thus whosoeuer prepareth himselfe in a sanctified life in earth, he cannot feare death, which is an entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a glorious life in heauen; where God, before whom he sincerely wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, hath prouided him a Citie, a Kingdome, a Crowne. He then, that longeth to see good dayes while he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, will be euer studious to please
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:21499:87"/>
him, by whom he is assured he shall receiue that endlesse inheritance when he dies. Let euery man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, while it is to day, pray, that God will vouchsafe him his grace, not to prolong his godly preparation to die, but to teach him wisdome in the inner parts, that he may so rectifie his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation, as he may be acceptable to God, through <hi>Christ,</hi> in his life vpon earth, and wishedly surrender vp his spirit to him that gaue it, when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the same.

A cure to them that enter into the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of their sinnes, and truely repent them: and a curse vnto them that make no vse of it; as too many worldlings doe, who in their sicknesse are as inclinable in desire to sinne, as in their health: And nothing preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the acte of sinne, but weaknes to effect it, or oportunitie to attempt it.

Though God may permit a wicked man to be cased or cured of his bodily disease by humane physicke; yet the soule lieth still in almost deadly sicknesse.

               <p>It is not yet sufficient to heare the word, but as <hi>Marie</hi> laid vp the word in her heart, so must euery pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable hearer retaine the word in their mindes, permit it to rule in their affections, and to bring foorth the

And therefore, it much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooueth men and women, thus of two made one, to consider the endes of their vniting: whether they asked first counsell of the Lord by prayer, had the consent of parents, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of the word of God.

And therefore seruants (although bound to corporall masters, as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching their bodily seruice) are yet <hi>the Lords free men,</hi> and so fellow-members

of <hi>Christ</hi> with their beleeuing masters, which maketh them brethren in the Lord, whose feare should preuent too much seueritie in the master, &amp; moue the seruant to the more obedience and faithfull seruice. <hi>The strength of Israel</hi> said vnto me (saith <hi>Samuel) Thou shalt beare rule ouer men, being iust, and ruling in the feare of God.</hi> Heere is the bound and limit of mans authoritie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer them whom they gouerne.

there were a priuiledge for you to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the God that made you men and women, and made you masters and gouernours ouer men and women, your gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t being but only car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, and their seruice but corporall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereas your Master which is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, gouerneth, spiritually, and your seruice towards him ought to be holy and truely spirituall. And thinke that if your seruants disobedience be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensiue vnto you; what are your sins and rebellious courses of life vnto God your great Master, which seeth your sinnes in secret, and will reward them openly? Make the case of your corporall seruants disobedience vnto you, your case of disobedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to God: and consider, whether you could be content that euery sinne you haue committed, should haue it due reward: would it not be a terror vnto you, and make you lesse furious, and lesse bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vnto your seruants, for euery trifle in committing of a fault, or omitting some small dutie to be done?

and to gouerne them in the feare of God, according to the rule of religion: and let none of them thinke it a needlesse, a superfluous, or a base dutie, for masters and gouernours to pray for their seruants, and such as are vnder their commaund.

If a professed Souldier faint or faile in the first, he is censured co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, and not brauely minded, which for outward disgrace hee will seeke to auoide. If he be foiled in the second, men and Angels will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne his weaknesse: if he preuaile in both, how great is his commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? If therefore you that be, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to bee Souldiers, perfect and complete, subdue and conquer, first your owne inward and priuate ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: then incounter the common enemie with courage: for, before you haue manfully fought against, and conquered <hi>Sinne</hi> and <hi>Satan,</hi> and your owne carnal affections lu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Vch as vse the seas (as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> obserueth) and haue occasion to passe the great waters by ship, see the wonderfull workes of the Lord. Wonderfull in deed, in the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of so huge a heape of waters, wonderfull in containing them within appointed limits; wonderful in ebbing and flowing; wonderfull in violence and rage; wherein sometimes it swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth and worketh; wonderfull in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of <hi>Iehouah,</hi> at whose word the most furious waues therof are appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. And lastly wonderfull, in respect of man, whom God hath indued with the vnderstanding to frame a vessell, wherein, as in a house, he may safely fly, as it were, through the furious fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes of so mercilesse waters. But all these wonders may be knitte vp in one, namely, in the wonderfull power and prouidence of <hi>Iehouah:</hi> who by his word hath made the seas, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:21499:196"/>
the great waters into one place, and commandeth them not to passe their bounds, and they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey: hee hath giuen man iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and art to frame the <hi>hull,</hi> to place the <hi>Roder,</hi> to stretch out the <hi>Tacklings,</hi> and to spread the <hi>sailes,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend into the deepe. But if God should there leaue him to his owne will, wit, power or art, though he haue his <hi>card</hi> and <hi>compasse</hi> to guide him, he should neuer attaine his wished port: when the winds blow, the tempests rise, the seas rage, the waues lift them vp as vpon mountaines, and hurle them downe againe as into deepe gulfes. What then can art or force do? Doe not their hearts then melt for feare, vntill the winds cease, the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pests appease, the seas calme, and the waues be still? And who worketh this wished and most comfortable change? only that mightie <hi>Jehouah:</hi> hee that made the seas, he commandeth them to rage, to shew his power, and againe willeth them to bee quiet, to shew his mercie. Are not these the wonderful workes of God? who but he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, and the seas obey? Ye therefore that are occupied in this dangerous
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:21499:197"/>
trade of life, bee not vnmindfull to serue the liuing God: for ye see by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, how suddenly hee comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, and calleth for a tempest, and then ye thinke your selues neere vnto the doore of death Yet, as saith <hi>Dauid, When they cried vnto the Lord, he deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them out of their distresse, and brought them to the hauen where they would bee.</hi> There is none that vseth the seas, but hath seene and felt this. If then they confesse not the power, prouidence, and louing kindnesse of <hi>Iehouah,</hi> and acknowledge the wonderfull workes that he hath done for them, euen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the sonnes of men: Let them bee assured, that a thousand perils futurely attend them. But the most of them that exercise this kind of trauell, shew themselues temporizers: when dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers appeare, they seeme much hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, promising reformation of their finfull liues; they pray, and are cast downe with importable feare and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: but the danger past, they forget it, and God that deliuered them from it, especially whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they approch the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen where they would bee, in safetie, where, in stead of giuing of thanks to God for his mercies, in leading and

conducting them; the first thing they doe, is to shew they owe him no duty, by presently falling to transgresse his will by drunkennesse, wantonnesse, whoredome, swearing and blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming him, as though the danger past were the last they need to feare, or could befall them. But they deceiue themselues; for God is patient and long suffering, but neuer forgetteth them in iudgement, that so forget and neglect his mercies. Hee followeth them, when they thinke dangers far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest off: <hi>Shipwracke, Pirats, Famine,</hi> or some other Iudgement seazeth vpon all carelesse Sea-faring men.
