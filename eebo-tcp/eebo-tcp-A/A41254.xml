            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <head>To all thoſe whoſe Bodies are troubled with Wind, or any Diſeaſes cauſed thereby.</head>
                  <p>IT is confeſſed by all, that no temporal Bleſſing is better then Health; therefore it is to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired, that moſt men ſhould ſo much ſlight and neglect it: the worth whereof, if we conſider, we muſt ſay with the Poet <hi>Amphion:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <l>O bleſſed Health, with thee 'tis ever ſpring,</l>
                     <l>And without thee there is no pleaſant thing.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>She is the cheriſher of all Wiſdom, Science, and Arts, and the only ſolace that we find in this trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blEſom life. By the preſence of health all humane actions, and ſtrength of body, beauty, riches, and whatſoever is eſteemed among men, do flouriſh: ſhe failing by malignity of evil cauſes, all other things fail, which were before in requeſt, and a diſeaſe follows, which is the fore-runner of death. Now who can expel a diſeaſe but by avoiding and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding the cauſes that breed and feed it? nor can the cauſes be avoided, or excluded before they are known. Therefore the chief way to cure a diſeaſe, is to know the cauſes. And if we care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully conſider them, it will appear, that no thing in the whole world is more miſerable then man, and (if you except his diviner part, the Soul)
<pb facs="tcp:108994:6"/>
nothing is more frail and obnoxious to the injuries of all things. For what is there in the whole Creation, by which a man is not aſſailed and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and ſometimes hurt? For the Heavens and the Stars by their converſions and malignant aſpects bring plagues, heats, and extreme colds, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers inconveniences to Mankind: And the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are plainly perceived to be more injurious then they. For the Air hath been infinite ways pernicious to Mankind, as by Hail, Rain, Storms, Thunder, and Lightning: And the Earth by ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible motions, and quaking, and opening of it ſelf, and by breathing forth peſtilent vapours from its Dens and Caverns: And the Water with ſtinking vapours from Inundations, Fens, and ſtanding Pools: And the Fire alſo by many Conflagrations. Moreover all ſorts of living Creatures by one unanimous conſent, ſeek the deſtruction of Mankind: nor are the Herbs, Shrubs, and Trees with their fruit, freed from that pernicious Spirit. Beſides all theſe, as if they could not do miſchief enough to Mankind, man himſelf is enemy to himſelf, by Thefts, Brabling, Murther, and Wars, and many innumerable wicked actions: And which is worſt of all, man is ſo cruel to his own Nature, and ſo mad, that he torments his weak body by inordinate luſts, daily and nightly riotings and ſurfeits; ſo that he runs head-long into all manner of diſeaſes, and defiles his divine part, the Soul, and brings the wrath of God upon himſelf. Therefore he ſaid well,
<pb facs="tcp:108994:6"/>
that compared mans life to a warfare upon the Earth. Hence it is, that wiſe men to oppoſe ſo many miſchiefs, deſired nothing more then to invent ſome Art to preſerve them and theirs from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries of the things mentioned, and free them from diſeaſes. Therefore <hi>Apollo</hi> gave noble Principles at firſt to the Art of Phyſick, which were after celebrated by <hi>Aeſculapius,</hi> and then by <hi>Machaon</hi> and <hi>Podaleirius;</hi> ſo that all did highly eſteem them as <hi>Homer</hi> writes:
<q>
                        <l>The learn'd Phyſitian that can cure well,</l>
                        <l>Doth all Profeſſions in the world excel.</l>
                     </q>
The Sons of <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> delivered this Art to their Poſterity, not by writing, but by traditional inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the time of <hi>Hippocrates. Hippocrates</hi> that came from <hi>Hercules</hi> and <hi>Aeſculapius,</hi> grew ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent in Phyſick, that he got great Renown by his Works in <hi>Coos,</hi> and among the Theſſalians and Athenians, that gave him divine honour next unto <hi>Hercules.</hi> He was the firſt that committed this Art to writing, and left us his Works, which <hi>Galen</hi> purged from thorns and weeds, and put it into ſuch Order and Method, that he made it almoſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat. But nothing in the world of this ſort can be ſo exact, that it admits no farther induſtry: therefore the Ages following and ours, according to the ingenuity of the beſt in the time, did refine and digeſt into order thoſe parts of Phyſick that ſeemed imperfect: They cut off what was ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous, and ſupplied what was defective, and did
<pb facs="tcp:108994:7"/>
all with ſuch induſtry, that the Art ſeemed to have a new face. For no part of Phyſick, though obſcure and hard, can now be concealed. For fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous men have not ceaſed to ſtudy the Heavens and Stars, with their motions, and the Nature of the Elements, and to ſearch into the bowels of the Earth, and to find out by great labour the force of Herbs and all Plants, and to know all ſorts of living Creatures; nay to ſearch into the bowels of Mankind by a kind of cruelty, that they might be preſerved againſt the ſtorms of ſo many malignant Cauſes. This is the reaſon why we beſtow our labour and ſtudy for the Common Good, in writing this Book and others, and in peruſing Authors, out of which we have gathered this Treatiſe of Wind that troubles the Body of Man. Men are of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ingenuities, and every one follows that which his Nature and heat of Spirit draws him unto. Some follow Muſick and the Mathematicks; others Morality; others Religion, without any reſpect to other Sciences: Some in obedience to their God, Belly, follow head-long after luſt, and ſpend more time and pains in pleaſure and luxury, then in honeſty, and lay up treaſure by any means, good or bad, to maintain their luſts. Theſe vain Wretches (having nothing but a body which ſhews their manhood) paſs away, and their memory rots: But ſuch whoſe Souls dwell more nobly in them, and think of the adorning of their Divine part, loſe no time for meditation, that they may declare
<pb facs="tcp:108994:7"/>
things more clearly to Poſterity, and be famous to Eternity. Of this ſort there are many in our Age, chiefly Phyſitians, who have ſo laboured to purge and adorn their Science, that no Age hath done more. For no Science is ſo abſolute in all things, but there is ſomething new that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients did not take notice of, or leave unfiniſhed. For humane induſtry is fed by meditation, and grows hot by an unwearied force: And a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Soul ſubmits his private ſtudies to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Learned, and grows more ſtudious afterwards. For if his works are approved by them, he is more inflamed to go forward; if not, he labours to recover his honour, and to hit that the ſecond time, which he miſſed at the firſt. Fall how it will, an ingenious generous Spirit loſeth nothing, but gets much. This is the cauſe why we have taken in hand to clear that part of Phyſick which treats of Wind, and is of great conſequence to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that we may not live in ſilence, as if born for our ſelves: And the rather, becauſe there is no diſeaſe more uſual and vexatious, chiefly in the North, and leſs underſtood by Phyſitians, though indifferently learned, then thoſe of Wind. And there is no part of Phyſick more neglected by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors; for none hath written exactly of Wind but <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> and he hath written ſo, that little benefit is to be gotten thereby. We confeſs the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend old Man had a wonderful Spirit in ſhewing the Cauſe of every Diſeaſe: But he uſeth Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb facs="tcp:108994:8"/>

And he handles but ſlightly the breeding of Wind from meat, drink of flegm. He only ſpeaks of the force of the Air breathed in. Nor is it a wonder: For his Age was very temperate, and no ways given to Luxury; Alſo the Country he lived in, chiefly <hi>Cous,</hi> was a temperate Iſland, and did not breed theſe torments from Wind. But our Age, from Gluttony and Drunkenneſs, affords few that are not tormented with Wind. Therefore we ſhall provide that ſuch as are troubled therewith may be cured, and that by bad diet they do not relapſe, and be again troubled therewith. And we ſhall leave <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> who wrote on this ſubject more learnedly then profitably, and diſcover for the Common Good thoſe Principles that we know by Experience to be profitable.</p>

                     <head type="sub">That Wind is a Spirit; and of the Diviſion of Spirits.</head>
                     <p>I Suppoſe none doth queſtion, but that that ſubſtance, whether it be air, wind, or blaſt, which is ſtrong, &amp; to be heard or felt, though not to be ſeen, is called a Spirit. For ſo <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> calls them in his Book of Winds. And <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith they are ſpirits, <hi>Epid. 1. Com.</hi> 3. And in his Book of the difficulty of breathing, and differences of breathing, and in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnoſticks; and that a belch is a kind of ſpirit, and doth after a ſort communicate with the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of breathing. Thus it appears by theſe ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of <hi>Galen,</hi> that wind is a ſpirit: now there are differences of ſpirits: therefore I ſhall ſhew the nature of all ſpirits, and begin from the chief
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:108994:9"/>
to the meaneſt. Spirits are either within or without our bodies. They without are of three ſorts. There is the ſpirit of the living God, and of univerſal Nature, and of the Soul. The ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God ſhews his hidden Majeſty and Power, and goes through all things, and is every where comprehending all things: It hath the minds and ſouls of all in its power, and can carry them where it pleaſeth. The ſpirit of Nature is that which all the Philoſophers and Poets ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend: <hi>Plato</hi> calls it the ſoul of the world: <hi>Galen</hi> calls it a mind brought hither from above. <hi>Ariſtotle, Lib. de mund. ad Alex.</hi> ſets it forth more plainly by this definition, ſaying, this ſpirit is an animate ſubſtance that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateth in Plants and living Creatures, belonging to all; being largely extended, it contains all, rejoyceth all, carrying the vital ſoul of the world with it, and Nature it ſelf, and making all things live that it gets into. Alſo there is a ſpirit under the form of every mortal and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete thing, which knits it to its thick body, being of a mean condition between both; it joyns things different, being like unto both: and this ſpirit is governed and preſerved by the other, which is the univerſal ſpirit of all Nature. To theſe three differences of ſpirits <hi>Ariſt. Lib. de mund.</hi> adds a fourth; ſaying, that wind ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth from a dry exhalation, when it is caſt off by cold, ſo that it ſpreads abroad it ſelf: ſo that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:108994:9"/>
wind is only much air ſtirring about, and forced; and this is called a ſpirit alſo. For air is ſtrong, though not viſible, but known by its effects and our apprehenſions: and <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in his Book of Wind, ſaith that all that is between Heaven and Earth is full of ſpirits. Alſo the ſpirits in the body are comprehended in their ſeveral members; for they are natural, vital, or animal. All theſe are called by the name of innate or imbred ſpirits: wind, or the flatulent ſpirit (that the great and little world Man, might be alike) is joyned to theſe. The natural Spirit is made when the more pure or aerial part of nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment turns by concoction into thin blood, like a vapour. This takes force from the imbred ſpirit in the Liver, and goes to the Heart by the hollow vein with the reſt of the blood; then by heat being more refined, it turns to a ſort of air, and becomes a vital ſpirit, which ſpread through the whole body by the arteries, gives life: part of this carried by the arteries of the neck into the net-work of the brain, and ſo into the ventricles, increaſeth by the air received at the noſe, and by force of the ſpirit imbred in the brain, becomes animal; and being ſent to the whole body, gives ſenſe and motion. The ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit we ſhall ſpeak of, differs much from theſe, and is the fourth ſpirit in our bodies, of the ſame nature with wind, and it is ſo called. It is groſs and not ſo aery or thin as the other. You
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:108994:10"/>
may beſt know the nature of it, if you conſider the air in a South or North wind. The windy ſpirit in us is like the South wind, and the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral is like the North. Let us leave the innate or imbred ſpirits, which are well deſcribed by others, and ſpeak of the flatuous or windy ſpirit.</p>

                     <head type="sub">Of the Analogy or Proportion between the flatuous Spirit and Wind, or the Wind in Man and in the Earth.</head>
                     <p>THere are two things that chiefly blow up our bodies, and prepare them for diſeaſes; diet and the air. Food, though at firſt unlike, is at length made like us, and turned into the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the body: Therefore by long uſe the body will be of the ſame nature. For all Diet, though well concocted, keeps it in a natural and genuine condition: therefore Lettice and other cold things, though they be overcome by conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, yet cool the ſtomach and whole body, and produce cold blood. So Wine and Garlick produce hot blood: Fiſh, Cheeſe, and ſalt Meats, groſs blood. By which it is clear, that not only the ſpirits and humours by which we
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:108994:10"/>
are preſerved, are changed, but the conſtitution of the whole body. Therefore a cool diet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares the body to breed wind, by oppreſſing the native heat. Alſo too much of the beſt meats and drinks, ſuch as burdens Nature, cannot be well concocted or turned into good blood, but many crudities will be, which will cauſe obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and rottenneſs, or corruption, by which the natural heat is ſuffocated, as the wiek of a candle by too much greaſe. This crudity and abundance of humours is gathered in all, chiefly the Northern Inhabitants: theſe, as if it were too low a thing to ſlay with a ſword, or hang with a halter, or fight publickly, kill them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with kindneſs, they contend in drinking healths, and riot night and day, and add new ſurfeits to the former, and leave not off, till they vomit what they take in, or are ready to burſt; forgetting the ſaying, That gluttony and drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enneſs kill more then the ſword. When too much food is taken, it cauſeth a diſeaſe. It is no wonder, if ſuch have many excrements and wind, which for their abundance are not eaſily voided. Alſo the Country and air is of much force. For a hot Country, as the Summer, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flames the ſpirits, dries the humours, and increaſeth Choler, which cauſeth moſt acute diſeaſes. But a cold and moiſt air, as it is in the North, is like the Winter, ſtupifies the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, ſtops the Pores, and burdens the body with
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:108994:11"/>
many ſuperfluous humours, and oppreſſeth the native heat. Hence the concoction is weakned, and there are crudities, and fluctuations of food in the ſtomach, diſtillations, chronick diſeaſes, ſtones, worms, wind, and the like. Theſe breed in Man the little world, as in the great, unto which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> compares him. For as in the great world there are four Elements, Fire, Air, Water, Earth; ſo there are the ſame in the little: and as in all thoſe Elements are divers ſubſtances bred, as in the earth ſtones and trees; in the water, divers Creatures; in the air, thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, lightning, rain: ſo in man there are bred bones as ſtones; and worms and lice as living Creatures; and diſtillations as rain, and wind, or a flatus like the wind in the earth. To be ſhort, the image of the Univerſe is clear in man. For God, when in ſix days he had wonderfully made the world, and ſet all things in order, ſo that nothing ſeemed to be wanting, made man as the abridgment of all the reſt, to extol his Divine power and wiſdom, and admire his works. Moreover, there is nothing in Heaven or Earth, the like whereunto may not be found in man, if you diligently ſearch and conſider the Soul is his God, the underſtanding and will are his angelical Spirits; heat, cold, moiſture, and drineſs anſwer to the outward Elements. In the heat appear divers flaſhes and fiery repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Frenzies, Inflammations, Eryſipelas, Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:108994:11"/>
In the moiſture are diſtillations and Nodes, that come from thence like hail. alſo the humours ebbe and flow in the veins and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries. But the earthy Element of this little world is moſt like the great, in which are ſtones, which our bones do reſemble: and <hi>Ovid</hi> calls the ſtones the bones of our great mother Earth. As the Plants, Corn, and Trees are in the Earth, ſo are the hairs in man. As <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, hairs grow as Plants. For as ſome grow by the art of the Husbandman, others by natural cauſes only: ſo in animals the head is like a Wheat or Barley-field, and the hair in other parts is like other plants in drier ground. What ſhall I ſay of the Earthquake? when many exhalations are bred in the bowels of the Earth by force of the Sun and Stars, from a moiſture that is ſunk into the Earth, and from the matter of the Earth; when they cannot get forth by reaſon of the Earths cloſure or the groſſneſs of the wind, there muſt needs be an Earthquake in part. So when flatuous ſpirits or wind is ſhut up in the cavity of the body, and ſtrives to get out, there is great trembling; as <hi>Langius</hi> ſaith, if we may confer great things with ſmall, as wind ſhut up in the bowels of the Earth, makes it tremble when it ſtrives to get out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo a flatulent air or wind being kept in by the covers of the Muſcles and other parts that may be ſtretched, ſhakes them till it breaks through the Membrane that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:108994:12"/>
covers them: the vulgar ignorant of this, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe this to be the ſoul or life-blood. While it goes forth without doing hurt at the Pores, there is no trembling; but if they be ſtopt, it hunts about and gets into cavities, and ſtrives to break through: ſo the wind ſtriving to get out, ſhakes the body.</p>
                     <p>There is another reaſon of this trembling. The wind ſhut up in the cavities, being beaten back by the heat of the bowels and natural mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, grows hot by reaſon of the want of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and ſo thinner. This inſinuates it ſelf into any part, even the principal parts, and falls ſwiftly upon ſenſible places, and doth not only diſturb them with its quality, but pricks them with its thinneſs, and ſtretcheth, tears, or wounds them: for all biting or ſharp cauſes that are moved, whether hot or cold, bring horrour and ſhaking to a living Creature. Thirdly, this ſpirit running to and fro, troubles the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſive faculty, and the parts, which provoked, contract themſelves ſpeedily to expel the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender, and ſo ſhake and tremble. Therefore this wind in man being like other wind, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth the like effects. Now we ſhall ſhew what it is.</p>

                     <head type="sub">What this Wind in Man is.</head>
                     <p>NOne wrote better of this wind then <hi>Galen Lib. 3. de Symp. cauſis,</hi> who ſaith it is a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour raiſed from a humour, or flegmatick meats or drinks, or from weak heat. But this is an imperfect definition: for divers vapours go to the brain from food in the ſtomach, as in Drunkards, and in ſore Eyes, from conſent of the ſtomach, which are not called winds; nor are they ſuch. But that flatuous ſpirit that is bred in the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondrion from a melancholy humour, is truly wind. Therefore I would have this wind to be thus deſcribed more exactly: A Flatus or wind is an abundance of vapours from ſpirits or meat or drink, or flegm or melancholy raiſed from a weak heat in the body. I ſay an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, becauſe a ſmall vapour, which the beſt conſtitution is never free from, is not a wind, or can puffe up. As <hi>Galen Lib. 5. in Aph.</hi> 72. ſaith they are windy; according to <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> that have much wind in their bellies, that is voided upwards or downwards, or ſtretcheth the parts that hold it. And <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, wind is only much air fluctuating or moving, and ſtopped. You ſhall know from <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and what I ſhall
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:108994:13"/>
ſay after, why I call it an halitous ſpirit, and not a vapour; for none can get any certainty out of <hi>Galen</hi> in this, that calls a ſpirit, vapour, wind and blaſt, all one without diſtinction. <hi>Thera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peut.</hi> 14. he ſaith, a vaporous ſpirit is from juyces heated by degrees, and that a vapour is an humour extenuated, <hi>de Sympt. cauſ. lib. 1. de Simpl. med. fac. lib.</hi> 1. and <hi>Halitus</hi> is a mean or medium between the thinneſt ſpirit and blood that is finiſhed, <hi>Lib. 3. de nat. fac.</hi> All theſe ſignifie the ſame thing, therefore I ſhall not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute them. Nor is that againſt my definition that <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, if a greater heat fall upon a groſs glutinous flegm, it turns them into a thick or groſs wind. For though heat be ſtrong, yet in compariſon of the quantity and quality of the humour, it may be weak; ſuch as can raiſe a ſpirit, but not lay it or diſſolve it. It is ſo in thoſe that by intemperate drinking oppreſs the ſtrongeſt heat. We ſhall now ſhew in what parts this wind is bred.</p>

                     <head type="sub">Of the place where Wind is bred.</head>
                     <p>IN the former Chapter we ſhewed from <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> that thoſe were windy bodies that gathered much wind in their bellies, which
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:108994:13"/>
is voided upwards or downwards, or that ſtretcheth the parts that hold it. Hence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that the ſtomach and guts are the place of its breeding; otherwiſe it could not go forth upward or downward. So wind is bred in the Earth, which after rain being warmed, as <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> ſaith, from above and from it ſelf, ſmoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; and in this is the force of wind. For when the Earth takes greateſt force from water, there muſt be moſt forcible vapours, even as green wood burnt affords moſt ſmoak. The ſtomach moſt reſembles the Earth in man. <hi>Galen</hi> compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, ſaith, that Nature made the ſtomach in ſtead of an Earth to Animals, to be a ſtore-houſe, as the: Earth is to Plants. For the veins that go to the ſtomach, ſuch Chyle out of it to nouriſh the whole body, as the roots of Trees do from the Earth: it is a natural action in both. They are alike, but the Earth of it ſelf is dry and ſapleſs; except watered, it produceth no fruit; but being moiſtned, as <hi>Virgil</hi> ſaith, it produceth winds alſo. So our ſtomach is membranous and dry, and except it be moderately moiſtned with meats and drinks, it defrauds the body of its nouriſhment, and it conſumes: If too much drink be taken, there is fluctuation and wind; for too much food oppreſſeth the natural heat, and makes it weak; but yet it will fall to work, or concoct: but being not able to do it exactly, it raiſeth vapours which it cannot diſcuſs. Then
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:108994:14"/>
by degrees the firſt concoction being hindered, there are groſs and flegmatick humours, both in the ſtomach and guts, chiefly the Colon. If the wind be thick, it ſtretcheth only the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach and belly; but when by degrees it is made thin by heat of the bowels, that which was ſhut up begins to move and enlarge it ſelf, and take up more room, and ſtir about to get forth, and then all is well. But if a coſtive body by hard excrements or tough flegm in the guts hinder its paſſage, it runs back and roars, rumbles, and pains the guts, and labours by force to get out. For when the heat of the guts extenuates the vapours, they move readily and of themſelves, and ſo are thinner, and can pierce farther: they run about like Thunder ſwiftly, and open ſmall paſſages, and make ſolution of unity, and cauſe pain in any ſolid part by their paſſage being thin. What <hi>Seneca Lib. 6. nat. quaeſt. c.</hi> 8. ſaith of other wind, agrees with this, that its force is not to be withſtood, becauſe a ſpirit is not to be conquered. They only can judge of this wind who have been troubled with it, Therefore as the other wind is only bred in the Earth, ſo this is bred only in the ſtomach and guts, as the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns of the Earth, and from thence goes to any part: for the body is thin and previous, full of paſſages for the wind to go through; which when it is much, and gets not forth, ſhakes the body, cauſeth chilneſs, and great Symptoms af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be mentioned.</p>

                     <head type="sub">Of the manner how Wind is bred in the Body.</head>
                     <p>WInd is bred from heat, which is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times great, ſometimes weak; and is raiſed from the matter, after the ſame manner it is diſcuſſed. For the ſtrong heat of the bowels diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſeth it before it get force, and hinders it from breeding at the firſt. Abſolute cold raiſeth no ſpirits, as appears in extream crudities. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Hippocrates Lib.</hi> 6. ſaith, that in a long Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentery or Flux, if there be ſowre belchings, it is good; becauſe before belching there was no ſign of concoction, by reaſon of the decay of natural heat; which beginning to revive, being but yet weak, by reaſon of the ſmall concocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it raiſed wind which was belched forth. Therefore not great heat nor great cold, but a mean between both makes wind, according to <hi>Galen de ſympt. cauſ. lib. 6. cap.</hi> 2. who ſaith it breeds in the vacuities of the ſtomach, when flegm there contained, or food, is turned to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours by weak heat. For as abſolute cold raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no vapours, becauſe it cannot extenuate, nor diſſolve, nor concoct; ſo vehement heat over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes for the moſt part what is comprehended,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:108994:15"/>
extenuates the food beyond the generation of vapours, except it be ſuch as eaſily turns to wind. If the heat be weak, it diſſolves the food, but doth not concoct perfectly, and hence comes wind. And as in external things, as a cold ſeaſon, chiefly when the North wind blows, makes the air clearer; and a very hot ſeaſon makes the air pure, but the middle conſtitution of air produceth clouds: ſo it is in Animals heat when very weak or very ſtrong, doth not cauſe wind, but the mean between both. But <hi>Galen 12. Meth. med.</hi> ſaith, that wind is not only from a mean but vehement heat: as appears by their generation there mentioned, and by his way of cure. For he ſaith, if by any accident a vapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſpirit be joyned with groſs glutinous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, that cannot break forth of the body, there is very great pain; and that from two cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, obſtruction or heat. For obſtruction keeps the wind in, and groſs glutinous matter, when it is hot, cauſeth wind. And a little after: how then, ſaith he, ſhall we cure thoſe pains which a cold humour ſhut up in the guts, hath cauſed? Not by Cataplaſms and Fomentations which heat violently: for all clammy humours that are groſs and cold, are diſcuſſed into wind by things that heat, except they alſo ſtrongly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt. Therefore they muſt be cut and concocted at the ſame time by attenuaters which are not too hot. From theſe words of <hi>Galen,</hi> it appears
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:108994:15"/>
that a vehement heat doth not hinder breeding of wind, or diſcuſs them being bred, but will cauſe them from the ſubject matter to breed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new when they were gone. Therefore <hi>Lib. 3. cap.</hi> 43. he ſaith, we muſt beware of nothing more in the abundance of ſuch humours, then immoderate heat that will melt them, and turn them into wind, but not digeſt them. The Italian Doctor knew this well, who (as <hi>Paul Aegineta</hi> ſaith) cured almoſt all Colicks with cold remedies: and <hi>Paul</hi> knew it when he wrote, that pains from cold, clammy, and tough hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, are to be cured with reſpect that the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines be not vehement hot; for ſo they will be melted, and turned more to winds. Alſo ſtrong heat doth not only make wind of flegm, which it cannot conſume, but alſo of any over-much moiſture received; as in ſuch as have drunk too much Wine, or Beer, or Broth, or ſtuffed themſelves with any groſs or clammy food, which the heat cannot conſume. So vehement heat alſo raiſeth wind. This is clear in Feavers alſo, in which, though preternatural heat abound, much drink ſwells the belly, becauſe Nature is thereby reſtrained. Therefore three things are required in the breeding and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of Wind; heat naturally too weak, or ſo by oppreſſion; that the part be ſenſible and fit, and the matter proper to produce wind.</p>

                     <p>THe wind is of divers natures: one ſort is quiet, another moved. The quiet is groſs, and of flow motion, cloudy and cold, that brings ſeldom any Symptoms but a ſwollen Belly and Hypochondria, without much pain. This troubles ſuch commonly that drink thick ſweet Ale, or Milk, or Water, between meals chiefly: for that corrupts concoction, and weakneth the action of the ſtomach, as if you ſhould pour cold water into a boiling Kettle; and thence there will be cloudy vapours and fluctuations that will ſwell the Belly like a Drum, which will fall with ſobriety and a ſtool or two. But if it ſtay long between the tunicles of the guts, it threatens a dangerous Colick. A moved wind, becauſe it is thin, and running about with great pain, is like a changeable <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teus:</hi> It is either caſt out or retained, goes forth with or without noiſe, by the mouth or Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. By the mouth the belch is ſour, or ſmoak-like, and unſavory: by the Fundament it is with or without noiſe. Theſe are of ſo much concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the body of man, as the Stoicks ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:108994:16"/>
to <hi>Cicero Lib. 9. epiſt. epiſt.</hi> 22. ſaid, that a fart ought to be as free as a belch. And <hi>Claudius Caeſar</hi> made an Edict to give leave for any to fart at meat, becauſe he knew one endangered by refraining through modeſty. <hi>Suet in vita Claudii, cap.</hi> 23. But when wind is ſent out at neither part, but detained, it cauſeth a ſwelling: a Symptom of the ſtomach not able through weakneſs to expel the abounding cloudy ſpirit. Alſo <hi>Galen 3. Symp. cauſ. lib. 6. cap.</hi> 6. ſaith, there are divers parts of the guts in which the wind moves, which though they have not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct names; yet may they ſo be declared, that any ingenious perſon may underſtand what kind, and how much the excrement is, and in what part it chiefly moves. For if it ſound ſharp and ſhrill, it is carried through the ſtrait gut, and is more pure and aerial. If it puff up, it will make a ſmall noiſe while it goes through the ſmall guts, but not ſo ſharp and ſhrill. All theſe noiſes are in the ſpaces of the empty gut uſually, &amp; make the leſs noiſe the lower they go. Other noiſes are humming, like that of Pipes, which cannot give a pure ſound, by reaſon of the matter they conſiſt of; and the paſſage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing large, makes the ſound greater. Such winds are in the thick guts, when they are empty; and if any moiſture be contained in them, it will cauſe a kind of <hi>Bombus,</hi> which is a rumbling, which ſhews a moiſt ſtool to be
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:108994:17"/>
at hand, becauſe it is from Nature moving; and it is moiſt, becauſe it rumbled before. Alſo the noiſe that follows the ſtool, if it rumbles, ſignifies more ſtools: but if it be pure and clear, it ſhews that either the gut is empty, or that hard excrements are in its upper part. That which is ſhrill, is from the ſtraitneſs of the paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and little moiſture. We might here add the different ſounds of the wind in the ear: but we ſhall reſerve that for the eleventh Chapter, where we ſhall ſpeak of the pains of the ears.</p>

                        <hi>GAlen</hi> made three chief ſorts of Diſeaſes, a Similary, Inſtrumental, and a Common, which is the ſolution of unity. A ſimilary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe is that which overthrows the natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. An Organical or Inſtrumental is that which hinders the faſhion in conformation, number, magnitude, or compoſition. The Common is, when unity is diſſolved in part. Let us ſee which of theſe wind will produce. <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates, Lib. de flatibus</hi> ſaith, when a body is full of food, and much wind prevails, and the meat lies long in the ſtomach, and cannot get
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:108994:17"/>
out for abundance, and the lower belly is ſtopt or bound, wind goes over all the body, and gets chiefly to the parts full of blood, and cools them: And if the parts be cooled where the blood comes, there is chilneſs over all the body. For when all the blood is cold, the whole body muſt be chill. <hi>Galen Meth. med.</hi> 12. confirms this ſaying, that ſuch diſeaſes are in thoſe that are ſtuffed with groſs clammy food that is cold, when the wind in the tunicles of the guts cannot get forth. For the tunicles are double, and the humour being between them is turned into wind, it is groſs and cold, and of ſlow mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. When it is detained, it ſtretcheth the tunicles, and the juyce whence it comes cools the guts it toucheth, and they are doubly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted. By theſe inſtances it is plain, that wind by its coldneſs can make a ſimilary diſeaſe that conſiſts in diſtemper, and alſo the ſolution of unity. For there is pain and ſtretching of the tunicles, which cannot be without laceration. For there are two univerſal cauſes of pain; one is an unequal diſtemper which comes ſuddenly, and another when continuity is diſſolved. For parts diſſolved by a humour or wind, are pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſeparation. Becauſe if <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſay, cold is biting to Ulcers for no other cauſe, but it contracts, and condenſeth, and conſtring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all parts it toucheth, and ſo twitcheth the ſoft parts of the continuity, and diſſolves it.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:108994:18"/>
Alſo if in acute fevers nervous bodies are moſt dried, and therefore have Convulſion; and if too much repletion that pulls it up and down, and makes it ſhorter, and ſo ſeparates conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity, how much more difficulty of ſolution of continuity will wind cauſe, which for that only cauſe produce ſuch ſtrange Symptoms that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the whole care of a Phyſitian. Thirdly, it will appear by what follows, that the whole Abdomen or Panch ſwells by wind, as in a Tympany; and the Liver and Spleen are won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully ſtopt thereby, and hard as a Schirrhus and ſwollen, as alſo the ſtomach; and all theſe are inſtrumental diſeaſes: therefore organical diſeaſes are alſo from wind. Alſo <hi>Galen de diff. morb.</hi> ſaith, when any part is ſwollen, and ſo its paſſage ſtopt, if that part hath no proper opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that ſtoppage is only called a diſeaſe: but the tumour is not, but only is the cauſe of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. But if the part affected hath any proper office, then the obſtruction and the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of the part are both diſeaſes. Therefore the three ſorts of diſeaſes, diſtemper of ſimple parts, and diſorder of inſtrumental, and ſolution of united parts, are from wind.</p>

                     <head type="sub">Of the Cauſes of Wind.</head>
                     <p>THere are few or none in the world but are troubled ſometimes with winds: for the ſtomach, which is the Kitchin for the firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, attracts the meat by the Gullet as by a long hand, and embraceth and keepeth it, and changeth it, ſeparating<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the pure from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure, caſting the one into the guts; but the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeraick veins ſucking the other, carry it to the Liver. When the ſtomach through weakneſs embraceth not the food attracted, nor contains it, it rumbles and toſſeth about, and then it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well concoct. For it muſt be ſtrong, as <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> ſaith, which conſiſts in an excellent temper of the four qualities, by which it turns the food into the proper quality of that which is nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by help of the bowels about it, the Heart, Liver, Spleen, Reins, Midriff, which lye about the ſtomach, as a great fire under a Caldron. But ſometimes a bad diet (for none can be always punctual in the rules) or ſome external force diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves its ſtrength, or weakens the fire, and then the virtue of the ſtomach abates, and it alters according to the greatneſs or ſmalneſs of the cauſe. Alſo outward cold, as in cold Countries
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:108994:19"/>
and in Northern winds, piercing to the inward parts, in thin and weak bodies, offends the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive heat. Alſo too hot Air caſts out &amp; diſperſeth the natural heat, and takes it from the bowels, and then concoction is hindered, and wind bred. But ſtrong natural heat overcoming for the moſt part things comprehended by it, extenuateth the meat more then that it can produce va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, except it be of its nature windy. For the ſtomach, though ſtrong, and force of Nature flouriſheth, and the heat not decayed, is offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed often by food that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is proper to breed wind. Therefore all Phyſick and food that is properly by its nature windy, or by its coldneſs or multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude diſſolves the ſtrength of the ſtomach, and oppreſſeth its natural heat, is the cauſe of wind; as Pulſe, raw Corn, and Fruits. All theſe <hi>Galen de alim. fac. lib.</hi> 2. ſaith, and ſuch as we eat before they are ripe, are windy, but they are ſoon digeſted: therefore he argues thus in the beginning of that Book: All the food mentioned in the firſt Book were the ſeeds of Plants, little differing from fruits: But all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary fruits are windy, and all ſeeds more or leſs. And boil Beans as much as you will, they are windy: ſome add Onions to prevent it, becauſe hot and attenuating things correct wind. But fry them, or any other pulſe, and they are not windy, but very hard of concoction, and paſs away ſlowly, and make groſs juyce. But any way
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:108994:19"/>
dreſſed, they ſwell the body. He that will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the diſtempers that follow every ſort of food, ſhall perceive a ſtretching of the whole body, as by a wind after eating of Beans, chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if he have not uſed to eat them formerly, or eat up not well boiled. Peaſe, though like Beans, are not ſo windy. Theſe are with us plentiful and uſual, and therefore we perceive leſs the hurt they do. For what we eat freely, and with pleaſure, the ſtomach embraceth cloſer, and retains better, and digeſts eaſier. Fetches are windy alſo, but few deſire them: it is good with any of theſe to boil Calamints, Onions, Dill, or Pennyroyal. Lentils puffe up the ſtomach and guts. Alſo all Summer-fruits are like theſe: for they are crude and full of excrements and unprofitable juyce, eſpecially when not ripe; they are alſo flegmatick and windy. Alſo if immoderately taken, by their cold and moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture they abate the natural heat, ſo that the ſtomach cannot diſcuſs the wind it raiſeth. Mulberries and Plums are the worſt of theſe, chiefly green, and after meat. All ſorts of Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, chiefly the Spaniſh Cherries, and Melones, Pompions, Cucumbers, Gourds, Apples, Pears, are alike: but boiled, they are leſs windy, chiefly if eaten with ſeeds, or hot and dry exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuaters or expellers of wind, Aniſe or Corian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Figs, ſaith <hi>Galen, lib. de aliment.</hi> nouriſh more then other autumnal fruits, but are windy:
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:108994:20"/>
but the wind ſoon vaniſheth, becauſe they are laxative. Cheſnuts eaten plentifully, cauſe Headach, ſwell the belly, bind it, and are hard of concoction. Alſo Roots, Turneps, Radiſhes, and the like, are windy; and Corn, Milium, Wheat, chiefly boiled Barley, but Rapes and Radiſhes are moſt windy. All Fiſh are the like, flegmatick and windy, chiefly the great; and the leſs that are ſlimy, as the Eel and Salmon, Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prey, Tench, chiefly if boiled, broiled, or fryed, they are not ſo windy, chiefly if the fleſh be ſoft, as the Brook-fiſh. Though <hi>Celſus, lib. 2. c.</hi> 26. ſaith, they are not windy. All Pulſe and fat meats do ſwell with wind, and ſweet things, and Broths, new Wine. Alſo Garlick, Coleworts, Onions, and all Roots, except a Parſnip and Schirroots. Leeks and dry Figs are windy, but the green moſt. Green Grapes, all Nuts, except thoſe of the Pine-tree; Milk, all Cheeſe, and whatſoever is taken crude. Hunting and hawking are good againſt wind. <hi>Celſus</hi> ſaith, all fat things are windy; for <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, they overthrow the ſtomach, and are hard of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, fill and ſwell either by wind that comes from them by a weak concoction, or by rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the fat, and make it run thin. Alſo ſweet things, chiefly if groſs, are windy, and new Wine, unleſs it paſs ſoon through, fills with wind, is hard of concoction, begets groſs moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, and cauſeth Headach. Therefore <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>
                        <pb n="25" facs="tcp:108994:20"/>
in his Problems asks directly why it is dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous for the ſtomach to drink new Wine? <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe it is undigeſtible, and therefore puffes up the ſtomach, and cauſeth a kind of Dyſentery. Milk is an enemy to a weak head, and to the Hypochondria that are blown up with wind from a ſmall offence; it puffes the bellies of moſt that eat it, as <hi>Hippocraies</hi> ſaith. And <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> ſaith, that people in health have headach and wind from eating Milk; therefore it muſt needs be bad for ſuch as are ſo affected before. Therefore let windy bodies avoid Milk above all things. Alſo Mead, and Perry, and Sider are windy, chiefly if not boiled. <hi>Hippocrates, lib. 5. aph.</hi> 41. bids you give Mead to women at bed-time, to know if they be with child: for if her belly be griped thereby, ſhe hath conceived, otherwiſe not: the pain is from wind that cannot get out, the Mead cauſeth it; for raw Honey ſwells the belly. Ale which is uſual in the North is alſo windy, it is near that which <hi>Dioſcorides, lib. 2. cap.</hi> 80. called <hi>Zythus:</hi> it is worſe new, or when not well boiled. The thinner or cruder it is, the leſs it nouriſheth, but it ſwells and cools more, being but a little hotter then water. Such are the Drinks of <hi>Brabant, Holland,</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> they are commonly thick and ill boiled, ſo that they ſtop the Ureters, and cool and cauſe Stranguries, breed the ſtone, and ſhort breathing, increaſe flegm, breed wind in
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:108994:21"/>
the belly, and pains and Colicks. But old Ale that is clear, well boiled, and well malted, which is made in private houſes (not to be ſold) do more caſt off thoſe pernicious qualities, the nearer they reſemble Wine. But when it is careleſly brewed, being it is daily uſed, and very much, the Symptoms it cauſeth are won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful, but chiefly great ſwellings and puffings up with wind: ſo that few or none that drink this Ale, but are much oppreſſed with winds. But if the belly be looſned by much of it taken, or by its ſharpneſs, and that which is ſuperfluous be ſent downward by ſtool or by urine, or vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited up, then you need not ſo much fear infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by wind. For it is better then water, being moderately taken to quench thirſt only, and waſh down food, but not ſo good as Wine. Alſo <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, that all the faults of water are from its coldneſs, by which it lies long in the ſtomach, and cauſeth fluctuations, and turns to wind, and corrupts and weakens the ſtomach, ſo that it concocts worſe. But Wine hath a nature adverſe to theſe faults in water, it neither puffeth up the belly, but takes it rather down, nor ſtays long there, by reaſon of its moderate heat. Therefore common Ale and Beer are a medium between wine and water, but nearer to water: for they puff up, and ſtay long, being thick, but do not ſo much deſtroy the natural heat as water, or weaken the ſtomach. The
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:108994:21"/>
clear old Beer that is well boiled is moſt near to Wine; for it opens the ways of digeſtion, and quickly goes down, is of good juyce, and fit to mix and concoct things in the ſtomach and veins; it puffs up little, it is better then new or crude Wine, and the liker it is to Wine, the farther it is from the faults in water. For water, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Snow or Pond is not good, chiefly for cold ſtomachs, not for <hi>Galens</hi> reaſon only, becauſe if taken preſently after meat, makes it ſwim by putting it ſelf between the meat and the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and making a ſeparation and fluctuation: for Wine and the beſt drink may do that: But becauſe it is heavy and very cold, and choaks the natural heat, and hinders concoction, and hurts the ſtomach, breaſt, and lungs, ſtops the urine, cauſeth ſide-pains, Dropſies, Colicks, and Iliacks. But wind is not bred only by this or that way, but too much Wine, or Beer, or Milk, or Broths, or Water, though otherwiſe whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, may cauſe wind, or any ſlimy matter that cannot be overcome by the native heat. For too much weakens the ſtomach; and <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, the ſign of a weak ſtomach is noiſe and fluctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For the ſtomach being right, is cloſe, and keeps every little it takes in cloſe wrapt, ſo that there is no ſpace between. And when there is a rumbling, there is vacuity, and it doth not exactly embrace the food: and this is a looſe ſpace which ſuffers the moiſt things received to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:108994:22"/>
paſs to and fro, and make a noiſe. Then the belly ſwells, and the Hypochondria, and there is much crudity, flegm, and groſs humors bred. If this crudity be joyned with trouble of ſtomach, and the Patient cannot ſleep, it is evil: For watching and pain of ſtomach cauſe a toſſing in bed, and wind, and belching. Therefore cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity is from immoderate eating and drinking, and from crudity, come groſs ſlimy humours; upon which, if hot medicines, ſimple or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, are given (as often by ignorance they are) they cauſe wind from the matter. Alſo Wine, though of the beſt, and ſuch as by its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture expels wind, and any liquid thing, if not by its force, yet by its abundance may oppreſs the natural heat, or by the nature of the things it is mixed with in the ſtomach, may cauſe wind. Moreover, of all things mentioned as cauſes of wind, none are worſe then night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drinkings upon a full ſtomach, and going to bed with a belly full of drink, or drinking between meals, or preſently after meat. <hi>Ariſtotle, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teor. lib. 4 cap.</hi> 3. ſaith, that ſuch concoction is like boiling, chiefly when it is done by heat of the body in a hot and moiſt ſubject; and ſome crudities are like meat half boiled. For as when we caſt much cold water into a boiling Kettle, the boiling is ſtopt, and the heat inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, and thereby crudity remains; ſo if you drink preſently after meat, the concoction is
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:108994:22"/>
interrupted, and there will be crudities, which will cauſe fluctuation and inflation, and ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the belly like a Drum. As <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, you muſt not preſently drink after meat, before it be concocted: For then the food will ſwim, and the ſtomach cannot embrace them, by reaſon of the moiſture between. Therefore (to be ſhort) inflations are from three cauſes, obſtruction, heat, and a cold and moiſt diſtemper of the ſtomach. For obſtructions ſtop the wind, that it cannot paſs forth, and groſs and clammy things, when made hot, breed wind; <hi>Gal. meth.</hi> 12. and all that are ſo have ſwollen bellies, and whatſoever they take, is eaſily turned into wind; and they are puffed up. A cold and moiſt ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, whether by nature, or acquired by op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the native heat by repletion, breeds only wind. Therefore defend the ſtomach outwardly from cold air, and keep the feet from cold; for nerves go from them to the ſtomach, and preſently cool it, and the Colick and all inflations are cauſed thereby ſooner then any can imagine. We have ſhewed the cauſes of wind, we ſhall now ſhew the ſigns.</p>

                     <head type="sub">Of the Signs of Wind.</head>
                     <p>THe ſigns of wind are taken from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions and matter therein predomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, from flegmatick diet, and windy, and ſtretching of the Hypochondria without heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; from belching, rumbling, farting, ſwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and wandring pain coming ſuddenly, and ſuddenly vaniſhing; from a clear tumour that yields to the touch, and that ſounds like a Drum. Often belching and farting are alſo ſigns, and eaſe after breaking of wind doth uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally follow. Or if from any cauſe the paſſage of the wind be ſtopt, it flies back, and there is a ſtretching pain that runs about the body, and pricks like needles under the breaſts between the ſhoulders or membranes of the ribs, or other parts. But theſe laſt not long, becauſe they are thin, and eaſily turn to air. They dream of flying or leaping over Rivers, ſometimes of Thunder and Tempeſts. There is often noiſe in the ears, beating in the fleſh, yawning, and cramp in the legs, arms, and fingers, and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to the Colick, and other windy diſeaſes: Pain about the Navel, loathing and vomiting of corrupt humours, chiefly of flegm. The belly
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:108994:24"/>
is bound, and will not let out ſo much as wind. Sometimes glaſſie flegm, with great ſtraining, is voided alone, or with ſome few hard excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The dung is ſometimes like that of an Ox, full of wind, and water is on the top. Alſo the pain is not fixed to one part, but comes by fits, and to many parts more grievous in one then an other. The ſame ſigns are not in all. Some are tormented about the Navel, and the belly looſe, having three ſtools a day, and yet the pain abate not. It is a ſign then that the wind hath gotten into the tunicles of the Colon, or that it is bred of the cold diſtemper of glaſſie flegm, or it is from its ſharpneſs that comes from putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and twitcheth the guts, or of mixture of Choler with flegm, which doth provoke the expulſive faculty. Moreover, when the paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges are ſtopt from much flegm, the excrements cannot paſs, and then the obſtruction increaſeth, and the wind runs about in the guts, and cauſeth much pain, which we muſt not meddle with for cure, except we firſt purge the glaſſie flegm with Clyſters, or flegm-purgers at the mouth. But if the Colick come from wind without matter, there is greater ſtretching and rumbling, quick pains, wind running to and fro to ſeek paſſage forth, and they uſed windy meats and drinks. If groſs and clammy humours do melt by heat, and turn to wind (which is uſual) the ſigns will be mixed of both, and the pain will be greater,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:108994:25"/>
according to the cauſe. For the force of conjunct cauſes is more then that of ſimple cauſes; and there will be, beſides that pain which is like a ſtake fixed, and comes from the coldneſs of the glaſſieflegm, another vehement pain from ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the part that runs through all the cavity of the belly, and diſturbs the ſtomach as well as the guts. For when the wind cannot get forth, by reaſon of the ſtoppages, nor exhale or breathe forth, by reaſon of its thickneſs, or the thickneſs of the body, or the coldneſs of the pores, and the guts cannot contain its abundance, it goes back to the ſtomach, and hinders its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, by putting it ſelf between the meat and the ſtomach, and leaving a vacuity, which cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſtomach not cloſely to embrace the meat. Hence comes fluctuation, and greater ſwelling then the former, and heavineſs and difficult breathing, the ſtomach preſſing upon the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff. This trouble and reſtleſneſs increaſeth, if they take meat or drink, chiefly milk or water before they are well; for then the ſtomach is more diſtempered, and the fluctuating humour ſtretcheth and puffs it up more. They are at eaſe when the meat deſcends to the lower parts of the belly, and the wind is ſent forth upwards or downwards; but it is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſent forth while the diſtemper laſts, but kept in both ways: and if there be a belch by chance, then it gives no eaſe. Sometimes the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:108994:25"/>
mouth of the ſtomach is ſwollen: and the pain is ſometimes in the back about the Spondiles, ſometimes about the breaſt, ſometimes in both. We ſhall ſpeak of the other ſigns, chiefly the particular, that ſhew the parts troubled with wind, among the Symptoms of wind.</p>

                     <head type="sub">Of the Symptoms coming from Wind.</head>
                     <p>THere are alſo divers Symptoms produced from the divers places where the wind is, being a large off-ſpring of a fruitful Parent, the ſolution of continuity. This cauſeth pain. All pain, chiefly of the head, is in the Membranes, which if not offended by diſtemper, heat, or cold, ſtroke, or bad ſcent, or ſharp humours, muſt needs be hurt by wind bred in the part (which is ſeldom ſeen) or ſent from other parts where it abounds (which is uſual.) This wind gets between the Skull and the Pericranium, or between the Skull and the Dura Mater, or hard film, or between both the Meaninges or films, and twitcheth and pulleth them from the bone. Hence is intolerable head-ach. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times this wind ſtretcheth the ventricles of the Brain and the whole inward Membrane called Pia Mater, like a bladder, and cauſeth unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able pain. They complain that the head is
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:108994:26"/>
ſometimes ſtretched, ſometimes ſlackned. This gets into any part quickly by its thinneſs; and if it hath any malignant quality from the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours putrefying below in the body, it diſturbs the mind and reaſon, and cauſeth terrible dreams, melancholy, dotings, ſhakings of the head, and ſometimes death.</p>
                     <p>The Vertigo or Megrim is, when the head ſeems to turn round. The Scotoma is, when there is not only a turning round, but a miſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the eyes. Both are from divers cauſes. We ſhall ſpeak only of that Vertigo which is from wind in the fore-ventricle of the Brain, that moves diſorderly. This wind cauſeth miſts, and perverts the imagination; hence things ſeem to run round, and think they run round themſelves and fall. For a Vertigo is a turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent commotion of thick flatuous ſpirits in the fore-ventricles of the Brain. This wind ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times breeds in the Brain from an uneven di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper thereof; ſometimes it is ſent from the ſtomach and Hypochondria, which you may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the Chapter afore-going. Sometimes wind gets from the Brain to the Nerves, and fills them, and twitcheth, and cauſeth a windy Cramp in the Fingers and Toes, or Arms and Legs, extending or contracting them.</p>
                     <p>Alſo this wind cauſeth great pain in the Ears, when it is ſtraitned about the Membranes in the Organ of Hearing For finding no paſſage out, it
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:108994:26"/>
ſtretcheth them vehemently, and tears them from the bone. This diſtemper is known from others; for there is neither heat nor heavineſs (except there be flagm there) but only a ſtretching with noiſe or ringing. Alſo it is of much concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if it be much or little, thick or thin, move quickly or ſlowly. For if it be much, thick, and move quick, it will be perceived like ſwift flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing water, or like a drum, or ſuch an inſtrument as makes a ſhrill noiſe, with a large blaſt of wind. If it be little, or thick, and move quick, it is like the breaking and falling of a tree, or an houſe, or a conduit. If it be much, but thin, and move quick, it cauſeth jingling or ringing, or ringing, or like the whiſtling of wind in at the cranny of a door. If it be much, groſs, and move not quickly, it cauſeth rumbling. If it be little, thick, and move ſlowly, it cauſeth a whiſtling, or Suſurrus, whiſpering. When it is much, thin, and moves ſlowly, it cauſeth hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. They that have it, are commonly dull both in the inward and outward ſenſes, chiefly in the hearing, by reaſon of the groſſneſs of the ſpirits, impurity and coldneſs, and the pain is not conſtant, but by fits.</p>
                     <p>Alſo wind gets into the roots of the Teeth, and ſtretcheth their Nerves, or the Membrane of the Cheek-bone, and cauſeth wonderful pain, almoſt not to be aſſwaged. It is eaſily known, for it is not conſtant, nor alike all the fit, as
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:108994:27"/>
when humours logde there; but it is by fits worſe, and hath a quick motion like a dart.</p>
                     <p>Though, as <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, the Lungs feel no pain; yet being ſtretched, there is pain felt in the breaſt and back, from the membrane that compaſſeth them, which hangs from breaſt to back by fibres. As often then as wind ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this membrane by its abundance or quick motion, there wil be a pain in the breaſt or back; and which is worſe, it ſometimes breaks the veins, and cauſeth a flux of blood, and ſo a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, though ſeldom.</p>
                     <p>Wind often cauſeth a baſtard Pleuriſie, and ſometimes difficult to be cured, as when it is between the skin and the ribs, or between the membranes under the ribs, and pulls them from the parts they cleave to. This ſtops the breath, and keeps it from large and free paſſage, becauſe the ſide and the breaſt are ſtirred up to move in breathing. Sometimes from pain it cauſeth a dry Cough and a Feaver, and it reſembles a true Pleuriſie, which is from a Phlegmon: and many ignorant Phyſitians that are content with a few ſigns, and ſuch as ſhew not the diſeaſe, are deceived thereby, and cauſe dangerous Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms by falſe directions. But this Pleuriſie differs far from a true; and to ſhew the ſigns of a true, is not to our purpoſe: but the Pleuriſie of wind is with a wandring pain, not long in the ſame place, except it be a very groſs and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:108994:27"/>
cloudy vapour. It is milder by heat and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations, and is diſperſed; it comes from too much cold drink or milk, chiefly a great draught after exerciſe; from cold and wet feet, or other windy cauſes, as we ſhewed before.</p>
                     <p>Alſo palpitation of the Heart is from wind, when it gets into the Pericardium through in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible paſſages, and cannot get out; it torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by a vehement Syſtole and Diaſtole, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction and dilatation, ſo that when it extends the heart, it intercepts the motion of the Artery. We ſhall know when this is from wind, and not from a humour. For the humour will be much or little, thick or thin. That which is much and thick cannot get through the thick mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane, and be diſſolved into air through the habit of the body. If it be much and thin, though it may at length be diſſolved and dryed up; yet it requires longer abode, it cannot quickly come and go, be violent and ceaſe: this is a plain ſign, that then the palpitation of the Heart is from a windy ſubſtance. But if it were little and thin, it would eaſily vaniſh, and not make that kind of palpitation. Therefore it is probable, that there is a thick ſubſtance or a cloudy wind, which the heart labours to ſhake off, becauſe it oppreſſeth the vital faculty; and by its heat and continual motion extenuates the thickneſs, and ſo diſperſeth it, and then the pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitation ceaſeth, which comes from ſurfeits, idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:108994:28"/>
baſhfulneſs, or too much or ſudden fear, as the evident cauſes. But the palpitation which is from humours contained in the Pericardium, is different. For it is perpetual, ſeldom inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting; but in time of reſt it grows worſe from motion, and continues often for many years, even till death. <hi>Fernelius</hi> ſaith, that ſometimes it hath broken the adjacent ribs, and put them out of their place, and dilated the Artery out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward as big as the fiſt. The other from wind is troubleſom; but comes by fits, and is not ſo dangerous.</p>
                     <p>There are no oftner or greater Symptoms from wind, then thoſe that trouble the ſtomach and gut Colon: the firſt is called Inflation, the ſecond, the Colick, from the part affected. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flation is from a fault from the retentive and embracing faculty of the ſtomach. For the goodneſs of the ſtomach conſiſts in the time of the embracing of the food, being equal with the time of concoction, and when it ſo binds up the food, that there is no empty ſpace between it and the meat. But quick evacuation and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of meat in the lower belly, follow an unfit time of retention; and a weak retention cauſeth inflations. Theſe torment the ſtomach, and the pain deſcends to the back. For the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach lies under the Midriff, and begins at the <hi>Malum Punicum</hi> or Pomegranate, and ſo tends to the left ſide: for the upper part bends chiefly
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:108994:28"/>
thither; but the lower part bends more to the right ſide. The hinder part lyes upon the Back-bone, to which it is bound, cleaving as far as the firſt Spondil of the Loyns. The mouth of it is united, not to the Back-bone, but to the Diaphragma, Liver, Heart, Spleen, Guts, and other parts, by Membranes, Nerves, Arteries, and Veins. Hence when the ſtomach is ſtretcht with wind, thoſe parts are pained that are joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the ſtretched part of the ſtomach. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when the back parts are ſtretched by wind, there is chiefly pain in the Loyns and Kidneys, as if it were the Stone, which deceives not only the vulgar, but the learned ſometimes, ſo that they think them to have the ſtone, which are ſtretched with wind in the ſtomach. But this is chiefly in ſuch as have the Colick, as ſhall be proved. When the upper part of the ſtomach is extended, there is pain over the breaſt, chiefly on the left ſide. When the lower parts are ſtretched, the Liver is ſometimes pained, or the other ſide. If the mouth of the ſtomach be ſtretched, the Gullet hath a Convulſion, as if it were contracted with hands, ſo that they ſay, it is like a ſtick fixed, and they can ſcarce ſwallow. For as <hi>Galen Lib. 6. Aph.</hi> 39. ſaith, as fulneſs ſtretch the body, receiving it ſide-ways, and downward, and make the length of the part ſhorter; ſo it is in the inflation of the ſtomach, the Gullet is contracted, and the ſides and the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:108994:29"/>
bottom ſtretched. <hi>Eraſiſtratus</hi> ſaith, that if the muſcles be filled with wind, they grow broader, but ſhorter. Moreover, when from plenty the whole is ſtretched, the effect of diſtenſion is perceived all over; and becauſe the Diaphragma is compreſſed (for it is an inſtrument of reſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) the breath is difficult from the ſtomach puffed up; and ſo this inflation ſometimes ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth; that it makes a tumour on the mouth of the ſtomach. Theſe are allayed by ſtools, and breaking wind upward or downward.</p>
                     <p>The Colick is next, which is not always in one part of the belly in all, but as the Colon is moved, ſo it removeth, now to the right, then to the left ſide, ſometimes to the Kidneys, Navel, or over all the belly, but chiefly the left ſide. For the Colon is a thick Gut, through the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of the Liver on the right ſide is carried to the left Hypochondrion upon the bottom of the ſtomach, and lyes upon the Spleen; then bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing backward, it adheres to the left Kidney. Therefore in what part the wind chiefly gets, there is greateſt pain; but when it fixeth in one part, it is raiſed from a crude and cold flegm ſhut up in the turnings of the Gut; nor is the wind then wholly included. This flegm cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodes the Gut, and tears it, and is like an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that pierceth it, which cauſeth great pain, and loathing and vomiting of flegm, and it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parteth not after breaking of wind. But a pain
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:108994:29"/>
from wind without flegm, is wandring in divers parts of the belly, and rumbles often, and being ſhut up cloſe, will not break forth above or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. This uſeth to breed much in the Colon; for Nature hath made no other receptacle for wind, which the firſt concoction in the ſtomach hath bred: therefore wind is lodged in this gut with great pain, chiefly when by reaſon of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction from groſs flegm or hard and dry ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements, it cannot get forth. The dung is hardned from divers cauſes, chiefly from idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and labouring to keep from the ſtool. Reſt makes retention, as motion evacuation, and binds, as motion opens; reſt makes things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable, and motion moveable: It cauſeth vomiting, ſtools, ſweat, urine, and all natural expulſions; and reſt hinders them. Some wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men complain that they have not a ſtool in five or ſix days, ſome in eight days: Theſe are idle, cold, gluttonous, and obſtructed, ſo that motion doth not help, nor Choler, by reaſon of cold, provoke the Guts to expel. Alſo the obſtructions hinder the Choler from the Cuts, and a perverſe order in eating, binds the belly. Therefore it is no wonder women are more windy then men. Alſo coſtiveneſs doth not only cauſe the Colick, but other great acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents; for the dung ſent down by Nature, and by its heavineſs falling to the loweſt parts, if from other buſineſs or urgent occaſion it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:108994:30"/>
it will grow hard, becauſe being kept long, it drys by heat, and the Meſeraicks do always ſuck ſome juyce from it, for they are in the thick as well as the thin Guts. So the excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments being by degrees very dry, ſtop the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage againſt themſelves and the wind, and cauſe the Ileon or Convolvulus ſometimes, but the Colick often, and other great Symptoms. For when the wind cannot get out, it flyes from the bottom of the belly again to the ſtomach, and ſtretcheth it, and twitcheth ſo the Weaſant, and contracts it, that they can ſcarce ſwallow or ſpeak. Alſo becauſe the mouth of the ſtomach is very ſenſible, it is pained with Convulſion, ſo that the heat of the outward parts goes in to expel what hurts Nature; and then they want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their heat, are chill, and the Nerves are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, the Legs weak, and the body in a great ſtrait. Who would think that ſuch deadly and cruel Symptoms ſhould come from a little wind? but I know it to be ſo by long experience. The excrements voided in this fit are windy; for they ſwim upon water, and are like Ox-dung, and there was crudity, loathing, and vomiting before. This diſeaſe is like the ſtone in the Kidneys fixed in the Ureters, and hard to be diſtinguiſhed from it: <hi>Galen</hi> was deceived by it in his own body, and knew it not but to be the ſtone, till he injected Oyl of Rue, and voided glaſſie flegm, and was freed preſently from all pain.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="43" facs="tcp:108994:30"/>
We ſhall ſpeak next of windy Melancholy; it is bred from three cauſes, from heat of the Liver and the Meſeraicks, coldneſs of ſtomach, and a crude and groſs humour of flegm or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy. A cold ſtomach deſires too much, and digeſts too little. A hot Liver attracts crude and groſs meats before perfect concoction. And becauſe the ſecond concoction, which is in the Liver, cannot correct the defect of the firſt, the Veins of the Meſentery are obſtructed by groſs Chyle, and much crudity is gathered in them. This boils by preternatural heat, and ſends forth filthy vapours that are not eaſily diſcuſſed, and there are rumblings, and break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of wind. Alſo <hi>Galen</hi> from <hi>Diocles</hi> ſaith, there is another diſeaſe in the ſtomach like the other, called melancholy or windy, as when meat of hard digeſtion and hot, is taken, there is much ſpitting, belching, ſowre wind, heat in the ſides, not preſently, but after retention. Sometimes great pains of the ſtomach that reach to the back in ſome, ceaſe after concoction, and come again after meat. When the fit comes, the ſtomach and Hypochondria are miſe rably tormented, and not freed till the matter be voided by vomit or ſtool, that extends the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pochondria with wind. That which is vomited becauſe the ſtomach is cold and weak, is fleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick, clammy, and crude, white, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times without taſte, or ſowre, or bitter. That
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:108994:31"/>
which is ſent down is black and windy Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly; from this ſometimes a black vapour ariſeth, and hurts the brain, cauſeth troubleſom dreams, and diſturbs the mind with doting.</p>
                     <p>This wind ſhut up in the ſtomach and guts, and ſtriving to get out, gets into the ſmall veins and membranes of the Liver, on both ſides ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous and gibbous, and is like a Schirrus; or ſo ſtretcheth, that there is a tumour like a Schirrus, only it is bred in a ſhorter time. It is ſo great ſometimes, that it fills the Hypochondrion, and you cannot feel the ribs there, nor put a finger under it, and there is no ſhape of the Liver. This is known to be from much groſs vapours, becauſe there is not only heavineſs, but diſtention, as <hi>Galen lib. 5. de loc. affect.</hi> ſaith.</p>
                     <p>The Spleen is in like manner ſtretched with wind, as <hi>Trallianus,</hi> ſaith: as in other parts, ſo in the ſpleen, there is wind that grows to a tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour; it is like a Schirrus, but thus diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed: in a Schirrus, there is hardneſs not yielding, tumour and heavineſs in the left Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pochondrion: In a tumour from wind, it doth not ſtrongly reſiſt the touch, but yields to the finger, and the ſpleen is pricked and extended, but without heavineſs, and it comes ſooner. When vulgar Phyſitians underſtand not theſe two tumours of both Liver and Spleen, how blindly do they go to work with thouſands of Juleps! and they protract the cure, that they
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:108994:31"/>
may be largely rewarded, and when they have done more hurt then good, they affirm it to be a Schirrus, and from <hi>Galen,</hi> incurable. But they are very ignorant; for this cloudy wind fixed on the bowel, in time by the natural heat, ſomentations, faſting, an extenuating and hot diet given by women and Empericks, being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed, the humour vaniſheth, and the pain alſo, and the fooliſh Doctors contemned. I exhort therefore the ingenious that love their honour and the truth, to ſearch narrowly, and learn to know Symptoms from thoſe of other diſeaſes. It is hard, but excellent: For many Patients, as ready to dye for pain, cry out only from wind, which if corrupted, and come from a putrid and venomous matter, and run through the members with intolerable pain, needs an exact Artiſt to know the wind and the matter producing it, and diſtinguiſh the diſeaſe from others.</p>
                     <p>To this belongs the Tympany, Dropſie, when wind gets into the membranes of the belly with pain, and ſo into the ſpaces. <hi>Hippocrates Aph. 2. Sect.</hi> 4. ſpeaks of this thus. They that have pain about the Navel and Loyns, that will not be cured by medicines, will have a dry Dropſie. There are three ſorts of Dropſies; Anaſarca, Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites, and Tympanides, which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> calls the dry Dropſie. Anaſarca is a preternatural increaſe of the bulk of the body; here the feet ſwell firſt, at night chiefly, after exerciſe, or
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:108994:32"/>
when they have long hung down; they pit with the finger, the body is all ſoft, looſe, and pale, weak and tired with the leaſt pains; it is like the Green-ſickneſs in women, only the Dropſie ſwells the body, but in the other there is pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and trembling of the heart in motion, and ſhortneſs of wind going up ſtairs, and the body is heavy and ſluggiſh. The cauſe is the ſame in both, too much cooling of the Liver and Veins. The Liver cooled, the ſanguification is hurt, then comes crude and watry blood, which ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into the hollow vein, goes over all the body, and there is Anaſarca; and if the water from the Liver ſtretch the skin, without there will be bladders. If theſe break, the water gets into that part of the Peritonaeum which is by the lower belly, and then there is the ſecond kind of Dropſie called Aſcites. With this by degrees the belly is filled, and it ſwells unmeaſurably, the skin being looſned, and the reſt of the body pines away. If the body or the belly be turned, the water makes a noiſe. But in a Tympany there is no fluctuation of water, but the ſound of a drum when you ſtrike or fillip the belly with your finger. For <hi>Galen aph. 12. ſect.</hi> 4. ſaith, in theſe the air is beaten which is contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the skin; as in this kind of diſeaſe, the wind is ſtruck by the skin which is below. Cold of the bowels and veins is cauſe of all theſe Dropſies. The Aſcites or watry Dropſie is
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:108994:32"/>
from more cold, the Tympany from leſs; for water cannot be turned to wind without heat. Great thirſt follows all, chiefly Aſcites and Tympany: the firſt becauſe the water is ſalt and putrefied that is detained; and the other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is ſeldom wind alone in the belly without water which putrefies; alſo the wind takes away the moiſture of the ſtomach, and then it is dry, and deſires drink. This is thirſt, the deſire of moiſt and cold, or both. In exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals we ſee, that though the Earth be very wet with rain, yet when wind comes, it dryes it wonderfully in a ſhort time, and conſumes the moiſture. The ſame is done in the body; for one in a Tympany hath a thirſt beyond <hi>Tanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> the more he drinks, the more he may, and to ſatisfie the enemy in his bowels, he deſtroys himſelf with much drink. Alſo they in the Colick thirſt from the ſame cauſe.</p>
                     <p>Alſo wind ſwells the Cods and the Womb, it gets by inviſible paſſages into the cavity of them, or after Child-birth by the Orifice of the womb, or after bathing or fomenting; or it breeds there from ſome other cauſe, and there is ſtraitned, and ſo it ſtretcheth the womb. If the ſtretching be in the upper part of the womb, by force of the wind ſent thither, it aſcends and goes to the Midriff and ſtomach, and lyes like a ball there, and oppreſſeth it. Hence it is often driven down by the hands or fiſts, or by other
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:108994:33"/>
ſolid bodies into its proper place. But if either ſide of the womb be diſtended or ſtretcht more then the reſt, it gets by a Convulſion into the right or left Croyn, the Pecten and the lower belly are blown up and pained; ſometimes a noiſe is heard all over the body, there is belch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſwelling of the Loyns, and pain in the Reins and Hips, and when the belly is ſmitten with the fingers, there is a ſound like a drum, and the wind breaks forth at the mouth of the womb. <hi>Soranus</hi> ſaid, this was called a flatuous cold.</p>
                     <p>As wind gets into the womb of a woman, ſo it gets into the Cods of a man, with a diſeaſe or without, and is a diſeaſe by it ſelf. I have ſeen in a Tympany the Cods of a man ſwollen as big as a Hogs bladder. For the wind which at firſt was only in the membranes of the Abdomen and Peritonaeum, being now increaſed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring great ſpace, breaks them, and gets into the Cods, and fills alſo the whole body. Wind alſo extends the Cods without a diſeaſe in man, and chiefly new born children, and makes the Hernia called Pneumatocele, or windy Rupture. Sometimes it gets within the common mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane of the ſtones, and puffs up all the Cods alike; but when it gets between the tunicles of either ſtone, called Erythroides and Dartos, then one ſide of the Cod is only tumified. This tumour is tranſparent, and not heavy as that of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:108994:33"/>
You may try it in the dark with a Wax-candle held on the part oppoſite to your view.</p>
                     <p>Priapiſmus a Symptom of the Yard, hath two cauſes; one is the fulneſs of the Arteries of the Privities; the other is wind bred in the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulous Nerve. This fills the Nerve, ſo that it ſwells and makes the Yard ſtand without a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nereous deſire. <hi>Galen meth. med.</hi> 12. ſaith, there is another kind of Priapiſm, when the Yard ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends againſt deſire: For the Nerve that makes the proper ſubſtance of the Yard, being hollow, and filled with wind, cauſeth it. So Priapiſm is a permanent enlargement of the Yard in length and thickneſs, without deſire of Venery; and wind is the cauſe, as appears by its quick riſe and ſudden fall, which no humour could make. But Palpitation goes before this Pria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſm of wind, but not before that which is from the dilatation of the Artery.</p>
                     <p>We have ſhewed how wind fills the internal parts, and what evils it cauſeth; we ſhall now ſhew what Symptoms it produceth in the habit of the body: For it is thin, and not only fills vacuity, but diſſolves continuity, tears the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes in themſelves, and from the bones, and ſwiftly ſtrikes like a dart upon any part, cauſing great pain. Sometimes like cold air, it affects the ſenſible nervous parts without great pain; but this is little and very thin, and eaſily vaniſheth by the natural heat, and Fomentations. But it is
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:108994:34"/>
harder to be diſcuſſed, when it gets under the skin or membranes of the bones, being thicker, and more, and ſwells them to a windy Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtume. <hi>Galen</hi> diſtinguiſheth this from Oedema, which is from water, and yields to the finger, and pits deep. But an inflation is from wind, either under the skin or membranes of the bones, or under the Muſcles. This pits not with the finger, but ſounds like a drum with a fillip. Sometimes it cauſeth no tumour; but lying under the skin, through which it cannot breathe, being thick, it only beateth: this the Vulgar call the life. And <hi>Langius</hi> in an Epiſtle wittily ſhews the arrogancy and ignorance of ſome Chirurgions, that when they ſee the Muſcles of the Temples, Forehead, Cheeks, or Jaws tremble by wind in the skin, and to ſwell, they ſay, there is the ſoul or life, as in a priſon: alſo without purging, which is leſs dangerous then bleeding, they let blood, and beholding the blood to tremble in the Porringer by reaſon of wind, they fear that life is gone forth with the blood; and therefore they make the patient drink it off hot. Silly fellows! that know not that air feeds the vital and animal ſpirits, gets not only into the Arteries of the Brain, Lungs, and Heart, but into all parts by inſpiration, and the pores; and is mixed with the blood by the Anaſtomoſis of the Arteries with the Veins; and wind will breed from clammy humours, not
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:108994:34"/>
only in the Muſcles and all parts that may be ſtretched (as the Stomach, Guts, Liver, Spleen, Midriff, and Womb in teeming women) which move the womb, ſo that they think the Child moveth. And it cauſeth a trembling, not only in the Muſcles and other members, but chiefly in the Heart. And as wind ſhut up in the bowels of the Earth, ſhakes as it is ready to get forth; ſo wind in the body, being comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the muſcles or other ſtretchable parts, ſhakes them till it gets forth. Thus <hi>Langius</hi> and <hi>Galen lib. 2. de Art. curat. ad Glauc.</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms him, ſaying, that that ſort of wind which is groſs, ſometimes lyes under the membranes of the bones, ſometimes under the Peritonaeum, ſometimes in the guts and belly, ſometimes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the membranes about the muſcles and the membranous tendons, and the ſpaces of the muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and other parts. Therefore the force of wind is wonderful, that like Thunder paſſeth through inſenſible paſſages into private places, even into the bones and marrow, and cauſeth pain; but being between the bone and the Perioſtium, it teareth them aſunder with great pain.

                     <p>ALL diſeaſes of wind in any part, are hard to be cured, if it cannot get forth; the thicker and more cloſe it is, the longer it remains, and cauſeth worſe Symptoms. When it ſeparates the parts, it cauſeth pain, and pain cauſeth flux of humours, and the humour getting into the crannies of the part ſtretched, cauſeth a tumour, the tumour diſtends the skin and membranes, and contracts them: hence, the blood being not cooled, comes corruption and increaſe of preternatural heat. If this tumour be hard, and yield, red and beating, it is an inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; if it be white, yielding to touch, and pit, it is an Oedema; if it be white, yielding, and tranſparent, it is an inflation. Sometimes wind makes a Dropſie, as <hi>Hippocrates lib. de Flatibus</hi> ſaith, wind gets through the fleſh, and makes thin the pores, and then follows moiſture, to which the wind before had made a paſſage; and the body is moiſtned, the fleſh melts, and the humours fall down to the Legs, and then comes a Dropſie. They in whom wind hath long remained, are ſubject to all theſe diſeaſes, as the Aphoriſm ſaith. They who have pains
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:108994:35"/>
about the Navel and Loyns, that will not away with Phyſick or other ways, will have a dry Dropſie. This wind is not diſcuſſed by medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, or other things, by reaſon of the habitual diſtemper of the part, which perſevering, cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a Tympany, the worſt of Dropſies: I never knew it cured when confirmed. If then it be ſo dangerous, becauſe the wind will yield to no remedies, by reaſon of the cauſe that feeds it, <hi>Hippocrates Prognoſt. lib.</hi> 1. ſaid well, it is very healthful for wind to paſs forth without noiſe; but it is better to break with noiſe, then ſtay and move about, and cauſe pain. If any from mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, when they are ſound, will rather dye then fart, let them know that they dote, or muſt endure pain. If one fart willingly, it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies no ill, but only it were better to be voided without noiſe: For a noiſe ſhews much wind or ſtraitneſs of the veſſels; but that noiſe which is heard in new diſeaſes in the Hypochondria, pains or ſwellings, is not bad. <hi>Hippocrates lib. 2. Prognoſt.</hi> ſaith, new pains and ſwellings in the Hypochondria without inflammation, are diſſolved by noiſe, chiefly if there be ſtools and urine; and if the wind goes not forth, it is good that it goes downward. Theſe tumours being only of wind, are diſſolved by their rumbling, it ſhews wind joyned with a humour, and ſign fies good, that is, that the wind will go forth with the humour it is mixed with; or
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:108994:36"/>
if not, that it will go downward, and the pain and tumour will ceaſe. And <hi>Hippocrates Aph. 73. lib<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> 4. ſaith, they who have ſtretched Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondria with rumbling, and after that a pain in the Loyns, will have a moiſt belly or looſneſs, except they fart or piſs much. The Hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria rumbles and ſwells from wind alone, or mixed with humours; and if it alone breaks forth upward or downward with the humour, it is without danger, and the pain and tumour ſuddenly depart. For the Liver and Spleen lying in the Hypochondria, if they be much pained, it is from ſtrong inflammation or wind; if from wind, a Fever coming, removes the pain. As <hi>Hippocrates Aph. 52. lib.</hi> 7. ſaith, they whoſe Liver is much pained, are cured by a Fever; for the heat of it doth diſcuſs the wind. Now a Fever doth not follow an inflammation, but comes with it; nor doth it take off pain, but increaſe it. It appears that the heat of a Fever diſcuſſeth wind, becauſe they in the Jaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice ſeldom have fits of wind, becauſe they are hot of conſtitution, as <hi>Hippocrates Aph. 78. lib.</hi> 5. ſaith, they in the Jaundice are not much windy: For they are cholerick, and Choler will not ſuffer wind to raign, but diſcuſſeth it. But Phelgmaticks, and they of a moiſt and cold ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and the ſanguine, are troubled with wind, and eaſily have the Colick. And all know that great pains of the Colick are more
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:108994:36"/>
dangerous then leſs, and a total collection of excrements and wind into one part of the Colon, is worſe then when they run about many parts. Therefore there is leſs danger when wind is broken by Clyſters, and the ſtools take away the pain, then when not. But if wind cauſe a a doting, contraction of Nerves, fainting, cold limbs, cold ſweat, conſtant vomiting, ſtoppage of all excrements, as it doth when it comes from venomous matter, it is deadly, and there is a Convolvulus. It is beſt to be without wind, or eaſily diſcuſs it; but this cannot be without diligent caution and good diet in the uſe of the ſix natural things.</p>

                     <head type="sub">Of Diet to be obſerved by windy Bodies.</head>
                     <p>TO prevent breeding of wind by diet, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſs it when bred, four things are to be obſerved, chiefly in ſuch as have bodies apt to breed it; Order, Manner, Time, and Subſtance. The Order is, that they begin not dinner nor ſupper with drink, nor drink a great draught, as the cuſtom is after they have eaten a bit or two: Drink is beſt, when you have taken moſt part of the food. Alſo let liquid things be eaten
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:108994:37"/>
before hard, and looſners before aſtringents, and thoſe of eaſie concoction before thoſe of hard. The Manner is, that more food be not taken then can be concocted without difficulty, by riſing with an appetite, and not drinking more then to quench thirſt, and waſh down the meat, which will make the body lazy, and oppreſs the native heat. Some are never ſatisfied, except they carouſe exceedingly when they eat; ſome drink ſo, that they can eat little or nothing: this cauſeth fluctuation and inflation, becauſe the ſtomach cannot embrace the quantity. Time alſo muſt be obſerved, that they drink not faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nor between meals, or after ſupper, or in bed. nor eat before the former is digeſted, nor ſit long at meat. They muſt abſtain from groſs meats, they ſtop the narrow paſſages, ſuch as produce a clammy juyce, hard of concoction, ſalt Beef and Pork, from cold, and ſowre, and ſharp things; and all Summer-fruits, crude or boiled, Pulſe, Sallets, Milk, and all Milk-meats, all Junkets, as Fritters, Pancakes, Sweet-cakes, &amp;c. chiefly that which our women call White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pots, or that made of Eggs, Butter, and Honey in a Frying-pan or an Oven: And from that of green Cheeſe, Beets, Paſte, Eggs, and Oyl, which the Italians call a Tart. Alſo the Italian Diſhes are very hurtful, Turtellae, Laſaniae, Macaroons, Worms, and the like, made fit for the palate. Theſe fill the body with groſs humours, and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:108994:37"/>
ſo oppreſs the natural heat, that the ſtomach concocts worſe after, being not able to overcome the tough and clammy humours. But ſome will devour ſuch traſh and junkets, and contemn better food, and yet find no inconvenience, or very little. To which I anſwer: That all food made of paſte cauſeth groſs and clammy hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and many excrements, and obſtructions, and matter fit to breed wind. But if they be taken by a good and firm ſtomach, and well concocted (which I think ſcarce can be) and they find no hurt thereby worth notice; it doth not therefore follow, that they are of themſelves without harm: For all know, that to drink great draughts is an enemy to Nature; and that a medicine of Hemlock preſently killed <hi>Socrates.</hi> Therefore he concludes nothing that ſaith, therefore theſe things are not hurtful, and not to be diſpraiſed; becauſe ſome Drunkards will drink off great bowls, and the Athenian old Woman uſed to eat Hemlock, and becauſe one or two make food of paſte that nouriſheth. For the ſtomach embraceth ſweet things, and ſuch as are eaten with great delight, more cloſe, and eaſier digeſts them. Therefore three things make food, which is of its own nature hurtful, to be innocent and milder; uſe or cuſtom, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and a ſtrong firm ſtomach: For the beſt nouriſhing food hurts the ſtomach, if it loath it; and Brook-fiſh cauſe trouble to it, if it be weak.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:108994:38"/>
And let theſe men, if they will not be admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by me, be moved with the threatning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> with which he affrighteth Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons, let them not rejoyce when they eat bad food; for though they are not hurt by them at the preſent, afterwards they will not eſcape. To this belongs variety of meats, which cauſeth many crudities and winds in the body: For many things of divers natures are confounded, and theſe being unequally concocted and diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted, the natural heat muſt needs be put to it. You muſt avoid all great and Fen-fiſh, and ſuch as live in mud on putrefaction; their fleſh is ſlimy and clammy, cold, and hath much excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Alſo let windy people abſtain from wine too much cooled, from water, and from great draughts of drink drawn from a cool Cellar, chiefly when they are hot out wardly, or weary after exerciſe or labour, and from all exceſs of air, chiefly cold, which preſently reacheth the ſtomach, if not kept warm-clothed; and from cold and moiſture at the feet. Sitting long upon cold ſtones hath often cauſed great Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms from wind. Let him avoid idleneſs alſo and ſleeping in the day; theſe raiſe vapours, but diſcuſs them not; ſet upon concoction, but bring it not to perfection: whence comes crude flegm, the true material cauſe of flegm. When the ſtomach or guts are diſtended or ſtretcht with wind, let them abſtain from meat and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:108994:38"/>
drink, and feed very ſtenderly, and be ſober. For when the uſual diet is taken from the body, or abated, the native heat is not ſo put to it to alter and concoct food; but is active, and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth, and ſpreads it ſelf, and ſhews its ſtrength: firſt it concocts crudities, and atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuates the groſs humours, cleanſeth the tough, takes away the cauſe that will breed wind, ſends them for that the right paſſages, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſeth ſuch wind as is bred, and keeps it from breeding. And to be ſhort, faſting alone is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to cure any diſeaſe from crudity or wind. It is true that there is more trouble from the fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about of wind in the body that is empty, in ſuch as faſt and uſe a ſpare diet; but this will not be long, for they will preſently break forth, and free the patient from all pain, and the ſooner by uſe of exerciſe. For it is the Doctrine of <hi>Hippocrates Epid.</hi> 6. agreeable to this my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, fit to be written in gold in every houſe, That we ought not to eat to fulneſs, and to be ready to take pains. And <hi>Galen de ſanit. tuend. lib.</hi> 2. reckons up many ſorts of exerciſes, Wraſtling, Fencing, Running, &amp;c. which we ſhall not ſpeak of, only let this ſuffice, that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate exerciſe at ball or fencing, running or walking, faſting, and after the body hath diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged the excrements, doth wonderfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create all the faculties, and ſpread the native heat through the body, concoct humours, and make
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:108994:39"/>
the members active for their duties, loofens the belly, and ſends forth wind ſo powerfully, that there is no remedy like it, and nothing ſafer nor better then ſeaſonable exerciſe with a ſpare diet. Eat therefore little, and that with muſtard, or other attenuating and heating ſauce (except the conſtitution be ſanguine or cholerick) Sage, Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſop, Savory, Fennel, Marjoram, Pennyroyal, Calamints are to be uſed, and roaſted meat with Spices, Sage or Roſemary. Let his bread be well leavened, and with Fennel, Aniſe, Parſley or Gith ſeeds. His Wine ſtrong, when wind breeds from weak heat. If the body be cholerick or plethorick, drink little wine, and that with water. Let the powders following be taken after meat preſently, they do very much good: They ſtrengthen and conſtringe the ſtomach, and ſuffer not the vapours of the food to flye into the head, ſtir up the natural heat, quicken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, digeſt the Chyle, drive excrements downwards, and diſcuſs wind exceedingly. As, Take <hi>Aniſeeds candied three ounces, Fennel ſeed an ounce and half, Coriander prepared an ounce, Cummin, Caraway, Seſeli ſteept in white Wine, each a dram; dryed Citron peel, groſs Cinnamon, each four ſcruples; white Sugar twice as much.</hi> Take a ſpoonful after meat, and drink not after.</p>
                     <p>Or thus, Take <hi>Coriander prepared, Caraway, Aniſeeds, each an ounce; red Roſes, Maſtich, each a dram and half; dryed Mints a dram,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:108994:39"/>
Nutmeg, Cinnamon, Cubebs, each half a dram; make a fine Powder, and add Sugar of Roſes eight ounces: give a ſpoonful after meat.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>At night when concoction is almoſt finiſhed, chew Elicampane candied, or Ginger a dram, and ſwallow it, or Gentian roots, or Maſterwort, candied Cubebs, or two or three grains of white Pepper, only broken, they wonderfully help a ſlow, weak concoction, and expel wind; and they do the like in the morning faſting after going to ſtool. If the belly be bound, give Leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, as three drams of Turpentine waſhed in white Wine, in Wafers before dinner, or half a dram of Rhubarb chewed and ſwallowed, or a ſcruple of waſhed Aloes an hour afore ſupper; or Carthamus ſeeds husked with Figs: I allow not Caſſia, it is windy. Thus much for Diet; if it be tedious, and do not cure, take theſe medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines.</p>

                     <p>SOme will wonder, that I ſhall order the cure of Symptoms mentioned, which of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves admit no Cure. But we do it for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the Reader: For he that diſcuſſeth wind, takes away the cauſe, he that corrects the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, and mends the faults in conformation, and reſtores the ſolution of unity, cures the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe: But he that cures the pains that come from the diſeaſes, looks at the Symptoms. Therefore we have called windy Diſeaſes Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms, looking at the pains they produce, for the better method, and then we have ordered the mitigation of Symptoms, and the Cure of Diſeaſes. The knowledge of the diſeaſe gives the indication of cure. The diſeaſe is the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction of the parts by wind that ſtretcheth them, which pain doth follow, as a ſhadow, and the diſeaſe vaniſheth with the cauſe, and the parts come to their old natural habit. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore diſeaſes from wind are to be cured by three ſorts of remedies. 1. By diet that is attenuating, hot and dry. 2. By medicines that open obſtructions, and cut groſs clammy

matter, and purge, which you ſhall find in every Chapter. 3. The diſcuſſing of wind ſpeedily before the ſtrength abate by pain; which is done by medicines of thin parts, which if there be pain, will abate it, and ſtrengthen the weak heat, and extenuate the thick ſpirit, and open the thickneſs of parts.

                     <p>WInd tyranizeth in divers places, as <hi>Galen de compoſ. med. ſecund. loc. lib.</hi> 2. ſaith, wind breeds in the ſtomach and guts for want of heat, ſometimes from the nature of the food, and the organs are ſo filled and puffed up, by reaſon of the weakneſs of the comprehenſive fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, that they ſtretch, and thereby have pain; the ſame may be in parts of the head; for a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour or clammy humour that feeds it, may be ſo fixed in the ſtrait paſſages of the Brain, that it will require a long cure. Firſt therefore, whether it be wind alone in the paſſages, which is known from the motion of the pain from place to place, and by ſtretching without heavineſs
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:108994:41"/>
and beating; or if there be much flegm that feeds it, and ſo there is heavineſs with ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſenſe of cold; or if it flye to the head from parts below, it is much concerned as to the cure. Yet we begin in all windy diſeaſes the ſame way; partly by revelling from the head to the body; partly by applying remedies to the part affected: we revel by Clyſters and Purges. You may make Clyſters thus.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Mallows, Mercury, red Coleworts, Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minth, each half a handful; Chamomil flowers, Bran, each a pugil. Boil them to a pint and half, add Diacatholicon, red Sugar, each an ounce and half; Species Hierae ſimple two drams, Oyl of Dill three ounces, Salt a little, make a Clyſter.</hi> Give it before meat, not luke-warm, for ſuch things puff up, but hot, and that by degrees, leſt by force it drive the wind more upwards, and cauſe more pain. This is an excellent medicine which without trouble opens obſtructions, and empties out the hard dung and wind, and draws it from the head. After this, give one of the Carminatives or Wind-breakers.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Althaea roots two ounces, Mallows, Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mints, Pennyroyal, Rue, Sage, each a handful; flowers of Chamomil, Stoechas, Roſemary, each a pugil; Aniſe, and wild Rue ſeeds, and Cubebs, each three drams; Coloquintida a dram. Boil them to a pint ſtrained, add Electuary of Dates an ounce, Hiera Logodii two drams, red Sugar an
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:108994:41"/>
ounce and half, Oyl of Rue three ounces, Sal Gem a dram: give it before meat.</hi> It revels ſtrongly from the head, expels wind with the excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. But if the Piles or diſtaſt will not allow a Clyſter, give this Laxative in Coſtiveneſs.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Diacatholicon an ounce, ſpecies Hierae ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple a dram; with Sugar make a Bolus, or a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Lenitive Electuary ſix drams, Electuary of the juyce of Roſes a dram, Syrup of Roſe ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive an ounce and half: diſſolve them in the deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Flowers and Cordial Fruits.</hi> After La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xatives, if the head be full of groſs humours, give potions that attenuate and cut, of Hyſop, Pennyroyal, Calamints, Sage, French Lavender and Roſemary-flowers, with Syrup of Stoechas, Honey of Roſemary.</p>
                     <p>Or, Take <hi>Hyſop, Sage, Calamints, each a handful; flowers of Stoechas, Roſemary, Chamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mil, each a pugil; male Piony-ſeeds an ounce, Aniſe, Carrot, Parſley-ſeeds, each two drams. Boil, and to a pint ſtrained add Syrup of Stoechas, Honey of Roſemary, each an ounce and half; Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namon a dram: make an Apozem for divers draughts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The humours thus prepared, and the wind attenuated at leaſt, purge with theſe pills.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Pilulae aureae a dram, Troches of Alhan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal three grains, with Syrup of Stoechas; make five Pills: give them at midnight.</hi>

                     <p>This done often, and the pain ceaſe not, let us uſe Topicks, as <hi>Galen lib. de compoſ. med. ſec. loc.</hi> ſaith; ſometimes wind or clammy matter is ſometimes ſo fixed in ſtrait paſſages, that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires long Cure: Therefore it muſt be atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated, and the part dilated, and the part ſtrengthened, that no more come or breed. Therefore after preparatives and purges, uſe cupping to the head without bleeding, if blood abound not: or ſcarifie the ſhoulders, if blood abound. This is very good. Or roaſt a Turnep, and take off the top, and apply it hot behind the Ears, and then another, and ſo till the wind and pain paſs away: apply it to the ſide of the part pained, or to both, if the pain be all over. This is good alſo for the Toothach from wind. Or uſe Caſtor or Scents that pierce and exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate, or Gith-ſeed ſteept in Vinegar: or anoint the Noſtrils and Ears with Oyl of Caſtor or Spike, or Oyl in which were boiled Caſtor, Rue, Calaminths, Piony-ſeeds.

                     </p>
                     <p>Or, Take <hi>Roots of Pellitory, Staveſacre, each two ſcruples; Nutmeg, Ginger, white Pepper, each half a ſcruple; Maſtich two drams, with Vinegar make Balls:</hi> or diſcuſs wind, and eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuate with Neeſings.</p>

When we think the Brain is cleanſed, then dry and ſtrengthen, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſs wind with a Lixivium. As <hi>Galen lib. 7. de facult natural.</hi> it is made of water and aſhes, one pound of aſhes to three pints of water, take moſt aſhes of Willows and Vines, and fewer of Colewort and Bean ſtalks. This cleanſeth, dryes, and conſumes wind and tumours of flegm, with Marjoram, Bettony, Aſarabacca, Bay and Juniper-berries, and Roſemary boiled in it. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Wormwood, Sage, dryed Roſemary, each a pugil; Frankincenſe, Milium parched, red Roſes dry, Chamomil flowers, each two drams; Juniper-berries and Piony ſeeds, each a dram; Cloves, long Pepper, Cubebs, Wood Aloes, each a ſcruple; make a Quilt of Silk.</hi>

                        <pb n="68" facs="tcp:108994:43"/>

                     <p>WE ſhewed that wind would move very ſwiftly, and in a moment go through the thickeſt bodies: it is no wonder then, if it get into the Nerves under the Teeth, and cauſe intolerable pains by ſtretching and by its cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Therefore the Cure is to being with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Evacuations by emollient Clyſters. As,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Diacatholicon an ounce and half, red Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar an ounce, Oyl of Dill and of Chamomil, each an ounce and half; Salt a dram: diſſolve them in the common Decoction for Clyſters a pint.</hi> If after the excrements are diſcharged, you deſire to diſſolve more the thickneſs of the wind and revel, make this.</p>

                     </p>

                        <pb n="72" facs="tcp:108994:45"/>
If they will not take Clyſters, give Pills of waſhed Aloes, of Hiera, aureae Cochic. after pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration and abatement of pain. But if pain be great, and the matter ſmall, omit prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and evacuation, and fall upon that which moſt diſturbeth: therefore aſſwage pain ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily: apply a ſmall Cupping-glaſs without much flame twice or thrice to the ſhoulder, then take Gith, Cummin ſeed, Pellitory and Parſley roots, each half an ounce; boil them in Wine to the conſumption of half, waſh the teeth with it hot, it will diſcuſs, and attenuate, and amend the cold diſtemper, and draw out much ſlimy matter which breeds wind. Or boil Pellitory roots half an ounce, white Pepper a dram in Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar, and waſh the mouth therewith: or you may make a Bag, and apply it to the Tooth thus.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Calamints, Hyſop, Chamomil, each a handful; Milium parched, Bran, Salt, each a pugil; Cummin half an ounce: make a Bag.</hi> Then put a red hot Iron into an earthen Jug, and pour into it three or four ſpoonfuls of Vinegar, and let the Bag take the Fume at the mouth of the Jug. The Women hold it for a great Secret to apply a roaſted Turnep behind the Ears, for it revels ſtrongly, and abates pain, to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. I never allowed Narcoticks in this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, for they thicken the wind too much, and make it fix like a cloud upon the Nerves and

roots of the Teeth, and congealing makes a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle eaſe, but increaſeth the Diſeaſe. But if the pain be intolerable, to refreſh Nature you muſt uſe Narcoticks with hot things to abate their force, and look both at the Symptom and cauſe. Thus,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Pellitory, Pepper, each a ſcruple; Opium half a ſcruple:</hi> bind them in a Clout, and infuſe them two or three hours in Vinegar, and apply it to the Tooth. Or,</p>

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:108994:46"/>
it is certainly from a defluxion, and chiefly of hot matter; if it abate, it is from wind, or a ſmall defluxion which eaſily breaks forth when the skin is made thinner by the Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation. It is not good to uſe Fomentations only, but to give Clyſters to make paſſage for the wind; for in this diſeaſe the excrements are hard by idleneſs or drineſs, when the moiſture is gone to the veins, or from much flegm that is groſs, which ſtops the paſſages: therefore give a common Clyſter firſt, then a ſtronger to purget ſee the precedent Chapter. If he will not take a Clyſter, give this Medicine.</p>

When the wind is thus diſcuſſed, it is good to apply a great Cupping-glaſs ſix fingers breadth below the part without Scarification, but with a great flame twice or thrice: this will diſcuſs the wind eaſier, it would not at firſt be diſcuſſed by a Cupping-glaſs.

                     <p>A Palpitation is a Symptom of the Heart, namely an elevation and depreſſion of it preternaturally cauſed by wind, and it is more dangerous then another palpitation, becauſe the part is moſt noble. For if it be ſtrong, or laſt

Let the air be clear, hot and dry, not ſtinking or cloudy: make it ſo by art, if it be not naturally clear, and ſweet by ſweet cordial things. Let him abſtain from ſtrong paſſions of mind, chiefly from ſudden fear and ſhamefulneſs, and from much Wine (but moderate doth well) and Venery, and ſleep in the day, cold drink, and from all things mentioned in the Chapter of prevention. Keep the Belly looſe by Clyſters, or Suppoſitories.</p>

For bleeding doth good, more by revulſion of humours from the Heart, then weak and attracting by its motion, then by any other way, in regard there is then a cold diſtemper, and the wind is cold. Open there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Liver-vein in the right Arm, and bleed by degrees for revulſion; except there be any hindrance from age, ſtrength, or the like. Then uſe extenuating Diet and cutting Medicines that expel wind, to correct the cold diſtemper of the Heart, and ſtrengthen it, and conſume flegm that breeds wind, and ſtir up natural heat, and reſtore the animal and natural actions.

                     <p>Take <hi>Turbith a dram, Diagredium two grains, Ginger half a dram, Sugar two drams.</hi> Powder them, give it with Chicken-broth: in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning after theſe preparatives and purges, give the former ſtrengtheners.

                     <p>THe inflation of the ſtomach is a preterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural extenſion of the Membranes of the ſtomach by wind, with pain.

This pain is ſometimes before meat moſt, ſometimes after. Before meat, becauſe there is a groſs clammy flegm, with a cold diſtemper, which oppreſſeth the heat, and it laboureth to conquer it, and ſo cauſeth wind that ſtretcheth, and is diſturbant. This pain is allayed by belching, or vomiting flegm. It is worſt after meat, when it is only

I ſuppoſe there is no Remedy like it: alſo Caſtor half a dram, Cloves half a ſcruple drunk in Wine, or Poli montane in Wine, or Oxymel or Vinegar of Squills, which cuts vehemently, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven an ounce twice in a day in Wine. <hi>Aegineta</hi> ſaith, that the bone of a Hogs foot burnt and drunk, diſcuſſeth wind.

hot, if they fall upon clammy flegm, do raiſe wind, which they cannot diſcuſs; and inſtead of Cure will do hurt: and that which is good after purging is bad before. Beware then you uſe not too weak Remedies that cannot over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, or too ſtrong out of order; and ſo caſt the Patient into a Tympany. It is good out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly to bind the ſtomach ſtrait, to hinder wind, and further concoction, and to foment the ſtomach with Oyl, with Rue, Calamints, Roſemary, Cummin, Aniſe, Smallage, Carrot ſeed, Bay-berries boiled in it: or boil them in Wine, and foment, or uſe Oyl of Mace or Cloves. Theſe by their thinneſs open the skin, and extenuate, diſcuſs the wind, and ſtrengthen, and warm, and reſtore the ſuffocated heat, and refreſh by a propriety of ſubſtance. You may make of theſe an excellent Oyntment, thus.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Oyl of Mace by expreſſion ſix drams, Oyl of Wormwood, Maſtich, each four drams; Wood Aloes, Nutmeg, Cubebs, Cloves, each half a dram; Musk, Benzoin, Saffron, each ſix grains.</hi> Make a Powder, and with Wax make an Oyntment: anoint with it hot before meat: after the former Fomentation and Oyntment, apply a Bag of Feathers, or this.</p>

                     <head type="sub">Of the Cure of windy Melancholy.</head>
                     <p>THis is hard to be cured for divers cauſes. For beſides the vehement obſtruction of the Meſeraicks with groſs crude Melancholy and flegm, which conſtantly ſend up wind, there is a great diſtemper of the bowels. Hence come great accidents, namely ſtoppage of excrements from a hot Liver that drys and ſucks up the moiſture, difficult breathing from the ſtomach ſwollen and preſſing the Midriff, pain of ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach from wind that ſtretcheth, and a cold diſtemper; belchings, vomitings, and putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction from obſtruction in time, by the veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous vapours whereof the Soul fainteth, and there is a doting. This inequality of parts hath contrary indications for Cure. For the heat of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:108994:52"/>
the Liver requires cooling, and the cold of the ſtomach heating. And it is plain, that the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines that cut groſs humours, and extenuate and prepare, and evacuate and diſcuſs wind, muſt be very hot, and hot things increaſe the heat of the Liver and the veins; and heat abounding, diſperſeth what is thin in the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and thickens the reſt, and fixeth it more, and makes more wind from that humour. On the contrary, cold things by congealing to thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the matter, ſtop the paſſages, and abate the natural heat of the ſtomach, hinder concoction, cauſe crudities and wind. Therefore the only way is to cure by moderate Preparatives and Purges, and becauſe moderation doth little good in ſo great a diſeaſe, it is very hard to be cured. But let not difficulty frighten, but begin valiant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with this Clyſter.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Polypody roots, Senna, each an ounce; Mallows, Pellitory, Beets, red Coleworts, each a handful; Chamomil flowers a pugil, Aniſeeds ſix drams: boil them to half, to a pint ſtrained add Diacatholicon and red Sugar, each an ounce; Oyl of Dill two ounces, with a little Salt make a Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</hi> Or give this Potion.</p>

Four days following prepare with the Apozem mentioned, in a ſtrong body give it twice a day, and if there be a very ſoul body, give every other night two or three of theſe Pills.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Pill aureae foetidae, each half a dram; Troches of Alhandal four grains, with Oxymel make five Pills.</hi> Theſe do wonders in carrying of the prepared matter. When the Syrups are ſpent, purge with Confectio Hamec, Pills of Agarick foetidae, &amp;c. Alſo <hi>Montanus</hi> his Syrup, <hi>Chap.</hi> 18. is excellent. After the body is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently purged, correct the diſtemper of the

                     <head type="sub">Of the Cure of the Colick.</head>
                     <p>I Shall ſpeak by way of Preſace. Firſt, expect not any other Cure then that of wind alone, or joyned with glaſſie flegm. Secondly, be careful, leſt it turn to a Joynt-gout, as <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes lib. 6. epid. part. 4. aphor.</hi> 3. ſaith, one that had the Colick had a Gout, and then his pain of the Colick ceaſed, but returned when the Gout ceaſed. Thirdly, bleeding is good, if the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe be vehement, and there be Plethory or Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. Fourthly, beware of ſtrong heaters, chiefly before flegm is evacuated. Fifthly, let the chief means be Clyſters. Sixthly, cupping doth little good, but in ſeaſon and in a fit body. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conſider firſt whether the pain be from a flegmon in the Guts, or Choler that corrodes the inward Membranes, or glaſſie flegm, or from wind that ſtretcheth. If ſo, then obſerve if the pain be vehement or moderate, with or without a Plethora or fulneſs. If there be much blood with great pain, preſently after a Clyſter open a Vein, leſt great pain attract blood, and cauſe an Inflammation or a Fever. Then uſe ſtrong Clyſters of Hiera Indi major, Hiera Logodii: for no medicine can better purge flegm from the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:108994:55"/>
Guts. For <hi>Galen lib</hi> 5 <hi>meth.</hi> ſaith, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing taken at the mouth can come with its full force to the Guts, but a Clyſter without trouble reacheth them: therefore a Clyſter is beſt; for things taken at the mouth muſt needs be hot (for the diſeaſe is cold, and contraries are cured by contraries) and muſt be given in great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities at the mouth, if they do good. But all hot things being of thin parts, eaſily paſs through the Meſeraicks, and bring hot diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to them and to the Liver, and make the blood flow. Alſo heat melts the clammy flegm, and makes more wind, and a good medicine abuſed, becomes venom. Therefore I adviſe Phyſitians to be wary in the uſe of Mithridate, Treacle, Diacalamints, and other Heaters in Colicks, before ſhe glaſſie flegm fixed in the Guts be purged, and then uſe them not often. The beſt way is by Clyſters firſt emollient, to carry the common Excrements. As,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Diacatholicon ten drams, Hiera ſimple with Honey half an ounce, Sugar an ounce, Salt a dram and half: diſſolve them in a pint of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of Mallows, and the five Emollients, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>momil flowers, Bran, and red Peaſe.</hi> Then, as <hi>Galen lib.</hi> 2. <hi>ad Glauc.</hi> ſaith, inject Oyl of Rue, Bayes, or common Oyl, in which are boiled Heaters that extenuate, as Cummin, Smallage, Parſley, Aniſeed, Seſeli, Lovage, Carrot ſeed, Rue, and Bay-berries, adding Bitumen. Or this which is ſtronger.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>If theſe do not cure, repeat them, or others, according to the greatneſs of the diſeaſe, plenty of flegm or wind, or weakneſs of the patient: remembring that ſtill after the Clyſter, he lye on the ſide pained. In the mean while give things moderately hot at the mouth, as the Decoction of Chamomil flowers in white Wine, or of Cummin, which are excellent; with an ounce or two of Oyl of ſweet Almonds, Lineſeed, or common Oyl. Or give new Oyl of ſweet Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds warm three ounces. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Rheniſh Wine four ounces, Oyl of Nuts a dram or two ſcruples, common Oyl a ſpoonful: give it hot with Sugar.</hi> Oyl is anodyne, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples the parts, and ſtops the mouths of the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and weakens the attractive faculty, and makes the anodynes and correcters of cold, and diſcuſſers of wind to pierce ſooner to the part; nor can they be ſo ſoon taken in by the Veins. For this diſeaſe is loathing, and many do vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit: for ſuch,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>tops of Wormwood half a pugil, Cummin ſeed two drams, Chamomil and Roſemary flowers,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:108994:56"/>
each a pugil; Cubebs half a dram: boil them in Wine, ſtrain, and give it with Cinnamon and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, or half a dram of Caſtor in Wine with Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namon and Saffron.</hi> Such as have the belly much ſwollen, and are tormented, and have the Hic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets from cold clammy humours or groſs wind, muſt take it in Vinegar and Water. If the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe be very ſtubborn, and they will take no Clyſters, or flegm falls from the whole body in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Guts, uſe flegm-purgers after prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives; they are mentioned before. If you will uſe Narcoticks with Purgers,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>ſix drams of Electuary of Indi majoris, Troches of Alhandal, Caſtor, Opium, each four grains; with Sugar make a Bole.</hi> Or give this Infuſion.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Agarick four ſcruples, Ginger a ſcruple: infuſe them in the Decoction of Pennyroyal, Hyſop, Roſemary, Chamomil twelve hours, ſtrain, and add Diaphoenicon three drams, Philonium Perſicum a ſcruple, or half a dram if it be old, with Sugar.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Or, Take <hi>Pills of Hiera with Agarick two ſcruples, Cochy one ſcruple, Diagredium, Caſtor, Opium, each three grains: with Wine make ſeven Pills.</hi> By this means flegm is purged, wind diſcuſſed, and pain abated. <hi>Galen lib.</hi> 2. <hi>ad Glauc<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> gives Narcoticks alone: if, ſaith he, pain remain, give Opium; you may not fear it, though it may do ſome hurt to the part afflicted: you muſt oppoſe that which moſt urgeth; it is
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:108994:56"/>
good to ſave a dying man with a ſmall hurt, for the day following you may repair it. You may give half a dram or two ſcruples, or a dram of Philonium Perſicum in Wine, or the Pills of <hi>Rondelet,</hi> which are theſe.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Powder of Galangal, Aromaticum roſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, each two drams; Caſtor half a dram, Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorbium ten grains, Opium prepared with a hot Peſtel, and diſſolved in Sack, a ſcruple and half, Pepper, Saffron, Mirrh, each half a ſcruple; make ten Pills of a dram: give four or five;</hi> or if the pain abate not, nine or ten. They muſt be ſmall and ſoft, that they may be the better diſſolved, and ſooner give eaſe, and ſtay leſs while in the ſtomach. But give no Opiats before Evacuations, and that before meat faſting, and in extremity, and when other Anodynes do no good. A Colick from wind only requires neither preparatives nor purges, but only Clyſters that allay pain, and diſcuſs wind: as,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Lineſeed Oyl, Decoction of Chamomil flowers and Cummin ſeed, each half a pint; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Bay-berries two drams, Diacatholicon and red Sugar, each an ounce; Sal Gem two ſcruples.</hi> This is good againſt pain, but this expels wind more.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Elicampane roots three ounces, Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mints, Pellitory of the Wall, each a handful; Aniſe, Cummin, Cardamoms, each three drams; Juniper and Bay-berries, each a pugil: boil them
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:108994:57"/>
to a pint, ſtrain, add Sack four ounces, Diacola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minth three drams, Oyl of Rue or Nuts three oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>white Wine with Cummin, Aniſeeds, and Bay-berries boiled in it a pint: give it hot.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In this of wind the medicines at the mouth may be hotter then in the Colick from flegm; as Confection of Bay-berries, Diacyminum, Diatrionpipereon. Cupping-glaſſes are good, if the pain be from wind only, and the belly not fat and ſwollen. I have a thouſand times found them in vain, where there is much glaſſie flegm: For the pain which is like a fixed ſtick, is from a cold flegm, which will not away while the flegm is there. But a Cupping-glaſs evacuates no flegm, therefore takes not away the pain. In a fat belly the Cupping-glaſs is ſoon filled with fleſh, and cannot reach to attract the Guts, &amp; the paſſage of the wind is ſtopped; and when there is a Tympany, the hardneſs hinders the attraction. But if it be ſeaſonably applied, being large, and with much flame, it will do wonders. Alſo make Bags of Milium, Bran, Lavender, Chamomil flowers, Dill, Calamints fryed with Wine or Vinegar ſprinkled on; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them one after another: Or make a Pultis of Horſe-dung with Lineſeed, Chamomil, or Dill, Oyl, Dregs of Oyl, Wine, and Lavender-Cotton in a Frying-pan, apply it hot: Or apply hot Tiles in cloaths dipt in Wine; or hot Bread.
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:108994:57"/>
But Fomentations, Baths, Cataplaſms, if not uſed in ſeaſon, they do hurt: as <hi>Galen meth. med. lib.</hi> I. ſaith, it is not always ſafe to heat the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with Cataplaſms and Baths, but only in ſuch whoſe bodies are clean; it is very dangerous to others, &amp; how is the pain in the guts from a cold humour fixed in them, cured? not by Cataplaſms and Baths that are very hot; for all tough hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours that are groſs and cold are melted to wind by hot things, except they digeſt ſtrongly. Therefore they muſt be cut and concocted with attenuaters, chiefly if they be not very hot. And ſuch are beſt that moſt diſcuſs wind, and dry, the forms of which are declared. There are alſo Amulets that help by propriety of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, as <hi>Galerita,</hi> a Swines Ankle-bone burnt and drunk, the guts of a Wolf dried with Wine, his skin applied to the belly; alſo Girdles made thereof; and the white Dung of a Wolf drunk in Wine, or hung about the Neck to the Belly in a Nut-ſhell. I ſhall name no more, though Authors abound with them.</p>

                     <head type="sub">Of the Cure of the flatuous Obſtruction of the Liver.</head>
                     <p>OBſtruction is common to all Bowels, but moſt to the Liver and Spleen. It is when a groſs humour, flegm, or melancholy ſtuffes the ſmall branches of the gate which are in the Liver; alſo a groſs vapour ſometimes ſwells the Liver, that it is like a Schirrus. And it is no wonder, that wind ſhould ſo ſwell the Liver, when it cannot get out, becauſe the Veins there are very ſmall, in regard the largeſt Guts are ſo ſtopped by wind, that nothing can paſs by ſtool. Therefore the Arabians ſay, that a very groſs vapour is thinner then Chyle, as wind is thinner then water; but thin Chyle concocted as it ought, doth not obſtruct the Liver; therefore wind cannot: but this is ſimple; for hence then it ſhould follow, that the Guts ſhould never be obſtructed by wind, which is againſt Experience, when they ſend forth the thickeſt dung. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Liver is obſtructed by wind alone, or mixed with clammy humors. But we muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, leſt we take the Liver to be obſtructed with wind, when the fault is in the Colon: For the Colon lyes on the right ſide, and is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

                     <p>Take <hi>Elicampane roots, Madder, and Aſara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baccaroots, each ſix drams; bark of Danewort roots, and Capar roots, each four drams; Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, Ceterach, Hyſop, each a handful; Roman Wormwood half a handful, Carrot and Aniſeeds, each three drams; Juniper-berries and Currans, each a pugil: boil them to half, to a pint ſtrained add Sugar, and a dram and half of Cinnamon for four Doſes.</hi> Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>the Decoction aforeſaid four ounces, Syrup of Calamints an ounce, Oxymel of Squills two drams:</hi> and ſo for the other three Doſes.</p>
                     <p>Then, Take <hi>Dialacca two ſcruples, ſpecies of the Electuary of Bay berries, Diarrhodon, each half a ſcruple; with Sugar diſſolved in Fennel-water and Wine make Tablets of a dram weight: give one with the Syrups.</hi> After preparation purge flegm thus.</p>

                     <p>Take <hi>old Treacle half a dram, Conſerve of Roſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary flowers and of Borage flowers, each a dram.</hi> If any matter remains, prepare and purge again: in this way of acting you ſhall cure the wind, and ſtrengthen as well as evacuate the flegm. Moreover the ſtretching of the Hypochondrion is not long without flegm; for pain attracts it, and the extenſion of the paſſages receives it, and its coldneſs hinders the Liver, ſo that crudities are by degrees laid up: therefore conſider both, but that chiefly which urgeth moſt. When it is from wind only, give a Clyſter, or a Lenitive rather then a ſtrong Purge, and cutting Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zem, and the Tablets mentioned, to unſtop them: And diſcuſs wind with Wine wherein Cummin, Aniſe, Cubebs, Juniper-berries, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damoms, and Cinnamon were boiled, or in which Diacurcuma and Treacle, each half a dram are diſſolved: Or this Hippocras.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Treacle a dram, Cardamoms, Cubebs, each two ſcruples; Cinnamon three drams, Sugar four ounces: ſtrain them.</hi> But uſe hot things warily, if there be Plethory or a hot Liver.

                     <p>THe Tympany is the third ſort of Dropſie, and is from wind bred from a weak natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral heat. It is ſuperfluouſly gathered between the Peritonaeum and the Omentum or Cawl, and gets into the other Membranes of the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domen or Paunch, and ſtretcheth it violently all over, till it be very great, and is known by the noiſe, rumbling, and ſound like a drum when ſtruck with the finger-nail. At firſt it was only a wind that could not be diſcuſſed, then it grows thicker like a Cloud, and at laſt turns to water, whence a humour is gathered with the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:108994:60"/>
cloudy wind. The Cure, after good order of diet, which you may find before, is by conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the humours and their evacuation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waring leſt with ſtrong Remedies, as Meſereon, Chamelaea, Coloquintida, Briony, Spurge, or Antimony, which many uſe, you deſtroy the natural heat. For it is manifeſt, that ſuch Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines do ſhake the ſtrongeſt bodies, if afflicted with a long and old diſeaſe, and bring dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous pains, deſtroy ſtrength, and diſperſe the ſpirits. But labour to ſtrengthen the natural heat, that it may overcome and expel what hurts Nature: Therefore prepare the matter thus.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>roots of Maſterwort, Elicampane, Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, bark of the roots of Dwarfe-elder, each three drams; roots of Orris, Aſarabacca, each two drams; Organ, Calamints, each a pugil; Solda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nella or Sea-bind-weed an ounce, Gratiola or Hedg-Hyſop two drams, Aniſeeds and Bay-berries, each half an ounce.</hi> Boil them in two parts of Wine and one of Water, or in Wine alone three or four hours in Balneo, ſtrain, and add Sugar, drink a glaſs morning and evening; then purge with theſe Pills.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Pills of Hiera with Agarick, Turbith, Rhubarb, each two ſcruples; Soldanella a dram, Aſarum roots a ſcruple, Troches of Alhandal, Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terium, Nutmeg, Galangal, Cinnamon, Pepper, Cubebs, each half a ſeruple.</hi> Powder them, and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:108994:61"/>
with Juyce of Orris make a Maſs, and with Oxymel of Squills make five Pills of a dram: give them at midnight: Or give our Pills of Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danella good againſt all Dropſies: as,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Pills of Agarick a dram, Troches of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handal half a ſcruple, tops of Soldanella, Gratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la, Cinnamon, each a ſcruple, with juyce of Orris make five Pills of a dram:</hi> give two or three at the moſt at midnight, and repeat the Apozem before mentioned, ſometimes with the Pills; for the one diſcuſſeth wind, making it thin, and the other prepares and purgeth the humours: and let the ſtomach and other parts be ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with theſe Electuaries.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>juyce of Orris four drams, Cinnamon, Galangal, each two drams; Cloves and Mace, each a dram; Zedoary two ſcruples, Soldanella half an ounce.</hi> Powder them, and with Honey make an Electuary: give as much as a Nutmeg every day, or other day. Or this.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Electuary of Bay-berries four drams, Conſerve of Elicampane roots two drams, Diani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum, Diagalanga, Diacyminum, each a ſcruple; Oyl of Juniper a dram, with Syrup of Stoechas make an Electuary.</hi> Or give this Potion.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Cinnamon water two ounces, Aqua vitae four drams, ſome drops of Oyl of Aniſeeds: give it faſting.</hi> There are alſo Powders to be taken after meat, to warm the ſtomach, and make it concoct, and diſcuſs wind: as,</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="105" facs="tcp:108994:61"/>
Take <hi>Aniſeed Comfits three ounces, Fennel ſeed an ounce and half, Coriander prepared half an ounce, Cummin, Caraway, Seſeli ſteept in Wine, each an ounce; Citron peels, Cinnamon, each four ſcruples; Sugar of Roſes as much as all the reſt.</hi> Make a powder, give a ſpoonful after meat, and let him not drink more at that time. After the humours are purged, and the ſtrength reſtored, diſcuſs the wind with this Decoction, which doth wonders.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Album Graecum, Barley, each an ounce and half.</hi> Boil them gently in three or four pints of French Wine till the Barley break, ſtrain it, and pour off the clear part, then boil it to half, then clarifie it, and add Cinnamon and Sugar: give five ounces thereof thrice a day faſting, and he ſhall break wind wonderfully, and his belly fall. Alſo the Confection of Bay-berries, Diacyminum, Diagalanga, Diatrionpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereon, Diamoſchu dulce, diſcuſs wind. But as I ſaid, uſe theſe moderately, or they will do much hurt, as may appear by this Example. A Woman had a Tympany, and went to her Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian, he only minded the diſcuſſing of wind, without giving other things before, gave a hot Electuary, ſhe felt a greater rumbling after, and worſe pain, and breathed worſe, and her belly ſwelled more, and it was all over her breaſt, and the tumours were divers at diſtance. I coming, ſaid, death was at hand, and therefore no more
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:108994:62"/>
was to be done, and ſhe died the third day after. I judge the hot extenuating Medicine made the cloudy vapours thin that were in a little place, and they made larger room. For ſuch is the force of heat, that by attenuating groſs bodies, it makes them moiſt, and they turn to vapours. For groſs things contained in a ſmall place, if they grow hot, take up more room, as appears by Milk, half a Skillet full hot and extenuated, ſwells to the top. So it is in the Tympany, when they uſe much heat. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore uſe moderate hot things which ſtrengthen within and without, and ſtir up natural heat. Anoint the ſtomach with this Liniment.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Oyl of Spike, of Maſtich, each three drams; Oyl of Nutmegs and of Mace, each a dram; dry Mints, red Coral, Maſtich, Cummin, each a ſcruple, with Wax make a Liniment:</hi> anoint the ſtomach hot therewith. Then chaff the belly with hot clothes, or hands, till it be red, that the pores may be opened for the wind to get out, then bathe with Brandy-wine and Oyl of Rue: or apply this Plaiſter.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Emplaſter of Bay-berries half a pound: mix it with Goats or Cow-dung and Wine, apply it hot.</hi> Or make Bags of Wormwood, Mints, Rue, hot Seeds, Bay-berries, Lavender, Elder, Chamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mil, Roſemary, and Stoechas, Milium, Bran, and Salt. Fry them with Wine, apply them hot; when they cool, heat them over a veſſel
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:108994:62"/>
with a hot Iron and Wine in it, and apply them again. I ſhall add nothing more of cupping, they are famous againſt all wind, but here I value them not. Carminative Clyſters expel wind ſometimes; but I ſhall omit theſe, and admoniſh this, that exerciſe, if ſtrength permit, thirſt and ſweat, are chief Cures for this, and the other two ſorts of Dropſies.</p>

He ſaith, that Priapiſmus is a ſtanding of the Yard ſwelling in length and breadth, without luſt from heat, and wind with pain. It is called Priapiſmus from <hi>Priapus</hi> the Satyre, who is painted with ſuch a Yard as natural. It is from the mouths of the Veins and Arteries ſtretched in the Privities, or from wind. <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, it is from both, but oftneſt from the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices dilated. Some have it from want of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery, having much ſeed, and that uſed Venery, and abſtain from it, and do not by much exerciſe abate the blood. It chiefly comes to ſuch as dream of Venereal fancies, and the pain is like the Cramp; for the Yard is as in a Convulſion, being pufft up and ſtretched, and they dye ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, except cured, and then the belly is ſwol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, and there is a cold ſweat; as in other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions when they dye. Therefore againſt the pain and inflammation, preſently open a Vein, and uſe a ſmall Diet three days, and foment the parts about and the Yard with Wool dipt in
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:108994:65"/>
Wine and Oyl: give a gentle Clyſter not ſharp, and feed him with a little Corn and Water. If it laſt long, cup and ſcarifie: if there be much blood, uſe Leeches to the part, and Cataplaſms of Barley flour: looſen the belly with Beets, Mallows, and Mercury boiled. And give the Decoction of Shell-fiſh: uſe no ſtrong Purges, and beware of Diureticks or provokers of urine. Uſe Corn-food that attenuates gently without manifeſt heating. Lay Coolers to the Loyns, as Nightſhade, Purſlane, Houſleek, Henbane. Let the ſpace between the Fundament and the Yard be cooled with Litharge of Silver, Fullers Earth, Ceruſs, Vinegar, and Water. A Cerot of Roſe-Oyntment waſhed often in cold Water, and applied to the Loyns and Privities, doth much good. He muſt lye upon one ſide, and lay under him things againſt the emiſſion of Sperm: And he muſt ſee no Venereal pictures, nor hear no wanton diſcourſe.</p>

                     <p>INflations come from Wind under the skin, or the Membranes of the Bones or Muſcles, or gathered in fleſhy parts. Now (as <hi>Aegineta</hi> ſaith) it is either from the thickneſs of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, or groſſneſs of the wind. A groſs vapour diſtends the place that contains it, by its plenty, and makes a tumour, not ſuch as is looſe, or will yield to the finger when preſſed, or pit like an Oedema. The common way of Cure of theſe tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, is to evacuate what is preternatural, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever contained. Now it cannot be evacuated, except that which is groſs be relaxed, and the thickneſs of the vapour be extenuated. Both are done by Extenuaters, and things potentially hot. I have ſhewed that Oyl which is of an extenuating quality, wherein Rue or hot Seeds are boiled, doth cure the ſtomach and other bowels ſtretched by wind. Now I ſhall ſhew how other parts, as Joynts and Muſcles, or Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes about the Bones, are cured when ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with wind. This is ſometimes with pain, ſometimes without, and that from a ſingle cauſe, namely a weak heat, or a contuſion. For an inflation without pain (according to <hi>Galen lib. 4. meth.)</hi> a Lixivium with a new Sponge will cure it. As,</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="114" facs="tcp:108994:66"/>
Take <hi>Rain-water or Wine, let Aſhes of a Fig-tree or Juniper be infuſed therein twenty four hours.</hi> Or thus.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Bay-berries, Orris roots, each an ounce; Bay leaves, Roſemary, Nip, each a handful; La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vender flowers a pugil, Cummin ſix drams.</hi> Boil them in Water to half, in four pints infuſe aſhes of Fig-tree, Beans, or Coleworts; foment therewith with a new Sponge hot. It cleanſeth, drys, conſumes, and diſcuſſeth wind, and the tumour. If there be pain, uſe no Lixivium (for by ſharpneſs it will increaſe it) but uſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxing Oyls, as that of Dill, Rue, or Chamomil. If Diſeaſes come from Contuſions, when the Muſcle or the Membrane of the Bone is bruiſed, then lay the Sponge aforeſaid upon the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane of the Bone. But when the Muſcles are pained, uſe a more mitigating or aſſwaging Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy. To theſe we uſe not Lixivium alone, but add to it boiled Wine and Oyl. It is beſt at the firſt to uſe no Lixivium, but Wine and a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Vinegar and Oyl with Wooll, to foment the part. And if pain be great, uſe more Aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters or Aſſwagers of it. If there be no pain, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Inflation by ſtronger Medicines, as Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xivium, Vinegar, and then Wine: And when you are not to aſſwage pain, put in more Lixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vium and Vinegar. For ſuch Inflations as by neglect are worſe, firſt uſe things made of a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xivium, then ſome Plaiſter, ſuch as that which
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:108994:66"/>
is made of Sweat from mens bodies: But the uſe of that being forgotten in our Age, we order inſtead of it the Plaiſter of Bay-berries, or this.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Melilot Plaiſter and that of Bay-berries, each three drams; Nitre, Cummin, Sulphur, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlak'd Lime, Salt, each a ſcruple; Oyl of Bayes and Wax as much as will make a Plaiſter.</hi> If the wind that makes this Inflation be ſmoak-like, evil, and corrupt, and from a venomous mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, with great pain and heat running through the members, it is beſt when it is ſetled, to tye the part above and beneath, and to open the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flation with a Lancet or hot Iron, that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomous vapor may get out. Then fill the Orifice with Aloes and Bole Armenick diſſolved in Oyl of Roſes and Vinegar. After three or four days, fill the wound with fleſh, and heal it up. And in this caſe of a venomous Inflation, uſe a ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der diet, and purge, and give a little Treacle ſometimes.</p>

                        <hi>HItherto (Courteous Reader) I have ſhewed according to my abilities, the Nature and Effects of Winds, and the Diſeaſes from them, and their Cures, for the good of the Ignorant, and help of the Diſeaſed, and that learned and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious perſons may take occaſion from hence to write better.
