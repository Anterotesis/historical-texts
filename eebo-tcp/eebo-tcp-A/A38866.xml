            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>THE <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of HISTORY</hi> in general, <hi>is too well known to need a Demonstration; and all the Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that ariſes in our eſteem of</hi> Particular Hiſtories, <hi>conſiſts only in their</hi> Validity; <hi>to which nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes more than the Ability and Circumſtances of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, theſe furniſh him with Opportunity of knowing, that with Capacity of Conveying the Tranſactions he makes choice of, to Poſterity. For the first, none can be more fit than an Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſs; for the ſecond, than a man of just obſervation; who omits nothing Material, nor rakes together ſupervacaneous and trifling Occurrences; how far the following Sheets will agree with this, your peruſal will inform you. But this I ſhall ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to ſay without partiality, the Writar has been always with his Majeſty from his leaving</hi> England, <hi>to his</hi> happy <hi>and</hi> trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant RETURN: <hi>and that may enſure the</hi> Truth <hi>of what he tells us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the Validity of a Hiſtory is not the only Motive of read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the</hi> Importance <hi>of the</hi> Action <hi>comes in for a large ſhare with a ſenſible Reader. For a Romance that preſents us with the true Model of a Brave Commander, is for delight at least preferrable to a dry Truth that contains nothing of Pleaſure, and little of Profit. But I am of opinion, that there never has been a War of greater Conſequence than the Preſent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Confedrates and the French King, either as to the Parties engaged, or the Cauſe for which they fight; that is, the most powerful Monarchs of this part of the World, for the</hi> LIBERTY <hi>or</hi> SLAVERY <hi>of</hi> Europe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:52104:3"/>
France <hi>has for near Two hundred years been growing, and fixing the Foundations of that Greatneſs they now poſſeſs; and it is no wonder that after ſuch Maſter-Builders as</hi> Henry the Great, Richlieu, <hi>and</hi> Mazarine, <hi>it proves ſo hard a Task to batter it down. 'Tis more wonderful to me that the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Nations could with ſo much <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nconcern look on it, till 'twas almoſt too well fortified for all their Endeavours to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſh. And I may venture without Flattery to ſay, That nothing but the</hi> Providential Acceſſion <hi>of his Glorious Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty</hi> WILLIAM THE THIRD <hi>to the Crown of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>and Head of the moſt Royal Confederacy that ever was, we muſt ſoon have felt Our ſelves under the moſt abſolute and laſting</hi> Tyranny <hi>that ever</hi> Europe <hi>was ſubject to; for the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation and other advantages of</hi> France <hi>renders it more fit for the Monarchy it aim'd at, than the Dominions of the Houſe of</hi> Auſtria <hi>formerly,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But Our Sacred King (deriv'd from a Race us'd to give Liberty to</hi> Europe, <hi>and oblige Mankind the Nobleſt and most Senſible Way) put a Stop to the Fatal Fabrick and by taking</hi> Namur <hi>has ſo far underminded it, that we may hope ſoon a Breach large enough for a ſucceſsful Aſſault: It has ſhew'd us that the</hi> French <hi>can be forc'd from their Faſtneſſes in the Eye of a Numerous Veteran, and well Diſciplin'd Army.</hi>

               <hi>Berkley.</hi> On <hi>Monday</hi> by 4 in the morning we got up our Anchors, and His Majeſty ſailed again, the Wind being fair, and joined the Convoy at the <hi>Gunfleet,</hi> under the Command of Sir <hi>George Rook,</hi> conſiſting of 22 Men of War and Frigats, whereof 8 were <hi>Dutch;</hi> about Noon the <hi>Cambridge</hi> (Admiral) touched on the edge of the <hi>Galloper</hi> Sand, but by Sir <hi>George Rook</hi>'s good manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and care ſhe was got off again in an hour's time, without any damage, and purſued their Voyage with a fine gale which carried His Majeſty over by the next morning. The 14th, about 9 in the morning His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty landed at the <hi>Orange-polder,</hi> where His Coaches were ready to carry him to <hi>Naeldwyck,</hi> a Houſe of Monſieur <hi>Reynenburg</hi>'s, there His Majeſty dined, and was attended by the Penſioner, Monſieur <hi>Odyck,</hi> Monſieur <hi>Dyckvelt,</hi> and divers other Perſons of Quality, and made it 8 in the Evening before he arrived in the <hi>Hague,</hi> His Majeſty's uſual manner of preventing a publick Reception by the Burghers in Arms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which they made up by their great Acclamations and Joy for His Maieſty's ſafe Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val on their Shore; the Confederate Forces being now ordered to draw together with expedition, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scotch</hi> near <hi>Deinſe,</hi> and about two Leagues from <hi>Ghent,</hi> where the Prince of <hi>Vaudemont</hi> went this day to command, until the arrival of His Majeſty: Another Body is forming near <hi>Newport,</hi> commanded by Duke <hi>Wirtemburg;</hi> and the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> has formed ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at <hi>Sellick,</hi> a League from <hi>Bruſſells,</hi> where the Forces from <hi>Liege</hi> and <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> under the command of Count <hi>Claude de Tilly,</hi> joined the 11/25<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of this Month, making in all about Thirty thouſand.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 15/25<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, His Majeſty was waited on, and complimented on His ſafe arrival, by the States-General, the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> and the Council of State, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe by all the Foreign Miniſters, which took up all the

            <p>13th, We continued our march about 3 Leagues to a place called <hi>Becelaer à Chatteau,</hi> where the King had his Quarters; a Party of ours met with, and defeated two of the Enemy's; killed and took many of them Priſoners, purſuing the reſt to the Walls of <hi>Ypres.</hi>

            <p>15th, His Majeſty had an Account that the <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgers</hi> and <hi>Munſterians,</hi> with the Garriſons of <hi>Liege, Maeſtricht</hi> and <hi>Huy,</hi> making together a Body of 24790 men, were marching towards <hi>Namur.</hi> The King is every day near the Enemy's Lines, and from riſing ground viewing them behind the ſame; and our Foragers undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed go under thoſe Lines, in compariſon, which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges the Enemy to deſtroy within themſelves, whilſt we do the ſame without their Lines, (but in their Country); and what they uſed to preſerve for filling their Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zines on that ſide, we and they now deſtroy.</p>
            <p>16th, Major-General <hi>Ellemberg</hi> received Orders to make ready the Troops under his command to march, and to carry Cannon and Mortars with him, upon which he gave general Orders for every man to repair to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Colours upon pain of death; the ſame day we ſeized a Spy, who was got clear of our Out-Guards, rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing off to the Enemy in Boors Habit.</p>

18th, The Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg</hi> viewed all the ground, and could ſee the Enemy buſied in working on their Lines towards <hi>Ypres,</hi> from the right of the Fort; they ſaluted him with ſeveral Pieces of Cannon without any effect, except killing of one Horſe.</p>
            <p>19th, Major-General <hi>Churchill</hi> was detached from His Majeſty's Camp with 8 Battalions to reinforce the Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg,</hi> which he executed in the Forenoon; in the Afternoon they perceived the Enemy had poſſeſſed themſelves of ſome Houſes on their ſide of the <hi>Cannall,</hi> and had ſet fire to others, upon which the Granadeers were detached under the command of Collonel <hi>Maytland,</hi> to beat the Enemy from thence, which they performed with great vigour and reſolution. Further, on the right, Collonel <hi>Tiffany</hi> was ſent with a Detachment, ſuſtained by a Regiment of Foot, and there was a very warm Fire (which laſted till night) on both ſides; the Enemy had the advantage of a little Fort upon a Hill on the other ſide the <hi>Cannall,</hi> from whence they galled our men; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding which, ours brought up ſix Pieces of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non to the ſide of the <hi>Cannall,</hi> and made a lodgment; ſeveral Officers and Soldiers were killed on both ſides; Major-General <hi>Churchill</hi> was ſhot through the Hat, and Collonel <hi>Tiffany</hi> through the Hand.</p>

               </gap> day two Spies were tried and condemned at a Court-Martial, formerly Sutlers in our Army, and executed accordingly; as were likewiſe ſeveral Deſerters, that attempted to go over to the Enemy; who to delude our men, and draw them from our Service, give a <hi>Louis d'Or</hi> to each that goes over, at leaſt makes them fair promiſes of ſuch a Reward. His Majeſty reviewed the Enemy's Lines, with the ground adjacent, with ſuch care and exactneſs, that we expected we ſhould have forced them.</p>
            <p>The 24th, A Spy came into the Camp, and gave an account, that the Enemy had detached 600 of their Horſe and Granadiers by the way of <hi>Mennin,</hi> in order to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept our Proviſions coming from <hi>Ghent</hi> to our Army; His Majeſty thereupon immediately order'd 500 Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons, under the Command of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> to march and reinforce the Convoy that were with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion-waggons, which they met with and joined near <hi>Roaſeler:</hi> And at the ſame time another Detachment of about 1000 Horſe and Dragoons, under the command of the Earl of <hi>Portland,</hi> were ſent to find out the Enemy, which they did in a Village called <hi>Morſelle,</hi> about mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, between <hi>Courtray</hi> and <hi>Menin;</hi> the Enemy's Foot were drawn up in the Market-place, and their Horſe at a ſmall diſtance to ſuſtain them; having notice of our march half an hour before we got up with them; our

Dragoons immediately quitted their Horſes, and charged the Enemy with great Bravery, and were warmly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; but after three quarters of an hour's hot diſpute the Enemy gave way, and got off by the favour of a dark night; for had this Action been in the day, it had been morally impoſſible for the Enemy to have eſcaped being killed or taken; 78 were left dead upon the ſpot of the Enemy, and a Captain of Granadiers taken Priſoner. On our ſide Lieutenant <hi>Web</hi> and 5 Dragoons were killed, Captain <hi>Holdgate</hi> and Captain <hi>Collins</hi> with 11 men were wounded; and the Convoy arrived ſafe in the Camp, conſiſting of 500 Waggons, beſides the Sutlers Carts and Waggons with all manner of Proviſions.</p>

            <p>26th, We carried our Lines ſo far, as to cut off the Communication between the Town and Fort <hi>Pollard,</hi> which hindered our approaches to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſcarp, and the Enemies other Works near St. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas</hi> Gate; whereupon the <hi>French</hi> Poſted there, were

ſummoned to Surrender, which they refuſed to do, unleſs they might have leave to retire into the Town, which was denied them; and our Miners ſet at work, who having made a conſiderable advance in the night, lodged themſelves under the Counterſcarp of the ſaid Fort: The Gariſon conſiſting of a Captain, Two Lieutenants, an Enſign, an Ingenier, a Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, and 55 choſen Men of the <hi>Dauphin</hi>'s Regiment, Surrendred early the 27th at Diſcretion, and were made Priſoners at War; ſoon after our Guns were brought down, and a Battery raiſed upon the ſaid Fort to play upon the Counterſcarp near St. <hi>Nicholas</hi> Port, where we have been for ſome days making a Breach, and undermined the dams that keep up the Water in the ditch of the Town, in order to drain the ſame, by blowing them up.</p>
            <p>28th, Major-General <hi>Lindeboom</hi> relieved the Guard of the Trenches; and our Lines being carried on to the edge of the <hi>Maeſe</hi> near the Counterſcarp, all things were diſpoſed for the Attack of it, in order to a Lodgment on the Glacis; and accordingly about 4 a Clock in the Afternoon it was begun by the Granadiers, <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> who with continual fire, and Hand-granadoes, with the help of our Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, ſoon obliged the Enemy to retire, and made a Lodgment on the Glacis; but the Enemy having ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny works within this, as the Counterguard, the Ravelin, and the Town-walls, they very much annoyed our Men, being alſo continually relieved from the Town; however, ours Fortified themſelves and kept their Poſt; our Granadiers were ſuſtained by Colonel <hi>Ingoldsby</hi>'s Regiment, which ſuffer'd very much in this Action, by the accident of Fire taking in the Woolſacks and Gabions that were to cover their Men; Colonel <hi>Saunderſon</hi> and Colonel <hi>Collingwood</hi>'s Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

            <p>29th, Our Lodgment being thus made on the Counterſcarp, on the ſide of the <hi>Maeſe,</hi> as was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, our Batteries will be advanced nearer to the Enemies Works, and a further Breach made for an Aſſault of the Town; in the Attack of Yeſterday we loſt, that is, Killed and Wounded of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> about 300. The Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> made an Attack at the ſame time upon the Cloyſter of <hi>Salſine,</hi> wherein the Enemy had a Gariſon of 400 Men, and poſſeſs'd himſelf of it with little Loſs; by which means he can now make his approaches nearer to the Enemies works.

            <p>30th, About Four a Clock in the Morning, the Elector of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> with a Detachment of Granadiers, and 15 Battalions of Foot of his own, the <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> and other Foreign Troops, made an Attack upon the Works and Retrenchments the Enemy had without the <hi>Coehorn Fort,</hi> upon the Hill towards the <hi>Sambre,</hi> which hindred our approaches upon that ſide;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52104:14"/>
in about Two hours time we beat the Enemy out of them, and purſued them to the very walls of the Caſtle, ſo that we are now Maſters of their great Line drawn over the Hill from the <hi>Sambre</hi> to the <hi>Maeſe,</hi> on which the Enemy had two Batteries; we are now Fortifying our ſelves there in order to At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack the <hi>Coehorn</hi> work; it Rained violently all the while of the Attack, notwithſtanding which the Men continued it with great Reſolution, and we loſt about 100 Men; the Enemy are much diſheartned at our being Maſters of this ſtrong Work, which they gave out would coſt us many Thouſand Men; the aſcent of the Hill was difficult by reaſon of its rocky ſteepneſs, and the Enemies Cannon playing on all ſides; yet ſometimes on all four up they got, and made themſelves Maſters of the pretended impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Line, made by Monſieur <hi>Vauban</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Chief Ingenier. Major-General <hi>Hewklem</hi> relieved the Trenches.</p>
            <p>31ſt, The reſt of the wounded in each Regiment were by water ſent to <hi>Liege</hi> to the Hoſpital Erected there on this occaſion, well furniſhed with Doctors, Chirurgeons, Nurſes, and all manner of Conveniencies and Neceſſaries whatſoever.

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52104:14"/>
themſelves on the point of the Demi-Baſtion, not being able to maintain the Work it ſelf; the King was all the while in the Trenches, which His Majeſty viſited every day; and becauſe no time ſhould be loſt in giving ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Orders, His Majeſty frequently eat in, and near the Trenches; the Proviſions, when dreſt, being carried from His Majeſty's Quarters thither. Major-General <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deboom</hi> relieved the Guard of the Trenches, and carried on the Work with good ſucceſs. In this Action we had about 400 men killed and wounded of <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch;</hi> the Trenches were relieved ſomewhat after the uſual hour by particular Order, and then Major General <hi>Ramſey</hi> and Brigadier <hi>Fitzpatrick,</hi> who came on the Guard, viſited the Works, which they continued and carried about 50 Paces farther to the Right; in this, as well as all the other Actions of this Siege, our men behaved themſelves with ſuch undaunted Courage and Bravery, that they carried all before them; for whatever they attacked, they carried; and what they took, they maintained, to the great diſheartning and diſcouragement of the Enemy, who found it in vain, notwithſtanding their numbers, to pretend to reſiſt ſuch Vigour: Nay, the moſt Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced Officers declare, they never ſaw Attacks made with greater Vigour and Reſolution.</p>
            <p>2d, Preparations was made for a General Aſſault of the Town, the Breaches being wide enough for 100 men in front: We had an Account that the Dauphin, with the Houſhold Troops, was marching from Court to join <hi>Villeroy,</hi> and attempt the Relief of <hi>Namur,</hi> coſt what it would; and that the <hi>French</hi> King in Perſon would come to the Frontiers: At the ſame time arrived ſome Officers that made their eſcape from <hi>Dixmuyde,</hi> after the ſurrender of that Place by Major-General <hi>Ellemberg;</hi> amongſt the reſt Collonel <hi>Brewer,</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:52104:15"/>
who gave His Majeſty an account of the whole Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery; and that Brigadier <hi>d' Offerrer</hi> had delivered up <hi>Deynſe</hi> upon no better Account, the Gariſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made Priſoners at War; and the Enemy had Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed the Fortifications, and carried the men towards <hi>Ypres.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3d, Major-General <hi>Saliſh</hi> relieved the Guard of the Works and Trenches, and all things were diſpoſed for an Aſſault of the Town, when about Two in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon the Enemy hung out a White Flag, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired a Parley; which being granted, Hoſtages were exchanged, Collonel <hi>William Seymour</hi> and Major <hi>Stork</hi> on our ſide, and Count <hi>Nogent</hi> and a <hi>French</hi> Major on the Enemy's; and Articles were ſent out and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the <hi>French</hi> for the Surrender of the Town, ſome of which were granted, others diſagreed unto.</p>

            <p>13th, We advanced our Trenches near 200 Paces more, notwithſtanding the Rain continued to waſh the Earth down again. In the Afternoon one of our Bombs fell into a Magazine of the Enemy's, where they had a quantity of Grenades and Powder which blew up; and by the Deſerters we were informed, it did them conſiderable damage.

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:52104:18"/>
the neceſſary Orders in that City. Laſt Night the Enemy made a Sally upon 600 of our Men Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Colonel <hi>Seymour,</hi> who were Poſted near their Paliſades to cover the Workmen that were to carry on the Trenches, but they were repulſed and ſeveral of them killed; on our ſide 4 Men were killed, and Colonel <hi>Seymour</hi>'s Major, a Captain, and 12 Men wounded; we continued our Works with good ſucceſs, advancing 150 Paces, though the ground was ſtony; the Guard being relieved by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor-General <hi>Hewklem.</hi>
            </p>

Major-General <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deboom</hi> this day made a new Trench of about 300 Paces in the plain of <hi>Salſine</hi> behind the other, and run a Line from our Lodgment to the old Trench at the foot of the Mountain, to ſecure it againſt Sallies; the Enemy made but little fire, we did not loſe one Man, only 5 or 6 wounded. The Landtgrave of <hi>Heſſe</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived in the Camp, and was by His Majeſty received with great Reſpect.</p>
            <p>16th, We advanced our Trench in the Plain of <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſine,</hi> and enlarged and mended that at the foot of the Mountain, which was much endamaged by the continual Rains that looſened the Earth caſt up, and made it ſhoot down again to the bottom of the Trench, and

lay there like mud; and rendred it very troubleſome to paſs and repaſs.</p>
            <p>17th. We advanced our Trench <hi>Saliſh</hi> at the foot of the Mountain about 100 Paces, and carried on that of the <hi>Salſine</hi> towards it. The Enemy made a great fire in the Night both with the Cannon and ſmall Shot, and made two Sallies to diſturb our work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, but were preſently beat in again; a Colonel of the <hi>Brandenburghs</hi> and 10 Soldiers were killed, and ſome wounded; our Cannon and Bombs play without ceaſing day and night on the Caſtle and <hi>Coehorn,</hi> and according to the reports of Deſerters, do greatly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy the Enemy, having killed great numbers of them, and, diſmounted ſome of their Cannon; this Evening arrived here from <hi>Maeſtricht</hi> 32 Twenty-four Pounders to be employed againſt the Caſtle from Count <hi>Tilly</hi>'s ſide; the Batteries had had good ſucceſs and done the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my conſiderable miſchief; and we prepare more on all ſides in order to a Breach in the <hi>Coehorn</hi> and Caſtle; the Forces of <hi>Heſſe</hi> and <hi>Lunemburg,</hi> which came from the <hi>Rhyne</hi> are Encamped between <hi>Liege</hi> and <hi>Huy:</hi> This Morning His Majeſty received an account that the Mareſchal <hi>de Villeroy</hi> had raiſed Batteries on the high Ground of <hi>Anderleck,</hi> from whence he Bombard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> from the 13th about Six in the Evening, untill the 15th about Noon; when he drew off, and marched towards <hi>Engheim,</hi> by way of <hi>Hall;</hi> that the Lower Town had ſuffered the moſt, and ſeveral Houſes as high as the great Market are ruined, but all the Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zines in general have eſcaped; but the Electoreſs of <hi>Bavaria</hi> with the Fright miſcarried, but is in no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and was removed to a great Houſe in the Suburbs.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>28th.</hi> The Enemy marched to <hi>Gemblours,</hi> and ſeemed to diſpoſe every thing to a Battel; in the mean time we were not idle in preparing to receive them, notwithſtanding their Superiority of at leaſt 20000 Men: And our Forces that carried on the Attacks againſt the Caſtle went on vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>29th.</hi> The Enemy did actually leave their Tents ſtanding in their Camp, and marched towards us in Battalia, as near as the Ground would permit them. Whereupon his Majeſty
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52104:21"/>
cauſed our Army to be drawn out likewiſe, in which Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture we remained the whole Day, his Majeſty being on Horsback from four in the Morning until eight at Night, riding from Right to Left, and to the Right again; appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every where to give neceſſary Orders, and view the Diſpoſition of the Enemy; and our Army ordered to lye all Night under Arms in a readineſs to receive the Enemy if they pleaſe to come on. In the mean time all things were ready for a General Aſſault.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>30th.</hi> The Enemy only appeared in the Front of our Line, and moved off again without daring to attempt any thing, and with about 70 Squadrons took Poſt at <hi>Bonef</hi> on the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haigne,</hi> extending their Line from that place to the Right near <hi>Perwys.</hi> Whereupon his Majeſty cauſed our Army likewiſe to move, and extended our Right to <hi>Longchamp,</hi> our Left being near St. <hi>Dennis,</hi> and a Brigade of Foot left at <hi>Mazy</hi> Camp to ſecure that Poſt.</p>
            <p>This Day a General Aſſault was made againſt the Caſtle and Cohorn. The Diſpoſition as follows: The Lord <hi>Cutts</hi> attacked the Counterſcarp and Breach of the <hi>Terra Nova</hi> with a Detachment of Grenadiers, and four Regiments of Foot: Count <hi>Rivera</hi> Major General in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Service, Attackt the Cohorn on the ſide next the <hi>Terra Nova</hi> with 3000 <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Bavarians:</hi> Major General <hi>La Cave</hi> Attackt the Cohorn on the Right of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> with 2000 <hi>Brandenburgers;</hi> Major General <hi>Swerin</hi> Attackt the Caſſotte with 2000 <hi>Dutch;</hi> and the lower Town by a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel and about 2000 Men.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> advanced with great Order and Reſolution, and had gained the top of the Breach (through a great deal of Fire on all ſides) but found the Enemy ſo advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geouſly poſted and entrenched behind the Breach, and the Ground on their ſide ſo very craggy and uneven, that it was impoſſible to advance in any Front, were forced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire. Count <hi>Rivera</hi> was kill'd upon his approach to the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:52104:21"/>
Counterſcarp, but the <hi>Bavarians</hi> took Poſt upon a Saliant Angle of the Cohorn, and maintained a hot Fire with the Enemy, who diſputed hard to diſlodge them; and when moſt of the Officers of the <hi>Bavarian</hi> Guards was killed and wounded, and that the other Regiments had ſuffered very much, the Enemy continuing their Fire with great obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy; the <hi>Engliſh</hi> that had left the <hi>Terra Nova,</hi> not being able to do any thing on that ſide, ſuſtained the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Bavarians</hi> under the Command of my Lord <hi>Cutts,</hi> who at the ſame time ordered a Lieutenant of Colonel <hi>Maccay</hi>'s Regiment with 30 Men to paſs the Palliſado's, and Attack a Battery of the Enemies; which he executed with the greateſt Bravery and Reſolution, turning ſeven of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies own Cannon againſt them, ſecuring at the ſame time ſeveral of their Mines ready to ſpring; and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Bavarians</hi> planting their Colours upon the Palliſado's made a good Lodgment. While this happened, Major General <hi>La Cave</hi> with the <hi>Brandenburgers,</hi> and Major General <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin</hi> with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> made each of them likewiſe a Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which they improve in order to an Attack; and the Batteries are now ordered to play on the <hi>Terra Nova</hi> to make that Attack more practicable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>31th.</hi> The Enemy appeared with about 11 Squadrons near our grand Guard, but were ſoon repulſed, and the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Liſt was given in of the kill'd and wounded. Of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in the Aſſault under the Command of my Lord <hi>Cutts,</hi>

Hoſtages were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed on both ſides for performance of what may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed unto.</p>

            <p>The Garriſons of <hi>Dixmuyde</hi> and <hi>Deynſe</hi> have the greateſt reaſon to rejoyce at this Surrender; for whilſt the Enemy had any proſpect of relieving the Caſtle, thoſe unfortunate Men were inhumanly uſed, purpoſely to force them to take up in the <hi>French</hi> Service: Nay, the Officers were not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from their Barbarity, being (with the Soldiers) kept in the Common Priſons among Criminals and Perſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to the Gallies, notwithſtanding they Capitulated, and were to be made Priſoners at War. <hi>Villeroy</hi> was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed (whether by order or not) to take no notice either of Capitulation, or Cartel of Agreement, which expreſly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, That all Priſoners whatſoever, taken either in the Field or in Towns, ſhall be releaſed and ſent back to their proper Maſters in fifteen days by Exchange, or upon paying their Ranſoms, which is ſettled from the General Officer to the Private Centinel.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>5th.</hi> This Morning the Garriſon, according to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulation, marched out at the Breaches of the <hi>Terra Nova,</hi> being 4190 Foot, and 1205 Dragoons (of which only 160 were mounted) moſt of them in a very ill condition, with the Mareſchal <hi>de Boufflers</hi> and the Count <hi>de Guiſcard</hi> at the Head of them. The King was <hi>incognito</hi> in a Coach, and the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> to ſee them.</p>
            <p>They had not gone far when Brigadier <hi>L'estang</hi> advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced towards Mareſchal <hi>de Boufflers,</hi> and told him, He had Orders from his Majeſty to Arreſt him, by way of Repriſal for the Garriſons of <hi>Dixmuyde</hi> and <hi>Deynſe,</hi> which were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and ill treated by the <hi>French,</hi> contrary to their Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation and the Cartel. At which he ſeem'd much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, but being forced to ſubmit, was carried away Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner to the Town of <hi>Namur,</hi> having firſt had the Offer of his Liberty upon his parol and promiſe to return in four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen days, or to procure the Liberty of our Men within that time: But he choſe rather to be made a Priſoner until his Maſter's will was known in that Affair.</p>
            <p>Thus ended this great Siege: great, I ſay, becauſe there never were Attacks carried on before any Fortreſs with greater Courage and Reſolution, nay and Succeſs, nor bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter defended by Beſieged. And great, conſidering its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance and ſituation at the Confluence of the Rivers <hi>Maeſe</hi>
