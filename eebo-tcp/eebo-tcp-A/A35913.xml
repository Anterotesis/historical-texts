            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
INTRODUCTION,
Containing a Diſplay of the
Grounds, upon which the
French King layeth claim to
a great part of the Spaniſh
Netherlands.</head>
            <p>THat the beſt Title of the <hi>French
Queen</hi> to the Dutchy of <hi>Brabant,</hi>
and its annexes, the Seignory of
<hi>Malmes, Antwerp, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper Gelderland,
Namur, Limburg,</hi> and the places uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
on the other ſide the <hi>Meuſe, Hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nault,
Artois, Cambray,</hi> the County of
<hi>Burgundy,</hi> and the Dutchy of <hi>Luxem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg,</hi>
conſiſted in the <hi>Sword</hi> of the
King her Husband, ſcarce ſeems a
doubt to any but the French them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
And with what ſucceſs the
Cauſe hath been pleaded by that Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon,
during the Campagne of 1667.
the enſuing Narrative, written by one
that was preſent at moſt of the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
<pb facs="tcp:54819:3"/>
Actions thereof, giveth a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
and yet no immodeſt Account.
So that perhaps it is not much neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to preface this Relation with a
Diſplay of the Grounds and Reaſons
of the War, whoſe progreſs it exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits;
accordingly the Author thought
fit not to meddle therewith, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving,
I ſuppoſe, that the Juſtice of
his Soveraigns Armes was ſufficiently
evidenc'd to all the Subjects by the
<hi>Manifeſto,</hi> and other writings which
his Majeſty had publiſh'd immediately
before his Forces enter'd <hi>Flanders.</hi>
Nevertheleſs, in regard that 'tis likely
many, into whoſe hands this Piece
may fall, have not ſo fully underſtood
the Reaſons, whereby the French King
hath endeavor'd to juſtifie, to Forreign
Princes and States, his late Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
in the Netherlands, nor thoſe
contrary ones, whereby the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
endeavour to maintain their own poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions,
and invalidate the French Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions,
I ſhall adventure to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
the Reader with an Abſtract of
either Parties Allegations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:54819:3"/>
The <hi>French Queens</hi> Title ſtands
thus: <hi>Philip</hi> the fourth, King of
<hi>Spain,</hi> married <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> Daughter to
<hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, and Siſter to <hi>Lewis</hi>
the thirteenth, Kings of <hi>France,</hi> in the
year 1615. on the ſame day whereon
the laſt mentioned Prince eſpouſed
<hi>Anne</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> Infanta of <hi>Spain.</hi> The
Portions of either ſide were ſatisfied
by way of Exchange, being the ſum
of 500000. Crowns of Gold. <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi>
ſome years after dies, leaving
behind her a Son nam'd <hi>Don Baltha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar,</hi>
and a Daughter nam'd <hi>Donna Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria
Thereſa:</hi> Afterwards King <hi>Philip</hi>
marries another Wife, by whom he
hath Iſſue male, <hi>Don Carlo,</hi> who by the
death of his half-Brother, <hi>Don Baltha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar,</hi>
became Heir apparent to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Crown. In the year 1659.
a Treaty of Peace was concluded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the two Crowns, and together
therewith a Marriage between <hi>Lewis</hi>
the fourteenth, now King of <hi>France,</hi>
and the above-mention'd Lady <hi>Maria
Thereſa,</hi> for whoſe Portion the King,
her Father, obliged himſelf to pay
500000. Crowns of Gold, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb facs="tcp:54819:4"/>
Salick Law debars Females
from ſucceſſion to the French Crown;
as alſo to the end that the two Crowns
being too great and puiſſant to be
united into one Kingdom, all occaſions
of ſuch a Conjunction might be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
It was covenanted (amongſt other
things) that neither the Infanta, nor
her Children and Deſcendants, in what
degree ſoever, ſhould ever ſucceed in
the Kingdoms, Signiories, or Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
which do or ſhall belong to his
Catholick Majeſty, as well within as
without the Kingdom of <hi>Spain,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
any Law or Cuſtom,
which by this Agreement (which is
to continue in the full force and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
of a Law for ever) their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
did aboliſh. This Renunciation
the Infanta confirmed in theſe very
Terms by her Oath in the preſence of
the Kings themſelves, the Princes of
the Blood, and the chief Nobility of
both Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>This Peace remained inviolated
about ſix years, (in which time the
King of <hi>Spain,</hi> for the preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thereof, yielded to the King of
<pb facs="tcp:54819:4"/>
               <hi>France</hi> the Precedence, which had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd
a fray between the Train of
the Ambaſſadours of the two Crowns
there at <hi>London.</hi>) But upon the death
of <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> which happened
toward the latter end of the year
1665. and had been lookt for the year
before by his good Neighbour, (who
from the latter end of 1664. had laid
up great Magazines of Corn at <hi>Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens,</hi>
and other places on the way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Flanders</hi>) diſcourſes began to
be ſpread abroad through <hi>France,</hi> of
a Title which the Queen and her Son
the <hi>Dauphin,</hi> had to certain Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
of the Netherlands. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs,
his French Majeſty thought
not fit to make diſcovery of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns,
till he ſaw what would be the
Iſſue of the War, which in great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
by his practices, was broken out
between the King of <hi>Great Brittain,</hi>
and the States of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
whoſe Quarrel, upon a pretended
League made two years before, he
eſpouſed.</p>
            <p>In the mean time he ſet forth a
conſiderable Navy at Sea, (which
<pb facs="tcp:54819:5"/>
yet never engaged in any Action a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Engliſh) and likewiſe made
great Levies, and warlike Preparations
at Land, without manifeſting how he
intended to imploy the ſame. At
length, about the middle of <hi>May,</hi> when
his Neighbours, the Engliſh and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Provinces, being weary of the
War, had ſet on foot a Treaty of
Peace at <hi>Breda,</hi> wherein himſelf was
alſo included, he thought it a fit op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to publiſh a <hi>Manifeſto</hi> of his
Claim to part of the Spaniſh Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,
which he likewiſe ſent to ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Princes of Chriſtendom, and
ſhortly after ſeconded, by falling into
thoſe Countries with a powerful Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;
the performances whereof are
recorded in the following Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</p>
            <p>In the ſaid <hi>Manifeſto</hi> it is ſet forth,
1. That by the cuſtomary Law of
<hi>Brabant,</hi> the Children by the firſt Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
go away with the whole Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance
of their Father, the Children
of the ſame Father, by a ſecond Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
being excluded; which Law is
<pb facs="tcp:54819:5"/>
called <hi>Jus Devolutionis,</hi> or the Right
of Devolution; and conſequently,
that the Infanta (now Queen of
<hi>France</hi>) being the ſole ſurviving Iſſue
of <hi>Philip</hi> the fourth, by his firſt Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
is Heir of all thoſe Countries
wherein the ſaid Law doth obtain,
and ſo excludeth her Brother of the
half-blood by a ſecond Marriage.
2. That by the Laws of <hi>Spain</hi> ſhe is
likewiſe Heir to her Mother of all
her Marriage-portion, and the Jewels
left behind her at her death, amounting
with intereſt to the ſum of 1100000.
Crowns of Gold. 3. That the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation
made by the Infanta at her
Marriage is void and null: Firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that a Renunciation is only of
an Eſtate in expectancy, not of an
Eſtate already fallen, as theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
are pretended to have been upon
the death of the Spaniſh Queen: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
becauſe a Renunciation ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
a Portion actually paid; but the
Infanta never received any; and that
if the 500000. Crowns of Gold, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
in the Contract of Marriage,
had been actually paid, it had ſtill
<pb facs="tcp:54819:6"/>
been no Portion, in regard 1100000.
were due to her. To all which ſome
other ſpecious reaſons are added,
which would take up too much room
in this ſhort Introduction.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, the Spaniards
anſwer, That, even ſetting aſide the
Renunciation, the Daughter can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
no Title to ſucceed in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
in queſtion, ſo long as there is an
Heir-male living: 1. Becauſe the
Right of Devolution hath nothing to
do with the ſucceſſion of Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>s
(as being meerly a municipal
Law for private Eſtates) which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend
in theſe Countries in the ſame
manner as they do in all other parts of
Chriſtendom, wherein the Male by the
ſecond Marriage ſucceeds before the
Female by the firſt; and for that there
are ſome expreſs Laws, made by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Princes of theſe Countries, which
declare, That Women ſhall then only
be admitted to the ſucceſſion of them,
<hi>Maſculis non extantibus,</hi> when there
are no Heirs-males living. 2. Becauſe
no Example can be produc'd in any
Age of ſuch an irregular ſucceſſion in
<pb facs="tcp:54819:6"/>
               <hi>Brabant,</hi> &amp;c. that a Woman hath been
preferr'd before a Man, in the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
in the publick Government: But
on the contrary, there are not wanting
Examples, where the Right of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
hath been neglected, in the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
of the ſame Dutchy. 3. They
alledge, that Renunciations are valid,
though no Portion be paid, becauſe
the end of them is the preſervation of
the Grandeur of Families. And
4. That by the Contract of Marriage
the Infanta was in lieu of all preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
whatſoever, to reſt ſatisfi'd with
500000. Crowns of Gold; the non-payment
whereof doth not invalidate
the Renunciation, becauſe the Equity
of Law corrects ſuch ſeverity, and
allows another day; as alſo becauſe
the Law ſaith, That <hi>Filia non per nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merationem
Dotis, ſed per conventionem
excluditur.</hi> 5. And laſtly, That by
the Edict of <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
by the Eſtates of <hi>Brabant,</hi> and
the other Provinces of the Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,
theſe Countries are decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
inſeparable from the Crown of
<hi>Spain.</hi>

To all which, perhaps it will not
ſeem ſuperfluous, to add here a Letter
or two of the French Kings, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this affair, and likewiſe the Queen
of <hi>Spains</hi> Anſwer to him; together

                  <head>The French Kings Letter to the
Queen of Spain, bearing date,
<date>May 8, 1667.</date>
                  </head>
                  <p>MOſt High, Illuſtrious and Mighty
Princeſs, our moſt dear and loving
Siſter, The ſincere Inclination we have
alwayes had, for the procuring and
maintaining of Peace, which was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
teſtified to the World, by the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of <hi>Weſtphalia</hi> and the <hi>Pyrenaeans,</hi>
induced us about the cloſe of the year
1665. by an obliging Prevention (though
it was not ſo taken at <hi>Madrid</hi>) to find
out ſome way of providing, that nothing
might be able to alter the good <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
and Amity between us and your
Majeſty, and our Crowns, which was ſo
happily eſtabliſht by our auguſt Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.
This was the late Queen our
Mothers intention, when ſhe deſired the
Marquis <hi>De Fuentes</hi> to write to your
Majeſty in her name, That having ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
informed her ſelf of the Right
of the Queen, our deareſt Wife, to ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Eſtates in the Netherlands, and
<pb facs="tcp:54819:8"/>
finding the Grounds to be ſolid, juſt and
undeniable, ſhe earneſtly conjured your
Majeſty, by the tender affection you bear
to her, that ſhe would alſo inform her
ſelf of theſe Rights, and take particular
cogniſance thereof, to the end, that view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the juſtice of them, as ſhe her ſelf
had done, the equity thereof might induce
you to do us reaſon, by a good accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
which might take away all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of miſunderſtanding between our
Monarchies; that ſhe ſufficiently knew
our intentions, ſo as to be able to anſwer
for us; that we ſhould be very moderate
in the condition of the ſaid accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation;
and that finding her ſelf draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
towards her end, next to her Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſhe deſired nothing more in the
world, nor with ſo much zeal, as the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
of having a union and amity
firmly ſettled between our two Houſes,
which this Difference might ſoon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb.
All theſe Particulars cannot but
be remembred by your Majeſty, and the
Councels of <hi>Spain</hi> cannot alſo forget the
Quality of the Anſwers, which they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
your Majeſty to make, ſo little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
to the Piety and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tility of the
<pb facs="tcp:54819:9"/>
Queen Mothers Inſtances, and ſo contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
without doubt, to the Inclination
your Majeſty hath for the conſervation of
the publick Peace.</p>
                  <p>This Anſwer was, That your Majeſty
could not in any manner, nor upon any
conſideration whatſoever, enter into the
diſcuſſion of this Affair, nor agree or
treat upon thoſe Rights, which you knew
had no foundation: And preſently after
your Majeſty ſent Order to the Governour
of <hi>Flanders,</hi> to cauſe the Oath of Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
to be adminiſtred to all the Eſtates
and People of the Country, which till
then had been neglected, ſince the deceaſe
of the late King our Father-in-law. This
abſolute refuſal of doing us Juſtice, and
this laſt Reſolution of binding thoſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
by Oath to your Majeſty, which are
truly our Subjects, in right of the Queen
our Wife, having reduced us to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing
and undiſpenſable neceſſity, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to be wanting in that which we owe
to our Honour, to our Self, to the Queen,
and to the <hi>Dauphin</hi> our Son; or to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
by the force of our Armes to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that Reaſon which hath been denied
us: We have choſen the latter, as that
<pb facs="tcp:54819:9"/>
which both Juſtice and Honour obliges
us to: And by an expreſs Currier, which
we diſpatch to the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brun</hi>
our Ambaſſadour, we order him to
let your Majeſty know our Reſolution
which we have taken, to march in perſon
towards the end of this moneth, at the
head of our Army, to endeavour to put
our ſelves into poſſeſſion of that which
belongs to us in the Low-Countries, in
right of the Queen, or of ſomething e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivalent;
and at the ſame time to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to your Majeſty a Writing, which
we have ordered to be compoſed, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Grounds of our Right, and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deſtroying the frivolous Objections of
thoſe contrary Writings, which the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of <hi>Flanders</hi> hath publiſht to the
world.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time we promiſe our
ſelves ſo much from your Equity, that as
ſoon as you ſhall have ſeen and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the ſaid Writing, you will much
blame the Counſel which was given you,
to deny us that Juſtice, which you will
find ſo clear and well-founded, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
embrace the wayes that we have
inſinuated to you, and do ſtill offer them,
<pb facs="tcp:54819:10"/>
to decide the differences between us by a
friendly accommodation; aſſuring your
Majeſty, in encouragement to it, of two
things; One, that we ſhall be content
with very moderate conditions, regard
being had to the quality and importance
of our Rights; the other, that if the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of our Armes be as proſperous as
their cauſe is juſt, we have no intention
to thruſt them forwards beyond that
which belongs to us, or ſomething equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
to it, whereſoever we can light on
it. And as to all the reſt of the Eſtates of
our deareſt and moſt beloved Brother the
King of <hi>Spain,</hi> the chief foundation ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
that we receive that Juſtice which
is due to us, we ſhall be alwayes ready to
defend them againſt all Aggreſſors, for
the conſervation of them to him and his
poſterity, which we wiſh may be numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and without end; as alſo very reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly
to obſerve the Peace, as we aſſured
the Marquis <hi>De la Fuentes,</hi> when he
took his leave of us, not thinking that
the Peace is broken by us by our entring
into the Low-Countries, though with the
Sword in our hand, ſince we march only
to put our ſelves in poſſeſſion of that
<pb facs="tcp:54819:10"/>
which is uſurped upon us: Thus refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
you further to our Ambaſſadour.
We pray God to preſerve you, moſt High,

the people became immediately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd

the foregoing Letter.</head>
                  <p>THe Arch-biſhop of <hi>Ambrun,</hi> your
Majeſties Ambaſſadour in this
Court, hath delivered me your Letter,
bearing date the eight inſtant, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
with a Book and a Memorial toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
with a large repreſentation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cital
of the Motives alledged by your
Majeſty, for the motion of your Forces,
upon a pretended Right to ſome Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in the Low-Countries. Whilſt we
apply our ſelves to the anſwer of yours,
in all the particulars required, I thought
it not fit to defer the giving an anſwer
to your Letter, although I am very much
ſurpriſed with the unexpected news of
ſuch a deſign. And although your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
is pleaſed to inſinuate, that the moſt
Chriſtian Queen, my good Siſter (whom
God hath taken to his glory) had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
theſe pretenſions to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
<hi>De la Fuente,</hi> and that I cannot but
remember, that he informed me of it by
his Letter; yet in truth I alwayes lookt
upon that diſcourſe as a thing only of
<pb facs="tcp:54819:12"/>
private familiarity and confidence,
ſince it paſſed not in the form of an
Ambaſſadour, nor as a Miniſter from
your Majeſty, nor yet in your Majeſties
name. And I have been the rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
in the truth of this Opinion,
ſince having given the ſaid Marquis a
very ſuccinct anſwer, to all that could be
ſaid upon the point, nothing was fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſaid in that matter: So that the
ſilence which hath been kept ſince the
Marquis had his anſwer, could not leave
any other impreſſion on me, but that your
Court being informed of the juſt Rights
of the King my Son, and ſufficiently ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
of the ſincerity of my proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
all further purſuit of thoſe preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
had been wholly laid aſide. It being
further to be conſidered, that this inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation
which has been made is quite
contrary to thoſe formalities, which the
Articles of Peace made in the <hi>Pyrenae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
requires, before it can be lawful to
proceed to a Rupture; It being alſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
upon the ninetieth Article, that if
the Renunciation it ſelf had not been
made, it ought not to have been purſued
by the way of Armes, but by that of
<pb facs="tcp:54819:13"/>
ſweetneſs and Juſtice. And ſince your
Majeſty doth now declare your willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to enter into an amicable Treaty,
I am alſo willing to conform my ſelf to
it; and am content that the Rights be
ſeaſonably examin'd, that Juſtice may
take its place by the way and means moſt
proper for that purpoſe: To which end
ſome perſons ought to be nominated, and
a place agreed on convenient for ſuch a
Treaty. And as 'tis neceſſary that both
parties do in the mean time abſtain
from all further proceedings by the way
of Armes, I hope your Majeſty will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend
to it: Which if denyed, I ſhall
be forced, as I am obliged in conſcience,
and as a Guardian Royal to the King
my Son, to make uſe of the ſame wayes
and meanes to defend the Juſtice of his
Cauſe.</p>

the advantages to your Majeſty; its
principal aim being only to reſtore Peace
to Chriſtendom, and put an end to a
War which had involved the poor and

<pb facs="tcp:54819:14"/>
in which all <hi>Europe</hi> will have a

the Scandal that will be given to

ſubordinated to the Laws of a Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
without any form of Juſtice, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance
of the Rule, of firſt demanding
ſatisfaction. And if your Majeſty hath
any pretenſion of disſatisfaction, Reaſon
and Juſtice require, your Majeſty ſhould
firſt declare and juſtifie them, not only in
particular to the Parties intereſſed, but
alſo to the Neighbouring Princes, to the
Countries in diſpute, and to your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
own Subjects; ſince by the Law
of Nature, nothing can be exacted or
forcibly taken from ones own Subject or
Slave, much leſs from one that is wholly
innocent, where the Government is ty'd
up by a Regency, to the prejudice of the
Subjects of both Parties, and of the

Laws, and without whoſe knowledge, ſo

noble a Member, as the Circle of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy,</hi>

violates the Treaty of <hi>Munſter,</hi>
by which (as alſo by our Peace which
was ſince concluded) it was capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated,
that in caſe of a Rupture, the

                  <p>I leave it, Sir, to the conſideration of
your Majeſty, how remote it will be from

without any of thoſe Formalities
<pb facs="tcp:54819:15"/>
and Interpoſitions which all Chriſtian
Princes have alwayes obſerved; that ſo
your Majeſty, as the moſt Chriſtian, may
not introduce an Example, which as it
is contrary to all former ones, ſo it
may prove prejudicial to your ſelf and
your Poſterity.</p>
                  <p>I do not deſire your Majeſty to preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice

in his Majeſties Troops, to ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſack
my memory in vain for ſuch
things as I had a mind to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.
I take not upon my ſelf
to make an exact deſcription
of the State of affairs at that
time; my deſign being to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
a Journal, and not a Hiſtory.
Neither do I think fit to diſplay
the Queens Title to the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,</hi>
ſince the righteouſneſs
thereof hath been authentically
enough made out by the <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſto</hi>
publiſhed by his Majeſty
concerning the ſame. It ſhall be
ſufficient for me to relate in a
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54819:18"/>
plain manner, and without all
affected Ornament of Style, what
I ſaw my ſelf, and what I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by information from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>The Peace which was Treating at
<hi>Breda,</hi> between <hi>England, France,</hi>
and <hi>Holland,</hi> was at the point of
concluſion, when the King who
had ſuffered eighteen or twenty
months to paſs ſince the death
of <hi>Philip</hi> the fourth King of
<hi>Spain,</hi> thereby to allow time to
the Queen Dowager to give him
ſatisfaction in a fair way in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to his pretentions to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Provinces of the Low
Countries, as he had given her
to underſtand as well by ſundry
Letters, as by frequent inſtances
of his Ambaſſador in the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
Court; aſtoniſht all his
Neighbours and ſurpriſed moſt
part of his own Subjects, by giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54819:19"/>
order in the months of
<hi>March</hi> and <hi>April,</hi> that almoſt all
the Forces deſign'd by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
to ſerve in this Expedition,
ſhould advance to the Frontiers
of <hi>Champaigne</hi> and <hi>Picardy,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
pretence of making great
Muſters, as he had accuſtom'd
to do for ſome years paſt;
wherein all the Regiments and
Companies both of Horſe and
Foot were uſed to encampe as
exactly and regularly as if they
had been in open War, and in the
midſt of his enemies.</p>
            <p>After the review which his
Majeſty made of his Guards
at S. <hi>Germains,</hi> towards the
end of the month of <hi>April,</hi> it
began to be divulged that his
Majeſty would in good earneſt
take the Field, if the Counſel of
<hi>Spain</hi> did not ſpeedily yeild to
the King a good part of thoſe
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54819:19"/>
thing which he had demanded
of them. Soon after Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Officers were nominated, and
care was taken for diſpoſing
great ſums of money for the
Artillery and proviſions. The
Commanders of Regiments had
notice given them to advertiſe
all perſons under their command
to ſee to their Equipages; and
in a word, all ſuch Orders were
given out as are uſual in the
commencing of a War.</p>
            <p>Whilſt theſe things were in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,
the <hi>Manifeſto,</hi> ſetting
forth the Queens Right and Title
to thoſe Countries, was publiſhed;
and about the beginning of <hi>May</hi>
Printed Copies thereof were
ſent throughout all <hi>Europe,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>pecially
into <hi>Spain,</hi> and to <hi>Bruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels.</hi>
Which being a ſufficient
and competent Declaration of
War, the King fitted himſelf to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54819:20"/>
go and expect an anſwer to it at
the head of his Army.</p>
            <p>Accordingly his Majeſty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the Queen depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from S. <hi>Germains</hi> on the
ſixteenth day of the ſame
moneth, attended with ſuch a
ſmall number of thoſe of his
Court as were in readineſs to
accompany him; moſt of the
great Lords and Courtiers ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
behind to prepare their Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pages
of War. But that thoſe
who intended to follow might
have time to overtake him,
his Majeſty ſpent four dayes on
the way before he arriv'd at
<hi>Amiens,</hi> where he arriv'd on the
twentieth day of the ſame
moneth of <hi>May.</hi> At the ſame
time the General Officers ſet
forward in order to the drawing
of the Troops together in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
places; ſome at <hi>La Fere,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

at S. <hi>Quintin, Guiſe, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zieres,

extended from the River <hi>Meuſe</hi>
to the coaſt of <hi>Calais;</hi> though in
diſtinct Bodies, yet ſo as that
they might joyn together in five

            <p>Marſhall <hi>D' Aumont,</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

Queen's Regiment; His Cavalry,
Commanded by Monſieur <hi>la Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donniere</hi>
Comiſſary General,
was divided into three Brigades,
at the head of which were the
Marquis <hi>de Rouvray,</hi> the Marquis

recall'd to Court, from which
he had been abſent for ſix years,
was ſent with between three and
four thouſand men to the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie
of <hi>Luxembourg,</hi> and the parts
about <hi>Alſatia;</hi> and with him
Monſieur <hi>Deſperce</hi> for Marſhall of

of Foot with him,
<hi>viz.</hi> the Regiment of <hi>Piedmont,</hi>
and S. <hi>Vallier,</hi> beſides 1000 Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons.
His Cavalry was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
divided into three Brigades,
under the Command of the
Marquiſſes <hi>d'Joyeuſe de la Feüillee,</hi>
and <hi>de Montaurel,</hi> who were all
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54819:21"/>
under the obedience of Monſieur
<hi>de Rochepere.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the ſame time the Duke of

whereof he was Governour, to
the end he might take care of
<hi>Rouſſillon,</hi> whilſt the main
brunt of the War ſhould be in

few Forces, becauſe there was
but little to enterpriſe; onely
ſome Regiments of Cavalry
were aſſigned to him, and Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>Foucaut,</hi> for his Lieutennant

            <p>'Twas eaſily judg'd that the
King had ſome great deſign
when it was underſtood that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his departure from S. <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main's</hi>
he appointed a Counſell
to remain with the Queen, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
of the Chanceller of <hi>France,</hi>
and the Marſhall <hi>d'Eſtree,</hi> with
two Secretaries of ſtate, Monſieur

            <p>The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> remain'd
at his houſe of <hi>Chantilly,</hi> partly
for that he was indiſpos'd in his
health, and partly for that, as it
was ſeen afterwards, the King
reſerv'd him for other imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
when the War ſhould be
begun; his Majeſty declaring,
that during the whole courſe of
of this Campagne he would
not make uſe of the Counſell
of any but that of mounſieur <hi>de
Turenne,</hi> Marſhal General of the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54819:22"/>
Camp, who by this meanes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
himſelf at a higher ſtep of

to before.</p>
            <p>As for the Miniſters of State,
of whom his Majeſty ſerv'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
namely Monſieur <hi>le Tellier,</hi>
Monſieur <hi>de Lionne,</hi> Secretaries of
State, and Monſieur <hi>Colbert,</hi> they
departed not from <hi>Paris,</hi> till ſix
dayes after his Majeſty, and then
they went directly to <hi>La Fere,</hi>
there to remain in expectation of
further orders.</p>
            <p>The Marquis <hi>de Louvois,</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary
of State, had ſet forth
from <hi>Paris</hi> two dayes before the
King, namely on the fourteenth
of <hi>May,</hi> in order to give notice to
all the world of his Majeſties
march, and the deſign he had
to let the Queen ſee what
Troups he had about <hi>Peronne,</hi>
where their Majeſties arrived
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54819:23"/>
the 26 of <hi>May.</hi> But before we
proceed any further, it ſeems to
me not impertinent to give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
what Forces were in being
when the King began firſt to
think of this enterpriſe.</p>
            <p>All the Infantry of <hi>France</hi>
were divided into 1200 Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies,
each of them conſiſting
of fifty men; but ſeveral young
Gentlemen of Quality having
ſince taken the Command of
Regiments upon them, they are
now much more, they having
for greater Oſtentation of their
Commands many of them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged
their Troops, and at
their own expence raiſed ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Companies much more
Numerous then was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the King had two
Regiments of his Guards, one of
<hi>French,</hi> the other of <hi>Swiſs,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54819:23"/>
twenty Companies of new
raiſed <hi>Swiſs,</hi> all which Foot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted
upon the Muſter Role
to 70000 men, beſides 1000 Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goones.</p>
            <p>The Horſe conſſſted of 200
Troops, each of them of fifty
men, which made up likewiſe by
the Roles 10000 Horſe, his Court
and Equipage were 3000 Horſe,
if we reckon the <hi>Guards de Corps,</hi>
his <hi>Muſquitires on Horſe-back</hi> his
<hi>Gens d' Armes,</hi> and <hi>his light
Horſe</hi> belonging to his perſon,
the moſt ready and beſt diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plin'd
that without doubt
have been ſeen at any time.</p>
            <p>Having furniſht his Garriſons
out of theſe, and divided the
reſt into ſeveral Bodies, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the different places he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd
to imploy them, as I have
related before, the Army Royal
was judg'd to conſiſt of about
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:54819:24"/>
24 or 25000 Foot, and 9 or
10000 Horſe, of which you ſhall
have the particulars.</p>
            <p>The Foot was divided into
four Brigades, the firſt and
ſtrongeſt was that of the Guards,
Compos'd of twenty-eight Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
of the <hi>French</hi> Guards,
and nineteen of the <hi>Swiſs,</hi> and
four &amp; twenty Companies of the
Kings Regiment Commanded by
the <hi>Marquis d' Anjau</hi> who alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
made eleven Battalions:
<hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> Guards four,
the <hi>Swiſs</hi> four, and the other
Regiment three.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Brigade was that
of <hi>Picardy,</hi> of which was the
Regiment called by that name
Commanded by the <hi>Counte de la
Mark,</hi> the Regiment of <hi>Saux</hi>
Commanded by the <hi>Count de
Saux de Leſdiguiers,</hi> the <hi>Lyon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nois</hi>
Regiment Commanded by
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:54819:24"/>
the Marquis <hi>de Villeroy,</hi> the
Regiment <hi>de Turenne</hi> Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by the Marquis <hi>de Sillery;</hi>
all which Regiments made up
two Battalions a piece.</p>
            <p>The third was the <hi>Brigade of
Champagne,</hi> compoſed of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment
of <hi>Champagne</hi> Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by the Marquis <hi>d' Ambre,</hi>
and of the Regiments of <hi>Caſtel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nau,
Louvigny,</hi> and <hi>Orleans,</hi> the
firſt Commanded by the Marquis
<hi>de Caſtelnau,</hi> the ſecond by the
Marquis <hi>de Louvigny,</hi> the third by
the Marquis <hi>de Beaufort,</hi> and
each of theſe Regiments made
up two Battalions likewiſe.</p>
            <p>In the fourth <hi>Baigade</hi> was the
Regiments of <hi>Auvergne</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by the Duke <hi>de Chev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reuſe,</hi>
the Royal Regiment Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by <hi>Pierrefit,</hi> the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Rouſſillon</hi> or <hi>Catalonia</hi>
Commanded by <hi>Caramagne,</hi> and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54819:25"/>
the Regiment of <hi>Alſatia</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by the <hi>Counte de Naſſau,</hi>
which in all made up but ſeven
Battalions, <hi>Rouſſillon</hi> making but
on
The <hi>Light Horſe</hi> Commanded by
the Duke <hi>Coaſlin,</hi> their Camp
Maſter General, was divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
twelve Brigades; but becauſe
it would be tedious to reckon
up the ſeveral Regiments they
were compos'd of, I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
my ſelf only to inſert the
names of the ſeveral <hi>Brigadies</hi>
they ſerved under, which were
the Barron of <hi>Montelar,</hi> of <hi>Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neaux,
Beauveze,</hi> the Marquis
<hi>de Reſnel, Biſſy,</hi> and <hi>Montauban,</hi>
the <hi>Chevallier de Fourilles,</hi> the
<hi>Comte de Choiſeul, Artagnan,</hi> the
<hi>Comte de Roye,</hi> the Marquis <hi>de
Rochefort</hi> and <hi>de Villequier.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There were expected alſo
ſome Troops from the Duke of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:54819:25"/>
               <hi>Lorraine,</hi> which conſiſted of four
Regiments of about 1500 Horſe,
and two of Foot of about 900 or
1000 Men.</p>
            <p>Their Canon they brought
from <hi>la Fere</hi> and <hi>Amiens,</hi> I mean
their great peices, for at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the moneth the King
had given order to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
of the ſeveral Brigades,
that every Battalion ſhould
carry a peice of 4 or 5 pound
Ball along with it, and money
was given out accordingly to buy
Horſes and other things, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
for their train.</p>
            <p>S. <hi>Hillary</hi> Lieutenant of the
Ordinance, was the perſon Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
all the Equipage de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
for this Army, and <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi>
Maſter of the Requeſt was

land.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:54819:26"/>
As to our Forces at Sea, I have
been told we had twelve or
thirteen Gallies in the Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean
Sea, and that the Duke
<hi>de Beaufort,</hi> our Admiral, was
upon the coaſt of <hi>Brittain</hi> and
<hi>Rochell</hi> with about 25 or 30
men of War.</p>
            <p>The King being arrived at

where he met moſt of his Army,

thence he marcht and incampt at

ſmall Town in <hi>Hainault</hi> unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified,
and which in the time of
the Wars follows alwayes the
Maſter of the Field: here it was
thought expedient to leave
ſome Forces for our convenience
whilſt the Army lay at <hi>Charleroy,</hi>
where his Majeſty deſign'd to
go at his coming from <hi>Amiens;</hi>
at the length he came and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp't
at <hi>Pieton,</hi> a Village ſituate
upon a Brook of the ſame name,
which after ſome meanders and
Circumflexions falls about a
league from the Town into the
<hi>Sambre.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This River and Brook where

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:54819:27"/>
the ſide of their deſcent, which
being ſufficiently elevated above

Towns that were delivered up
to us upon the peace on the

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:54819:27"/>
purſued with that diligence and
expence, that the place was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
defenſible, when they had
the firſt newes of the Kings reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
to come in perſon with a

            <p>This place which was called
by <hi>Caſtle Rodrigo, Charleroy,</hi> was
fortified with ſeven Baſtions, lined
with a ſort of ſtone that was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

not able to make any long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
if they ſhould be ſet upon

had ſent thither, before he blew
it up, and demoliſht the body of
it as well perhaps as ever was
any before; but the out-works
they left intire, and they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
ſo well to his Majeſty
when he came thither, that he
reſolved to repair all, upon an
opinion that this place not being

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orrage; beſides, they were ſo ill
provided with Horſes for their
Train of Artillery, that all they
could rap and rend were ſcarce
ſufficient to draw eight or ten
peices of whole Canon with ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
Ammunition for them &amp;
their Foot. Nor was their accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation
for Victualls in a much
better condition, moſt of their
Baggage being in a very ill po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
to follow the Army which
was falling into their Country:
it may be alſo he might have
ſome inclination to attend, and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:54819:29"/>
ſee what effect his Manifeſto,
might have upon the ſpirits of the
people, the War not being yet ſo
far gon, but that if they had given
any aſſurance of ſatisfaction he
could have hearkned to their
conditions, and have ſaved thoſe
Provinces from all the calamities
and devaſtations hath been ſince
brought upon them by his Army:
But whatſoever was the reaſon,
we ſpent there fifteen dayes in
reparing the ruines, as well as we
could, the whole Army working
all the while with all diligence
imaginable.</p>
            <p>The War being thus begun,
and no enemy appearing in the
Field, there was not much Hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
committed, the King keeping
his Army in as ſtrict a diſcipline as
if they had been in his own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions.
However they did not
forbear the proſecuting the War
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:54819:29"/>
from the time it marcht from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<hi>Chaſteau de Cambreſy,</hi> and
<hi>Pilois</hi> Camp-Maſter to the Horſe,
was Commanded out with 500
Horſe to fall into the Country
for intelligence, and to diſcover
if there were any preparation
making againſt them. The moſt
part of the perſons of quality
offered themſelves as Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers
in this Expedition; but the
King would permit but ſome
few, of which the moſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
were the Duke <hi>d' Enguien,</hi>
the Counte <hi>de S. Paul,</hi> and the
Duke <hi>de Boüillon;</hi> but their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
proved to little purpoſe,
for after they had been abroad
four or five dayes they returned
to the Camp without opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of doing any thing.</p>
            <p>During the ſtay of the Army
at <hi>Charleroy,</hi> the Queen, as I
have ſaid, returned to <hi>Compiegne;</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:54819:30"/>
but ſhe came back as far as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſne</hi>
to enjoy the preſence of
the King who was there, and to
take the advantage of that little
time he would ſpare from the
care he would needs take to
ſee the place accommodated
himſelf.</p>
            <p>The day ſhe was to arrive the
King went out with a good bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of Horſe, ſome two or three
Leagues to meet her; and during
the four or five days they were
together, <hi>Monſieur,</hi> who remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Camp, gave out all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
orders.</p>
            <p>Some there are that will ſay,
that that which carried the
King into this part of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
was not only the deſigne
upon <hi>Charleroy,</hi> which he knew
was demoliſht before he ſet out:
But having a long time main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
a correſpondence in <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:54819:30"/>
and <hi>Luxembourg,</hi> he had
haſtned his march to encourage
that enterpriſe: but I am not ſo
well informed of the intrigues
of Government to know the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty;
this I only know, they
were favourers of the houſe
of <hi>Auſtria</hi> that ſpred the report
to make the conduct of the
King the more odious to the
people.</p>
            <p>In ſhort they put <hi>Charleroy</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ſuch a condition of defence,
that they left all the great Guns
they had in the Camp there, and
put the Regiment of <hi>la Ferte</hi> in
Garriſon, and other Companies
drawn out of ſeveral battalions,
which they formed into another
called the <hi>Dauphins</hi> Regiment,
and gave the Command of it to
<hi>Phiſica,</hi> ſomtimes Lieutenant
Colonel in the Regiment of
<hi>Turenne:</hi> the Government of the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:54819:31"/>
Fort was beſtowed upon <hi>Montal,</hi>
with order to continue the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications
without intermiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>They left alſo 300 Horſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<hi>Charleroy</hi> for their farther
ſecurity, after which marcht the
King up into the Country, to
make his advantage of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation
his great Army had
brought upon the Provinces.</p>
            <p>On the <hi>15th</hi> of <hi>June</hi> he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp't
and marching towards
<hi>Bruſſels</hi> he took up his quarters
about <hi>Nivelle;</hi> whither having
at the entreaty of the inhabitants
ſent two of his Guards to ſecure
them, they were notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
contrary to all honour and
equity carried Priſoners to <hi>Bruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,</hi>
where they lay above two
moneths. From <hi>Nivelle</hi> the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
marcht a little above <hi>Mons</hi>
towards <hi>Braine-le-Comte,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:54819:31"/>
ſome days march they came
to <hi>Ath,</hi> a little Town ſituate
almoſt at the head of the River
<hi>Dendre</hi> without any fortification,
but ſo capable of it that the
King reſolved to leave a Garriſon
there, and made <hi>des Landes</hi>
(who had formerly ſerved the
Prince of <hi>Condy</hi>) the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
            <p>Out of divers Regiments
there were ſome Companies
drawn out, in all about 400 Foot
and 100 Horſe, which were left
on purpoſe to infeſt and alarm the
Towns thereabouts, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
<hi>Bruſſels,</hi> which was but eight
leagues diſtant, there being no
conſiderable Rivulets betwixt
them.</p>
            <p>All this progreſs was made
without any other impediment
then from the badneſs of the
wayes, the Enemy not daring to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:54819:32"/>
ſhew themſelves any where; only
a Party of their <hi>Cravatts,</hi> earneſt
upon plunder, fell upon our ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage.
But <hi>Rommecour,</hi> Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of the Company of the
<hi>Gardes de Corps,</hi> being by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
with a Party of Horſe near
<hi>Enchoit</hi> upon a deſign, which
was the place where this buſineſs
began, he charged them ſo
home he conſtrained them to
leave their prize, though they
had ſlain ſome of our men, not
without loſs certainly to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
This I am ſureof, the <hi>Comte
de S. Geran,</hi> who ſerved then as
<hi>Aide de Camp,</hi> and the Marquis
<hi>de Bellefont,</hi> were both very much
wounded.</p>
            <p>The Army ſtaid not ſo long
there as it had done at <hi>Charleroy,</hi>
they left the Garriſon only ſome
palliſadoes to begin their fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
withall; and the King
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:54819:32"/>
diſcampt and marcht to the
ſiedge of <hi>Tournay,</hi> a place of
great importance, but very ill
provided with Souldiers, and
the inhabitants, who were very
numerous, bearing no great ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſity
to the <hi>French,</hi> under
whoſe Dominion they had lived
long, for it is ſcarce an age ſince
they ſubmitted themſelves to the
houſe of <hi>Auſtria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides the King perceived
the taking of this Town would
be a conſiderable acqueſt in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of its ſituation upon the
River <hi>Sceld,</hi> betwixt <hi>Conde</hi> and
<hi>Oudenarde,</hi> and might eſpecially
perplex that part of <hi>Flanders</hi> is
called the <hi>Wallonne</hi> Country
(of which that is a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber)
as alſo <hi>Hainault</hi> and <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the <hi>20th</hi> of <hi>June</hi> they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
their march; but before that
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:54819:33"/>
he gave order to <hi>Comte de Lille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonne</hi>
(a Prince of the houſe of
<hi>Lorrain,</hi> who Commanded the
Troopes the Duke of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine</hi>
had ſent to the King,
and who being not as yet joyned
to the Army was quartered
about <hi>Arras</hi>) that he ſhould im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
joyne himſelf with
<hi>Artagnan,</hi> who was thereabouts
alſo, and that paſſing the bridge
at <hi>Avendin,</hi> he ſhould march
away immediately and block
up <hi>Tournay</hi> on that ſide next <hi>Lille,</hi>
which was executed accordingly,
and the Bridges for communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
being finiſhed, the King paſt
the River next day with moſt
of his Army, and took his Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
up at the Town of <hi>Foryen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,</hi>
having left on the other
ſide of the water the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
<hi>Humieres,</hi> and the <hi>Comte de
Duras,</hi> with ſuch Troops as were
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:54819:33"/>
thought neceſſary for the belea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guering
the Town on that ſide
next to <hi>Hainault</hi> and <hi>Brabant;</hi> and
without giving further time to
the beſeiged to recollect them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
it was reſolved they ſhould
that very night begin their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches.</p>
            <p>The place being ſurveyed; we
began our approaches on the
ſide of certaine Windmils, which
are plac't upon a little eminence
not far from the banke of the
River as you go into the Town.
The firſt Battalion of the <hi>French</hi>
Guards that <hi>d' Ortie</hi> Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
firſt Captain of that Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron,
began their works toward
the right, and the Regiments of
<hi>Picardy</hi> and <hi>Caſt<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lnau</hi> on the left:
but theſe laſt having misſpent
their time at the beginning of
the night, their approaches went
on but ſlow; however they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:54819:34"/>
as they pleaſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
the oppoſition and firing
of the enemy being very ſmall,
there was ſcarce any need of
ſhelter at all; there were not
many Souldiers kill'd, nor but
few wounded.</p>
            <p>This day Monſieur being in
the Trenches found the King
there, who came likewiſe to give
them a viſit, an action not ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
amongſt princes, and of
which Hiſtory affords but few
examples.</p>
            <p>It would be tedious to inſert
the names of all the Voluntiers
that were then in our Trenches.
The preſence of the King who
expoſed himſelf in all places of
danger (inſomuch that whilſt
out of a deſire to ſee all that
paſt, he went about ſurveying
the works, he had one of his
Pages wounded behind him
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:54819:34"/>
with a Canon-ſhot, and ſome few
Horſes kill'd) was a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to the whole Court,
and put them all forward to do
ſomething remarkable on this firſt
occaſion; amongſt the Voluntires
that more particularly ſignalis'd
themſelves, was the <hi>Comte</hi> of <hi>S.
Paul,</hi> who in a ſally the beſieged
made, beat them up to the very
Counterſcarp, &amp; there for a good
while diſputed with one of his
Enemies at the puſh of Pike; and
in this ſally S. <hi>Sandoux,</hi> a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
in the Regiment of Guards
was ſore wounded. The next
day the firſt Battalion, of the
<hi>Swiſs</hi> Guards Commanded by
<hi>Molondin</hi> their Collonel, releiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the <hi>French</hi> Guards, their
Generall the <hi>Comte</hi> of <hi>Soiſſons</hi>
being ill, and not able to come as
yet to the Army. About midnight
they beat a parly, and a ceſſatiou
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:54819:35"/>
being preſently gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
they yeilded up
the Town,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tournay</hi> ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred.</note> and that
before one great Gun was ſhot
againſt it; nor indeed had we as
yet one peice for Battery, though
we were in an hourly Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a great convoy from <hi>Arras</hi>
of 1500 or 1600 Waggons of all
ſort of Proviſion &amp; Ammunition,
and eight peices of whole Canon
that the Army had great need of.</p>
            <p>The Town being ſurrendred
the Governour retires into the
Caſtle with his Garriſon, which
is ſtrong, and divided from the
Town by the <hi>Sceld.</hi> It is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to have been built by the
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> whilſt it was in their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion,
after they had taken it
from the <hi>French.</hi> The works are
antient indeed, but not bad; but
as they ſtood then, they were in
no very good condition, nor was
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:54819:35"/>
it defended any better then the
Town, for they had much to doe
to keep it one day afterwards,
and marcht out the <hi>26th</hi> about
300 ill foot and 100 good Horſe,
in three Troops, without Canon
or any other good termes, and
were conducted to <hi>Bruſſels</hi> by
<hi>Pruines,</hi> an in feriour officer of
the Guards, with about 25 or
30 of his Souldiers: amongſt
all the wounded of quality
in this ſiege there was only <hi>Tracy</hi>
Captain of the Guardes that was
ſhot with a Musquit in the cheek.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Marſhall
<hi>d' Aumont</hi> was not idle, for being
entered into <hi>Flanders</hi> by the
new ditch betwixt S. <hi>Omer</hi> and
<hi>Aire,</hi> he had advanc't almoſt
as far as <hi>Bergue,</hi> where having un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
there were no formed
Troops in the place, he thought
it neceſſary to make any formal
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:54819:36"/>
ſiege; but drawing alltogether
by 9 in the morning he made all
his Foot advance, and fell on in
two ſeveral places.</p>
            <p>Theſe two ſtormes were Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
one by the <hi>Comte d' Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,</hi>
and the other by the Duke
of <hi>Roanez,</hi> both Lieutenant Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals;
the latter of which, not
troubling himſelf to throw up
any works, fell immediatly on,
and made himſelf Maſter of the
half-moon and Counterſcarpe:
at firſt they had ſome reſiſtance,
the Citizens having taken
Armes with ſome of the Country
that were come in for refuge;
but before night they parly'd,
and at the ſame time
ſurrendred upon ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
termes.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bergue</hi> taken by Marſhall <hi>d' Aumont.</hi>
               </note>
There were ſome
brave men ſlain there, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
for S. <hi>Lieu,</hi> Marſhall
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:54819:36"/>
               <hi>d' Campe,</hi> in this Army much
eſteemed for his courage, and
long experience in the War, was
kill'd by two ſhots of a Muſquet;
and five or ſix Officers in the
Queens Regiment, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment
of <hi>Navarre,</hi> were ſlain or
wounded, with about 200 Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
in all, but moſt of the Duke
of <hi>Roanez</hi> ſide, for of <hi>Paſſage's</hi>
here were but few.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bergue</hi> being taken the Army
advanced towards <hi>Furnes</hi> to
give the Garriſon of <hi>Dunkerque</hi>
more elbow-roome, where the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
was much one as at
<hi>Bergue.</hi> The ſecond day after
our Trenches were
opened the place was
ſurrendered,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Furnes</hi> tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en.</note> and we
became Maſters of it the third or
fourth time.</p>
            <p>The Marſhall <hi>de Aumont,</hi> not
ſatisfied with this, was marching
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:54819:37"/>
with his Army to <hi>Dixmude,</hi>
when he received expreſs order
from the King to come away
immediately to <hi>Armentiers,</hi> which
place is ſituate upon the <hi>Lis,</hi>
and in the time of Marſhall <hi>Gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi>
had gained great reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
it was fortified by him in the
Winter 1645, but was ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſht
by the <hi>Spaniard</hi> ſince, that
in <hi>May,</hi> whilſt the King was at
<hi>Peronne, Artagnan</hi> was ſent thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with ſome Troops, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
as he pleaſed he took the
Governour Priſoner in his own
lodgings without any noiſe or Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larme.
The deſign the King had
in calling the Marſhal <hi>d' Aumont</hi>
thither, was apparently to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
the paſſage of Victuals to
our great Army, whilſt it lay
before <hi>Tournay,</hi> for they were
the ſame Troops that conducted
the great convoy I mentioned
before.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:54819:37"/>
               <hi>Tournay</hi> being delivered, the
King and his whole Court were
lodged in the Town; he gave
<hi>Renoüart,</hi> Captain of the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Guards, the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
leaving him four Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of that Regiment, and three
of the <hi>Swiſs</hi> Guards, with three
Troops of Horſe of the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of S. <hi>Sierge,</hi> but lodged
them all in the Caſtle to prevent
any incommodity the in habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
might receive in the Town,
and to ſhew his new ſubjects
how eaſie his dominion would
be.</p>
            <p>The <hi>28th</hi> of the ſame moneth
having given exact orders for the
Conſervation of the place, he
marcht away with his Army
towards <hi>Gaunt,</hi> and as every
body thought, with deſign to
fall upon <hi>Oudenarde,</hi> or <hi>Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:54819:38"/>
They which deſired <hi>Oudenarde</hi>
ſhould be beſieged alledged the
Town was ſituate upon the
<hi>Sceld,</hi> ſome ſeven leagues from
<hi>Tournay,</hi> and would extend our
conqueſts quite down the River
as far as <hi>Gaunt;</hi> and that though
the Town being commanded by
a very high mountain on that
ſide towards <hi>Aloſt,</hi> could not be
very ſtrong, yet by placing a
good Garriſon there it might
make a good poſt, and be very
uſefull in interrupting the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
betwixt <hi>Bruſſels</hi> and <hi>Gaunt,</hi>
the two Principal Towns in the
<hi>Low Countries.</hi> Others were
for attempting of <hi>Courtray,</hi> a
Town upon the <hi>Lis,</hi> and of great
importance ever ſince <hi>Gaſſion</hi>
raiſed a Cittadel there, and by
it held in ſubjection as well the
<hi>Wallonne,</hi> part of <hi>Flanders,</hi> as the
<hi>Flemming:</hi> and this opinion
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:54819:38"/>
appeared the moſt reaſonable,
ſeeing all the Priſoners taken
agreed in their report, that there
were but 200 Souldiers in the
Town, and that the principal
Inhabitants had already reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to deliver up the Town,
and attended only his Majeſties
appearance with his Army to
ſurrender it into his hands.
But both theſe opinions were
diſappointed in the event, for
the Army which was then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>campt
at <hi>Helchin,</hi> ſome three
leagues from <hi>Courtray,</hi> four from
<hi>Oudenarde,</hi> and four or five from
<hi>Lille,</hi> on a ſudden on the <hi>30th</hi>
of that moneth marcht cleer
back again; the King having the
day before Commanded out the
Count <hi>de Duras,</hi> with two Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gades
of Horſe, and the <hi>Comte de
Lillebonne,</hi> with all the <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rainers,</hi>

               <hi>Doüay,</hi> and theſe Troops be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
advanced, to ſtrengthen it, al
the Army followed with great
marches, ſo as on the ſecond of
<hi>July</hi> the Town was beſieged on
all ſides.</p>
            <p>The King at firſt would take
up his quarters at <hi>Barbieres,</hi> a Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage
upon the <hi>Scarpe</hi> neer the
Road betwixt <hi>Doüay,</hi> and <hi>Arras,</hi>
but this Town being too far off,
and it being believed the Town
would require circumvallation,
he removed and lodged himſelf
in <hi>la Mottes</hi> quarters nearer the
Town, and more capable of being
fortified.</p>
            <p>Whilſt they were ordering the
Camp, the King, having din'd at a
Villedge of <hi>Eſquierchin,</hi> perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as he was getting a Horſeback
ſome of the Enemy drawing out
of the Town, and advanc't to a
little Chappel ſome 7 or 800 paces
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:54819:39"/>
without their Counterſcarpe,
which gave him a great deſire
of ſeeing them nearer hand, he
Commanded out preſently a
ſmall party of the Colonels
Regiment that was then by, to
charge them, and take ſome Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners
if they could: <hi>Mazel</hi>
Maſter of the Horſe to the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compte
de Turenne,</hi> with ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
putting themſelves in
with this party, and having or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
two Squadrons of the
Guards to relieve them, they
advanc't, and without ſo
much as ſtopping at their Vollies
they advanced to their Turne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pike,
behind which the Enemy
being retired, our Forces were
open to all their ſhot, both Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
and Muſquet. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
which there were not
above two or three wounded,
amongſt whom <hi>Leſtang,</hi> an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:54819:40"/>
of the Guards of <hi>Turenne</hi>
was one, and another Named <hi>S.
Rut.</hi> Some perſons of quallity
ſtole away from the King alſo to
be preſent at this action, and
amongſt the firſt of them was
the <hi>Comte de Soiſſons,</hi> and the
<hi>Comte de Avergne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is no great matter to gueſs
the Reaſons that brought his
Majeſty before <hi>Doüay:</hi> For this
Town being of very great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
in thoſe parts, being
ſituate upon the <hi>Scarpe</hi> ſome five
leagues below <hi>Arras,</hi> and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of receiving great numbers
of men, and the yeilding great
ſupply of Proviſion for the Army,
we could not take in any thing
of more importance, or that
could contribute more to the
keeping of <hi>Tournay,</hi> which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the communication of this
Town, was not eaſily to be
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:54819:40"/>
kept. Beſides he had advice
the Town was but ill man'd,
and not like to hold out long
and that the <hi>Scarpe</hi> Fort, which
is a Fort conſiſting of five Baſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
built in that Marſh, which
makes the River and gives it its
name, about a Cannon ſhot
below the Town, was alſo very ill
provided: and upon theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
the King reſolved to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taque
them both at one time,
as well to aſtoniſh them within,
as to take away all hopes of
relieving them without; which
would have been very eaſie ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
time, in reſpect the place was
of that extent it would require
a vaſt line of circumvallation,
and without that it was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible;
to attempt either the
Town without the Fort, or
the Fort without the Town,
at leaſt to block them up ſo as to
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:54819:41"/>
prevent their reliefs; but in
ſpight of the ſtrength or feeble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Enemy, the Vigilance
of the King and his Captains
overcame all difficulties; For on
the third at night our Trenches
were opened by fourteen Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
of the Regiments of
Guards, where Marſhall <hi>Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi>
their Colonel was preſent,
as ſick as he was, as he had been
before at <hi>Tournay:</hi> The Guards
began their works as they had
deſign'd to attaque the <hi>Ravelin</hi>
before the Gate towards the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage
of <hi>Eſquierchin,</hi> and the
Regiments of <hi>Picardy;</hi> and the
Kings on the other ſide began
theirs towards the half Moon
that looks towards <hi>Quinchy.</hi>
There happened nothing ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
in theſe attaques, ſaving
that the Trenches being very
large and deep they raiſed a
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:54819:41"/>
battery the ſame night of ten
peices of Canon betwixt the
works, which was in condition
to play by four a clock in the
morning. <hi>Le Renché</hi> a Captain
was wounded here, but very
ſlightly, and ſcarce one man
loſt. The fourth at night the
<hi>French</hi> Guards were relieved by
the <hi>Swiſs</hi> Guards, that is to ſay,
by ſeven Companies of them, and
the Count of <hi>Soiſſons,</hi> (Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
of all the <hi>Swiſs</hi> in the
<hi>French</hi> ſervice) at the head of
them: They entered the Trenches
about ſeven at night, expoſed to
all the Canon of the Town,
which was a great number, and
perhaps as well planted as ever
any were. The King viſiting
the Trenches approved very
much what they had done;
but he had much more reaſon
to commend them the next day,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:54819:42"/>
when he underſtood, that the 400
paces of Ground remaining be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the head of their Trenches
and the Ditch of the Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcarp
was ſecured by the works
they had thrown up that night,
and that all the Trenches were
in a good condition by ſix a
clock in the morning. Nor was
this all, the Marquis <hi>d' Humieres,</hi>
Lieutenant General, that da<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
having propoſed to the <hi>Comte de
Soiſſons,</hi> to attempt the ditch,
to ſound it, and throw in ſome
Faggots, in order to their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
the next night. The
<hi>Swiſſes</hi> animated by the example
of their General, who was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
all the while, would ſhew
no wearineſs for what was paſt,
but having begun a mine by eight
in the morning, they peirc't
their ditch by noon; though
they had neither plancks, nor
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:54819:42"/>
blinds, nor any thing neceſſary in
ſuch an Enterpriſe.</p>
            <p>There were two Officers that
Commanded in the Trenches,
one was <hi>Aſpremont,</hi> a Captain in
the Regiment of Guards, who
mannaged all the works, and
expreſt himſelf in that a man of
more then ordinary underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
the other was S. <hi>Fere,</hi> a
Captain of Horſe, who had put
himſelf then amongſt the Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers
that accompanied the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
<hi>de Humieres.</hi> Theſe two
Officers, deſiring to ſignallize
themſelves by ſome action ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary,
propoſed to the
Commanders in the Trench to
ſwim over the ditch, and lodge
themſelves on the other ſide, as
well to render the ſtructure of
the Bridge the more eaſie, as to
make it the more formidable
when it ſhould be done, and by
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:54819:43"/>
the boldneſs of the enterpriſe
to frighten the Enemy perhaps
from the point of their work;
their propoſal was applauded,
though contrary to the rules of
ſo great a ſiege: And having
choſen a certain number of ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deirs
that could ſwim, they ſtript
themſelves upon the <hi>Spott,</hi> and
S. <hi>Fere</hi> with ſeven <hi>Swiſſes</hi> only,
without other Arms then their
Pickaxes and ſhovells, ſwam
over the ditch, and placing
themſelves on the other ſide,
they fell to their work to ſhelter
themſelves as well as they could;
but S. <hi>Fere</hi> having the curioſity
to ſtand right up and peep over
their blind, received a ſhot from
a Muſquet in his body, and dyed
within a quarter of a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> houre.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aſpremont</hi> in the mean time
was with ſome of his Voluntiers
and <hi>Swiſſes</hi> in the ditch labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:54819:43"/>
to fill it up as much as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible:
and of the ſeven that
ſwam over, one of them only was
killed, the other ſix made their
work defenſible; and the Bridge
being by five in the morning
ſo finiſht that they might paſs
over dry, they ſent over from
the other ſide a Sergeant with
twelve Souldiers well arm'd to
make good what their ſix com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rades
had thrown up.</p>
            <p>All this affaire, both in the
night and day, coſt about
40 Souldiers, and two Officers
ſlain or wounded; but amongſt
the Voluntiers there were ſeveral
perſons of quality ill handled;
the Marquis <hi>de Noiſy Maupeou</hi>
was wounded that night by a
Muſquet ſhot in his head, of
which he recovered, though it
was judg'd mortall at the firſt:
The <hi>Comte du Broutay,</hi> ſometimes
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:54819:44"/>
Camp-maſter to the Regiment
of <hi>Navarre,</hi> received a ſhot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Arm-pit, and died a few
days after. The Marquis <hi>de Termes</hi>
was wounded in the thigh, the
<hi>Comte de Combourg</hi> on his foot,
<hi>Monmont</hi> in the ſhoulder, and a
little before the Trench was
raiſed the <hi>Comte de Blin,</hi> receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a ſhot with a facileon bullet
on the top of his arme which
brake the bone ſo as it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
he would dye of it, as he
did in the concluſion. There
was ſeveral others wounded
with their Canon, but the Prince
<hi>d' Eſpinoy,</hi> who was ſhot in the
Arme, and <hi>Briſſac</hi> a Lieutenant
in the Guards, are all I can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member.</p>
            <p>As to the approaches of the
Regiments, <hi>Picardy</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
by the Regiment of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vergne;</hi>
but not being there I
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:54819:44"/>
can give no further relation then
that <hi>Vauban,</hi> Captain in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment
of <hi>Picardy,</hi> that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
in that work, received
a Muſquet ſhot in his face. For
the ſame reaſon I ſhall paſs by
what was done on the <hi>Comte de
Duras</hi> his ſide, having heard
no more, then that being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>campt
with his Forces on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide of the Town towards
<hi>Cambray</hi> and <hi>Valecienne,</hi> and
deſirous that his Forces alſo
ſhould have their ſhare in
the honour, he beg'd of the
King that he might make his
effort on his ſide alſo; whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
having drawn up the
Regiment <hi>du Saut</hi> on the
fourth at night, and having
found no great reſiſtance, with
no great difficulty he lodged
himſelf the ſame night on the
Counterſcarp: Inſomuch as the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:54819:45"/>
Enemies ſeeing themſelves over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laid
on every ſide, and perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
otherwiſe by the reaſons of
the <hi>Comte de Gramont,</hi> whom
the King had ſent to ſummon
them, they demanded a parly,
and obtained a ceſſation of
Arms that very fifth at night,
at leaſt on the Guards ſide; for
on the ſide the Regiments of
<hi>Lyonnois</hi> and <hi>Louvigny</hi> were on,
who were apparently ignorant
of the Truce, they paſt the two
ditches, and lodged themſelves
upon the half-moon, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to no great purpoſe, the
Hoſtages being given before.</p>
            <p>All the reſt of the night was
ſpent in making their termes,
which were, that all the Souldiers
conſiſting of about 300 Foot,
pittifull fellowes, and ill provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
with three Troops of Horſe
of about 120. ſhould march out
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:54819:45"/>
with their Armes and Baggage,
but no Canon; which was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
the ſeventh,
of the ſame month,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Daway</hi> tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en.</note>
and they conducted
to <hi>Valencienne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Scarp Fort was attempted
diſtinctly by the Count <hi>de Lille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonne,</hi>
and ſome other Troops
Commanded by <hi>le Bret,</hi> Marſhal
<hi>de Camp,</hi> to whom the King
had given the Charge of that
affaire. They opened their
Trenches, on the fourth at
night, by the Regiment of <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagne,</hi>
which having began its
approaches along the Marſh, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
them on within twenty pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of their Counterſcarp, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the loſs almoſt of one man.
The next day this Regiment was
relieved by the Regiment of
<hi>Caſtelnau,</hi> who obſerving the
ſmall reſiſtance that was made,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:54819:46"/>
paſt over the ditch before the
Counterſcarp, and in two ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
places lodged themſelves at
the very foot of the Palliſadoes
of their Falſe-Bray, and forc't the
Enemy to leave their main Guards
and in ſhort all their out Guards;
inſomuch as they beat a parley,
and their Articles being made,
they marcht-out with their Arms
and Colours, but not Canon,
and were conducted to <hi>Valenci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enne;</hi>
So that <hi>Doway,</hi>
which never durſt,<note place="margin">The Scarp Fort taken.</note>
for the ſpace of five
and twenty years after the gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſeveral Battels, be attempted,
was taken in three dayes, and its

by reaſon of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>es with which they
could drowned all about both
the Fort and the Town: The

               </gap> taking it: and
gave him eight Companies of the
<hi>French</hi> Guards, and ſix of <hi>Swiſſes,</hi>
Commanded by <hi>Sury,</hi> Captain of
that body, but no Horſe, in reſpect
that all his Family, &amp; the moſt part
of the Equipage of the Court were
then at a diſtance, whilſt the
King who was then departing
for <hi>Compiegne</hi> began his journey.</p>
            <p>But the reaſon why the King
left the Army at that time, is
not yet come to my ears; all that
I can ſay is that there were ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
marcht off with him that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
thought it neceſſary to come
back.</p>
            <p>All this while the Marſhal
<hi>d' Aumonts</hi> Army was at <hi>Armen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieres,</hi>
where to prevent idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
they had began to repair
the old works. But judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſmall Garriſon left
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:54819:47"/>
there would be in no great ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity,
the Marſhall removed
from thence, and brought his
Troops nearer <hi>Lille,</hi> encamping
about <hi>Hautbourdin,</hi> ſome two
leagues from the Town, to the
end he might block up that Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
that made its conſtant ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions
either upon our Convoy,
or to the very Gates of <hi>Tournay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But for the father incommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
of this great Town they
put fire to all the Windmills that
were near it, which amounted
to near 50 or 60, which could
not be performed without ſome

            <p>The <hi>9th</hi> of this moneth the

Voluntier called <hi>Breton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celles</hi>

But this party were near doing

then their own Servants,

            <p>I forget to mention how the

reſolved the Marſhal <hi>de Aumonts</hi>
Army, that had done nothing
theſe two ſieges, ſhould be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
upon ſome place or other

A while after we underſtood

recrutes towards <hi>Courtray,</hi>

the Garriſon was very

            <p>At this time alſo the Marſhal
<hi>Turenne</hi> drew out five Brigades

for ſureneſs ſake to the rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement

draw into a body, and conſtrain
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:54819:50"/>
our Army to march to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief

had already put in what force
they were able: the Barron of
<hi>Limbec,</hi> with 300 Horſe having
conducted ſome Foot in the <hi>13th</hi>
of that moneth, which was the
day before our Troops were ſet
down before it.</p>
            <p>But as he was making his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
the Marquis of <hi>Bellefons</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
got newes of his march, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues
and overtakes him in a
Town, as he was refreſhing ſome
four or five leagues off: it fell
out very luckily for the Enemy,
for the Town had Barriers, and
could not eaſily be entred,
whereby they having opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to get to Horſe, and ſome of
them having got to a Bridge,
we muſt of neceſſity paſs into the
Town; they repelled the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
of our Troops, and after a

ſhort diſpute retired towards
<hi>Gaunt,</hi> without any conſiderable

            <p>
               <hi>Courtray</hi> being beſieged in

the Regiment of <hi>Campagne,</hi> had
the honour of the firſt attaque, as

the Regiment of <hi>Navarre;</hi> but
theſe Troops, and the other
on the other ſide, meeting no
no great reſiſtance
from the Town,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Courtray</hi> tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en.</note> they
took the out-works
the firſt night, and the next day
the Townſmen treated and
yeilded. The Souldiers retreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into the Cittadel, where on
the <hi>17th</hi> they were beſieged al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo;
on which day we threw up
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:54819:51"/>
two works, one in the Plain
on the ſide the Town lyes, and
the other on the other ſide.
But notwithſtanding this Citta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del
was in a good condition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and indifferently well provided
with men, it defended it ſelf
not much longer then the Town,
for the next day it ſurrendred,
and 400 or 500 men that were
in it, were ſent down the River
to <hi>Gaunt,</hi> according to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
in Boats.</p>
            <p>About this time the King was
returned from <hi>Campiegne,</hi> and
the Queen with him, whom his
Majeſty had a deſire ſhould have
a ſight of his Conqueſts: and
to let her underſtand, that as he
had undertaken her intereſt, ſo
he was able to do her reaſon by
by force of Arms, when the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractableneſs
of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi>
could not be brought to it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways.
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:54819:51"/>
Perhaps alſo he would have
his new ſubjects ſee a Princeſs of
the houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> who coming
in perſon to demand her Rights,
become one with his Majeſty
now by her Marriage, might
take away their regret at the
changing the Government, and
leave them without juſt reaſon
of complaint.</p>
            <p>She was brought at firſt to
<hi>Doway,</hi> where ſhe was received
with all poſſible acclamations;
which made him deſirous ſhe
ſhould ſee <hi>Tournay</hi> alſo, as well
to prevent any exception that
Town might take, for having
been leſs conſidered then <hi>Doway,</hi>
as alſo to demonſtrate to all the
world, that he was abſolute
Maſter of the Field; neither
the Queen, nor any of her Train,
having received the leaſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larme,
nor heard one Gun goe
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:54819:52"/>
off in all their march. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they paſt in the ſight of
<hi>Lille,</hi> and very near the Iſle of
S. <hi>Amont,</hi> which was certainly
the Enemies, they ſent away
the Court Harbingers on the
<hi>25th</hi> to take up lodgings for
the King and Queen the next
day at <hi>Tournay;</hi> but the way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
long, from one place to the
other, and very incommodious
for an Army to paſs, eſpecially
with ſo great a Train, all the
Court came that night to the
Camp at <hi>Cautice,</hi> ſome two
leagues higher then the Road
they ſhould have come: What
paſt that night being no matter
of War, is not to be expected
in this journall, nor to be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by a perſon ſo little acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with the affairs of the
Court. I ſhall only ſay this,
that all they that had houſes in
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:54819:52"/>
the Kings Quarters, made tender
of them to the Ladies: The King
and the Queen making choiſe
of no other then the lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
belonging to the <hi>Vicomte Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next morning by 10 of
the clock, they arrived at <hi>Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay,</hi>
where the people gave all
the expreſſions of joy imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable:
Two days they paſt there
without any thoughts, but of
their divertiſment, after which
the Queen returned to <hi>Doüay,</hi>
in her way to <hi>Arras,</hi> where ſhe
was to attend the Kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
back, who was then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
further againſt his
Enemies, with deſign of inlarging
his Conqueſts.</p>
            <p>He conducted her two Leagues
himſelf, and having taken his
leave, and returning to the Camp
with <hi>Rochefort's</hi> Brigade only, and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:54819:53"/>
ſome Voluntiers, he diſcerned a
great duſt, and hearing of Guns
go off, he ſent out, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
it was a great body of the
Enemy fallen upon the Guards
on that ſide next to <hi>Lille,</hi> with a
deſign to beat them off.</p>
            <p>There was a Squadron of the
Kings <hi>Gens-d'armes</hi> upon the
Guard that day, Commanded by
the Prince <hi>de Soubize,</hi> Captain
Lieutenant to that Company;
he had one of his out-Guards al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
ſurprized by the Enemy,
who counterfeiting themſelves
<hi>Lorrainers,</hi> came on crying out
<hi>Vive Turenne,</hi> and at the firſt
daſh kill'd three or four of the
Guards, but the reſt having diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
the cheat, engag'd them
very ſtoutly, though they were
much inferiour in number. The
Enemy was reinforc't with four
other Troops, which advanc't a
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:54819:53"/>
full trot towards the Squadron
of the Guards, and they having
taken the alarme were marching
towards the relief of their own,
inſomuch that there was only a
hollow way betwixt the Enemy
and us. When the Voluntiers
that were about the King came
in, and his Majeſty alſo with his
Troops being at hand, and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a great duſt, they perceived
it, and ran immediatly without
order, or reſiſtance, and were
purſued in the very ſight of
<hi>Lille.</hi> The Duke <hi>d' Enguin</hi>
was one of the firſt that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them, and made it appear
at this, as well as at all other
times, that courage was no leſs
natural to him, then to the
Prince of <hi>Condy,</hi> his Father;
they were ſo cloſe purſued that
of 200 Horſe Commanded by
<hi>Maciet,</hi> a man of great reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:54819:54"/>
amongſt them, he had much
adoe to bring half off, the reſt
being kill'd or taken.</p>
            <p>The next day being the
<hi>28th</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> the Army roſe
from about <hi>Tournay;</hi> and paſſing
the <hi>Sceld,</hi> about half a league
above, they encampt at <hi>Herines,</hi>
and the next day at <hi>Luperken,</hi> a
Village not far from <hi>Oudenard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This town which the <hi>Sceld</hi>
runs thorow was already blockt
up on one ſide by the <hi>Comte de
Lillebonne,</hi> and his <hi>Lorrainers;</hi>
and on the other, by the Forces
commanded by <hi>Bellefons</hi> and
<hi>Peguilin,</hi> who had not as yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
themſelves with the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of the Army, ſince they were
drawn out from <hi>Courtray;</hi> they
would that night have opened
their Trenches on both ſides, but
they did it only on <hi>Bellefons</hi> ſide;
for the <hi>Lorrain</hi> Foot, though
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:54819:54"/>
they were further advanc't, were
judged not numerous enough,
nor well enough arm'd to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
upon a place that ſet ſo
good a countenance upon the
buſineſs, and appeared outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſo well fortified, for within it
was no great matter. They let
them alone therefore till their
next day, and for that night im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
no other then the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of <hi>Campagne,</hi> and <hi>Caſtel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nau,</hi>
who having opened the
Trenches by the <hi>Fauxbourg</hi> that
goes towards <hi>Courtray,</hi> they
carried the Counterſcarp at firſt,
and fell a filling the ditch, leaving
a half moon on their left, that the
Enemy had deſerted. The day
after, about ten a clock, the King
planted good ſtore of Cannon, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
an Eminence about a Muſquet
ſhot from the Town, that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
all the outworks on that
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:54819:55"/>
ſide that is towards <hi>Brabant,</hi>
which Battery, with ſome of the
Field-peices, they carry at the
head of their Battalions, firing
continually; all day long the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
durſt not ſhew themſelves,
but apprehending they ſhould be
ſtormed and carried by force
the next night, they beat a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
about four in the afternoon,
and yeilded upon
conditions,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Oudenarde</hi> taken.</note> that all the
Souldiers ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Priſoners of War: there
was in the Town about four or
five hundred Foot, but no Horſe.</p>
            <p>This Conqueſt coſt very
few men, and we took in leſs
then four and twenty hours a
place that <hi>Strada</hi> makes a great
noiſe of in his Hiſtory of the
<hi>Low Countries,</hi> and magnifies
the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for having conquered it in two
moneths.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:54819:55"/>
There was but one Officer
wounded in the Regiments that
fell on, &amp; but very few Souldiers;
there was alſo on the Kings ſide,
one Voluntier wounded, and
that with a Faulcon ſhot in the
calf of his legg, and two other
ſhots with a Muſquet, as he was
advancing too near the ſuburbs
to ſurvey their works, he was
called <hi>Royecourt,</hi> and had had
conſiderable employments in the
War of <hi>Piedmont</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> in the
time of the Regency of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
Royal the Dutcheſs of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Town being taken, though
attach't by the by, the Army
marcht the next day being the
<hi>12th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt</hi> towards <hi>Aloſt;</hi>
The Count of <hi>Duras</hi> was drawn
out that night with five Brigades
of Horſe, and 1500 Muſquetiers,
to poſſeſs himſelf of ſome poſt
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:54819:56"/>
betwixt <hi>Bruſſels</hi> and <hi>Dendremond,</hi>
ſo as to be able to give alarme
and jealouſie to both: As he paſt
by he ſummons <hi>Aloſt,</hi> and had it
ſurrendred after ſome few Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyes,
there being in
the Town not above
thirty Horſe left,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Aloſt</hi> taken<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> rather for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
of our motion, then
defence.</p>
            <p>In this party there marcht ſo
great a number of Voluntiers,
they made up ſome diſtinct
Troops, and would needs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
ſome enterprize by
themſelves; the deſign was to
march up betwixt <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> and
<hi>Viluord,</hi> and to ſurpriſe, if they
could, one of the paſſage Boats
that goes daily up and down that
Cutt betwixt the two Towns:
but whether it was that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
was ill laid down at firſt,
or whether amongſt ſuch a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:54819:56"/>
medly of people, there
was not that obedience or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
that was requiſit, &amp; they
had not the ſucceſs was expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
From other places alſo there
were ſeveral parties Commanded
out; and ſo ſtrangely had the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
of engaging their Enemies
ſeiſed upon their ſpirits, that
one of the Troops commanded
by <hi>Chazeron,</hi> Lieutenant of the
the Guards <hi>de Corps,</hi> fell foul
upon another of our Troops,
and by a generous refractorineſs
refuſing to tell who they were
for, fell on, and found not they
were Friends till <hi>Royer Dubreüil</hi>
Captain of the Colonels Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was ſlain.</p>
            <p>The <hi>13th</hi> the Army encamp't
at <hi>Hochſtrate,</hi> a Village betwixt
<hi>Alost</hi> and <hi>Dendremond,</hi> from
whence <hi>Truel,</hi> a perſon of great
underſtanding in thoſe affairs,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:54819:57"/>
was diſpatcht to diſcover the
ſituation of <hi>Dendremond,</hi> and to
informe whether it might not be
blockt up by a line, or whether
the waters which they kept with
their ſluces being let looſe
would not make a great inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Truel</hi> reports they might lodge
themſelves well enough, and on
the Fourteenth the King gave
order the Wherries that went
along to the Artillary, ſhould
march to make a Bridge over the
<hi>Sceld,</hi> and made all the other
Boats he found in <hi>Aloſt</hi> to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
down the <hi>Dendre,</hi> to make
another over that. The next
day being the fifteenth the
Bridge over the <hi>Sceld</hi> was finiſh't,
at a Villedge called <hi>Apels,</hi> ſome
half a League above <hi>Dendre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi>
on that ſide the way lyes
from <hi>Gaunt;</hi> but having imployed
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:54819:57"/>
all their twenty Wherries about
that Bridge, and finding no more
to make another on the other ſide
towards <hi>Anwerp,</hi> where the
<hi>Sceld</hi> was much broader and the
Tide came up higher, they were
conſtrained to leave them that
way free for ſupplyes. In the
mean time the Marquis of <hi>Belli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fons</hi>
advanc't with five brigades
of Horſe, and four Regiments
of Foot marcht over the Bridge
that was made, to poſſeſs the other
ſide of the River, who finding an
incloſed Country, they might
eaſily block it up cloſe, and put
themſelves into a condition to
prevent any ſuccours going in by
Land on that ſide.</p>
            <p>The King took up his quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
at the Town of <hi>Apels</hi> afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid,
which was very near the
Bridge, and lay with the forces
he had with him all the ſpace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:54819:58"/>
the <hi>Sceld,</hi> and the Bridge
he had now made over the <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre.</hi>
The Count of <hi>Duras</hi> with
his Squadron, and the Count of
<hi>Lillebonne,</hi> with his <hi>Lorrainers,</hi>
took up all the ground betwixt
the <hi>Dendre</hi> and the <hi>Sceld,</hi> on that
ſide next <hi>Bruſſels</hi> and <hi>Viluorde;</hi>
their Poſts being thus taken, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
body concluded, they
would fall on, but there were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
conſiderations altered
their reſolutions.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who were for the ſiege
pretended the place was weak,
the fortifications decayed, and
in an ill condition, that there
was not above eight or nine
hundred men in the Town, and
thoſe ſhatter'd and inſufficient
to reſiſt ſuch an Army as ours,
eſpecially as it was then animated
by the preſence of the King; that
the waters they made ſuch a noiſe
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:54819:58"/>
with, might be eaſily diverted
by cutting the banks of the <hi>Sceld,</hi>
which dam'd up the waters of
the <hi>Dendre,</hi> and were made on
purpoſe to carry that River near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
the Town, which otherwiſe
would naturally have fallen into
the <hi>Sceld,</hi> about a Muſquet ſhot
above that place. And indeed,
<hi>Truel</hi> had already made two
cuts in this bank, and had begun
a third, with confidence (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the opinion of the
Watermen of <hi>Aloſt,</hi> and <hi>Dendre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi>
that were in our Camp)
in four or five dayes time, to
have turn'd the River ſo as they
might in two ſeveral places have
fallen upon the Town, and
have eaſily carried it, by reaſon of
the weakneſs of the defence that
was to be made.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who were for the r<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the ſiege alledged on the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:54819:59"/>
other ſide that that draining or
diverting the River was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
by reaſon the ſluces in the
Town were intire, and the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the banks of the <hi>Sceld</hi>
would but increaſe the inundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
by letting in the waters of the
Sea, which in that place was
twice in four and twenty hours
above ſix foot high; In ſo much
as they ſhould never be able to
make any works but what would
be wet, if not overflown twice
every day. Beſides the <hi>Sceld</hi>
being open below the Town, and
we having beſides the Bridge we
had made, neither Staccads, nor
Trees, nor Chaines, nor any thing
to hinder them, the Enemy might
when he pleaſed break the
Bridge; for it was obvious that
with the leaſt favourable wind,
and the aſſiſtance of the Tide,
they might come from <hi>Anwerp</hi>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:54819:59"/>
in four hours with many Veſſels
as they thought fit, and beating
down what we had raiſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt,
put what ſupplyes they
thought neceſſary into the
Town; and moreover, the Town
had been reinforc't with men and
all other neceſſaries for a long
defence, <hi>Louvigny,</hi> a perſon of
great eſteem in the <hi>Low Countries,</hi>
having had opportunity to put
himſelf in with what Troops he
had pleaſed: and laſtly, that if
all things could be managed as
was propoſed, they had no more
to doe then to encamp theſmelves
at <hi>Nienove,</hi> and in four dayes
they would be able to ſtarve
our Army, bread being already
grown ſcarce in ſpight of all the
care the Commiſſaries could
take that were imployed by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
from the Intendant <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>olbert.</hi>
This adviſe was aſſerted by ſo
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:54819:60"/>
many, and their arguments ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
ſo probable, the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves
to quit that Leaguer that
was like to be difficult, for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
no leſs honourable, nor
perhaps of leſs conſequence.</p>
            <p>During the two dayes we
were before this Town there
was ſcarce any thing conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
paſt: the Enemy ſhot many
great Guns amongſt us, but with
little execution; I beleive there
was not above 12 or 15 men ſlain, of
which the moſt eminent was one
Mr. <hi>Villars,</hi> a voluntier under the
Marquis <hi>de la Valliere</hi> Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of the Dolphins light Horſe.
There was alſo a little <hi>Rancontre,</hi>
betwixt the Horſe on the other
ſide of the <hi>Sceld,</hi> before the
Bridge was finiſht, for the King
having ſent 50 of his Guards
over in one of the Wherries de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd
for the bridge, under the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:54819:60"/>
Command of <hi>Lanſſon,</hi> one of the
Lieutenants of the four Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies,
the Cavaliers putting their
Horſes (unſadled) thorow the
water made them ſwim to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide, where as ſoon as they
had ſadled them again, they
mounted, &amp; marcht along a Dike
(all covered with Trees) towards
<hi>Dendremond:</hi> in a ſtreight way they
encountred about 150 of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
whom at firſt daſh they beat
back to their reſerves, who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
put a ſtop to our carrier,
and ſent our forlorne back with
the ſame ſpeed; but <hi>Lanſſon</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on, charges them again,
however the Enemy received it
ſo well there was but few either
kill'd or taken: we loſt alſo
ſome few Cavalliers, and had
ſome of our Voluntiers wounded,
and amongſt the reſt, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
of <hi>Courcelles,</hi> Lieutenant of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:54819:61"/>
the Artillery, and the ſame <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zel</hi>
I have mentioned before:
after which the night approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they parted, and the Bridge
being finiſht, the next morning
we heard no more of them.</p>
            <p>Two dayes after the Marquis
<hi>de Bellefons</hi> having paſt his
Troops over the ſame Bridge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
brake it down, and the Army
diſcamp't from before the Town.</p>
            <p>Some there were that reported
that ſeveral of our Army, and in
particular of thoſe under the
Command of the Marquis <hi>de Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefons,</hi>
being ſtragled for plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
into the Country of the <hi>Vàes,</hi>
came ſhort home; for expecting
to paſs at the Bridge, and finding
it broke down, they could not
get over, and that above 2000 of
them fell into the Enemies hands;
but this was otherwiſe, for it was
certain there was not two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
loſt there in all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:54819:61"/>
The Army being thus riſen
from <hi>Dendremond,</hi> the Marquis
of <hi>Humieres,</hi> with four Brigades
of Horſe, had orders to go and
inveſt <hi>Lille,</hi> that they had been a
long time bartering for; the
Marſhall <hi>d' Aumont</hi> ever ſince and
before the ſiege of <hi>Courtray,</hi>
having never lain above two or
three Leagues from it, ready to
attaque them whenever the
Enemy ſhould draw away their
Troops.</p>
            <p>This was a buſineſs of no ſmall
importance; it was well known
there was a very ſtrong Garriſon
in it, eſpecially of Horſe, all priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
agreeing there was above
1200 of them, and 3000 Foot: but
whether it was that the <hi>Vicomte</hi>
of <hi>Turrenne</hi> adviſed him to't, or
that his Majeſty was weary of
Conqueſt with eaſe, all could not
hinder him but that in four
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:54819:62"/>
dayes March the whole Army
took up their quarters before
the Town.</p>
            <p>At his arrival the King quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at the Village of <hi>Eſguermes,</hi>
but the next day, by reaſon the
Cannon from the Town incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moded
his lodging, he removed
to the Village of <hi>Laos</hi> upon the
River <hi>Deulle,</hi> with his Troops,
taking up all betwixt <hi>Laos</hi> as
far as <hi>Heleſme,</hi> where the
Marquis of <hi>Humieres</hi> had tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
up his. Next the <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rainers,</hi>
took their quarters to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the River of <hi>Marque;</hi>
and next them the Marquis of
<hi>Bellefons</hi> with his Troops lay
from the <hi>Lorrainers</hi> to the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>Deulle,</hi> towards the Abby of
<hi>Marquet:</hi> And laſt of all the
Count of <hi>Duras</hi> took his poſt on
the other ſide of the River,
whoſe Camp reacht to the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage

            <p>Things being thus diſpoſed,
the eleventh at night, about nine
a clock all the Army ſtood to
their armes, &amp; every Troop hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

800 paces towards the Town,
where to ſecure their Camp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Sallyes of the Enemy
out of the Town (which is one
of the biggeſt in the <hi>Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,</hi>
and without compariſon
moſt populous of any in ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> for they
were reported to be 20000 men
bearing arms in the Town, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the Garriſon) they began
to entrench: but this was
not finiſht the firſt night, but
within two nights after was
ſo compleat they planted thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:54819:63"/>
ſmall Field-peices upon
them, to ſecure the line, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain
the beſieged from ſallying,
which they had no mind to at
all; for without any interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to our work they contented
themſelves with firing their
great Guns into our Camp, and
eſpecially into the Kings quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
where they ſaw moſt peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>The ſiege then being of great
importance, on which ſide ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it is conſidered, the King to
put himſelf into a condition of
compaſſing his deſignes, and to
furniſh himſelf with all manner
of proviſions, before he opened
his trenches, Commands in all
the country about to aſſiſt in
his <hi>Line.</hi> Severall Convoys are
ſent to <hi>Arras, Bethune, Tournay,</hi>
and <hi>Doway,</hi> for Canon, Powder,
Bullets and match; in ſhort, all
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:54819:63"/>
things were ordered to be had
that were neceſſary in ſo great a
ſiege.</p>
            <p>About this time it was the
King underſtood the Queens
diſcompoſure for his abſence,
and the indiſpoſition of the <hi>Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin.</hi>
However he concealed the
trouble he had for that as well
as other misfortunes he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
at the beginning of this
ſiege; there it was he heard the
Prince of <hi>Ligne</hi> had fallen upon
300 Horſe of the Garriſons of
<hi>Charleroy,</hi> and <hi>Phillippeville,</hi> had
routed them and taken the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
of <hi>Vaubrun-nogent,</hi> who
Commanded the party Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
with moſt of his Officers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
what were left upon the
place: there it was he had notice
that the Garriſon of <hi>Cambray,</hi>
&amp; <hi>Valencien</hi> to give him ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
had been abroad, &amp; had
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:54819:64"/>
Plundred and burnt <hi>Riblemont
Marle,</hi> &amp; other conſiderable Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes

<hi>Marſin</hi> was marching to <hi>Ipre<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
to give him interruption both in

               </gap>
Enemy appeared about <hi>Oudenard</hi>
and it was to be feared they
might recover that place with
as much eaſe as we had taken it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
for which reaſon <hi>Beauveze</hi> was
Commanded out with a party
of Horſe to diſcover, who found
it nothing, and gave the King
notice the Enemy had drawn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
at <hi>Aloſt,</hi> but were retired
to <hi>Dendremond</hi> with out leaving
any Garriſon there. Beſides all
theſe, the King was troubled af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
four or five dayes with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
pain in his teeth which
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:54819:64"/>
could by no means be leſſened
whilſt he continued at his lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at <hi>Bioüvac,</hi> where he lay e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
night expoſed to all the
miſts and fogs, that were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
occaſioned by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
heat of that ſeaſon.
Notwithſtanding all which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities
he muſt of neceſſity at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the conſervation of what he
had gained, which nothing but
ſo brave a Perſon as he could
have done: to that end he gave
all Orders himſelf daily, and
(without any other regulation
of the controverſie betwixt the
Marſhal General of the Camp,
and the other Marſhals of <hi>France,</hi>
touching priority of Command)
he ſends away the Marſhal <hi>d' Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi>
with the reſidue of his
Forces to encamp about <hi>Tournay:</hi>
His Army was then but ſmall, he
having drawn out two Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:54819:65"/>
of Foot to the Leaguer at
<hi>Lille,</hi> that is to ſay, the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>du Pleſſis,</hi> and a Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Harcourt;</hi> in exchange of
which he only ſent them the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment
of <hi>Alſatia,</hi> which the <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagne</hi>
had exceedingly weakned,
moſt of the <hi>Germans</hi> (of which
it conſiſted) being either ſick
or run from their colours, as moſt
of the new Regiments that come
from that Nation into the <hi>French</hi>
ſervice do; beſides the <hi>Comte de
Lorges,</hi> Marſhal to that Army of
<hi>de Aumonts,</hi> had drawn out a
thouſand Horſe for the viſiting
of <hi>Lille,</hi> and was not returned;
the King having Commanded
his Troops for the ſecuring of
the River <hi>Lis,</hi> as alſo <hi>Varneton,
Comene,</hi> and <hi>Menene,</hi> leaſt by
that way the enemy ſhould
attempt to put relief into the
Town, inſomuch as the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:54819:65"/>
had not above four or five
hundred Horſe left with him.
There were four Companies of
the <hi>French</hi> Guards, and three
<hi>Swiſs</hi> Companies in the Garriſon
drawn out of <hi>Tournay,</hi> ſo as the
charge of that Town lay upon his
Foot; beſides that he was to have
an eye upon <hi>Ath,</hi> to ſecure the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
over the <hi>Sceld,</hi> and the <hi>Scarp,</hi>
as alſo <hi>Mortaigne,</hi> S. <hi>Amand,</hi>
and <hi>Marchienne,</hi> whither he was
was fain to ſend ſeveral of his
Army: In ſhort, it lay almoſt
wholly upon him to defend all
that was at any diſtance, and to
look to the ſecurity of the <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagnia;</hi>
the Marquis of <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quy</hi>
not being yet come up with
his Troops out of <hi>Luxemburg,</hi>
where he had been imployed all
this while.</p>
            <p>But to returne to the ſiege of
<hi>Lille;</hi> the King Commanded that
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:54819:66"/>
all the while betwixt the tenth
and the eighteenth, ſhould be
ſpent in fortifying their Leaguer,
both againſt the Town, and
without, and in furniſhing the
Camp with all Proviſions, both of
Victuals, and Ammunition, they
ſhould have need of. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
of <hi>Louvoy,</hi> a perſon of great
activity, had the care of all, and
in particular, of the Artillery, in
which he took great pains that
nothing might be wanting; for
in this ſiege the King was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to uſe all his Force, as if his
reputation all over <hi>Europe</hi> had
been at ſtake this bout; all
that he had done hitherto hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
been an effect rather of the
terror of his Armes, then any
real experiment of his ſtrength.
Moreover, in all Armies (but
eſpecially where there be many
Courtiers, as there was alwayes
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:54819:66"/>
about his Majeſty) there wants
not ſuch as will never approve
any Councels, of which they
have no part themſelves, and
who conſtantly decry all enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes
that appear doubtfull,
as this of <hi>Lille</hi> did, to the end
that if it miſcarried, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of their judgments might
appear, or at leaſt they might for
a while leſſen the reputation of
him that had the charge. And of
this ſort there are many, who by
the miſchief they doe that
way, redouble the care that
is neceſſary to the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>The King all this while ſpared
no pains, no watchings, no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,
no not ſo much as his
own perſon, conſidering no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
on this occaſion but
his own courage, and what
might contribute to the aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:54819:67"/>
of his glory.</p>
            <p>One of theſe nights which
the King paſt at <hi>Biouac,</hi> or moſt
commonly at the quarters of
the Light Horſe belonging to the
<hi>Dauphin,</hi> where to repoſe himſelf
he would goe ſomtimes into the
Tent of the Marquis <hi>de Valliere,</hi>
there happened a fire in his lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which burnt it almoſt quite
down, though by thy care of
thoſe that were there, the loſs
was not conſiderable.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Vicompte Turenne</hi> on his
ſide was on Horſeback night and
day, and forgot nothing he had
learn't by his long experience,
as conſidering well that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
ſhould befall muſt contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
either to his honour or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution.</p>
            <p>All things diſpoſed to the beſt
advantage according to the
ſhortneſs of the time, the eight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:54819:67"/>
at night the Trenches
were opened, and they fell on o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
that ſide that was next the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage
of <hi>Heleſme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this approach the opinions
of <hi>Aſpremont</hi> (who this <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pania</hi>
was chief Ingineer) and
<hi>Vauban,</hi> a perſon of great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
in matters of Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guer,
over-rul'd: Others there
were would have the attaque
made at the <hi>Porte de Malades,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
all the priſoners that were
taken, and all the people that
came out daily, reported that
the weakeſt place, and that there
was but three foot water in
the ditch: Others were for
ſtorming on the Suburbs ſide,
becauſe there was but one work,
and newly made, and not yet
in a condition to be defended,
and that being briskly attaqu't
they ſhould come immediatly to
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:54819:68"/>
the Counterſcarp of the Town,
without any further trouble then
at the firſt; moreover, they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
that place was neareſt
the Kings quarters, and under
the ſhelter of his Guns, whereby
they might draw up their releifs
with more convenience with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
reckoning the advantages of
Timber, and other materials for
a ſiege, which they ſhould gain in
that part of the Town. But all
theſe reaſons gave place to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
nor without reaſon, ſeeing
it was but fit they ſhould in ſome
meaſure accommodate to the
judgment of thoſe that were to
have ſo great a ſhare in the action:
beſides, on that ſide next <hi>Heleſme,</hi>
there were but two Baſtions, and
they a great diſtance from one
another, and defenſible only by
their Cannon, becauſe there were
three half moons upon the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:54819:68"/>
ſame line, to ſecure the length of
their Curtain, in the midſt of
which there was a gate in an
old Tower, but ſo weak their
Flankers could give but little de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
            <p>This place therefore being
choſen for the ſtorme on, <hi>Tueſday</hi>
night they opened their Trenches
in two places, about two or
three hundred paces from one
another; the <hi>French</hi> Guards took
the right as was uſual, not but
that they might have choſe their
poſt as they ſaw their advantage,
but judging their ſallyes leſs to
be feared on that ſide having a
Marſh, and a River on that hand,
and that the Enemy not being
able to come at them without
great difficulty they might with
more expedition advance; they
took the right, as I have ſaid,
and began their approaches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:54819:69"/>
the paved way by the
Church of the Priory of <hi>Fere.</hi>
That night they advanc't extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily;
but their Trenches
were ſo bad and ſo narrow by
the miſtake of thoſe that ſet
them out, (or becauſe it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
impoſſible it ſhould be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
in ſo great Leaguers,
the front whereof is of ſo great
extent) that there was ſcarce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
part ſecure.</p>
            <p>The Regiments of <hi>Picardy,</hi>
and <hi>Orleance,</hi> made their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
on the left hand, but
they advanc't not ſo far as the
Guards; yet their works were
very well done, ſuſtaind with
redoubts, and other works, and
all with the loſs of very few
men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> the <hi>19th</hi> the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
made a ſally, but by the
conſequence it appeared only
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:54819:69"/>
for a taſt, and to diſcover how
we lay, for the better pointing
their Artillery, rather then for
any thing elſe; for their Horſe
not being above ſixty, and their
Foot not many more, they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
durſt venture above 100 pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
from their Counterſcarp;
and ſcarce had they ſhown them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
there, but they were beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
back by the Horſe that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
our Trenches, and by
the Foot of the Guards, who
advanc't immediately againſt
them: in their ſally, <hi>Caſtelan,</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor
of that Body, was bruiſed
in the upper part of his
thigh.</p>
            <p>To make good our attaques, five
Squadrons every night releived
one another, at the tayle of our
works, under the Command of a
Brigadier, beſides which they
plac't three more at a little more
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:54819:70"/>
diſtance behind the Line of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvallation,
againſt any preſent
alarme. Moreover, the greateſt
part of the Voluntiers imbracing
the occaſion, got themſelves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
the firſt day of the ſiege
and reſolved to form themſelves
into Squadrons, of which one
was every night to be with the
other Horſe in the Trenches to
doe the ſame ſervice with the
regulated Troops; and to that
end had choſen themſelves Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders,
who were the Cheva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier
<hi>de Rohan, Folleville,</hi> the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
of <hi>Grignan,</hi> and the <hi>Comte
de Maré:</hi> for there was nothing
ſo much apprehended as their
ſallies (had they had the courage
to have made them) and that
becauſe of the Number of the
Horſe were in the Town, which
were known certai<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>y to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
or eight hundred, and good
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:54819:70"/>
Horſe too, beſides that they had
Foot enough by reaſon of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants.</p>
            <p>But theſe apprehenſions laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
but a ſhort time, and in
proceſs of the ſiege we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
that the Count <hi>de Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ay,</hi>
the Governour, finding he
had men enough in his Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to defend a place of that
Latitude and extent as <hi>Lille</hi>
was, diſmounted part of his
Horſe, leaving the other part
ſcarce able to keep Guards
both without and within:
for although he was well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
in the Town, and paſt
amongſt them and the Sould<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ers
for a brave perſon and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enc't,
yet he neglected not to
have an eye over the Townſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
who being always uſed to a
quiet and ſecure life, and to have
no other care then to increaſe
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:54819:71"/>
their eſtates, were amazed to ſee
their houſes come thundring
down with our Granadoes, and
Fireworks, and the Bullets that
came over their works: They
were troubled likewiſe, as was
reported, at the daily contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions,
towards the new Levies,
and at their payments towards
the works and reparations that
were but neceſſary for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of the place; they began
to deliberate alſo, whether if
their Forces that were incamp't
out of the Town were ſet upon,
they had beſt venture out to
their relief; and this perhaps may
be one of the reaſons why the
Order eſtabliſht amongſt the
Voluntieres was but of two
dayes continuance, unleſs you
would rather think that ſo
many <hi>French</hi> Gentlemen dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
both in humour and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:54819:71"/>
quality, were not likely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
long in a mind, or to bring
themſelves to obey one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>At firſt it was not certainly
known whether they had any of
the Army Troops, or not; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it was conſidently believed
they had not above ſix Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of <hi>Spaniards</hi> conſiſting of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
250 men, and almoſt as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>Italians,</hi> one Regiment of
<hi>Walloons</hi> called the Regiment
of <hi>Rache;</hi> and about 400 <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
and <hi>Iriſh;</hi> beſides which they
had almoſt 2000 <hi>Curlius,</hi> for ſo
they call the Militia they had
raiſed in that <hi>Caſtelleny:</hi> But
that which is truth is, they ſhot
hard at our firſt approaching,
and ſo, as in twenty ſieges and
above that I have been at I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
in my whole life ſaw ſuch
fire; which made us at firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:54819:72"/>
the Townſmen alſo were
in Armes, becauſe according to
our conjecture the Souldiers
were not enough to defend the
Town in that manner.</p>
            <p>The <hi>19th</hi> at night fourteen
Companies of the <hi>French</hi> Guards
Commanded by <hi>Dortie,</hi> were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
by eight Companies of the
<hi>Swiſs</hi> Guards with the Count <hi>de
Soiſſons</hi> their General: That
night they advanc't not much,
for the Guards had left their
works in ſo ill a condition, the
<hi>Vicomte Turenne</hi> had given or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
they ſhould by no meanes
go on above 100 or 120 paces,
and Commanded the Pioners
ſhould be imployed in nothing
but repairing the works had
been ſo ill made the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
both by inlarging them,
and making them deeper, to ſuch
a proportion, that they might
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:54819:72"/>
advance under covert; which
was executed as was deſired,
they working hard all night to
make new where their old works
were irremediable, inſomuch as
the next morning thoſe that
came to veiw the Trenches
knew them not when they ſaw
them, they were already ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act.</p>
            <p>This night very few men were
loſt, becauſe we advanc't not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
far. The next morning the
Enemy made a ſhew again of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying,
ſome thirty or forty of
their Horſe coming out ſome
50 paces from their works, the
Voluntiers that were then with
our Horſe preſt on immediately
towards them, there being ſeveral
perſons of quality amongſt them,
whoſe exploits did daily diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
them, as amongſt others
the <hi>Comte</hi> of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> the Prince
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:54819:73"/>
of <hi>Marſillac; Lanſſon,</hi> that was
then upon the Guard with his
Guards <hi>de Corps,</hi> and by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
was next them, advanced
with forty Horſe, as a reſerve to
the Voluntiers, who marcht up to
their very Palliſadoes, under
whoſe ſhelter the Enemy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tited
at firſt; and there it was the
<hi>Chevalier de Fourbin,</hi> Major of
the Guards <hi>de Corps,</hi> was wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the throat with a Muſquet,
two of the Guards were killed
alſo, and one taken priſoner, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ingaged himſelf too far. We
took one of the Enemies too,
but he could tell us no news, but
that the Townſmen certainly
took up Arms, and had liſted
themſelves for the Common de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
            <p>The <hi>20th</hi> at night the <hi>Swiſſes</hi>
were relieved by fourteen Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
of the Guards of <hi>France,</hi>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:54819:73"/>
who were Commanded by <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galloti,</hi>
and this night alſo they
made no great progreſs, being
imployed in making a line
of Communication with the
Trenches of <hi>Picardy,</hi> which they
had not begun before; and in
this there was never an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer
hurt but <hi>Remond</hi> an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.</p>
            <p>At the other attaque, I have
ſaid there was the Regiment of
<hi>Picardy,</hi> and <hi>Orleance,</hi> who had
opened their Trenches too, and
were relieved by the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of <hi>Champagne</hi> and <hi>Pleſſis
Parſlin,</hi> who with the loſs of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
few men, made very good
works, and I think there was
not on Officer hurt, but the
<hi>Chevalier du Pleſſis</hi> (Maſter <hi>de
Camp</hi> of the Regiment of his
own name) and two Captains of
the Regiment of <hi>Champagne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:54819:74"/>
The third day theſe two Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
were releived by thoſe of
<hi>Auvergne</hi> and <hi>Rouſſillon,</hi> who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
very well alſo with the
loſs of ſcarce a man, and never
an Officer wounded but the Duke
of <hi>Cheureuſe,</hi> and he but ſlightly
in the noſe.</p>
            <p>The fourth in the morning
our Batteries began to play, that
is to ſay, twenty-four peices of
Cannon, of which ſome carried
thirty three pound balls, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
twenty-four; but the place
they battered being of great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
and the Enemy having
more great Guns planted againſt
us, then we againſt them, in
ſpight of all the noiſe and thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
we made with ours, they
forbore not incommodating us
much, and eſpecially our Trench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
and Batteries with ſix peices
they had plac't upon a Baſtion a
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:54819:74"/>
good diſtance on the right hand
of the breach, and towards
which there was not one of ours.
Inſomuch as during this ſiege,
this Battery did us much miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief,
and being planted at the
foot of a Windmill on the Baſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
they called every ſhot that
came the Millers ſhot: However,
the fourth at night it was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
to raiſe a new battery
of four Guns, upon the right hand
of the approaches of the Guards,
to remove thoſe peices from the
Baſtion that diſturbed us. But
this work being very near the
Counterſcarp, and many of the
Pioners ſlain, tis poſſible they did
not exactly purſue their directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and therefore in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at break of day they found
the work not being well pointed
would doe but little ſervice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Baſtion, from whence
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:54819:75"/>
the Miller play'd his pranks; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
it was not altogether near
enough, however they finiſht it ſo
that on the fifteenth at night they
planted four Guns to batter the
half moon on the right hand, in
caſe we had ſtormed that, as
ſome people adviſed, but others
were for falling on only on that
in the midſt, which covered the
Gate of <hi>Fere,</hi> alledging it was
too much to ſtorm three places
at one time; in the mean time
the works went on, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Companies of <hi>Swiſs,</hi> that
relieved the fourteen <hi>French</hi>
Companies, advanc't very near
the Counterſcatp, ſo as it was
conceived they were not above
80 paces off it.</p>
            <p>This day Monſieur was in the
Trenches of the Guards Battery,
where the <hi>Swiſſes</hi> were then
with the Count <hi>de Soiſſons:</hi> he
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:54819:75"/>
viewed their works to the very
utmoſt Poſt, having done the
ſame at the other Battery, that
day the Regiments of <hi>Saux</hi> and
<hi>Harcourt</hi> were there, where
notwithſtanding all they could
ſay to the contrary he expoſed
himſelf much more then perſons
of his greatneſs ought in reaſon
to doe.</p>
            <p>The other Trench was reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Regiments of <hi>Caſtel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nau,</hi>
and <hi>Turenne,</hi> who though
they met with ſeveral half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moons
which the Enemy had
made at the angles of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſcarpe,
were not diſcouraged
from proceeding conſiderably
that night. Amongſt the <hi>Swiſs</hi>
they loſt ſeveral men; their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor
called <hi>Demer,</hi> whilſt he was
giving directions, was ſhot with a
muſquet in the legg, to no
ſmall inconvenience to the party,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:54819:76"/>
he being an old Officer, a brave
man, and exceedingly experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enc't
in all things of War; there
was never another Officer hurt,
but of the common Souldiers
there were about ſixty ſlain. I
know not what the Regiments in
the left hand Trenches loſt, and
therefore I ſhall ſay nothing of
them.</p>
            <p>This day the Enemy made a
ſhow alſo of a ſally, their Horſe
appearing along their Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcarp
betwixt our Battery and
the Port <hi>de Malades;</hi> but the King
being with his Guards near the
contrevallation, with a Regiment
that bore his own name, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by the Prince <hi>d' Marſillac,</hi>
marches himſelf directly againſt
them, &amp; ſtopt their journey, they
contenting themſelves with the
firing all the Cannon and Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets
they had, upon all that
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:54819:76"/>
appeared in the Plaine.</p>
            <p>The fifth at night the Trenches
were relieved thoſe of the
Guards, by the Regiments of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
and of <hi>Louvigny;</hi> and thoſe of
<hi>Picardy,</hi> by the Regiments of
<hi>Saux</hi> and <hi>Harcourt;</hi> theſe Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
advanc't ſtill, having but
few Offices hurt, and not many
Souldiers.</p>
            <p>The ſixth the Kings Regiment
relieved the Regiments in the
Guards Trenches, but they
could proceed but little, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they came at a way
that was paved, and as it were
fortified with the ruines of
Houſes, which made the work
very difficult, however they
found when it was day they were
not far from the Counterſcarp,
becauſe they had ſeveral officers
wounded, and many Souldiers
kill'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:54819:77"/>
On the left hand the Kings
Regiment and the <hi>Lorrainers</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
the Trenches, which they
carried on within twelve or fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
paces of the Counterſcarp,
without any conſiderable loſs; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
people of note there was
only the Chevalier <hi>de Signac</hi>
ſlain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a young Gentleman, and
a Voluntier, who would needs
aſſiſt every night in carrying on
the works, expoſing himſelf
always as much as was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
in theſe ſorts of imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>I do not always obſerve the
names of the General Officers that
Commanded in the Trenches;
it is ſufficient to tell you there
were in the Kings Army four
Liuetenant Generals, that is to
ſay the Marquis <hi>de Bellefons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
the Marquis <hi>de Humieres,</hi> the
<hi>Comte de Duras,</hi> and <hi>Pradelle;</hi>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:54819:77"/>
and four Marſhalls of the Camp,
the Marquis of <hi>Vivonne,</hi> the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
of <hi>Peguilin, Podwits,</hi> and <hi>le
Bret;</hi> of which, two, <hi>viz.</hi> one
Lieutenant General, and one
Marſhall <hi>de Camp,</hi> were daily in
the Trenches, and gave orders
for the ſecurity of the Camp,
which when they had done they
gave conſtantly their account to
the King, or the Marſhall Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
and then betook them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to ſuch places as had moſt
need of them. There was eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day alſo one of the Aides of
the Kings Camp that went to the
Trenches to overlook what was
done, &amp; continued there as long
as the Troops he came with all;
there were ſix of them <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> all, who
relieved one another by turnes,
that is to ſay, the <hi>Comte de Lude,</hi> the
Marquis <hi>de Soyecourt,</hi> the <hi>Comte de
Chamilly,</hi> the Marquis <hi>de Villars,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:54819:78"/>
Biſcarras,</hi> and the Baron <hi>de la
Garde;</hi> of which number the
Marquis <hi>de Soyecourt</hi> falling ſick
at that time, the Marquis <hi>d'Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy-Martel</hi>
was by the King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
in his place.</p>
            <p>The Marſhall <hi>de Aumonts</hi>
Troops being diſperſt in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
places during the ſiege of
of <hi>Lille,</hi> the Count <hi>de Lorges,</hi>
Marſhall of his Camp, was drawn
out to aſſiſt againſt <hi>Lille,</hi> from
whence he was Commanded to
the <hi>Lis,</hi> to ſecure the paſſage
there; but the neceſſity they had
of having more Horſe in the Line,
made him be Countermanded;
and that day the Regiments of
<hi>Saux</hi> and <hi>Harcourt</hi> were in the
Trenches he was there and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
a ſhot in the lower part
of his reines, and was the only
General Officer was wounded; for
that touch that <hi>le Bret</hi> received
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:54819:78"/>
(who was a Marſhal <hi>de Camp</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe)
was but inconſiderable.</p>
            <p>Whilſt things in the Camp were
at this paſs, there came intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
from all parts that the
Enemy was drawing together
out of all his Garriſons, to form a
body, and put ſome relief into the
place; which occaſioned a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
to the Marquis <hi>de Crequy</hi>
to march away with his Horſe
and Dragoons only, ſo as to be
in the Camp the <hi>23d</hi> of <hi>Auguſt,</hi>
in the morning; being ordered
for the more expedition to leave
his Foot behind, with his Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage,
Powder and Ammuniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to come along after him, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Command of <hi>Eſpence</hi> who
was Marſhal <hi>de Camp</hi> to his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my:
The King thought good
to keep only ſome of his Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Horſe, and 500 of his
Dragoons, &amp; ſend him away with
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:54819:79"/>
the reſt to <hi>Comene,</hi> a paſſage up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Lis,</hi> where they were
moſt fearfull the Enemy would
encamp; for that being but three
Leagues from our Camp, they
might give great diſturbance to
the quarters of <hi>Duras, Bellefons,</hi>
and the <hi>Lorraines,</hi> whoſe Troops
were weakeſt, for otherwiſe
coming from a greater diſtance
they did not apprehend they
could come near our Lines, but
we ſhould hear of them.</p>
            <p>Beſides this we had intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of their march every day;
from <hi>Ath</hi> we had news they were
coming that way, and it was
probable might attempt that
place (wherein there were very
few Forces) though it were but to
reſtore the courage of the people,
who believed themſelves utterly
abandoned, ſeeing no effort
made, either for their protection
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:54819:79"/>
or defence. From <hi>Courtray</hi> we had
advice the Enemy were paſſing
to <hi>Gaunt,</hi> and ſo to take the
Road to <hi>Burges,</hi> towards
the Sea, where our Garriſons
were but ſmall, and our Towns
in an ill condition, inaſmuch
as there was good reaſon of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting
ſome enterpriſe or other
was in hand; Eſpecially they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barking
Cannon upon the <hi>Canal</hi>
at <hi>Gaunt,</hi> to be ſent to <hi>Burges.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But all theſe alarms, and the
murmurings of ſeveral perſons
about the King, could not alter
the <hi>Vicomte de Turenne's</hi> pace in
the ſiege, who oppoſed all their
Counſels that adviſed to deal a
little more roundly with the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged;
but all that he preſt with
vehemence to the Regiments
when they went into the
Trenches, was, that they ſhould
work well, and ſecurely, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:54819:80"/>
how little they advanc't;
ſo that on the ſeventh day they
had fifteen or twenty paces to
the Counterſcarp left, which
not agreeing with the impatience
of the <hi>Fr<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nch,</hi> ſeveral perſons
took the liberty to decry him for
making ſo great a buſineſs of this
Town, and ſaying, that if they
had handled this, as they had
done <hi>Tournay</hi> and <hi>Doway,</hi> it had
been ours before then, the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
being no ſtronger then in
thoſe places, ſeeing all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
they could make was
only with the Muſquet, and that
principally by vollies, and thoſe
moſt commonly without aime:
'Tis true, the Cannon they had
within was well diſpoſed, but
it was only againſt our batteries,
where we had twenty-eight
peices of great Cannon to ſilence
the Enemies, if thoſe that were
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:54819:80"/>
to mannage them would ply
them hard: that in reſpect of
thoſe five or ſix peices upon
their Baſtion on the right, where
as I have ſaid our Batteries
could not play, it was an eaſie
matter to make them unſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
by planting five or ſix of
ours upon a little riſing before
the <hi>Lorraine</hi> quarters that was
open to the back of that Baſtion,
and from whence they might
eaſily diſmount their Guns: But
all the deſign theſe people had,
was but to leſſen the Marſhal
General, whom they aſperſt with
protracting the War, for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
end, but to continue his own
greatneſs and Authority.</p>
            <p>And through moſt quarters of
the Army, this was the only
diſcourſe, which was intended
only to haſten the ſiege. But
the <hi>French</hi> Guards, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:54819:81"/>
of <hi>Picardy,</hi> having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
their turn upon the <hi>7th</hi>
at night, it was imagined they
might fall upon the Counterſcarp
that night; and accordingly the
Marquis <hi>de Humieres</hi> diſpoſing
in the evening all his Troops in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
convenient places, about a ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
a clock ſhot off three peices
from our Batteries, which was the
ſignal to fall on in two ſeveral
places, the Guards on the right,
and the <hi>Picards</hi> on the left, which
they performed very readily,
and with a commanded party ran
immediately to their Palliſadoes:
at firſt they made good reſiſtance,
and moſt of them that were drawn
out having put themſelves out
of their reach, it was neceſſary
the Bodies ſhould advance,
which they did, with the ſucceſs
they deſired, for the Enemy ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelf attaqu't in ſeveral
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:54819:81"/>
places, began to leſſen his fire;
and their Palliſadoes being
broken by our Cannon in many
places, they left their works free
for our Troops and Voluntiers
to get in, which they did, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
beat them from their
works, and lodged themſelves
as largely and as conveniently as
they could deſire: There were
ſome of our Voluntiers, with the
Marquis <hi>Rambures</hi> at the head of
them, that charged to the very
halfmoon, before the Gate, but not
being above ſeven or eight, and
the reſt of the Officers and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
buſie in ſecuring the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
they had got, they were not
relieved; and the Marquis, his
Nephew, and three or four of
that ſmall party having been
wounded they were forc't to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire,
and the Enemy remained
Maſter of the half-moon he had
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:54819:82"/>
almoſt abandoned: the beſieged
alſo gave fire to a Mine that was
under the point of the Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcarp,
at the place where the
Guards ſtorm'd, but without
any other effect then removing
ſo much earth and rubbiſh as
was neceſſary for the accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of our lodging. At this
ſtorm <hi>Cavois,</hi> and the Chevalier
<hi>d' Aſſigny,</hi> both Lieutenants of
the Guards, were ſlain, with
four or five Sergeants, and about
100 common Souldiers kill'd and
wounded.</p>
            <p>On the <hi>Picards</hi> ſide there were
two Captains, <hi>Previgny-Rambou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illet,</hi>
and <hi>Villedieu</hi> ſlain, of the
Souldiers I know not the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.
There were ſome Voluntiers
wounded alſo in theſe attaques,
amongſt the reſt the Count of S.
<hi>Paul,</hi> in the Arme, and the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier
of <hi>Lorrain</hi> in the legg, but
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:54819:82"/>
both ſlightly. The next day
being <hi>Thurſday</hi> the twenty-fourth,
the <hi>Swiſſes</hi> relieved the
<hi>French</hi> Guards at ten in the
morning: The Officers and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
that had been in the ſtorm,
not being able to doe more by
reaſon of the ill weather it was,
the <hi>Swiſſes</hi> carried on their
Trenches along the Palliſades
about eight paces for their
enlargement, from the left to
the Angle of returne; where
they made a double about ſix or
ſeven fathoms, and at the ſame
time began two Mines under
their Parapet, with deſign to
have attempted their half-moon,
as ſoon as they had finiſhed
them: one of them being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
about two hours after mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night,
<hi>Aſpremont,</hi> that managed
them, was of opinion they
ſhould not ſpring it, becauſe he
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:54819:83"/>
was miſtaken ſeven or eight Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom,
and the hollow of the
Mine inclined a little too much
to the right hand to be exactly
under the corner of the half-moon;
inſomuch as they ſpent the
reſt of the night in perfecting
the other; where many Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntiers
had put themſelves for
occaſion of ſhewing their courage,
and moſt of them to accompany
the Count <hi>de Soiſſon,</hi> who was
alwayes at the head of the work;
yet he lodged twice in the
Trenches for their once, being
alwayes on the Guards with the
<hi>Swiſſes,</hi> who mounted at this
work twice in ſix hours as well
as the <hi>French</hi> Guards.</p>
            <p>When it was day they wrought
no further: nevertheleſs the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
being come the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to ſee what they had done
over night, and having confer'd
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:54819:83"/>
with <hi>Pradelle</hi> Lieutenant Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
that day, and with the <hi>Comte
de Soiſſons,</hi> the two laſt reſolved
to carry on their approaches to the
Parapet before they were reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that ſo they might facilitate
the attempting the half-moon to
the <hi>French</hi> Guards, who were to
come to their relief; which was
immediatly undertaken, and very
happily performed: for though
it was done in the open day, and
in ſpight of all their works, there
was but one Souldier kill'd, and
but two wounded, ſo as by
Noon it was capable of receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
five and twenty or thirty
men.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time the <hi>French</hi>
Guards relieved the Trenches,
and the <hi>Swiſs</hi> put them in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
of this poſt, which ſeemed
to be defenſible enough; but the
enemy having conſidered of what
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:54819:84"/>
importance it was, they powred
down Souldiers into the ditch of
the half-moon, which was almoſt
dry, and made it inacceſſible by
a double Palliſadoe on each ſide
of the ditch, plac't upon a
kind of Freez, with the points
upwards on thoſe on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
to keep us from going down
into the ditch, and the other
planted on the top of the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet.
An invention I had never
ſeen before, and well enough
contrived, to make our deſcent
difficult, under which the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
lay ſecure, throwing their
Granadoes into our Trenches,
and making a noiſe as if they
were upon the point of ſallying;
and being protected by their ſhot
from the Courlin, and the traver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers
they had towards the half-moon
on the right hand, they
terrified thoſe that were at the
head of the Trenches.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:54819:84"/>
               <hi>Godonit,</hi> a Lieutenant, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to that quarter, was
ſlain by a Granado; <hi>Briconnet</hi>
that came in his place, was kill'd
there alſo; and <hi>Derville,</hi> a Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
that ſucceeded both in his
turn, was ſhot in three places,
and carried off; after him S. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,</hi>
and S. <hi>Seine,</hi> two under-Lieutenants
were both wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
<hi>Magalotti,</hi> that Commanded
the Battallion of the Guards
received a ſhot from a Muſquet
in his ſide; <hi>Bonvizi,</hi> a Captain
had another in his mouth, which
carried away ſome of his teeth;
<hi>Biſcarras</hi> had one in his arme,
and <hi>Montgimont,</hi> Major of the
Regiment of Guards, had a
wound he died of a ſhort time
after: There were beſides ſome
Sergeants, and a conſiderable
number of Souldiers ſlain; and
the work being cleared the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:54819:85"/>
with their Halbards over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
all, and did what they
could to ſtop the mouth of the
Mine up till night.</p>
            <p>That which hapned in the
Trenches being told the King,
who from the difficulties of the
ſiege began to be impatient, to
bring it to an iſſue, and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
becauſe the Raines had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commoded
them much, and
<hi>Marcin</hi> was arrived at <hi>Ipre</hi> with
11 or 12000 men, with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
to fall upon ſome of our
quarters, as he ſhould have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity.
He Commanded two
Companies of Muſquetiers into
the Trench again, that night,
with reſolution to fall upon the
half-moon on ſo many ſides as
might aſſuredly render him Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
thereof: which ſucceeded
accordingly; the Muſquetiers
falling on at the ſame time, on
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:54819:85"/>
the right and left hand of the
point of the half-moon, and the
<hi>French</hi> Guards on the front,
the beſieged were not able to
ſuſtain them, but after ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance,
retired into the Town
in confuſion, leaving all their
Arms, and ſome dead in the
place, and ſeven or eight Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners:
after this the Muſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers
Commanded the Baſtines,
and the Chevalier <hi>de Noailles,</hi>
Marſhall <hi>de Logis,</hi> began to
lodge; after them came others
of the Regiment of Guards, who
with the Chevalier <hi>Cauveſſon,</hi>
and Captain <hi>Camiſſon,</hi> were
drawn out thence, and made a
good poſt, which they kept till
the next day about ten or eleven
a clock, when the <hi>Swiſſes</hi> came
to relieve them. The Enemy
ſeeing the half-moon on the left
hand was loſt alſo, they beat
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:54819:86"/>
a parly, and deſired to capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late.</p>
            <p>This laſt half-moon was
ſtormed by the Regiments of
<hi>Auvergne,</hi> and <hi>Rouſſillon,</hi> and by
200 commanded men out of
the Kings Regiment, of whom
all the Officers almoſt were
wounded, and ſome of the other
Regiments alſo; there were ſome
Sergeants kill'd, and Souldiers
a good number; there was at
the other ſtorm ſome ſeven or
eight of the Kings Muſquetiers,
kill'd, and fifteen or twenty
wounded, but of Officers there
was only <hi>Colbert,</hi> Captain of the
ſecond Company, that received
a ſhot, and that but ſlight too.
There were ſeveral Voluntiers
hurt, and amongſt the reſt, the
Marquis of <hi>Bourbonne</hi> loſt an
eye: The Guards alſo loſt ſome
Souldiers, but they had never
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:54819:86"/>
an Officer kill'd, but <hi>Arcis Cati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat,</hi>
a Captain who was ſhot in
the knee with a Muſquet Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let,
and died in a few dayes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, ceſſation of Arms con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
the News was carried
with all ſpeed to the King, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<hi>Saturday</hi> noon, and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
it was as acceptable as could
have come; for the Foot began
to be weary of the ſervice, and
of the ill weather, which for the
five or ſix laſt nights had been
very bad; however the Trenches
were reinforc't with more exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
then before, becauſe we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
very well the Enemy
was at <hi>Ipre,</hi> and it was of
higheſt reputation to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
honour that they ſhould
put in no relief, now it was ſo
near a ſurrender.</p>
            <p>Upon this conſideration he
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:54819:87"/>
left his quarters at <hi>Loos,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
to the Marquis of <hi>Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eres</hi>
at <hi>Heleſme,</hi> whither<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he
brought all his Guards <hi>de Corps,</hi>
and two Battallions of <hi>French</hi>
Foot and <hi>Swiſſes,</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the convenienteſt place to
give relief to all quarters, but
eſpecially the <hi>Lorrainers,</hi> where
they had no other Foot, then
the two <hi>Lorrain</hi> Regiments, in
whom they had no great confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
as well for their number,
as that they were ill armed.
Beſides, the King was there at the
foot as it were of the Trenches,
and had intelligence every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and his preſence made
all things be executed with
more care and expedition.</p>
            <p>The Enemy having demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
parley, they ſent out the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
of <hi>Richebourg</hi> with their
propoſitions, who was received
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:54819:87"/>
by the Marquis <hi>de Bellefons</hi> that
day, Lieutenant General, and
conveyed to the King, of whom
he at firſt deſired two or three
dayes time, in expectation of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
engaging if they came not, to
ſurrender upon reaſonable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions;
but theſe propoſals not
anſwering the impatience the
King was in of perfecting his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,
he ſent him back imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly,
and commanded the
Marquis of <hi>Bellefons</hi> to renew
the Batteries, and ply their
Guns as faſt as they could. But
ſome of them that attended
<hi>Richebourg</hi> back, having told
him his Propoſitions were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable
in the Condition the
Town ſtood then, all their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works
being taken, and the
Rampart that remained being
hardly defenſible; that it
would bring the ſafety of the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:54819:88"/>
Town, and the prudence of the
Governour in queſtion, who
had mannaged his affairs ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably
hitherto, if by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying
for a few hours, they
ſhould incenſe his Majeſty, and
make his own condition worſe,
and expoſe the people to the
hazard of being plundred, and
all the calamities of a Sack. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
that he had been overſeen
not to bring ſome of the chief
Citizens along with him (who
were a conſiderable body) to
have a care of their intereſt in
the Capitulation. Now whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he was by theſe arguments
effectually perſwaded, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he had Order from the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour,
to abate of his former
demands, he condeſcended to
propoſe that ſome ſmall time
might be allowed him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
and confer with the ſeveral
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:54819:88"/>
intereſts. In ſhort, after ſome
going to and fro, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
till eight a clock at night,
all things were agreed.</p>
            <p>The Governour and the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens
having joyntly ſent out
their Hoſtages, the Regiment of
<hi>Caſtelnau,</hi> which was then in
the Trenches on the left ſide, was
about eleven that night put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
poſſeſſion of one of the Gates
of the Town, and about eight
or nine in the morning the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
marcht out with Armes and
Baggage, their Horſe conſiſted of
ſix Companies of the Regiment
of <hi>Maciet,</hi> of four of <hi>Erbais,</hi> of
three of <hi>Gavelans,</hi> two of <hi>Riche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg,</hi>
and ſome others I know
not whoſe, the whole number
might be about 7 or 800. The
Infantry conſiſted of 300 natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<hi>Spaniards,</hi> or thereabouts,
drawn out of ſeveral <hi>Terces,</hi>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:54819:89"/>
and near as many from <hi>Naples,</hi>
but not ſo good Souldiers, about
as many <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and ſome 150
<hi>Iriſh,</hi> proper men, and who had
the appearance of old Souldiers.
There was alſo beſides theſe a
part of the Regiment of <hi>Rache,</hi>
which were reported to be but
ſix Companies, but they made
up above 600 men, which made
it be believed that they being
compoſed of <hi>Walloons</hi> as they
were, the moſt part of the <hi>Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins</hi>
of the Town and their new
Levies had put themſelves into
thoſe Companies, becauſe there
was not found one perſon of that
kind, though we were informed
during the ſiege that there was
1500 of them within: And this
with the Governours Company
conſiſting of 30 men, was the
whole number of their Foot, and
all theſe by an inferior Officer
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:54819:89"/>
with twenty of the Guards only
conducted to the <hi>Ipre</hi> the Count
<hi>de Broüay</hi> not being perſwaded
to go any-where elſe, becauſe
it was rumour'd in the Army
they would attempt this place
again.</p>
            <p>Whilſt in this manner the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
marcht out, and the <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagne</hi>
Brigade, and two other of
Horſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that of <hi>Biſſy,</hi> and that
of <hi>Reſnel</hi> entered the Town, the
King gave order that the Army
ſhould march to ſee if by any
means he could ingage the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.
It is remarkable, that from
the time the King underſtood
they parlied in the Town, all his
trouble was to find out a way to
give the Enemy Battel, whilſt
they were together. Having, to
that end had conference with
the Marſhal <hi>Turenne,</hi> he made
the Marquis of <hi>Crequy,</hi> with his
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:54819:90"/>
Horſe and Dragoons to march
that very night, being <hi>Saturday;</hi>
he gave order alſo to the <hi>Comte
de Lillebonne</hi> with his <hi>Lorrainers,</hi>
that he ſhould follow the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
as faſt as was poſſible: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch
as theſe Troops having
refreſh't a little at <hi>Menene,</hi> were
the next day encamp't beyond
<hi>Harlebec;</hi> and having from
thence paſt the <hi>Lis,</hi> at <hi>Deinſe,</hi>
were advanc't as far as the Canal
betwixt <hi>Bruges</hi> and <hi>Gaunt.</hi> The
King having only paſt through
<hi>Lille</hi> as it werre, and ſtay'd the
time of ſinging a <hi>Te deum,</hi> marcht
himſelf on <hi>Sunday</hi> after dinner;
but it being late he could march
that night not above three quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of a League, which was near
the Abby of <hi>Marquette.</hi> The
next day being <hi>Monday,</hi> the <hi>29th,</hi>
he marcht very early in the
morning, with a deſign to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:54819:90"/>
alſo at <hi>Harlebec,</hi> where the
two Brigades of Horſe belonging
to <hi>Choiſeul</hi> and <hi>Fourilles</hi> were
drawn out under the Marquis <hi>de
Bellefons</hi> to march towards <hi>Gaunt,</hi>
and to follow the ſteps of the
Marquis <hi>de Crequy,</hi> and the <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rainers.</hi>
The next day the Army
paſt the <hi>Lis</hi> at <hi>Deinſe,</hi> where the
King took up his quarter, his
Troops encamping upon the way,
whereby they might upon all
occaſions relieve the Marquis of
<hi>Crequy,</hi> if there ſhould be any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity;
and the ſame night he
ſent away <hi>Podwits,</hi> Marſhall <hi>de

of <hi>Ar<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

to joyn with the Marquis
<hi>de Bellefons;</hi> but they hearing
the Marquis had already paſt the
Canal near the Village called
<hi>Vinderhout,</hi> ſome three quarters
of a League from <hi>Gaunt,</hi> at a
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:54819:91"/>
Bridge the inhabitants had made
for the convenience of their
commerce, they followed the
ſame way, and found them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>campt
in two Villages about a
League and a half on the other
ſide of the Bridge. The Marquis
of <hi>Crequy</hi> being alwayes about
half a League before to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
and ſtop them in caſe the
Enemies deſign were to return
to <hi>Gaunt,</hi> as the King, and the
Marſhall General conceived they
would, in which they found af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
they were not much
deceived: for, <hi>Marcin,</hi> who was
at <hi>Ipre,</hi> having no news on <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi>
noon that <hi>Lille</hi> did capitulate,
and conſidering there were no
Forces left in <hi>Gaunt, Bruſſels,</hi> nor
generally in all <hi>Brabant</hi> nor <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nault,</hi>
he ſaw plainly all diligence
was to be uſed to retire with
his Troops to the relief of thoſe
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:54819:91"/>
places that might be in great
neceſſity for want of them, ſo as
he diſcampt within an hour after
he had received the news, march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
directly for <hi>Bruges,</hi> and from
thence for <hi>Gaunt,</hi> but with his
Horſe only, becauſe he judged
the Foot would not be able to
follow ſo faſt, which obliged
him to ſend them down the River
from <hi>Ipre</hi> to <hi>Dixmude</hi> by water.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Marcin</hi> being with the greateſt
diligence he could marcht to
<hi>Bruges,</hi> underſtood there by the
people of the Country, that the
Marquis of <hi>Crequy</hi> had paſt the
Canal, and that he was got into
a Country very inconvenient for
Horſe, where he would have much
a doe to get off ſhould he advance
againſt him. Upon this he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
ſounds to horſe, &amp; putting

diviſions, he marcht along the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:54819:92"/>
way to <hi>Gaunt,</hi> without any delay,
to the place where he heard our
Troops were; in which expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
he ſpent moſt part of that
night, but coming near them, and
having taken ſome Priſoners, he
found the Marquis was not alone,

his out Guards about two a

giving them an allarme re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired.</p>
            <p>The Marquis of <hi>Crequy,</hi> who
had kept thoſe Guards on Horſe-back
all night, commanded out a
Cornet with 25 Horſe, which was
the Guard aforeſaid, to follow
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:54819:92"/>
them immediatly, &amp; either bring
him ſome Priſoners, or be taken
himſelf; which was performed
happily enough, for within an
hour he returned with ſome Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valiers
Priſoners, which eaſed the
Marquis of the diſquiet he was
in, by informing him who they
were had given him the allarme;
and accordingly, at the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
he gave order to all his
Troops to march, keeping before
him only that Regiment that had
the Guard, which was that day
the Kings Regiment, Commanded
by the <hi>Comte de Torigny Matignon,</hi>
and which was the firſt of the
Marquis <hi>de Rouvrays</hi> Brigade. He
had ſcarce paſt a League or ſuch
a matter in this order, but he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertook
three of the Enemies
Troops; who made a head, and
took up all the Ground they
could poſſible in that place: our
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:54819:93"/>
forelorns charged immediately,
but having to doe with thoſe
that were drawn, and ſtood
firme in a good place, which is
great advantage in an incloſed
Country, they could move them
but little; and there could have
been nothing but Skirmiſhing at
a diſtance, had not the Marquis
diſmounted 100 of his Dragoons
commanded by <hi>Ranqueil,</hi> who
being drawn upon the right and
left hand of the way, and giving
their Volleys at a convenient
diſtance, the Enemy was ſo
ſtartled, that the Marquis, with
the Marquis <hi>Peguilin,</hi> who was
ſent to him with ſome Troops
from the Marſhal <hi>d' Aumont,</hi> the
<hi>Comte de Torigny,</hi> the Marquis <hi>du

beſides that were next
them, having charged that Troop
that had poſſeſt it ſelf of the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:54819:93"/>
way, they break it, ſo that all they
that made head at firſt, took to
their heels and fled in ſpight of
all their Officers could do, and
were purſued by our Horſe
above a League, where ſome of
them made a ſtand, but 'twas
but for a ſhort time, for they
were routed again, and purſued
above two Leagues more, and
not one perſon fac't about unleſs
ſome Officers, who pay'd dear
for their valour. There were
many kill'd, many of the moſt
conſiderable wounded and taken
Priſoners, amongſt the reſt, the
Chevalier <hi>Vielleneuve</hi> Commiſſary
General of their Horſe, the Prince
of <hi>Salme,</hi> the young <hi>Rhingrave,
Vaudemont,</hi> and other Officers, I

were alſo two pair of Kettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drums,
and three or four Colours
taken, with many Horſe, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:54819:94"/>
3 or 400 men, inſomuch as
the Enemy was chaſed into the

there ſome perſons of condition,
amongſt the reſt the Marquis of

<hi>Gaſſay Matignon,</hi> and ſome others

of <hi>Choiſeul,</hi> whoſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorne
being well received, they
durſt not paſs a little Bridge the
Enemy had before them; but the
groſs of our Troop comming up,
this <hi>Holſtein</hi> Regiment, though it
received the charge very well,
and rally'd often, was at laſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd
to give Ground and run,
but not with that confuſion
as they did on <hi>Crequy's</hi> ſide:
There was 150 Priſoners, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them ſome conſiderable
Officers, as <hi>Don Antonio de Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dove</hi>
Lieutenant General of their
Horſe, beſides Kettle-drums and
Colours. On our ſide alſo there
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:54819:95"/>
were ſome ſlain, and particularly
of the two Companies of the
Queen and Monſieur, who had
been in the Van all the while:
and ſome Officers wounded, as <hi>la

Horſe.</p>
            <p>It was not long they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged

moſt of his party underſtood
the occaſion. And in full Gallop
taking his way that lead to the
Canal, his Troops had ſome
trouble to keep pace; when he
came near the Bridge he put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
at the head of <hi>Rocehforts</hi> Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gade,
and having taken up for a

ſome news from the <hi>Vicomte
Turenne,</hi> who having already paſt

have moſt need of them. <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur,</hi>
and almoſt all the perſons of

party, and ſeveral Voluntiers
with them. But becauſe the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
was ſtrait and dangerous by
reaſon of an old Channel, over
which there was a Bridge of
Stone, the <hi>Vicomte Turenne</hi> would
not ſuffer his Troops to paſs till
he had firſt had certain news of
the Marquis <hi>de Crequy:</hi> ſo as
they continued there till two in
the afternoon, before they learnt
by the Priſoners that were carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

&amp; our Troops returning to their

Camp, which occaſioned them
all to repair to his Majeſty, who
was then at the Canal, who after
conſultation with the Marſhall
General reſolved to ſtay where
he was, till he had news of the
Marquis <hi>de Bellefons</hi> alſo, for
whom he was in great trouble, he
not coming in till night.</p>
            <p>Reſolution was then taken to
encamp near <hi>Gaunt,</hi> and the King
Commands 3000 Foot from the
Guards Brigad from <hi>Deniſe,</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with him no Infantry at all,
but ſome ſelect parties drawn
out of the Queens Regiments
and <hi>de Sourches,</hi> which the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
of <hi>Crequy</hi> had with him to
diſpoſe here and there as he ſaw
occaſion.</p>
            <p>In the mean time there were
ſome propoſed to his Majeſty to
ſummon <hi>Gaunt,</hi> alledging that
the Town being great, and having
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:54819:97"/>
only a Garriſon of 200 men in
the Caſtle, and ſeeing the Troops
that were comming to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leif
broken and repelled, they
might in probability enter into a
new Treaty under the protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>France,</hi> which was repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to have been already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
by ſome of the principal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants,
adding moreover that
we were to make uſe of our time,
&amp; not neglect ſuch opportunities
which hapned but ſeldome, and
that there could be no inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience
at all in the attempt; but
the King gave no ear to thoſe
propoſitions, but made anſwer
that he was not in a condition to
do it at that time; notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this expedient was found out,
the <hi>Comte</hi> of <hi>Chamilly,</hi> as of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
ſhould deſire to ſpeak with
ſome of his acquaintance in the
Town, it being impoſſible but he
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:54819:97"/>
had gained ſome in the time of his
reſidence there with the Prince of
<hi>Condy,</hi> and under this pretence
give them notice of his Majeſties
intention, and ſound them what
effect the taking of <hi>Lille,</hi> and
the routing of <hi>Marcin</hi> had had
upon their ſpirits: But this trade
laſted not long, for the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
would not ſuffer <hi>Chamilly</hi>
to come into the Town, nor ſpeak
with any particular perſon; ſo as
he went as he came, and they
thought no more of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
of <hi>Gaunt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next morning, which was
the laſt of <hi>Auguſt</hi> the, King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
with his Army to <hi>Deinſe,</hi>
from whence he went to <hi>Lille,</hi> the
firſt of <hi>September,</hi> leaving the
Camp with the Marſhall General,
with whom he was agreed what
courſe they ſhould ſteer. It was
reported a reſolution was taken
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:54819:98"/>
to attempt no more that year,
but to put their Troops into their
Winter quarters the latter end
of <hi>October,</hi> and as many as they
could in the places newly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered,
that they might have
ſome refreſhments, after the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſneſs
of the Campania,
which began earlier then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary,
and was more trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome,
by reaſon their great
marches had put them into an
ill condition, moſt of them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a ſeven years peace having
been unaccuſtomed to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodities
of War.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Vicomte Turenne</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
at <hi>Deinſe,</hi> and the King
went from <hi>Lille</hi> to <hi>Arras,</hi>
where the Queen attended him;
from <hi>Arras</hi> both their Majeſties
went on to <hi>Peronne,</hi> and from
thence arrived the ſixt of <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
at S. <hi>Germans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:54819:98"/>
After which the Marſhall Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
having news about the ninth
or tenth of the ſame month
that the Enemy was returned
to <hi>Aloſt,</hi> and fortifying apace,
he marcht immediatly, and in
three days coming before the
Town, they within refuſing to
open the Gates, he ſtormed
them the ſame day he arrived,
without any intrenchments at
all: the <hi>French</hi> Guards, and the
Regiment of <hi>Picardy,</hi> with ſome
ſelect men, fell on on two or
three ſeveral places, but found
more reſiſtance then they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected:
They loſt ſeveral out of
<hi>Picardy,</hi> which had thirteen or
fourteen Officers wounded, and
many Souldiers ſlain; of the
Guards there was one Enſign
kill'd, and ſome Souldiers, and
<hi>Bartillac</hi> a Lieutenant was with a
Muſquet-ſhot ſhot into the body.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:54819:99"/>
However the next morning
the Enemy ſurrendred; and
marcht out with their Armes
according to Articles, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
after we fell a demoliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the works, which though at
that time could be of no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to us, would have ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
much incommoded us had
the Enemy had time to have
maintained them; the Army
continued here ſome time, and
from thence went and encampt
at <hi>Likerque,</hi> where there was a
Caſtle made ſome ſhow of
holding out, but not long:
Here the Army reſted ſome
time, that is, as long as they
found any forrage; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
they changed their quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
and marcht to <hi>Gamerage</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Ath</hi> and <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> that they
might at once keep what they
had got, and eat up the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:54819:99"/>
Enemies Country.</p>
            <p>At length the time being come
for drawing into Winter quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
every Officer General that
was deſigned to any Command
went to the quarter appointed
him. The Marquis <hi>de Belle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fons</hi>
ſhould have Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Lille, Orchies, Doway, Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray,</hi>
and <hi>Armentieres;</hi> but
whether that imployment pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him not, or whether he
had other deſignes on Foot,
he came to the Court himſelf,
and begged of his Majeſty he
might be permitted to ſerve him
in ſome other place: Inſomuch
as the Marquis <hi>d' Humieres</hi> had
his Command, and he the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
of <hi>Humieres</hi>'s, which was
<hi>Charleroy,</hi> and all the Country
between the <hi>Sambre</hi> and the
<hi>Meuſe.</hi> The Count of <hi>Duras</hi>
had under him all the Troops
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:54819:100"/>
in <hi>Tournay, Oudenarde,</hi> and <hi>Ath:</hi>
The <hi>Comte de Paſſage</hi> was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patcht
towards the Sea ſide with
his Troops for ſecuring <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi>
and <hi>Furnes.</hi> The Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Bergue</hi> was given to
<hi>Caſaux,</hi> and that of <hi>Furnes,</hi> to
the <hi>Baron de le Garde; Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray</hi>
was given to <hi>Pertuis</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of the Guards to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>Turenne: Genlis</hi> had <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentieres;
Le Brett, Doway,</hi> and
<hi>Rochefort</hi> and <hi>Oudenarde,</hi> who
had been Governour there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in the former Wars. They
put men alſo into <hi>Orchies,</hi>
S. <hi>Amand,</hi> and ſuch other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
as he believed might fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitate
their Contribution. The
Marquis of <hi>Crequy,</hi> with the
moſt part of the Forces he
had commanded this <hi>Campagnia,</hi>
was ſent back into <hi>Luxembourg,</hi>
and he had with him for Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:54819:100"/>
               <hi>Podwits</hi> and <hi>de Eſpence:</hi>
the Count <hi>de Vivonne</hi> ſtayed at
<hi>Lille,</hi> with the Marquis of <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieres.</hi>
In ſhort, all the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
General, which had ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in this <hi>Campania,</hi> except
<hi>Pradelle</hi> and the Marquis of
<hi>Peguilin,</hi> had Commands during
the Winter.</p>
            <p>Many people admire that the
King broke the courſe of his
Conqueſt ſo ſuddenly, ſeeing
he was abſolute Maſter of the
Field, and that after defeat
of <hi>Marcin,</hi> the terrour was ſo
great all over the <hi>Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,</hi>
he ſeemed to have no
more to do then to take his
choiſe which Town was the
next he would take in; but it
ought to be conſidered, that the

eaſie matter to undertake great
enterpriſes, for as much as thoſe
places that remained to be tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
were very ſtrong and well
provided with all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
for a long ſiege; or elſe
of ſo ſmall importance, they were
not worth the paines of think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of them. Beſides, the great
Towns we had taken, as <hi>Lille,
Tournay, Doway,</hi> and <hi>Courtray,</hi>
were very hard to be kept; and
leaving ſufficient Garriſons there,
we had not men enough to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
any thing againſt <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray,
Valenciennes,</hi> or <hi>Monts,</hi>
or any other ſtrong Town in
the Country. Wherefore the
ſafeſt Councel was followed,
which was to keep what we
had got, till we ſhould ſee
what party would ſide with
the houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and its
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:54819:101"/>
Allies: And perchance alſo his
Majeſty would not take away
all hopes of an accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from the people, all his
Neighbours having interpoſed,
and principally the <hi>Engliſh,
Swede,</hi> and <hi>Hollander,</hi> who
offered upon a ceſſation of
Arms to ſee his Majeſty ſhould
have reaſon done. The Pope
alſo had put in, and ſent a

where all the Deputies of the

<pb n="171" facs="tcp:54819:102"/>
firſt action of their new Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
was to oblige the Towns
lately conquer'd to contribute
towards their maintenance: The
Tax was ſo high that 50000
Livres were impoſed upon
<hi>Lille</hi> alone; which Place, and
divers other <hi>French</hi> Garriſons,
became ſhortly after much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted
with ſickneſſes, to which
great numbers of the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours

to yield without quarter. Now
although the tearms on which
the Towns aboveſaid had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned

<hi>French</hi> hands, were fair and
eaſie enough, yet ſuch is the
humour of that Nation, that
they are by all the world ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved

ariſing between the Citizens
and Souldiers; which came to
that hight, that one of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of the Guard, and about
twenty Souldiers, were killed.
This accident occaſioned an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional
ſupply of three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Souldiers more to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to that Garriſon, beſides
the Kings Regiment of Guards,

and the whole City diſarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> King, though
retired to <hi>Paris</hi> (where, and at

refuſing to undertake the

as part of the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,

and offers being made to
them, that upon the giving up

of a Regiment of Horſe to
the Count <hi>de</hi> S. <hi>Amour</hi> his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew,
for his good ſervice in
winning the ſaid Marquis to a

               <p>This ſettlement being conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

the King of <hi>England</hi> and
thoſe States, to employ force to

The <hi>French</hi> King accepted of

accordingly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
a ceſſation of all Acts of

to which alſo the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
<hi>de Caſtle Rodrigo</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented,
and nominated the

Baron of <hi>Bergeyck</hi> to be ſent
with ſufficient Powers and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions

aſſiſt at the Treaty of Peace
there.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding the ceſſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the <hi>French</hi> forbore not to
make all poſſible Preparations
for War; and Monſieur <hi>de Belle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fons</hi>
and <hi>Duras</hi> pretending want
of notice of the ceſſation, (which
they would not take from any

<hi>Guena,</hi> and in a few dayes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
the ſame to be ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>French</hi> King thought
not fit to hold a place, which
had been taken during the
Truce; and therefore, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Treaty, gave order for
the delivering of it back into
the hands of the <hi>Spaniards:</hi> But
withall he declared that he
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:54819:109"/>
would take the Field in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of <hi>April,</hi> and unleſs the
Peace were perfectly concluded

it ſhould be free for him
to purſue his Conqueſts; yet
obliging himſelf, in caſe of Peace
by that time to reſtore back to
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> all ſuch places as
he ſhould make himſelf maſter
of by his Armes.</p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>Colbert</hi> was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
by his <hi>French</hi> Majeſty to
<hi>Aix la Chappel</hi> for negotiating the

by the United Provinces,
as Sir <hi>William Temple,</hi> Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
at <hi>Bruſſels</hi> for his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
of Great <hi>Brittain</hi> was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
ordered thither for the ſame
effect: <hi>Signieur Aug. Franciotti</hi>
Plenipotentiary for the Pope,
and three Plenipotentiaries
more from the three Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:54819:110"/>
Electors of <hi>Germany.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean time the <hi>French</hi>
King gives command for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſhing
of the Fortifications
of moſt of the conſiderable
Towns which he had taken in
<hi>Franche Comte,</hi> and alſo for the
building of a Citadel at <hi>Beſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon.</hi>
The former was accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
executed; but in regard
the Peace began now to be
hopefull, it was thought fit to
forbare the latter.</p>
               <p>After many doubts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the iſſue of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
at laſt the Plenipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiaries
ſigned an agreement on
the ſecond of <hi>May,</hi> which being
ratified by the <hi>French</hi> King and
the Queen Regent of <hi>Spain,</hi> was
proclaimed at <hi>Bruſſels</hi> on the
<hi>30th</hi> of the ſame moneth, and
ſhortly after ſworn to by both
Kings.</p>

                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:54819:110"/>
The ſubſtance of this conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
was, (1.) That the moſt
Chriſtian King ſhould keep and
effectually enjoy all Places,
Forts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that he had taken or
fortified by Armes during the
laſt years Campagne, <hi>viz.</hi> The

and all their Baliwicks,
Caſtlewicks, Appurtenances and
dependances, by what name ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
called, as far as ever they
extend; the Catholick King
for himſelf and his Succeſſors
renouncing and diſclaiming the
ſame for ever. (2.) That imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
after the Publication of
the Peace, the <hi>French</hi> King
ſhould withdraw his Forces from

the ſame to the Catholick
