         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHAT Severities towards the <hi>Perſons,</hi> what
Havock and Devaſtations on the <hi>Goods and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates</hi>
of peaceable Engliſh Men, have ſome
years paſt been practiſed by <hi>ſtrained</hi> Interpretations, and a
rigorous Execution of the ſeveral <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> is ſure <hi>too
late</hi> to be forgot by the <hi>Sufferers,</hi> too notorious to be denied
by the <hi>Actors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During this <hi>Storm</hi> the Diſſenters of all ſorts filled Earth
and Heaven with loud and mournful Complaints, both of
the Iniquity of <hi>thoſe Laws,</hi> and the <hi>Perſecution</hi> they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
ſuffered; which was become ſo intolerable, that <hi>many</hi>
actually tranſported themſelves to forreign Parts; <hi>Multitudes
more,</hi> out of a ſenſe of their preſent hard uſage, or juſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
of further Proſecutions, were <hi>upon the wing</hi> ready
to fly at the firſt opportunity to the remoteſt Deſarts, chuſing
by a voluntary Baniſhment from their <hi>Native Country</hi> to
expoſe themſelves to all Hazards <hi>abroad,</hi> rather than conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
under thoſe Evils which they either <hi>felt</hi> or <hi>feared</hi> at
<hi>home.</hi> And as <hi>Oppreſſion</hi> is apt to make even <hi>wiſe Men</hi> mad,
not a few diſtracted with theſe <hi>frightful Idea's,</hi> ſuffered
themſelves to be embarqu'd in Deſigns no leſs <hi>unwarrantable</hi>
in their own Nature, than deſtructive in the Event.</p>
            <p>In the height of this <hi>Conſternation,</hi> and when no Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
but that of his Maj<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> own Princely Generoſity and the
Publick-<hi>Weal,</hi> could neceſſitate him to it (the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97397:3"/>
being cruſh't and all his Enemies at his feet) the
KING was pleaſed to publiſh his <hi>healing Declaration</hi> for a
general <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> together with the Grounds
and Reaſons inducing him thereunto; it being no ſudden
or <hi>occaſional</hi> Overture to ſerve a preſent turn, but the well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weigh'd
and long-confirmed Reſult of his <hi>Royal Judgment,</hi>
which as he had <hi>many years ago</hi> declared on ſundry occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
ſo 'tis not unknown <hi>to whom</hi> we owe the <hi>Retarding</hi>
thereof ſo long, and conſequently all the <hi>Diſaſters</hi> attending
that unhappy Obſtruction.</p>
            <p>By this <hi>Gracious Declaration,</hi> as his Majeſty did freely
and fully eaſe all his <hi>Nonconforming Subjects</hi> from thoſe Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
under which they had groaned for ſo many years,
and put them into an equal Capacity with the reſt of their
Fellow-Subjects, to ſerve his Majeſty and their Countrey,
without violating their <hi>Conſciences,</hi> (a natural <hi>Birth-right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Priviledg,</hi>
which they were before debarr'd of) ſo he par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
expreſſed his Kindneſs to <hi>that Party</hi> who call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<hi>The Church of England,</hi> by his Royal Aſſurance,
that they ſhould without any moleſtation, fully enjoy all
<hi>their Poſſeſſions,</hi> as well as the <hi>free Exerciſe</hi> of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>Now who that conſiders Men as acting like <hi>rational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi>
could have imagined but ſuch a very gracious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure,
would have obliged all his Majeſties Subjects to a
moſt <hi>joyful Reſentment</hi> of ſo vaſt a Favour?</p>
            <p>Who would not have thought that the <hi>Church-men</hi> (who
ſeemed to value themſelves upon nothing more than their
<hi>ſteady Loyalty,</hi> and intire <hi>paſſive Obedience)</hi> ſhould have been
extreamly pleaſed, that their Prince, though himſelf of a
different Communion, was ſo far from putting them on the
Practice of that <hi>uneaſy Vertue,</hi> as on the contrary he vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed
ſo peculiar a regard of them, as to continue them in
the Figure of the <hi>National Church,</hi> and ſure Enjoyment of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:97397:3"/>
               <hi>all</hi> their former <hi>Advantages,</hi> except that <hi>unaccountable</hi> one of
forcing all others, (altho by deſtructive means, and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to the Publick Repoſe) to conform to their particular
<hi>Schemes,</hi> which yet themſelves own to be <hi>indifferent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At worſt, if they could be ſuppoſed capable of ſuch an
unreaſonable <hi>Peeviſhneſs,</hi> as not to be ſatisfied, becauſe their
Nails were pared, and they could not ſcratch their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
ſo as heretofore; yet it could not be doubted but all
the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> of whatever Denomination, would with the
<hi>higheſt Gratitude</hi> receive ſuch an indearing Indulgence; the
rather becauſe <hi>His Majeſty</hi> not only aſſured them of it for his
<hi>own Reign,</hi> but engaged to do his part for continuing it to
their <hi>Poſterity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as what is offered with the <hi>Right</hi> Hand is not ſeldom
received with the <hi>Left;</hi> and the beſt Actions frequently
happen to be traduced by the Siniſter Interpretations of thoſe
that poſtpone the <hi>Publique Tranquillity</hi> to their own pettiſh
Humours, little <hi>Self-Intereſts,</hi> or perhaps only ſilly <hi>Vanity</hi>
of appearing more ſagacious at the Politicks than their
Neighbours. No ſooner was this <hi>Incomparable Declaration</hi>
emitted, but ſome <hi>rigid Churchmen</hi> vext by a Spirit of <hi>Pride</hi>
to think that their power of domineering ſhould be in the
leaſt abbridged; and gaul'd with <hi>Envy</hi> to behold <hi>Diſſenters</hi>
admitted to any degree of Royal Favour (which they hop'd
to engroſs wholly to themſelves) ſtudying likewiſe by ſome
<hi>Wheadling Artifice</hi> to manage the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> ſo, as that <hi>they</hi>
ſhould expoſe themſelves to his Majeſties <hi>just Diſpleaſure,</hi>
as a ſort of ſavage Animals, that like <hi>Tygers</hi> can never be
rendred tame; Men that would not be quiet under any
Government, but like <hi>Trouts</hi> muſt be always <hi>ſwimming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the ſtream;</hi> People without <hi>Conſcience, Reaſon</hi> or <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Sence;</hi> whom no Kindneſs could reclaim, no Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
oblige (for in ſuch hideous Characters they always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
them;) and withal deſigning that the <hi>Rods</hi> which
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:97397:4"/>
themſelves had both procured, and ſo miſchievouſly <hi>made
uſe of,</hi> might ſtill be reſerved <hi>in Lavender</hi> for a more oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
Juncture, in order to ſmarter Laſhes on all that will
not truckle to whatever Ceremonies their Reverencies
ſhould think fit to impoſe. Upon theſe and ſuch like Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
I ſay, a ſtrange ſullen Murmur, and <hi>grouling</hi> Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
has ever ſince poſſeſſ'd moſt of the violent Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
to repine at or reproach his Majeſties Proceedings,
to incenſe or amuſe the People with Fears and Jealouſies,
and eſpecially to cajole the Diſſenters not to regard this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence
with that Reſpect they ought to do, or at leaſt
to diſcourage them from contributing their ſhare towards
rendring it perpetual.</p>
            <p>To reach theſe Ends, the <hi>Malecontents</hi> aforeſaid have had
their <hi>Clubs,</hi> and <hi>Cabals,</hi> and <hi>little Aſſociations</hi> acted by <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Councils,</hi> not altogether perhaps uninfluenced by <hi>foreign
Correſpondencies</hi> (as 'tis ſaid, they had once heretofore on
ſomewhat alike occaſion) with ſome that have found <hi>Liberty
of Conſcience,</hi> too advantagious <hi>a Plant</hi> to themſelves, to
ſuffer it, by their good Wills, to <hi>thrive</hi> any where elſe.</p>
            <p>The high-flown Church-men have endeavoured to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright
ſuch honeſt <hi>Country Gentlemen,</hi> as they thought Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotted
to their Eſtabliſhment, with Outcries, that this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence
will certainly blow up the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and
then Good-night to the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> and ſo farewel
to all their <hi>Abbey-Lands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the other ſide the <hi>Latitudinarian</hi> Divines, as being
for their reported Moderation of greateſt Credit and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
among the <hi>Non-Cons,</hi> have been inveigled by ſpecious
Pretenſions, to amuſe and bug-bear the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> with a
noiſe of the <hi>Snake in the Graſs;</hi> that the <hi>Conſtitution</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
was <hi>unhoop'd, all the Laws</hi> of Civil Property ſhaken,
by the King's diſpenſing with the <hi>Penalties</hi> of theſe <hi>Irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Religious</hi> ones; that this Indulgence was only a <hi>Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folding</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:97397:4"/>
erected for the building up of <hi>Popery,</hi> which would
be <hi>thrown down</hi> as ſoon as the <hi>intended Structure</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Inſinuations were managed at firſt with <hi>Caution,</hi>
till having (as they thought) by <hi>private Whiſpers</hi> ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
prepoſſeſs'd their own Party, and created <hi>preparative
Jealouſies</hi> amongſt others; To crown the Work, out comes
a Paper, called <hi>A Letter to a Diſſenter,</hi> &amp;c. wherein all that
<hi>Wit</hi> or <hi>Malice</hi> would rake together, to invenom Mens Minds
with <hi>falſe Impreſſions,</hi> is muſter'd up, and boldly publiſhed
to the World.</p>
            <p>No ſooner was the <hi>Preſs</hi> delivered in Hugger-mugger of
this <hi>hopeful Brat,</hi> but many <hi>grave Dons</hi> (appointed for
that <hi>Cue)</hi> ſtood ready to admire and recommend its char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<hi>Features:</hi> Induſtriouſly were the Papers ſpread, (and
ſome <hi>Crape Gowns</hi> appeared ſo fond of promoting it, as if they
had a mind to play the <hi>Interlopers</hi> on the <hi>Hawkers)</hi> printed it
was more than <hi>once</hi> or <hi>twice,</hi> and at laſt in a <hi>ſingle Sheet</hi> for
Conveniency of Poſtage, that no Corner of the Land might
be unattempted by this excellent Specimen of the Church
of <hi>England's</hi> Loyalty.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Author,</hi> ſince he is ſo kind to himſelf, as to
play Bo-peep with the <hi>Publick,</hi> under the Mask of a couple
of <hi>Letters</hi> only, I am not ſolicitous to enquire after either
the Quality or Habitation of a <hi>certain uncertain T. W.</hi> whom
perhaps I am never like to find; not did I certainly know
the Gentleman, ſhould I deſcend to <hi>Perſonal Reflections,</hi>
how obnoxious ſoever he might happen to be to them;
that is a <hi>baſe and ſneaking</hi> Practice uſed only by ſuch as
thereby confeſs themſelves <hi>over-match'd</hi> in the Argument.</p>
            <p>For this Reaſon too, I ſhall not qualify the Paper with
any harſh <hi>Epethites;</hi> whether it fall within the Statute of
<hi>falſe News,</hi> or without it; whether it ſhould be called <hi>Libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:97397:5"/>
or <hi>Seditious,</hi> or ſomewhat worſe, are Queſtions that
belong not at all to my Province.</p>
            <p>That which I apprehended my Duty (both as a diſinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted
<hi>honeſt Man,</hi> a <hi>good Subject,</hi> a hearty Lover of the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Peace of my Country, and a ſincere Profeſſor of, and
<hi>Well-wiſher</hi> to the Proteſtant Religion, that it may be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
on ſuch a Foot as may for ever preſerve it free, both
from the <hi>danger</hi> of being perſecuted, and the <hi>ſcandal</hi> of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
any others) was to conſider the Purport and End of
this Writer, atd the Reaſons he offers; and ſince theſe, to
the beſt of my Underſtanding, appear repugnant to all thoſe
Obligations, I hope I may be allowed to offer my Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereupon without any juſt Offence; to antidote the
<hi>unwary</hi> againſt thoſe <hi>miſchievous Notions,</hi> which I conceive
he would <hi>inſtil</hi> into their Minds, under the Flouriſhes of a
<hi>gaudy Rhetorick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For it muſt be acknowledged, that this Pamphlet is
wrote with a great deal of <hi>Art,</hi> full of pert Sallies of <hi>Wit,</hi>
and <hi>gay Language,</hi> plauſible Expreſſions of <hi>Kindneſs,</hi> and a
Stile altogether accommodated to amuſe and inveigle; but for
<hi>ſtrict Truth,</hi> or <hi>ſolid Arguments,</hi> the Author has been pleaſed
to <hi>diſpenſe</hi> with his Readers Expectations.</p>
            <p>To premiſe thus much, I thought not altogether imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent,
that the <hi>State of the Caſe</hi> being rightly apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
we might have done the ſooner, and the Reader, if he
pleaſe to diveſt himſelf for a while of Prejudice and partial
Affections, may be the better enabled to judg of what is
offered on either ſide: And ſo let us come to the matter.</p>
            <p>Here's a Letter from <hi>Some body</hi> to a <hi>Diſſenter—</hi> Very
good! What has the <hi>illuſtrious</hi> unknown <hi>T. W.</hi> to ſay to his
humble <hi>diſſenting Servant?</hi> Why truly, after an envious
Reflection on the late <hi>Addreſſes</hi> in general, and a fine-ſpun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſinuating
<hi>Banter,</hi> he has a <hi>pair of Advices</hi> to communicate
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:97397:5"/>
to him: 1. <hi>That he muſt ſuſpect his new Friends. 2. That
he muſt not hazard the Publick Safety, neither by deſire of
Eaſe, nor of Revenge.</hi> To the <hi>first</hi> we can give no <hi>Catego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical</hi>
Anſwer till we better underſtand his meaning, which
I ſhall enqire after by and by: But as for the <hi>last,</hi> I hope
there is no <hi>Diſſenter</hi> in <hi>England</hi> but was before fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
that it was his Duty; and ſo the Gentleman might
have ſpared the pains of his elaborate Letter in that reſpect.
But he has alſo ſome <hi>News</hi> to tell him, <hi>viz.</hi> That the
<hi>Papiſts;</hi> always make their firſt Court-ſhip to the <hi>Church of
England;</hi> That they are not in their Hearts ſo fond of the
<hi>Diſſenters,</hi> as to their Principles, but civil to them, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
their <hi>Interests</hi> at this Juncture happen to unite in
<hi>aliquo Tertio, viz.</hi> A Repeal of the <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> under
which they have <hi>both</hi> ſmarted, and are in danger to do ſo
again; and that therefore <hi>one Reaſon</hi> (and perhaps with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
the <hi>only Reaſon)</hi> why they are content to allow them <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,</hi>
is becauſe they would thereby get a little for <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves</hi>
and their <hi>Poſterity.</hi> Having made theſe <hi>wonderful
Diſcoveries,</hi> our Author proceeds to open his Budget full of
<hi>Suppoſals,</hi> mixt with known <hi>Falſhoods,</hi> and thence conjures
up a Parcel of horrid <hi>Inferences,</hi> and upon the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes,
that we <hi>had as good be down-right Atheiſts,</hi> as conſent
to part with the <hi>Penal Laws;—</hi> And ſo he is, <hi>dear Sir, your
moſt affectionate humble Servant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the <hi>Sum</hi> and <hi>Subſtance</hi> of the Pamphlet, when
ſtript of its <hi>Top-knots</hi> and Gallantry; and were not vulgar
Ears more open to <hi>Rhetorick</hi> than <hi>Logick,</hi> there need no
more be ſaid to expoſe its <hi>Shallowneſs</hi> and Vanity; but
ſince the <hi>Trifle</hi> is become ſo celebrated, I ſhall briefly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haul
the Particulars.</p>
            <p>His firſt Inſtruction to Diſſenters is, that <hi>they have cauſe
to ſuſpect their new Friends;</hi> and have they none to ſuſpect
their <hi>old Enemies?</hi> The truth is, the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> would glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:97397:6"/>
be <hi>Friends</hi> with all their Fellow-ſubjects, that there
might be an Union in <hi>Affections,</hi> and all the mutual Offices
of <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Humanity,</hi> tho under different Apprehenſions
about Matters of Religion; nor can they ſo much as gueſs
at <hi>any Expedient</hi> able to accompliſh that glorious End, <hi>viz.</hi>
To render both Governours and People eaſy and ſafe, by
extirpating the otherwiſe <hi>perpetual Feuds</hi> and <hi>Fears,</hi> each
Party much needs entertain againſt the other (thoſe infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<hi>Winds</hi> which ſo often have raiſed <hi>Storms,</hi> and more
than once <hi>ſhip-wrack'd</hi> Civil States.) And in a word, to <hi>give
God and Caeſar each his due;</hi> Unleſs it be by a total Aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of thoſe <hi>Penal Laws</hi> (that have hitherto obſtructed
all theſe Bleſſings) and eſtabliſhing <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi>
on ſo firm a <hi>Legal Baſis,</hi> that it ſhall not be <hi>in the Power</hi>
(how violent ſoever the Inclination may be) of any <hi>one
Party</hi> to invade the Immunities of the reſt.</p>
            <p>But this will not anſwer our Authors End; 'tis too plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
evident by this affected Term of <hi>New Friends,</hi> which
runs through all his Paper, he principally means the <hi>King;</hi>
who indeed has been the <hi>beſt Friend</hi> the Diſſenters ever had
on this ſide Heaven; and yet ſome People are ſo <hi>prodigiouſly
ungrateful</hi> as to perſuade them not to <hi>thank</hi> Him for't.</p>
            <p>But if we muſt always miſtruſt <hi>new Friendſhips;</hi> then we
muſt not credit the very late Pretenſions on behalf of the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> that ſhe is ſorry for her <hi>paſt Rigours,
or will be more kind for the future:</hi> With what <hi>Forehead</hi> does
this Gentleman urge us to ſuſpect the <hi>ſolemn repeated Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
of our <hi>SOVERAIGN</hi> and yet at the ſame time expect
we ſhould take his <hi>bare Word,</hi> who neither gives us his <hi>own
Name,</hi> nor produces any <hi>Commiſſion</hi> from that <hi>Church,</hi> for
what he undertakes in <hi>Hers?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But why muſt we needs <hi>ſuſpect our King?</hi> Is it becauſe
amongſt the many <hi>Royal Qualities</hi> he is inveſted with; a <hi>pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
Veracity,</hi> and generous Diſdain of all little <hi>tricking
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:97397:6"/>
diſſembling Arts,</hi> has been ſignally remarkable? No it is,
becauſe <hi>the Church of Rome cannot by her Principles allow Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to Hereticks;</hi> and becauſe <hi>the Men of Taunton and Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verton
are on a ſudden grown eminent for Loyalty;</hi> and becauſe
<hi>the Quakers give the King Thanks with a</hi> boon <hi>Grace:—</hi> Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Reaſons! But let's examine them apart.</p>
            <p>As for the firſt, our Author exaggerates it with his u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual
Floridneſs thus, <hi>p.</hi> 3. <q>This Alliance between
Liberty and Infallibility is bringing together the two
moſt contrary things that are in the World. The Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> doth not only diſlike the allowing Liberty, but
by its Principles it cannot do it. Wine is not more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
forbidden to the <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> than giving Hereticks
Liberty to the <hi>Papiſts.</hi> They are no more able to make
good their Vows to you, than Men married before, and
their Wife alive, can confirm their Contract with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
The continuance of their Kindneſs would be a
Habit of Sin, of which they are to repent, and their
Abſolution is to be had upon no other Terms, than their
Promiſe to deſtroy you:</q> —Thus He. And becauſe
'tis a <hi>popular</hi> Argument frequently made uſe of, I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to give it a full Anſwer.</p>
            <p>1. What the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>'s <hi>Principles</hi> are, or what
by them ſhe <hi>can, or cannot do,</hi> I ſhall not here take upon me
to determine; for many of her Principles are very <hi>abſtruſe,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
this of <hi>Infallibility,</hi> ſhe has not been pleaſed
to determine <hi>where</hi> and in <hi>whom</hi> particularly it
reſides; and ſhe <hi>can</hi> do great things, as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
(if I am not<note n="*" place="margin">See my Lord <hi>Coke</hi>'s Charge given at <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich Aſſizes, 4 Aug.</hi> 1606 4th page of the ſheet F. (for 'tis not paged.)</note> miſinformed) ſhe offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
once to allow of our <hi>Common-Prayer-Book,</hi>
and that I hope you'l ſay was kindly done of
her. Nor do I ſee any ſuch neceſſary Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
between <hi>Infallibility</hi> and <hi>Liberty;</hi> for though a Man
ſhould think himſelf <hi>Infallible,</hi> (if any can in good earneſt
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:97397:7"/>
think ſo) it does not follow, that he muſt beat, ſpoil or
kill all that will not <hi>own</hi> ſuch his <hi>aſſumed Infallibility;</hi> at
leaſt <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Infallibility</hi> may agree, as well as we find by
woful Experience <hi>Conformity</hi> hath done with <hi>Nonconformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi>
and if Diſſenters muſt be perſecuted, 'tis much alike
to them, whether it be by a <hi>Fellow-Proteſtant</hi> or a <hi>Papiſt</hi>'s
Hand; only the former, Act ſomewhat the more <hi>abſurdly</hi>
in Impoſing on others, ſince they confeſs they may perhaps
be in the <hi>wrong themſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. But however theſe things may happen to be, 'tis plain
the Gentleman does not here argue a <hi>Propos;</hi> for we have
nothing to do with the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> ſhe is no Party to
the Tranſaction: The <hi>Diſſenters</hi> have never that I know
of, entred into any <hi>Treaty</hi> about Reconciliation with her in
Principles, whatever <hi>others</hi> have been nibbling at. Our
Concern lies with a Prince, our <hi>natural Soveraign,</hi> who
altho he be of that Communion, has ſolemnly avowed to
all the World, <hi>That it has been, and is his conſtant Senſe and
Opinion, that Conſcience ought not to be conſtrained, nor Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
forced in Matters of meer Religion.</hi> In purſuance of
which Principle, his Majeſty has at preſent reſtrained the
Execution of the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> and aſſured the Diſſenters that
they <hi>ſhall enjoy the ſame Eaſe during his Reign;</hi> and that he
would be ready to contribute <hi>His Part</hi> toward rendring the
ſame perpetual, both by repealing thoſe Laws, and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
the <hi>Right</hi> of free Exerciſe of Religious Worſhip,
and ſecuring by Law ſuch a ſettled and permanent Freedom
of Conſcience from being invaded by any Party whatſoever
for the future.</p>
            <p>The Queſtion is, whether the Diſſenters ought not thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
to embrace his Majeſties moſt Gracious Offer herein,
and not be wanting on their part towards bringing it to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect?
To which I ſhould anſwer affirmatively, and take it
to be their <hi>true Intereſt</hi> and only Preſervative. For,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:97397:7"/>
3. How far ſoever the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>'s Pretenſions to
<hi>Infallibility,</hi> or her Averſion to thoſe ſhe calls <hi>Hereticks</hi> may
extend, we find in fact, that it does not render all her Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
ſo extravagant as to venture on Impoſſibilities, and act
contrary to their own apparent <hi>Intereſt; Quia deſunt vires</hi>
is allowed by their <hi>hotteſt</hi> Caſuiſts, a ſufficient Ground for
<hi>tolerating Hereticks;</hi> elſe every one of her Sons ſhould be
obliged under Pain of Damnation to <hi>run a muck</hi> againſt
all Mankind that differ from her; whereas we ſee many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
where both <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants</hi> live very quietly
together, and that there have been and are Princes of the
<hi>Roman Creed</hi> that have and do tolerate different Religions,
without eſteeming themſelves ever the worſe <hi>Catholicks;</hi>
nor does the Pope venture to excommunicate them on that
account.</p>
            <p>I doubt not but thoſe of the <hi>Proteſtant Cantons</hi> in <hi>Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zerland</hi>
believe as much as any of our Diſſenters that there
is <hi>Idolatry</hi> in the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and there is no Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
but thoſe of the <hi>Popiſh Cantons</hi> believe the other to be
<hi>rank Hereticks,</hi> yet they both in a friendly manner <hi>coaleſce</hi>
into one and the ſame Republick, and live quietly together
for their mutual Preſervation; neither the <hi>miſcall'd Heretick</hi>
thinking himſelf bound to invade the Civil Rights of the
ſuppoſed <hi>Idolater;</hi> nor the <hi>imagined Idolater</hi> once dreaming
that he can never go to Heaven, without <hi>a Promiſe</hi> to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
his Neighbour,</hi> becauſe he fancies him to be an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick.</p>
            <p>Nor do the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> of the <hi>Vnited Provinces</hi>
(whoſe Numbers are not inconſiderable) eſteem themſelves
bound to cut their Compatriots <hi>Throats,</hi> but on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
have as vigorouſly as any drawn their <hi>Swords</hi> (even
though againſt the moſt <hi>Catholick</hi> King) in defence of their
<hi>common Liberties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:97397:8"/>
By all theſe and many other like inſtances that might be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
it appears that <hi>Roman-Catholicks,</hi> notwithſtanding their
Principles, can ſometimes live very <hi>ſociably</hi> with <hi>Proteſtants,</hi>
where their common <hi>Safety</hi> and <hi>Intereſt</hi> requires it; And that
this is their caſe in <hi>England,</hi> ſhall preſently be ſhewn.</p>
            <p>But in the mean time, this may ſerve in ſome meaſure to
anſwer and take off that vulgar reproach now commonly
thrown at <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> that <hi>they joyn with Papiſts to ſet up Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,
by deſtroying the Church of England;</hi> Of which Charge
neither Branch is true; they joyn not with Papiſts to <hi>ſet up,</hi>
but rather to keep <hi>down</hi> Popery, and not to <hi>deſtroy</hi> the Ch.
of <hi>England,</hi> but rather to <hi>eſtabliſh</hi> it upon firm and laſting
Grounds; To give every Party their <hi>Right</hi> in an uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
Freedom of Conſcience, and prevent any of them
from uſing Violence to the other. To joyn with People of
another Perſuaſion in a certain reſpect where our ſeveral In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts
happen to unite, may be done without the juſt ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
of favouring their Opinions, ſo when the Pope expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
with <hi>Cardinal d' Oſſat</hi> Ambaſſador from King <hi>Henry</hi>
the <hi>4th</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> that his Maſter had entred into an Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who were <hi>Hereticks,</hi> to the danger of
the Church; that moſt prudent <hi>Miniſter of State</hi> replied,
<q>That his <hi>Holineſs</hi> need not wonder how <hi>in Reaſon of State</hi>
thoſe of <hi>different Religions</hi> might joyn together for <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Ends,</hi> without hazard of altering Religion; thus
<hi>David</hi> ſought Protection of the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi>
redeemed the <hi>ſinful Sodomites;</hi> That he took it to be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the ſame Ground, that his <hi>Holineſs</hi> himſelf not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
received a Perſian Ambaſſador, who was ſo far worſe
than an <hi>Heretick,</hi> that he never pretended to the Name
of a <hi>Chriſtian.</hi>
               </q> —With which Reaſon the Pope was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to acquieſce.</p>
            <p>Whatever <hi>Principles</hi> bigotted People may have advanc'd,
wiſe Princes have, and always will endeavour to act accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:97397:8"/>
to <hi>Reaſons of State</hi> and their true <hi>Intereſt.</hi> The Poets
tell us, that the Gods eſteemed themſelves obliged by no
Oath, but when they <hi>ſwore by Stix:</hi> The <hi>judicious Bacon</hi>
mythologizes it thus, that though ſome <hi>Princes</hi> ſcorn to be
Slaves to their Words, yet when their <hi>Interest</hi> runs paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel
with their <hi>Promiſes,</hi> you may rely upon their Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance.</p>
            <p>To remove our Suſpicions in this caſe, we have not only
the greateſt <hi>verbal</hi> Aſſurances that can be given from the
moſt ſteady and generous of Princes, but alſo the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of his <hi>Intereſt,</hi> together with that of all thoſe of his
<hi>Communion.</hi> It is <hi>His</hi> Intereſt, as to begin, ſo to <hi>continue</hi>
Liberty of Conſcience; as it allays <hi>Animoſities,</hi> ſecures his
own <hi>Peace,</hi> encreaſes <hi>People,</hi> augments <hi>Trade,</hi> advances
his Royal Revenue. And to ſettle it upon an <hi>impregnable
Foot,</hi> ſeems the greateſt Kindneſs he can do thoſe of his
<hi>own</hi> Perſuaſion; to give them any Encouragement to hope
further, will certainly embroil his Affairs, and in the End
may probably occaſion ſome great Diſaſter on that Party;
They being at moſt not much above one in ſixty, nay per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
not one in a hundred, (for I conceive our Author may
too much under-calculate, when he makes them but one in
two hundred) in number compared with the reſt of his
Subjects; the Force of which over-Proportion is alſo much
augmented by their inbred Averſion to <hi>Popery,</hi> than which
nothing can be more viſible throughout the Nation; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
add that the next <hi>Heirs</hi> in proſpect are both <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,</hi>
and beſtowed in <hi>Proteſtant Alliances,</hi> which muſt
needs unravel all the Web, and perhaps before it may be
compleatly woven.</p>
            <p>So that if any of the warmer <hi>Religious Orders</hi> ſhould think
of puſhing on any preſent Advantages, ſo far as to make
<hi>theirs</hi> the <hi>National</hi> Religion; as they are moſt unlikely to
ſucceed in ſuch a raſh Attempt, ſo the <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gentry</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:97397:9"/>
of their Party, and all that have <hi>Eſtates</hi> (who muſt ride
out any contingent Storm and ſtand <hi>at mark,</hi> whilſt others
may retreat to <hi>ſafe Covert</hi> abroad) cannot be ſo dull as not
to foreſee that whether they <hi>fail</hi> or <hi>proſper</hi> at preſent, they
muſt certainly expect to pay for it <hi>ſeverely</hi> hereafter, and
they cannot tell <hi>how ſoon,</hi> therefore will undoubtedly be
cautious of countenancing any ſuch <hi>precipitate Meaſures;</hi>
but rather being content with the Liberty of their <hi>own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences</hi>
and Enjoyment of their Natural <hi>Priviledges</hi> in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
with their Fellow-ſubjects will adjoyn their Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
towards tranſmitting that <hi>Eaſe</hi> and <hi>Happineſs</hi> to
their Poſterity, upon ſo comprehenſive a Foundation, that
it ſhall be the <hi>General Intereſt</hi> of the Nation to perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
it.</p>
            <p>It may therefore upon the whole matter, be moſt <hi>reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably,</hi>
as it ought moſt <hi>dutifully</hi> be believ'd, That his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's
<hi>reiterated Promiſes</hi> deſerve our entire Confidence;
That a Prince ſo <hi>Wiſe</hi> and <hi>Generous</hi> will not expoſe both
his own Eaſe and Grandeur, the <hi>Repoſe</hi> of his Realms, the
Honour of his <hi>Name,</hi> nay the Honour of his <hi>Religion,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the <hi>future Safety</hi> of all that profeſs it in theſe
Realms, to ſuch inevitable hazards; But rather that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
(as he has frankly declared) <hi>no more</hi> than to make
his Reign <hi>eaſy</hi> to Himſelf, and All his People, To leave
thoſe of his own Perſwaſion (as well as others) in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
leſs Burdenſom than for ſome Reigns paſt; And by
theſe ſweet and gentle Methods at once ſecure the <hi>future
Tranquillity</hi> of his Kingdoms, and raiſe a perpetual Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his own <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Clemency,</hi> whereunto His
great <hi>Experience</hi> as well as natural Goodneſs do diſpoſe
Him; The paſt Example of a <hi>mighty Monarchy</hi> reduced to
a great Declenſion chiefly by the Maxims of an over-zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<hi>Fierceneſs;</hi> Or that more Modern and Terrible One
of <hi>Another</hi> (the Conſequences of which may perhaps be
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:97397:9"/>
foreſeen without Conſulting <hi>Aſtrology)</hi> are no very invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Precedents for a prudent Prince to follow; eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
when the Difficulties <hi>here</hi> are ſo much more inſuperable
than they were in either of <hi>them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But after all this very Queſtion, whether we ſhall <hi>truſt</hi>
or <hi>ſuſpect,</hi> is in Truth impertinent, and has no room in our
preſent Caſe. His Majeſty, though he well <hi>deſerves,</hi> is yet
ſo gracious as not to <hi>require</hi> our Confidence <hi>gratis,</hi> he offers
a <hi>legal Eſtabliſhment</hi> of our common Religious Freedom; you
ſhall have at the ſame inſtant as good Security as can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed,
provided Terms be not inſiſted on, that are natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
repugnant to <hi>that Liberty</hi> intended to be Confirmed;
For if it be not <hi>General,</hi> it cannot be Effectual; But by a
General Security equally including <hi>All</hi> Parties, the Fears
and Jealouſies of <hi>Each</hi> muſt vaniſh, and their ſeveral In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts
<hi>Concentre</hi> to continue Inviolable: For whatever
may be the Deſires and Inclinations of <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi>
'tis certainly their <hi>Interest</hi> to ſecure themſelves with the
Multitude; And if it prove a Security to <hi>Them,</hi> 'tis ſo to
others: If not to <hi>others,</hi> it will likewiſe <hi>fail</hi> them when
they may need it; Therefore they are as much concern'd
as any, to make a <hi>ſound Proviſion.</hi> That which defends
the Whole, preſerves every Part; But a Partial Security is
imperfect and dangerous.</p>
            <p>As to the Particulars, or <hi>Modalities</hi> of ſuch Security, 'tis
the Work of the <hi>Great Council of the Kingdom:</hi> And as it
would be a <hi>ſawcy Vanity</hi> for a private Perſon to preſcribe, ſo
it can be no leſs <hi>Preſumption</hi> in any to ſay, That the <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of the Nation</hi> can find no Expedients inſtead of the
<hi>Teſts,</hi> which without being (like them) appropriated to
the Intereſt of a <hi>ſingle</hi> Party, or invading Mens Civil
Rights or Priviledges for Matters of Conſcience (as they
do) may yet no leſs, nay more effectually prevent all Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions
of any one Parties over-running the reſt. If

            <p>The <hi>Letter-Writer</hi>'s next Suggeſtion why we ought to

how miraculous a thing it is, <hi>That the Men of</hi> Taunton <hi>and</hi>

Sir! Either ceaſe, or encreaſe your Aſtoniſhment; there
are other ſtrange violent <hi>Metamorphoſes</hi> abroad, altogether
as ſurpriſing; the old Declaimers againſt <hi>Fears</hi> and <hi>Jealouſies</hi>

for more than twenty years in Invectives againſt <hi>Diſſenters,</hi>
and promoted the moſt violent Proſecutions againſt them,
as often as the Government did not reſtrain them, <hi>are now</hi>
(if your News <hi>pag.</hi> 10. be true) <hi>overflowing with the ſpirit of
Peace, Charity and Condeſcenſion. And all their former Haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs
is for ever extinguiſhed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is certainly a <hi>ſudden</hi> unexpected Change, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we are inclinable to take your Advice <hi>pag.</hi> 3. and <hi>pauſe a

            <p>We forget not the Affairs of <hi>Taunton</hi> and <hi>Tiverton,</hi> and

            <p>Let us not flatter our ſelves, or <hi>calumniate</hi> others; Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion

Sufferings <hi>equal</hi> at leaſt with any other Party, to make

And alſo, if they deſerve it, may be made uſe of, and <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred</hi>

they are <hi>open Denyers</hi> of our ever bleſſed <hi>Saviour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hitherto we find this Author's Arguments of <hi>no force</hi> to
perſuade us to abandon our <hi>Intereſt</hi> and <hi>Duty,</hi> which are both
inſeparably <hi>wound up</hi> in our lawful endeavours to get the <hi>Penal
Laws</hi> repeal'd.—But if he cannot delude us with <hi>Sophiſtry,</hi> he
will affright us with <hi>Mormo's</hi> and <hi>Hobgoblins;</hi> Give him leave
but to <hi>ſuppoſe for you,</hi> &amp; then if you do not <hi>runout of your Wits,</hi>
he pronounces <hi>your Courage too dangerous a virtue to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as he offers no proofs for his <hi>Suppoſals,</hi> ſo they are
founded neither on <hi>Truth</hi> nor <hi>Probability.</hi> He imagines ſome
<hi>criminal Alliance</hi> between the Roman <hi>Catholicks</hi> and <hi>Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
when there is nothing more than a joint Concurrence
(prompted by their Common Intereſt, and juſtified by the
firſt Principles of <hi>Religion, Reaſon,</hi> and <hi>Policy)</hi> to remove
unwarrantable and oppreſſive <hi>Shackles</hi> upon Conſcience,
and withal at the ſame time advance ſuch a <hi>Legal Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
as may ſecure, not only themſelves, but all others too,
in their Rights, both as <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what need was there of any <hi>Mediators</hi> armed with
Power of giving <hi>Encouragements</hi> and <hi>Rewards</hi> to induce
Men to ſuch an innocent undertaking, no leſs advantagious
to all others (nay more to the <hi>Church-men)</hi> than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves?</p>
            <p>As Part of this Alliance or an <hi>Effect</hi> thereof, 'tis plain, he
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:97397:11"/>
reckons the Diſſenters returning of <hi>Thanks</hi> to his Majeſty
for his Declaration of <hi>Indulgence,</hi> and then at once to caſt
an inſolent <hi>Reflection</hi> on his Majeſty, or his Miniſters of State,
and to expoſe the diſſenting Miniſters as Mercinaries, ſuch as
act not upon Principles of Conſcience or Honour, but may
eaſily be drawn by a little Money to any lewd Compliance,
although to the Ruin of the Proteſtant Religion, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
of all our Municipal Laws, and the very Conſtitution
of our Engliſh Government, (for elſewhere he brands <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing</hi>
with no leſs miſchievous Tendencies, ſee <hi>pag.</hi> 9. &amp;
10.) He proceeds to advance two moſt <hi>ſcandalous Charges.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt, <hi>pag.</hi> 5. by way of Suggeſtion, as if <hi>ſome</hi> (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
implied in a like Negotiation) had now <hi>by Authority,
ſprinkled Mony among the Diſſenting Miniſters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other, <hi>pag.</hi> 7. in a poſitive Affirmation, <hi>That the firſt
Draughts of the Addreſſes</hi> (he ſpeaks generally, <hi>that fly abroad
every week,</hi> and with an Air of Scorn and Malice,—<hi>murther us
with another to the ſame)</hi> are made by the Prieſts [which
cannot otherwiſe be meant than of <hi>Roman Prieſts]</hi> and that
the <hi>Diſſenters Part is only to write them out fairer.—</hi> [His
Kindneſs it ſeems will allow them to be the <hi>better Scribes,</hi> tho
<hi>ſuch Dunces</hi> as not able to expreſs their <hi>own Thoughts</hi> ſo well
as certain <hi>inviſible Fathers</hi> who know nothing of them.]</p>
            <p>Now if both theſe, be (as I dare, with all aſſurance, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verr,
they are) utterly falſe, then I hope the World will
partly underſtand the <hi>Temper</hi> of the <hi>Writer,</hi> and <hi>Deſign</hi> of
his Paper, and entertain both with that <hi>Abhorrence,</hi> due to
one that regards neither <hi>Reſpect</hi> to his <hi>Prince,</hi> nor <hi>Juſtice</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
his Neighbours, nor any Meaſures either of <hi>Charity</hi>
or <hi>Truth</hi> or common Honeſty; ſo he may but reach his ends,
of dividing the Diſſenters amongſt themſelves, and expoſing
them all to the <hi>Contempt</hi> and Hatred of others; fomenting
Miſapprehenſions and Jealouſies, thereby to frame an <hi>Engine</hi>
both for their <hi>Ruin,</hi> and for continuing the exorbitant Power
of <hi>that Party</hi> for whom he is an Advocate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:97397:12"/>
But how do we demonſtrate that there is no Truth in the
Particulars he hints at? I confeſs it is impoſſible <hi>apodictically</hi>
to prove ſuch an univerſal Negative; but if offering as much
towards it as the <hi>nature of the thing</hi> will bear, may be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,
I doubt not but to ſatisfy all the impartial World.</p>
            <p>1. The manner of our Author's talking, argues a Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
of <hi>Guilt,</hi> and has all the natural Features of a <hi>Libel;</hi>
nothing aſſerted, but blind Hints, and <hi>Innuendo's</hi> thrown
out; Baits fair enough to catch <hi>Gudgeons,</hi> and make them
ſwallow the <hi>Calumny;</hi> but yet ſo cautiouſly worded, as to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
a <hi>Retreat</hi> when taxed with down-right <hi>Slander.</hi> His <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis</hi>
he thought, might amuſe, but where is his <hi>Aſſumption</hi>
that ſhould prove? <hi>If thoſe Men that formerly ſprinkled Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
amongſt the Diſſenting Miniſters, ſhould</hi> (ſays he) <hi>by the
SAME A<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>THORITY now do the like, and disburſe where
they cannot otherwiſe perſuade.—</hi> He ought to have added;—
<hi>But thoſe very Men have now done the ſame,—</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
proved, and not till then, he might have inferred (as he
does) <hi>that is ſeems rather an Evidence than a Preſumption of the
Deceit;</hi> Whereas now, his Diſcourſe is a Rope of incoherent
Sand, and may thus, and much better be retorted,—If
this Author have only <hi>dreamed,</hi> or <hi>invidiouſly forged</hi> this Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal,
as is highly probable, becauſe he produces no Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
for it, (which in Reaſon it muſt be thought he would
have done, could he have procured any) then 'tis rather an
Evidence than Preſumption of Deceit, and ſomething elſe
which I am not willing to expreſs by its proper Name.</p>
            <p>2. This Inſinuation about ſprinkling of Mony conſiſts of
two parts: 1. That ſuch a thing was once, and by Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
too, done formerly, to the Diſſenting Miniſters. 2. The
like again now by the very ſame Men.—Here we are left
altogether in the dark <hi>when,</hi> or how long ago this <hi>formerly</hi>
was; but it ſeems 'twas within Memory, becauſe by the ſame
Negotiators. Now I do well remember, that Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> in
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:97397:12"/>
the Preface to a Book, Intituled, <hi>An Enquiry &amp;c.</hi> partly in
Anſwer to the Reverend Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi>'s Diſcourſe of the
Unreaſonableneſs of Separation, printed <hi>Anno</hi> 1681, takes
notice of a Report then advanced, <q>
                  <hi>That the</hi> Nonconformiſts
<hi>ſome of them at leaſt, do receive, or have received Money from
the Papiſts to act their Affairs, and promote their Intereſt.</hi>
               </q> And
then he tells the World, <q>
                  <hi>That 'tis ſuch a malicious frontleſs
Lye as Impudence it ſelf would bluſh at, That thoſe by whom it
was firſt whiſpered probably underſtood better than the</hi> Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts
<hi>what Influence</hi> Money, <hi>or the things which they knew
how to turn into it, had into their Profeſſion and Actings in
Religion;</hi>
               </q> Whereunto he adds (I had almoſt ſaid <hi>propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally)</hi>
theſe Words, ☞ <q>It ſeems to me that ſome ſuch Men
are afraid, leſt the preſent Oppoſition unto Popery ſhould
iſſue in <hi>ſuch an Eſtabliſhment</hi> of the Proteſtant Religion,
as that hereafter it ſhould not be in the diſpoſal of any,
nor in their Power to make a Bargain of it, either for their
Advantage, or in their Neceſſity.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And a little after, ſpeaking of <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> He ſays, <q>How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they may be Traduced or Accuſed, they will continue
in giving the higheſt Security that Conſcience, Profeſſion,
Principles, Intereſt and Actions can give of their Stability
in the ſame [Proteſtant] Cauſe; only the deſire to be
excuſed, if they make not uſe of this notable Engine for
oppoſing of Popery, namely, the ſtirring up of Jealouſies,
Fears and Animoſities amongſt Proteſtants, which others
judge ſerviceable to that End.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And in the next Page, <q>Becauſe I know my ſelf herein
peculiarly reflected on, I do avow, That never any one
Perſon in Authority, Dignity, or Power in the Nation,
Nor any one that had any Relation unto Publick Affairs,
nor any from them, Papiſt or Proteſtant, did once ſpeak one
Word to me, or adviſe with me, about any Indulgence or
Toleration to be granted unto Papiſts; I challenge all the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:97397:13"/>
World who are otherwiſe minded, to intermit their Service
for a ſeaſon unto the great falſe Accuſer, and prove the
contrary if they can; The Perſons are ſufficiently known
of whom they may make their Enquiry.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus that <hi>Learned Worthy Man.—</hi> And can any Body that
knew him, judg that he would either in Piety or Prudence
print at ſuch a rate (in a time when <hi>enow</hi> would have been
ready to detect it), if what he ſo <hi>amply</hi> and <hi>earneſtly</hi> denies,
had in it any Colour of <hi>Truth?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet ſince he remarks, it was at that time become a publick
<hi>Slander,</hi> 'tis highly probable <hi>this</hi> was what <hi>our Author</hi> would
hint at, in the firſt Branch of his Suppoſition, if at leaſt he
thereby <hi>meant any thing,</hi> or had ſo much as any old <hi>baffled
Story</hi> whereon to ground the Figment; For, perhaps, we
ſhall wrong the Gentlemans Invention, not to aſcribe it alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
to his <hi>own teeming</hi> Imagination.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Non Entis nullae ſunt Affectiones,</hi> If there were no ſuch
<hi>pecuniary ſprinklings</hi> heretofore, then none <hi>now,</hi> according to
the <hi>Letter-writers</hi> own Account, for he ſuppoſes the latter to
be done by the <hi>ſame Inſtruments, and in the ſame Methods;</hi>
And ſo all his <hi>Tattle</hi> about <hi>Miniſters who having fallen under
ſuch Temptations, are engaged to continue their Frailty, by
the Awe they are in, leſt it ſhould be expoſed, &amp;c.</hi> becomes
inſignificant.</p>
            <p>4. If there were any ſuch Artifices of <hi>Bribing Ministers,</hi>
or of having <hi>Addreſſes penn'd by Jeſuits,</hi> or other Popiſh
Prieſts, <hi>ſent to Diſſenters</hi> whoſe part was only to <hi>Copy, Sign,
and Preſent</hi> them, it is moſt reaſonable to believe, That ſuch
Intrigues muſt be practiſed upon thoſe that <hi>moſt early</hi> Addreſſed,
to the end others might be invited to follow. But ſo far is this
from any Reſemblance of Truth, That the <hi>firſt Addreſſers</hi> in
this kind, were ſo ſcrupulous as not to impart their Intentions
to any but thoſe of their <hi>own Communion,</hi> till the Form was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſted
and agreed upon amongſt themſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:97397:13"/>
And for the full <hi>Detection</hi> of any ſuch Practices as are inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated,
I have <hi>Commiſſion</hi> from Perſons ſufficiently able to
anſwer ſuch an Engagement, to <hi>Advertiſe</hi> and <hi>Aſſure</hi> all the
World,</p>
            <p>That if any Perſon or Perſons can make appear ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
That there was any <hi>Money</hi> or Moneys worth what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever,
directly or indirectly, <hi>Given, Promiſed, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded</hi>
to any of the Perſons that did firſt Addreſs,
<hi>viz.</hi> That of the <hi>Baptiſts,</hi> That of the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> or
that of the <hi>Congregational Perſuaſion</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
them, or any of them, to make ſuch Addreſs; Or
that there was any <hi>Draught</hi> or <hi>Copy</hi> of any of the ſaid
Addreſſes, or any part thereof (drawn by any Perſon or
Perſons, other than ſome of thoſe that ſubſcribed the
ſame reſpectively) ever ſent, ſhewn, or propoſed to
any of the <hi>Subſcribers,</hi> That then the Perſon or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
making ſuch Diſcovery, ſhall, upon his or their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
to the <hi>Bookſeller,</hi> whoſe <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Habitation</hi>
is hereunto prefix'd, receive Directions where and of
whom, He or They, and every of them making ſuch
Diſcovery, may and ſhall (beſides moſt hearty thanks)
have, and be honeſtly and <hi>Bonâ Fide</hi> paid a Reward of
<hi>Fifty Pounds</hi> of Lawful Money of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The reſt of his Suppoſals are of the <hi>ſame Leaven</hi> both for
<hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Charity.</hi> Who are <hi>thoſe Diſſenters,</hi> and on what
part of the <hi>Globe</hi> do they dwell, (For ſure they muſt be <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipodes</hi>
to <hi>Ours)</hi> that preach up <hi>Anger and Vengeance againſt
the Church of England?</hi> That are <hi>under a Contract which obliges
them upon a Forfeiture to make uſe of Inflaming Eloquence?</hi> That
apprehend <hi>their Wages would be retrench'd, if they ſhould be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate?—</hi> Quite contrary, they have, with a moſt
<hi>Chriſtian Moderation,</hi> ſo far overcome the Reſentments of
their paſt <hi>hard Uſage,</hi> or <hi>preſent Provocations,</hi> that they treat
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:97397:14"/>
               <hi>that Church</hi> with all Friendlineſs and Reſpect; But think they
mean her <hi>no Harm</hi> when they wiſh thoſe <hi>dangerous Weapons</hi>
out of her hands, which ſhe has ſo long indiſcreetly made
uſe of, only to <hi>ruine other</hi> innocent People, and <hi>ſtab</hi> her <hi>own
Reputation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Does this Sir Politick <hi>T. W.</hi> or <hi>W. T.</hi> (for ſome Criticks
think that the truer Reading) imagine Liberty of Conſcience,
or Freedom to worſhip our Creator in <hi>ſuch manner</hi> as we are
convinc'd to be moſt agreeable to <hi>his Will,</hi> without being
<hi>jailed</hi> or <hi>undone</hi> for the ſame; and without being ſcarr'd by
ſever Temporal Penalties to joyn externally and Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critically
in a Religious Worſhip, which our Conſciences
tell us is ſinful; does he, I ſay, conceit this noble Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,
ſo <hi>cheap and vile a thing</hi> that none will appear for it but
ſuch as are either <hi>ſuborned</hi> with Money, or have deſerved to
be <hi>hang'd?</hi> Is it not a pretty Notion, and much becoming a
<hi>Stateſman,</hi> that thoſe who chiefly to aſſert Liberty of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
(though in a very bad and irregular way) incurr'd the
Want of a <hi>Pardon,</hi> muſt after ſuch Pardon obtained, needs
act againſt their Conſciences, if they offer to perſwade any
to endeavour the ſettling ſuch Liberty regularly in a <hi>Legal
Courſe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is his next <hi>politick Squint</hi> leſs impertinent, as if <hi>one Prince</hi>
might not for Reaſons of State continue Friendſhip with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
whoſe Conduct in ſome Particulars he highly <hi>diſapproves;</hi>
nor know I how, in that caſe, he can more effectually declare
ſuch diſlike, than by ſteering a direct contrary Courſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>His Noiſe of ſolliciting <hi>Addreſſes,</hi> the <hi>Tyring Poſt-Horſes</hi>
with <hi>Circular Letters,</hi> and <hi>threatning,</hi> where <hi>Perſwaſions</hi> would
not ſerve to procure them, is all but the Product of a very
<hi>bold Imagination;</hi> And he has been ſufficiently challenged to
give but <hi>one ſingle Inſtance.</hi> Sure the Gentleman is Maſter
of no great Stock of <hi>Gratitude</hi> at home, that he can think
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:97397:14"/>
the whole Nation ſo wondrous barren of it, on one of the

the Diſſenters for their <hi>Forwardneſs,</hi> and yet would have the
World believe they were very <hi>backward</hi> in <hi>Addreſſing—</hi>
But ſtill, wherein I pray, lies the harm of the thing it ſelf,
that either there ſhould need ſuch Variety of Artifices to
draw in the <hi>unwilling;</hi> Or that can render them <hi>criminal</hi> that
did with all ready Zeal make thoſe grateful Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?
This he undertakes to tell us, <hi>pag.</hi> 8. &amp; 9. (for I
follow the <hi>firſt Edition)</hi> and the Sum of his Diſcourſe amounts
to neither more nor leſs than <hi>this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the King's Declaration for Liberty of Conſcience was
an IRREG<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>LAR ACT <hi>[Very dutifully ſpoken!]</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> ought not to have taken any notice of it,
but to have forborn the Publick Exerciſe of their Religion, till
a Parliament had allowed it <hi>[which if he and his Aſſociates
can help it, ſhall never be]</hi> But ſince they did not only receive
the Benefit granted, but publickly return his Majeſty Thanks
for it, they thereby give a Blow to all the Laws by which their
Religion and Liberty are to be protected, and fall foul upon
<hi>Magna Charta [Which</hi> Chapter <hi>of it I beſeech you Sir?]</hi>
gave up their Right in the Laws; for after giving Thanks for
the Breach of one Law, they loſe the Right of complaining
of the Breach of all the reſt.</p>
            <p>This is <hi>ſed News!</hi> but as good Luck would have it, there
is not one Article of it <hi>true;</hi> for the Kings's Declaration was
in it ſelf, not only a very pious, prudent and gracious, but
(according to the antient Conſtitution of this Realm) a
moſt <hi>Legal Act.</hi> The <hi>Diſſenters</hi> had been the moſt <hi>inexcuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:97397:15"/>
peeviſh</hi> People in the World, if they had not accepted of
it, the <hi>most ungrateful</hi> if they had not thankfully acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
it, and will be the moſt <hi>ſtupid Neglecters</hi> of their own
Intereſt, both <hi>Religious</hi> and <hi>Civil,</hi> if they do not exret all
their Endeavours towards having it eſtabliſhed for Poſterity
by a <hi>Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this occaſion it may be expected, that I ſhould enter
into a long Diſcourſe in Affirmance of his Majeſties <hi>Right</hi> to
diſpenſe with Coercive Laws <hi>in Matters of Religion:</hi> But
ſince that is already done by a <hi>far better Hand</hi> in a <hi>Just Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe</hi>
(which may poſſibly er'e long ſee the Light) I ſhall not
<hi>actum agere,</hi> or inlay my <hi>Copper</hi> with that <hi>Noble</hi> Author's <hi>Gold;</hi>
but content my ſelf to ſay in general,</p>
            <p>1. <hi>That as it was the Right of our <hi>Engliſh Kings</hi> by the
<hi>Common Law,</hi> ſo it has been confirmed to themby ſeveral <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes;</hi>
and they have accordingly exerted it time out of mind;
and particularly 'tis reſerved to the <hi>Crown</hi> by the Statute of
22 <hi>Car.</hi> 2 cap. 1. <hi>for preventing and ſuppreſſing ſeditious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles,
in theſe Words,—</hi>
               </hi> Provided, That neither this
Act, nor any thing therein contained, ſhall extend to invali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
or avoid his Majeſties Supremacy in Eccleſiaſtical Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs;
But that his Majeſty and his Heirs and Succeſſors
may from time to time, and at all times hereafter, exerciſe
and enjoy all Powers and Authority in Eccleſiaſtical Affairs as
fully and as amply as himſelf, or any of his Predeceſſors
have, or might have done the ſame; Any thing in this Act
notwithſtanding.</p>
            <p>2. As to what is alledged touching all other Laws, being
by this <hi>Precedent</hi> ſhaken; and that ſuch as give Thanks for
the Breach of <hi>One Law,</hi> preclude themſelves from complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Breach of all the reſt; becauſe on the like Ground
the King may <hi>Repeal</hi> any other <hi>Statutes</hi> without Common
Conſent in <hi>Parliament.—</hi> It may readily be anſwered
(beſides what has been already pointed at in the foregoing
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:97397:15"/>
               <hi>graph)</hi> That there is a great difference between <hi>Repealing</hi> a
Law, and relaxing or diſpenſing with the <hi>Penalty;</hi> The firſt
can only be done in Parliament, the latter has been always ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
to be Part of the <hi>Royal Prerogative.</hi> For example,
the Law dooms every Perſon convicted of <hi>Burghlary</hi> or <hi>pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Pocket,</hi> to die: Our Kings have frequently in all times
remitted the <hi>Execution:</hi> Was this ever thought to be a Repeal
of thoſe Laws? or any Infringment of all the reſt?</p>
            <p>And if it be ſo in Civil Caſes, wherein the Subject is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in the Injury, and where the Matter to be reſtrained
by the Laws, is not only <hi>Malum prohibitum,</hi> but <hi>Malum in ſe,</hi>
not meerly <hi>evil,</hi> becauſe forbidden, but <hi>forbidden</hi> becauſe
intrinſecally <hi>evil;</hi> Then <hi>(a fortiori)</hi> much more ſtrongly it
follows, that his Majeſty may ſuſpend the Execution of the
Penalties, which by <hi>theſe Laws</hi> relating to Eccleſiaſtical Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
are inflicted on <hi>Actions</hi> or <hi>Defaults</hi> ſo far from being in
themſelves <hi>Criminal,</hi> That a very great part of them are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
allow'd by the Laws of <hi>God, Nature,</hi> and <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſo much the rather may his Majeſty exert this Right,
ſince theſe Penal Statutes generally in their <hi>Preambles</hi> (which
are <hi>Claves Legum,</hi> the <hi>Keys</hi> that open to us the <hi>Occaſion,</hi> and
conſequently the main <hi>Scope</hi> and End of Enacting them) af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
that they were made for the Security of the Princes <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi>
and to prevent <hi>Treaſon, Inſurrections</hi> and <hi>Sedition;</hi> ſo
that his Majeſty is principally and immediately concern'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in;
and ſince <hi>He</hi> muſt be allowed the beſt Judg of his <hi>own Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi>
if he ſhall find that there is <hi>no need</hi> of putting <hi>ſuch Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes</hi>
in Execution to that End; but rather that the <hi>Non-Execution</hi>
thereof will more conduce to his Safety, and the
publick Repoſe; and therefore thinks fit to <hi>ſuperſede</hi> or
forbear the exacting the Penalties, Where is the Wrong? To
whom the Injury?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:97397:16"/>
So that hitherto neither was the King's Declaration an <hi>Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular
Act,</hi> nor the Diſſenters thanking him for it any ſuch
deſperate Buſineſs as to make them <hi>forfeit their Right in all
other Laws</hi> of their Country; but moſt true it is that whilſt
theſe <hi>Church-driving Laws</hi> ſtand in Force, if the Execution
of them happen into ſome <hi>Hands,</hi> we know by Experience
that there are a <hi>thouſand</hi> very ſmall <hi>Matters,</hi> of which any
one, by the dexterous Management of the Gentlemen of
<hi>Doctors Commons,</hi> is enough not only to ſtrip any Man of
his Intereſt <hi>in the Laws,</hi> but ſend his Body to the <hi>Gaol,</hi> and (in
their aprehenſion) his <hi>Soul to the Devil</hi> to boot.</p>
            <p>And who can but <hi>Bluſh</hi> to hear ſome People upbraid the
<hi>Romaniſts</hi> with that Tenet, <hi>That Faith is not to be kept with
Hereticks</hi> (which yet they, with the higheſt Aſſeverations,
diſclaim) whilſt at the ſame time, <hi>Themſelves</hi> would have ſo
many Laws kept on Foot, that give opportunity to every
Villain to <hi>cheat</hi> any honeſt Man, by taking Advantage of his
<hi>Conſcientious Diſſent</hi> in Matters of Religion, from the Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd
Mode; Witneſs the pleading of <hi>Excommunication</hi> in Bar
of a juſt Action; And the Diſablement o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> 
               <hi>ſo many</hi> to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
any Suit at Law, or in Equity, unleſs they firſt both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the <hi>Sacrament</hi> according to the Uſage of the <hi>Church of
England,</hi> and take the <hi>Teſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But—<hi>Parcius iſta viris—</hi> The Gentleman owns, That <hi>the
Church of</hi> England <hi>preſerving too long the bitter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Taſte of that
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſage They had received in the times of our former Confuſions,
ſacrific'd their Intereſt to their Revenge.</hi> [A great Truth, I had
almoſt ſaid, the <hi>only</hi> one in his Paper.] But now (quoth he)
<hi>they are ſenſible of their Miſtake, all their former Haughtineſs is
for ever extinguiſh'd; Therefore you may ſecurely trust them, That
in the next Parliament</hi> [If you Diſſenters will be Quiet and
ſuffer them to carry <hi>Elections</hi> as they pleaſe] <hi>They will do you
Reaſon; Ay, and</hi> you <hi>ſhall have</hi> Liberty, <hi>and the</hi> Papiſts <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
a</hi> Bit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:97397:16"/>
Is there any Body that deſerves not to wear a <hi>Muckender,</hi>
but muſt needs ſee through all this? What better Hopes can
Diſſenters conceive of <hi>another Parliament</hi> of Bigotted Church-Men
than of the <hi>Last?</hi> who were generally <hi>ſtanch</hi> that way.
To go about to wheadle us with Promiſes of Liberty to
<hi>Proteſtants,</hi> but excluſive of <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> is, at this time of
day, ſuch a <hi>palpable Banter</hi> as only ſhews the contemptible O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
they have of the Diſſenters <hi>Intellectuals.</hi> Can it be
imagined, That <hi>the King</hi> can ever paſs it? Would it not be
extravagant <hi>Rudeneſs</hi> to offer it? Nay, have not They them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
already by their Proxies made <hi>Overtures</hi> to the direct
contrary?</p>
            <p>To pretend now, That They were only the Inſtruments,
not the <hi>Authors</hi> of the late Violences towards <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> as it
expoſes their Prudence and Honeſty in the <hi>Fact,</hi> ſo it mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts
their <hi>Inſincerity</hi> in the Excuſe; did they not <hi>by Concert</hi>
throughout the Nation both in <hi>Pulpits, Prints,</hi> and <hi>Practices,</hi>
inſtigate and warrantize thoſe Outrages? Have we not ſeen
them in Perſon animating <hi>Informers,</hi> and with their <hi>own hands</hi>
in ſome places pulling down <hi>Meeting-Houſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay ſo high had the inveterate Venom ſwell'd, that even
diſtreſſed <hi>Foreign Protestants</hi> felt part of its Fury; For by ſome
of their good Wills none of the poor <hi>Ruinated Hugenots,</hi>
ſhould have had any ſhare of that <hi>Noble Charity</hi> which <hi>Royal
Mercy</hi> had allow'd to be Collected, and true Engliſh Bounty
plentifully Contributed for their Relief; But they muſt not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<hi>ſtarve,</hi> unleſs they would firſt conform to certain
<hi>Rituals,</hi> which either they did not <hi>understand,</hi> or elſe could
not be ſuppoſed (according to their Education) able in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
to <hi>comply with,</hi> and ſo in flying <hi>one Rape</hi> upon their
<hi>Souls,</hi> were dangerouſly expoſed to <hi>another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet notwithſtanding all theſe too common and unwarrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<hi>Tranſports,</hi> it muſt be acknowledged, there were divers
of the <hi>Eſtabliſh'd Clergy</hi> who kept themſelves free from that
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:97397:17"/>
Epidemical Infection of the <hi>perſecuting Spirit,</hi> who did Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianly
interpoſe, and venture far in their Endeavours to ſtem
the impetuous Torrent: The Author of the ſeveral <hi>Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts
Pleas for the Nonconformiſts;</hi> The Reverend <hi>Protestant
Reconciler;</hi> honeſt Mr. <hi>B—lds,</hi> and probably more than I
have met with, did publickly appear in <hi>Print;</hi> And others in
their <hi>Sermons</hi> and <hi>Practices</hi> declared their more healing and
pacifick Principles. May their Names be never mentioned
without Reſpect and Honour! May they never ſtand <hi>in need</hi>
of that Compaſſion which they ſo bravely vouchſafed to others
under Perſecution! May their <hi>Memories</hi> be had in perpetual
Renown; and eſpecially let their <hi>Moderation</hi> for ever be
imitated!</p>
            <p>But as to the Generality of thoſe that pride themſelves with
the Title of <hi>Churchmen,</hi> it cannot be denied, That as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd
ſuch their <hi>moderate Brethren</hi> with the odious Nick-Name
of <hi>Trimmers,</hi> ſo themſelves went on <hi>Jehu's Pace,</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but a ſtrict and ſevere Execution of all the moſt rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Laws would content them; They daily both irritated
<hi>Magiſtrates</hi> and the <hi>Skum</hi> of the People to the <hi>Holy Work;</hi>
At <hi>Guild-Hall</hi>-Chappel we have heard ſuch enflaming Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick
as this (ſpeaking of the Diſſenters) <q>Let them not call it
<hi>Perſecution,</hi> 'tis a juſt and neceſſary <hi>Proſecution,</hi> and the <hi>most</hi>
they can ſuffer, is the <hi>least</hi> they <hi>deſerve.</hi>
               </q> In purſuance of ſuch
<hi>Pulpit</hi>-Maxims, Laws, tho <hi>too harſh</hi> in themſelves, were wyre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn
abundantly further than the apparent Intent of the
Makers. Common Juſtice denied to any that appeared under
the Character of Diſſenters; palpable Perjuries wink't at;
<hi>Riots</hi> made not only of the moſt peaceable Aſſemblies to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
God, but of the <hi>Friendly Viſits</hi> of Relations; Nay where
the <hi>ſmall Number</hi> found, were not ſufficient to colour <hi>a Legal
Proſecution</hi> on that pretence, <hi>a Servant</hi> attending one that
came to ſurprize them, has been <hi>clapt in for a Party</hi> in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment,
and an <hi>Outragious Fine</hi> thereupon enforced to be
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:97397:17"/>
paid; As in the Caſe of a <hi>worthy Citizen</hi> near <hi>London-Bridg;</hi>
How Juries <hi>Brow-beaten,</hi> and forc'd to preſent Men on the
23 <hi>Eliz.</hi> contrary to their Conſciences; Some troubled on a
<hi>double</hi> Conviction before two ſeveral Magiſtrates for one and
the ſame Offence; The <hi>Fines</hi> frequently Extravagant, as
one Man at a Seſſions in <hi>Surrey</hi> was compell'd to pay down
100 pound, for being at one Meeting. In brief, <hi>no Wood</hi>
came amiſs to make <hi>Arrows</hi> of, for the Deſtruction of the
<hi>Diſſenters; Delenda erat Carthago,</hi> all <hi>Nonconformists</hi> were to
be ruined in all places, after the Example of <hi>Briſtol, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At this paſs matters ſtood when His Majeſty vouchſaf'd to
hold forth his <hi>Golden Scepter,</hi> and put a Stop to all theſe <hi>Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages</hi>
and <hi>Calamities:</hi> And what Security does this unknown
Author give us, that it may not be ſo again one day, if theſe
Penal Laws be not utterly removed? How does it appear
that the Sentiments of the Church of <hi>England</hi> towards Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters
are chang'd, unleſs it be to a greater degree of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice?
Or that their Haughtineſs is for ever extinct, but rather
encreaſed? For Example, but ten miles up the Thames, a
good while ſince the Declaration, a Parſon refus'd to Bury
a Child, becauſe Baptized by a <hi>Nonconformist</hi>-Miniſter, ſo
that all the Company aſſembled for the Funeral were forc'd
to depart, and the Infant's Corps to be kept above Ground
all Night; And hardly would he be induced by any Entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
to permit its Interment the next day, and then too with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
vouchſafing his <hi>Reverencies</hi> Preſence.</p>
            <p>I would not file particular Mens Failures to the Reproach
of a Community amongſt whom are ſo many <hi>Learned worthy</hi>
Men; But this I cannot forbear to ſay, That if the Church of
<hi>England</hi> would be credited, ſhe ought publickly declare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Perſecuting <hi>Spirit,</hi> and make her <hi>Repentance</hi> as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
as the <hi>Scandal:</hi> Whereas her conteſting ſo ſtifly for
the Continuance of the <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> argues too <hi>broadly</hi> that
ſhe ſtill retains the <hi>very ſame</hi> Inclinations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:97397:18"/>
And indeed this mighty <hi>Stir</hi> and <hi>Outery</hi> of keeping up the
<hi>Teſts,</hi> or elſe we <hi>are all undone,</hi> is no more than that of old,
<hi>Great is Diana of the Epheſians!</hi> For by theſe <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Teſts</hi>
the <hi>Church-men</hi> (though but <hi>one</hi> Part, and that not the
greateſt, of the Nation) have not only engroſſed and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
to themſelves all the <hi>Preferments</hi> and <hi>Offices,</hi> all Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of <hi>Profit, Honour,</hi> and <hi>Truſt</hi> throughout the Kingdom;
but alſo an opportunity of Ruinating all, or any of the <hi>other
Parties</hi> at pleaſure. Theſe are <hi>too ſweet</hi> Morſels to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorg'd
without ſome <hi>Reluctancy;</hi> And they may be excus'd in
<hi>Policy,</hi> if they uſe <hi>all Efforts</hi> to continue their Enjoyment, or
Hopes at leaſt, of ſuch <hi>abſolute Advantages;</hi> But in the mean
time the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> will be unpardonably <hi>remiſs,</hi> if they hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to the Voice of theſe <hi>Charmers,</hi> and neglect ſuch an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of <hi>Enfranchizing</hi> Themſelves and Poſterity.</p>
            <p>Nor can I imagine what our Author means by that <hi>Hecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Rhodomantado,</hi> pag. 12. How his <hi>Church can in a moment
bring Clouds again, and turn the Royal Thunder upon the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters
heads, Blow them off the Stage in a Breath, if She would
give but a Smile, or a kind word: That the leaſt Glimpſe of her
Compliance would throw them back into a ſtate of Suffering,
and draw upon them all the Arrears of Severity which have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crued
during this time of Kindneſs to them:—But She will
not allow her ſelf to be reſcued</hi> [From what?] <hi>by ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtifiable
means, but chuſeth to bear the Weight of Power, rather
than lie under the Burthen of being Criminal.</hi> And to the ſame
purpoſe he talks elſewhere, That his Church <hi>had the first
Court-ſhips, which ſhe rejected, and is ready to ſuffer, rather
than receive all Advantages that can be gain'd by a Criminal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance.—</hi>
Now beſides the moſt inſolent Aſperſion hereby
thrown on his Majeſty (as if he were rather her <hi>Servant</hi> than
her <hi>Soveraign)</hi> that ſhe can ſo eaſily induce him to violate his
<hi>ſolemn Promiſes</hi> for her Pleaſure; I would gladly learn what
this expected and ſo much courted <hi>Smile</hi> might be, that can
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:97397:18"/>
perform <hi>ſuch Miracles?</hi> What it was <hi>His Church</hi> refuſed, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than <hi>criminally</hi> comply with?</p>
            <p>Was it that her <hi>Sons</hi> ſhould <hi>all turn Papiſts?</hi> This indeed
would notably vary the Scene of Affairs, and by caſting the
<hi>Over-ballance</hi> to that Party, alter the <hi>Politick Interest;</hi> and
yet even in ſuch caſe the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> would truſt <hi>God's Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
and the <hi>King's Word</hi> for their Security.</p>
            <p>Is it that they ſhould <hi>conſent to repeal all the Penal Laws againſt
Roman Catholicks,</hi> with a Reſerve of thoſe againſt <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Diſſenters?</hi> I am much more confident there never was
any ſuch <hi>ſhameful partial</hi> Dealing propoſed unto them, than
I am, that it was never <hi>voluntarily offered</hi> by them.</p>
            <p>But if it ſhould be true, that they have made <hi>frank Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi>
to <hi>reſcind</hi> the Laws againſt the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> and ſecure
them in the <hi>next Reign,</hi> Provided themſelves might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
in their proſecuting <hi>Proteſtant Diſſenters</hi> in this;
and that the ſame was rejected with a generous Indignation
worthy of ſuch a <hi>Propoſition:</hi> Then it will not be difficult
to gueſs both at the Nature and Prevalency of their boaſted
<hi>Smiles,</hi> and what Kindneſs <hi>Diſſenters</hi> are to expect at their
Hands, notwithſtanding all their fair Pretenſions.</p>
            <p>Either the Church of <hi>England</hi> oppoſeth <hi>Liberty of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
in general, and then juſtly engageth the Body of the
Nation againſt her; or only <hi>That</hi> of <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> and
then they recede from their own Principles, for it cannot be
forgot that they heretofore told the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> there was as
much Reaſon the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> ſhould be tolerated as <hi>They;</hi>
And to confirm it, many of her Communion frequently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
That <hi>they would rather be</hi> Romans <hi>than</hi> Preſbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</p>
            <p>But it may ſtill be urg'd, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> is
now no more for <hi>perſecuting,</hi> and would be content to give
up all the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> on either ſide; But cannot, <hi>dares not,</hi>
part with the <hi>TESTS;</hi> eſpecially the laſt, whereby only
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:97397:19"/>
               <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> are kept out of <hi>Parliament.</hi> For if She
quit <hi>this Guard;</hi> preſently the <hi>Two Houſes</hi> may be full of
<hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> who will eſtabliſh their Religion <hi>by Law,</hi>
or perhaps pretend it actually in Poſſeſſion <hi>Jure Poſtliminii,</hi>
And ſo the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> ſhall be utterly <hi>ſuppreſs'd,</hi> and
the Writ, <hi>De Haeretico comburendo</hi> revived, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the <hi>Topping Objection,</hi> but I think a very ſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>Anſwer</hi> may be given to it. For,</p>
            <p>1. Not to repeat what has already been offered of the
<hi>King's Promiſes,</hi> the <hi>Paucity</hi> of the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> and how their
<hi>Interest</hi> ſtands in proſpect of Futurity, I cannot but <hi>remind</hi>
you, that no body that I have met with, ſuppoſes the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
of the <hi>Teſts,</hi> without ſome <hi>equipollent Proviſion</hi> in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſame <hi>Act,</hi> that may obviate theſe Fears. And 'tis incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable
that the Wiſdom of the Nation ſo refined, ſhould
yet be ſo barren, as not to be able to contrive ſome <hi>Civil Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity</hi>
as ſtrong and ſafe, without <hi>Hampering</hi> of <hi>Conſcience.</hi> For
Why may there not be a <hi>Civil Test</hi> form'd, altogether as ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual,
and yet not ſo obnoxious to <hi>Exceptions,</hi> as theſe <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Ones?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. If we can ſecure due <hi>Elections</hi> and Regular <hi>Returns,</hi> we
are ſafe; for undoubtedly the <hi>Free-holders, Citizens</hi> and <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghers</hi>
of <hi>England</hi> are not very fond of chuſing <hi>Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks</hi>
for their <hi>Repreſentatives.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. As to any Apprehenſions, that by taking away theſe
Laws, the <hi>Roman</hi> ſhould pretend a Right to be the <hi>Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi>
eſtabliſh'd <hi>Religion,</hi> by vertue of any <hi>Antiquated Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,</hi>
that may eaſily be daſh't by an <hi>Eſtabliſhment</hi> or Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the <hi>preſent Church of England,</hi> as to all its Priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
but ſuch as are <hi>Compulſory</hi> by Temporal <hi>Penalties,</hi> alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
unadequate means to ſecure <hi>Religion,</hi> and unneceſſary
to the <hi>Well-being</hi> of a <hi>Goſpel-Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. What if in the ſame <hi>Bill</hi> that vacates all the <hi>Old Penal
Laws,</hi> it be by the King in <hi>Parliament,</hi> aſſerted and declared,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:97397:19"/>
that <hi>Liberty of Conſcience is</hi> part of the <hi>Conſtitution</hi> of this
Kingdom; The natural Birth-right of every <hi>Engliſh Man?</hi>
And that all Perſons endeavouring to undermine of ſubvert
ſuch <hi>Settlement,</hi> ſhall be adjudg'd <hi>Criminal,</hi> and liable to ſuch
<hi>Penalties</hi> as ſhall be thought fit; all <hi>Acts</hi> tending thereunto,
in themſelves <hi>ab initio</hi> and for ever <hi>void.</hi> And every Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of <hi>either Houſe</hi> of Parliament, obliged before he <hi>ſits</hi> or
<hi>acts,</hi> ſolemnly to make ſome ſuch <hi>Declaration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. Or what if all the <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> together with the <hi>Test,</hi>
debarring from <hi>Offices</hi> and <hi>Imployments,</hi> be abrogated, and
only <hi>that</hi> relating to Members of Parliament be kept on foot?</p>
            <p>Will none of theſe <hi>Expedients,</hi> or ſuch <hi>better</hi> ones as may
be contriv'd, allay your Fears?</p>
            <p>That which alone muſt conclude any honeſt Man's <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
is the Reſolution of this <hi>ſingle Queſtion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether Perſecution in it ſelf be <hi>lawful?</hi> That is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for meer Opinions, or Exerciſe of Religious Worſhip,
tho different from the national Form, yet no ways diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
the Publick <hi>Peace,</hi> injuring <hi>Civil Society,</hi> or violating
<hi>Morality,</hi> any Perſons whatſoever ought according to the
<hi>Law of God</hi> or <hi>Nature,</hi> be puniſh'd by <hi>Death, Baniſhment,
Mulcts, Fines,</hi> or <hi>Impriſonments,</hi> or be rendred liable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
any <hi>Forfeitures</hi> of, or <hi>Precluſions</hi> from thoſe Advantages
and Priviledges, which otherwiſe they might juſtly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to, or ought to enjoy?</p>
            <p>They, and <hi>They only,</hi> that will undertake to juſtify the
<hi>Affirmative,</hi> may reaſonably appear for the Continuance of
the <hi>Penal Laws and Tests.</hi> But then, if they aſſert any kind
of Perſecution to be lawful, they ought alſo to tell us the
<hi>Bounds and Limits</hi> of it, why the Penalties may not be <hi>ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinary</hi>
as well as <hi>pecuniary, poſitive</hi> as well as <hi>privative?</hi> why
we may not <hi>burn</hi> a Man for his ſuppoſed Error in <hi>Religion,</hi> as
well as take away his <hi>Goods, or his Birth-right?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:97397:20"/>
On the other ſide, all <hi>Thoſe,</hi> who cannot but acknowledg
ſuch <hi>Statutes,</hi> and all Proſecutions thereupon to be <hi>unwarran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,</hi>
as being againſt the main Tendency of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to our Lord's Rule of <hi>doing as we would be done by,</hi> and
oppoſite to the Maxims of <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Civil Policy,</hi> are bound
in <hi>Conſcience</hi> as well as <hi>Interest</hi> to declare and uſe their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
Endeavours for the <hi>Abolition</hi> of all theſe burthenſom de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive
Laws.</p>
            <p>Nor will they be affrighted with any imagined bad <hi>Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences,</hi>
or a Noiſe of what Advantages <hi>ill Men</hi> may deſign
to make by ſuch a <hi>Repeal;</hi> for as we are not to do <hi>Evil,</hi> that
Good may come on't, ſo we muſt not omit <hi>doing Right,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
may be the <hi>Sequel.</hi> Let us perform <hi>our Duty,</hi> and then
we may reſt aſſured, that Divine <hi>Providence</hi> which ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
all the Affairs of this fading World, will diſſipate the
Councils of any <hi>Architophels,</hi> and either preſerve us <hi>from,</hi> or
ſupport us <hi>under</hi> the worſt they can <hi>contrive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> wilfully loſe this Opportunity which
<hi>God</hi> and the <hi>King</hi> have graciouſly vouchſafed; And ſhall in
Diſtruſt of <hi>Providence,</hi> as well as his Majeſties <hi>Word,</hi> multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
to themſelves groundleſs <hi>Fears;</hi> and for certain ſuppoſed
<hi>Politick Ends,</hi> quit both their <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Interest,</hi> to rely on
<hi>Egyptian Reeds,</hi> and future <hi>improbable Expectancies,</hi> the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſy
of a ſort of People, whoſe tendereſt <hi>Mercies</hi> they have
found to be cruel; and will aſſiſt to continue thoſe very
Statutes which their <hi>own Conſciences</hi> cannot but tell them, are
<hi>Irreligious</hi> and <hi>unjust,</hi> and under the Laſh of which they have
ſo lately and ſo <hi>ſeverely ſmarted;</hi> and by reaſon of this <hi>reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Error</hi> againſt their own <hi>Convictions</hi> and <hi>Experience,</hi> ſhall
happen hereafter to fall under a more <hi>dreadful Perſecution,</hi>
than ever heretofore; ('tis no matter by <hi>whoſe Hand:)</hi> Muſt
they not with Confuſion of Face, acknowledg they have juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>deſerved it?</hi> And that themſelves have chiefly contributed

            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:97397:20"/>
He who is convinced, that Perſecution for Religion is <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful,</hi>
and yet refuſes to contribute all he can towards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving
thoſe Laws (which either <hi>poſitively</hi> or <hi>privatively,</hi> for

let him pretend what Fears and <hi>Jealouſies</hi> he will of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing
Dangers from the doing of it, I know not how to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
him from the juſt Imputation of being either a <hi>Fool</hi> or
an <hi>Atheiſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis true, our Orator aſſerts, That <hi>'tis as juſtifiable to have
NO RELIGION, as wilfully to throw away the</hi> humane
Means <hi>of preſerving it.</hi> But becauſe I always thought Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was beſt to be preſerved by <hi>Religious Methods,</hi> and that
a Church built upon the Rock, needs not the feeble Suports
of <hi>Civil Force;</hi> I would gladly learn what <hi>Humane Means</hi> are
neceſſary or Expedient, or indeed <hi>adequate</hi> to preſerve true
Religion? Sure I am the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> held up its Head,
not only <hi>without,</hi> but <hi>againſt ſuch Means</hi> for the firſt <hi>Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;</hi>
And yet <hi>then</hi> it was that it moſt <hi>flouriſh'd in purity,</hi> and
ſpread it ſelf throughout the World; but as ſoon as Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
would be adding their <hi>Humane Means</hi> to preſerve it,
and interwove it with <hi>Intereſt of State,</hi> from thence we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
date its <hi>Declenſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a word, if it be the Intereſt both of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> of this
Nation, and of all <hi>Proteſtant Diſſenters,</hi> to have a General
<hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi> firmly ſetled: If this be no real Diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to the <hi>Church of England,</hi> but only keeps her from
<hi>engroſſing</hi> all Offices and Employments, which cauſed her to
be <hi>envied;</hi> and from ruining her innocent Neighbours, which
made her <hi>hated;</hi> and is both her <hi>Guilt</hi> and her <hi>Shame:</hi> If by
the Goſpel, no Man is to be abridged of any of his <hi>Civil-Rights</hi>
for his different Opinion in Religion; Since we may
have <hi>as good Security</hi> for the Enjoyment of this <hi>Liberty for ever</hi>
as we our ſelves can reaſonably contrive; ſince we have felt
and found ſo many <hi>Evils</hi> attending <hi>Perſecution,</hi> and never
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:97397:21"/>
any <hi>Good,</hi> It ſeems to me Unaccountable why we ſhould not
<hi>all</hi> readily and harmoniouſly agree to the Total Extirpation
of all <hi>Tests</hi> and <hi>Penal Laws</hi> for Religion, and heartily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
