            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>IT is not much worth the while to inform the World, that now Mr. <hi>George Ridpath</hi> is at the Head of the Presbyterian Party in <hi>Scotland.</hi> His Aſſociates there, and here, have ſuch an Opinion of him, that they conſider him as the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible Champion of their Cauſe; and the truth is, if any Man be ſo inconſiderable, and ſo much a Brute, as to fight him at his own Weapons, Mr. <hi>Ridpath</hi> will certainly carry the Prize. He's the Man, that is now moſt likely to pull down <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>Whore</hi> of <hi>Babylon.</hi> And as for the <hi>Scotch Epiſcopal Clergy</hi> who yet retain any kindneſs for the <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> and the former Government, if he lives another year, they muſt all of them be baniſh'd the <hi>Iſle of Britain.</hi> It is enough for you to know, that now the Presbyterians, as is probable, have by an unanimous Suffrage choſen him to manage the Libels againſt their Oppoſites. He now appears in the Field of Battel, with all the Noiſe,
<pb facs="tcp:93903:3"/>
Lies, and Clamour, that becomes a Zealous Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanter. He began this laſt years Campagne with a Libel againſt Dr. <hi>M—o,</hi> which valuable Book he Dedicated to the <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>Scotland;</hi> by this, one may eaſily infer, that either he had a mean Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Parliament, or extraordinary thoughts of himſelf.</p>
            <p>If the following Treatiſe cannot be reduc'd into any certain Method, this is not to be imputed unto me; for I muſt confeſs that I too much follow'd the Excurſions of Mr. <hi>Ridpath</hi>'s invention. I was willing to contract the Animadverſions that I made upon his Book into as little room as was poſſible; and therefore the frequent Tranſitions from one thing to another, are beſt underſtood, by ſuch as have Read his Continuation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I hope moſt Men are better employed than either to think or ſpeak of the Calumnies and Lies, that he induſtriouſly heaps to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether againſt the Clergy. His Party is reſolv'd to make uſe of ſuch Engines againſt the Church, as they and their Fore-Fathers found moſt ſucceſsful to the Extirpation of <hi>Root</hi> and <hi>Branch:</hi> and they that are unacquainted with their Malicious Methods, are great Strangers to our Nation, and Hiſtory.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>Reader</hi> meet with ſome Paragraphs that are more <hi>particular,</hi> and <hi>peculiar</hi> to Mr. <hi>Ridpath,</hi> than the Publick is oblig'd to take notice of, I muſt be excus'd, ſince I was compell'd; for I aſſure you,
<pb facs="tcp:93903:3"/>
that I value perſonal altereations no otherwiſe than a good Chriſtian ought to do: Nor did I ever Write to ſatisfie or convince Mr. <hi>Ridpath,</hi> that being a thing in it ſelf impoſſible. There is a certain Order of Mean Spirited Fellows (I do not mean by their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Quality) who think that there is nothing writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by their Party, (were it never ſo ignominiouſly fulſome and ſcandalous) but what is invincible and unanſwerable. Their Pride, and Vanity are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable. It is not my meaning that we ought to put our ſelves to the Drudgery of anſwering all the Scurrilous and Obſcene Libels that are propagated by our Enemies, but 'tis reaſonable to let our Friends ſee, that at ſome times we can Confute them if that be thought convenient. I am ſo far convinc'd of the weakneſs of their Reaſonings, that I know no Sect, Antient, or Modern, that ever broke the Peace of the Chriſtian Church, but may be more plauſibly defended, than the lateſt Edition of <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery</hi> in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I never thought that the Reputation of my Friend was in any hazard by being attack'd by Mr. <hi>Ridpath,</hi> or the Little Creatures who inſtigate him; yet by the following Papers, I make it plain to all diſinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſed perſons, that Mr. <hi>Ridpath</hi> lies Willfully and Deliberately in ſeveral Inſtances; and therefore I may be allow'd to take leave of him for the future, if he does not manage his accuſations, as becomes
<pb facs="tcp:93903:4"/>
the Spirit of Truth, Innocence, and Ingenuity. If you think that the Style is more ſharp than is De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent or Juſt, then I intreat you may Read his Books which occaſion'd theſe Papers, and then I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that you will retract your Cenſure, and find that I have meddled with his Perſon as little as was poſſible. He is in ſome places ſo Obſcene that there is no coming near him, and therefore I made all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible haſt to rid my imagination of him, and the paultry Traſh that he gathers together.</p>
            <p>The Bookſeller was willing to Print a Sheet or two more than the Letter that I addreſs'd to Mr. <hi>Rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>path,</hi> and therefore I gave him ſome Propoſitions that are extracted out of ſuch Books as are moſt in Vogue amongſt the <hi>Scotch</hi> Presbyterians, that the Reader might have a ſample of their Moral Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy with regard to <hi>Obedience, Government,</hi> and <hi>Subjection.</hi> To which I have added a Letter, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten from the <hi>Tolbooth</hi> of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> by the Famous Aſſaſſin Mr. <hi>James Mitchel,</hi> who endeavours to prove from ſeveral Texts of Scripture, that he ought to kill Dr. <hi>Sharp, Lord Archbiſhop of St. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews.</hi> In ſhort, to uſe the words of a <hi>Great Man, Rebellion is the Soul of the Kirk.</hi> And though we had not known the Hiſtory of that Parliament <hi>Anno</hi> 1645. (So they call'd the bloody Meeting at St. <hi>Andrews)</hi> we have later Inſtances of their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary and Tyrannical Malice againſt the better half
<pb facs="tcp:93903:4"/>
of the Nation. Their very Patrons are aſham'd of them (not through any ingenuous remorſe) but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their bare fac'd Villanies are frequently expos'd. I think the following Letter needs no other Preface than what is already hinted by</p>

               <salute>Mr. <hi>Ridpath,</hi>
               </salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have good information from ſeveral Perſons of known integrity here at <hi>London,</hi> that you are the Author of two abuſive Pamphlets by which you endeavour to defame our Kings, Parliaments, and Nobles, ſuch as we had in <hi>Scotland</hi> before the <hi>Revolution.</hi> Our Kings were perjured Tyrants, and K. <hi>Charles</hi> II. knew that he himſelf <hi>had forfeited his Title to the Crown</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuat.</note>. Our Parliaments were but <hi>pack'd Clubs,</hi> a company of ſlaviſh Paraſites, that contributed all they could to the ruin of our Liberties, Civil and Religious; and conſequently our No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility can deſerve no better Character, who made ſo great a Figure in all our Parliaments. As for the Epiſcopal Clergy whether Biſhops or Presbyters, you give them ſo many names, that it is a wonder you did not think ſuch a deſpicable company of men below your Notice.</p>
            <p>The Book which you call your <hi>Continuation,</hi> moſt of it is levelled againſt one particular man; and when I undertake his Defence (if that be neceſſary) I find that the reading over your book, and tranſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing ſo many parts of it was all the toil I was likely to undergo, and tho you call him whom you fancy to be your Adverſary <hi>a man of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governable paſſion;</hi> yet I muſt tell you that he could not but be mad to the laſt degree, if he were angry at the names you give him, ſince they of the firſt quality in <hi>Europe,</hi> have no fairer quarter at your hands; <hi>A Scribler. a Pedant, a Hawker, a Villain, an Aſs, an Ignoramus, a Blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer,</hi> are all of them words that he can hear with patience, when his Superiours are not better treated. One may modeſtly conclude that you are very angry, and that's a greater puniſhment than any of your Adverſaries can inflict upon you. The Author of the <hi>Poſtſcript to the Apology for the Clergy of Scotland,</hi> told you already, that he was not at all concerned in that Scuffle between you and your Antagoniſt, nor is he likely to offer his mediation to end your Debate; and he is ſtill of the opinion, that he can employ his time better than to read again your <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,</hi> or the Book that occaſioned it. His <hi>Poſtſcript</hi> is a ſhort Epiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary account of the firſt, or rather a Character of the preſent methods of <hi>Presbytery,</hi> in imitation of their Predeceſſors, than any particular view of your Book, and I am content that you impute this to his ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance or weakneſs or what elſe you pleaſe to call it. It is very odd that you ſhould think that you have power to ſummon any body to the Preſs when you pleaſe, even when you lurk behind the Curtains. You
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:93903:8"/>
take it for granted that Dr. <hi>M.—</hi> was the Author of that <hi>Poſtſcript,</hi> and it may be you hit right enough; yet tho your Party be laſhed in it with ſome ſeverity, he takes no great pleaſure in medling with parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular men further than neceſſity conſtrains.</p>
            <p>He ſaid, that there was not <hi>a good conſequence in your Book from the beginning to the end;</hi> this could not but provoke a man of your courage and mettle. By <hi>a Conſequence,</hi> I humbly think he underſtood a truth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from true and ſolid Principles that overthrows the common cauſe of Epiſcopacy, or the reputation of thoſe men whom you aſperſe, I mean ſuch of the Clergy who were never under any publick cenſure of the Church. He told you likewiſe that he had no inclination par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to examine the imaginary contradictions that you charge your Enemy with, and now I give you the reaſon, partly becauſe the Theme, as you manage it, yields no edification, partly becauſe the publick is not at all concerned to read ſuch Libels and altercations, and he gives you liberty to triumph as much as you pleaſe upon this Head: but if your honour and credit is at ſtake, and that you find your ſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned more particularly to run him down than any other, he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to meet you before any competent number of grave witneſſes, who by their authority may mitigate ſuch excurſions of rudeneſs as may be feared, if your blood ſhould boil to its uſual fervor: and to reaſon the matter calmly, and (without either huffing, or the terrible language of an Almanzor) to demonſtrate that there is not a <hi>good conſequence in your Book from the beginning to the end.</hi> And indeed you may excuſe me to tell you, that in your laſt Pamphlet you ſeem not to underſtand the very firſt Elements of Logick.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the Author of the <hi>Poſtſcript</hi> incurr'd your high diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, by ſaying, that there were abuſive Metaphors in Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi>'s Letters, and ſome dark and unintelligible paſſages in his Scholaſtical Eſſays: and is this the unpardonable Crime for which there can be no atonement? Mr. <hi>Ridpath,</hi> this was no reflection upon his Morals, but a plain matter of Fact to be ſeen by every body that peruſeth the Books that are cited. And therefore this could not at all juſtifie your accuſing Sir <hi>George Mackenzie</hi> to have ſuborned Witneſſes; a practice ſo infamous and ſo wicked, that I am confident no man of honour will ever ſay any ſuch thing of the <hi>truly Juſt, and Learned Advocate.</hi> A previous examination of Witneſſes in criminal Caſes is not Subornation, but precognition, practiſed at all times in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> before they deponed judicially; and Sir <hi>George Mackenzie</hi> want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not many clear evidences to prove that <hi>C.</hi> of <hi>C.</hi> was plotting an inſurrection againſt the King and Government about the time of <hi>Argyle</hi>'s rebellion. You may read the elegant Hiſtory of that inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection

Edit.</hi> 2. 1685.</note> Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> and there you may ſee with your own Eyes ſeveral authentick E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences, upon record, againſt <hi>C.</hi> of <hi>C.</hi> and I muſt tell you that Sir <hi>George Mackenzie</hi> needed not that Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's Aſſiſtance to re commend him to the preſent Court, if he had been ambitious to have been a Favorite; and if he told <hi>C.</hi> of <hi>C.</hi> that he had done him an Injury, and begg'd him par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, how came this Confeſſion to be made publick? if he to whom it was firſt revealed, under truſt, ſpread it abroad, he is guilty of ſomething that no Gentleman will readily own; but the plain truth is Sir <hi>George Mackenzie</hi> never told him any ſuch thing, after the manner you repreſent it; and he had very good reaſon to expect that the Witneſſes againſt <hi>C.</hi> of <hi>C.</hi> would judicially depone in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, the very ſame things that they aſſerted in private; and if you pleaſe you may remember that there is a greater difference between Sir <hi>George Mackenzie</hi> and your ſelf, than between Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> and thoſe of our Clergy you trample upon.</p>
            <p>Your Advices and Threatnings to the Miniſters of State in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> are idle, and of no uſe at all; for Miniſters of State will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe according to their Light and Conviction, without any regard to the ſhort-liv'd Pamphlets that fly about the City; nor are they likely to receive their Meaſures either from you, or any of us who ſee ſo little in their Sphere. The <hi>Presbyterians</hi> in <hi>England</hi> are not yet ripe for a Rebellion, and they in <hi>Scotland</hi> can do little to diſturb <hi>England,</hi> without their Aſſiſtance, and therefore you had beſt forbear your Threatnings, for I am apt to think that your Influence in either Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion goes but a little way.</p>
            <p>You treat King <hi>William</hi> no better than other Kings, ſince, you ſay, he is prevailed upon to write Letters to the General Aſſembly that they are not obliged in Law to comply with; but better Lawyers are of another Opinion, and if King <hi>William</hi> venture upon ſuch Eſſays of Arbitrary Power, in a little time (according to your Hypotheſis) he <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Contin.</hi> p. 4.</note> may forfeit his Title, ſince he has none but ſuch as is twiſted with the Divine Right of <hi>Presbytery.</hi> But indeed, Mr. <hi>Ridpath,</hi> I think we had Kings in <hi>Scotland,</hi> before we had either <hi>Covenants,</hi> or <hi>Presbytery,</hi> or the <hi>Claim of Right;</hi> and that our fundamental Conſtitution does not depend upon an Act of the <hi>General Aſſembly,</hi> tho the <hi>General Aſſembly</hi> ſometimes venture, <hi>in terminis,</hi> to make an Act againſt an Act of <hi>Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a gentile Compliment that you beſtow upon Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> when you allow the <hi>Jacobites</hi> to invite her <hi>Father</hi> to keep the <hi>Solon-Geese</hi> in the <hi>Baſs;</hi> and I think none is permitted to ſpeak ſo but

Mr. <hi>Ridpath.</hi> It is not ſafe for any Government to ſuffer Buffoons to treat crowned Heads ſo familiarly; whatever be the Quarrel between Princes, this Language is intolerable; yet ſome Animals are privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged to bark at this rate.

Pho! how they ſtink!</hi> This is the Wit and Civility of an enraged <hi>Presbyterian;</hi> theſe are the Flights of a Zealot, when inſpired to the heighth. You treat Archbiſhop <hi>Sharp</hi> and the Archbiſhop of <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> in the ſame Language that Archbiſhop <hi>Laud,</hi> and Archbiſhop <hi>Spotſwood</hi> were complemented by your Predeceſſors.</p>
            <p>There is a Letter here, which I have ſeen, from the Archbiſhop of <hi>Glaſgow</hi> to one of his Friends; which, ſome time or other may ſee the light in a larger Treatiſe. It was occaſioned by your obſcene Libels againſt him; I muſt tell you one thing that is in it, and it may provoke your Curioſity to ſee it; <hi>He</hi> promiſes <hi>two hundred pound ſterl.</hi> to any Man that will prove, by Witneſſes of known Probity, any one Particular that is maliciouſly vented againſt him by your ſelf or any of your Informers. Why then do not ye appear openly above-board, for the <hi>Biſhop</hi> declines no competent Judge in <hi>Scotland?</hi> 'Tis true, <hi>He</hi> thought that the Book that treated him ſo barbarouſly had
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93903:9"/>
been writ by ſome of the fluttering <hi>Damme</hi>'s about the City, whoſe moſt compendious Method to deſtroy Religion, is, at any rate, to run down the Clergy; but if he had known his Accuſer, 'tis more than proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble he would forbear any Vindication. <hi>He</hi> was ſometimes oppoſed by Perſons of the firſt Quality in the Nation, and if he had been ſo wicked a Wretch as you repreſent him, he had certainly <hi>forfeited his Life to Justice, and his Name to Infamy,</hi> as he expreſſes it himſelf in his Letter. Mr. <hi>Ridpath,</hi> do not take it ill that I do not go through the Particulars of your Libel againſt the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> for I have made you a fair Offer already; and beſides, when you are better informed, you will find your ſelf that you name ſome Perſons in your Libel, who are laſting Monuments of the Diſgrace of your Faction; ſo that you have as little of the <hi>Wiſdom of the Serpent,</hi> as of the <hi>Innocence of the Dove.</hi> You may go on and accuſe the <hi>Biſhop</hi> and his Collegues of all the Crimes that your Predeceſſors charged the former <hi>Biſhops</hi> with, in the year 1638; nay, which is more, you may accuſe him of all the Villainies which your own Major <hi>Wier</hi> actually committed, when he ran about with ſo many of the Siſters, from one Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to another: and I aſſure you that neither he nor any of his Friends will take notice of you. We know very well that you are at extraordinary pains to gather Intelligence againſt the Clergy, but all your Evidences hitherto are of no Authority at all.</p>

There is one thing that I thank you heartily for, <hi>viz.</hi> that this accuſation is expreſs, particular, and circumſtantiated, for when accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations are looſe, general, and indefinite, nothing can be fixt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that can lead us unto the Truth, and therefore Mr. <hi>Ridpath,</hi> here I plainly give you the Lye; I know a man of your honour will reſent this affront. The affirmative part is your own, and therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe obliges you to prove it if you can, you are here upon the place, ſo are they whom you accuſe; the Dr. declines no competent Judge in <hi>England,</hi> and if you can prove that ever he ſpoke with Mr <hi>Shields</hi> in St. <hi>Jame</hi>'s Park, he'll acknowledg all the Libels againſt him to be true, and the only method to ſave your Reputation in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, is to put it to a fair Trial. But I perceive that you are as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate in the informations that you receive againſt the Clergy, as you are haſty and unadviſed in publiſhing of them.</p>
            <p>Whether the error in <hi>Scotch Grammar</hi> with which you charge the <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>Dr.</hi> be an omiſſion of the Printer or his inadvertence, is not material to enquire, he had rather commit a thouſand ſuch, than one Latin <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leciſm</hi> in a publick Harangue <hi>ex Cathedra.</hi> It is uneaſie to live next door to a Grammarian.

Asking one of the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents what was his Name, the Youth told him ſo and ſo, but not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his Sirname; He asked again, <hi>quid eſt totum nomen?</hi> At another time miſſing the Key of a certain Box which is kept in the <hi>Library,</hi> when he would have opened it, he told them that were about him, <hi>Neſcio quid factum eſt de iis, habui mox.</hi> Now the Affirmative is mine,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93903:10"/>
I am obliged to prove it when ever you put me to it. You are all of you ſo tender upon the point of Honour, that you let nothing paſs without preſent Revenge, and Mr. <hi>Rule</hi> himſelf may know the Witneſſes when he pleaſes, tho it be not decent to print their Names.</p>
            <p>The next accuſation againſt the <hi>Dr.</hi> is, that he cannot forbear Swearing. Mr <hi>Ridpath,</hi> I hope it is otherwiſe; and this is but an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of the original Libel, anſwered already in the <hi>Presbyterian In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition.</hi> You was adviſed by the Author of the Poſtſcript, rather to inſiſt on the old Libel than to truſt to your own invention. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over you ſay that it can be proved, that he ſaid to a certain Miniſter, that <hi>if the Epiſcopal party had not the Government, he cared not if the Devil had it.</hi> By other accuſers this Calumny is otherwiſe repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>if the Epiſcopal party had not the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he cared not if the Papiſts had it;</hi> but both are beat out upon the ſame Anvil <note n="*" place="margin">This is glanced at in a late Letter written by a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Miniſter to a member of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, <hi>p.</hi> 11.</note>. I wiſh you had named the Miniſter to whom this was ſaid; the Devil has but too much of the Government of the World already, and I am affraid that they who publiſh ſuch malicious and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definite reports, are more governed by him than they are aware of.</p>
            <p>You charge him again, that he hindered the printing of Mr. <hi>Jame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>'s <note place="margin">P. 15.</note> Book, againſt <hi>Quakeriſm;</hi> he had no authority to do ſo, nor was it poſſible for him to treat Mr. <hi>Jameſon</hi> with greater civility than he did. As for the Oath impoſed on the Scholars in King <hi>James</hi> his time, that is ſufficiently accounted for in another <note n="*" place="margin">Presb. Inquiſit.</note> Treatiſe, and whether you are ſatisfied or not, it matters not much. The Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections ſtarted againſt it, were but the Whimſies of a malicious Pedant who knew not well what he ſaid.</p>
            <p>It muſt be confeſſed that <hi>He</hi> preferred the <hi>French Refugies</hi> to the <hi>Scotch Presbyterians,</hi> when both petitioned the <hi>Town-Council</hi> for the uſe of the <hi>publick Hall</hi> to preach in upon the Sundays. I am not obliged to believe, upon your authority, that he had any undecent expreſſions upon that occaſion. I incline to think that if the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> had the <hi>publick Hall</hi> of the <hi>College,</hi> very many naughty perſons would reſort unto it, though the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Miniſters ſhould endeaviour to hinder it. Now I would gladly ask you one Queſtion, whether ever you had a Scholar, that anſwered you with greater ſubmiſſion and obedience than I do.</p>
            <p>You name a Perſon at the foot of the 15 pag. whom you ſay, the Dr. was careful to vindicate, that he never ſo much as mentioned his Name; but Newſmongers have a greater priviledge than their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</p>

The Presbyterian Opinions, as ſuch, are new and lately ſtarted, and peculiar to themſelves, nor is there any of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches that ever aſſerted Presbyterian government to be foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon ſuch <hi>Divine Right</hi> as is excluſive of all other <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Polities.</hi> The <hi>Church of Scotland,</hi> which, you ſay, was Presbyterian from the beginning of the Reformation, declares poſitively, in her <hi>Confeſſion of Faith,</hi> that <hi>Church Polity is variable,</hi> and the Order of <hi>Biſhops</hi> was never condemned by our Reformers; and <hi>Buchanan</hi> tells us expreſly, that our firſt Reformers were ſo far from being Presbyterians, that <hi>Scoti ante aliquot annos Anglorum auxiliis è ſervitute</hi>

            <p>To ſay that the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhould be governed by <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,</hi> becauſe <hi>Presbyters</hi> were moſt active in the firſt Reformation, is an unpardonable Impertinence. If all the Biſhops in the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> had been as zealous to promote the Reformation as the <hi>Biſhops</hi> of <hi>Galloway</hi> and <hi>Argyle,</hi> would it therefore follow, that if the Biſhops had reformed the Church without the aſſiſtance of Presbyters, there ought to be no Presbyters in the Church when it was fully reformed. No, I think this could not follow; and therefore when the Biſhops own the Doctrine of the Reformed Churches, they muſt be obeyed, and our Reformers never declaimed againſt their Order; and if they would adhere to the Doctrine of the <hi>Reformed Churches, Calvin</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines poſitively in that Caſe, that <hi>nullo non anathemate digni ſunt,</hi> who ſtubbornly oppoſe their Authority; but <note place="margin">Calvin. <hi>Inſt. lib.</hi> 4.

            <p>Your next contains a lamentable Catalogue of Crueltiess that you ſay the Presbyterians in the Weſt did undergo under the former <note place="margin">pag. 17.</note> Reigns, <hi>viz.</hi> that ſome were <hi>roaſted before Fires,</hi> &amp;c.

            <p>All your Bauble about the <hi>Cameronians</hi> is neither to your Purpoſe <note place="margin">pag. 18.</note> nor mine, their Practices can never be condemned by Presbyterian Principles, and they may be the Standard of Presbytery as much as the Miniſters you name in that Paragraph.

And this is the fatal and fundamental Error of your Party, that they have no principles of Unity, but ſuch as a plauſible Proteſtation ſeconded by the Rabble can ſhake your Eccleſiaſtical Authority upon all occaſions, according to the Original Maxim of Mr. <hi>Andrew Melvil, Vota ſunt ponderanda, non numeranda.</hi>

            <p>Your <hi>Argumentum ad hominem</hi> taken from the <hi>Viſcount</hi> of <hi>Dundee</hi>'s Practices, proves no more than your thick and palpable Ignorance in the firſt <hi>Principles of Logick.</hi> Nothing can be improved as an <hi>Argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum ad hominem</hi> againſt any Man, but ſuch Practices as naturally over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw his own Principles; and do you think that my Lord <hi>Dundee</hi> own'd any true and indiſputable Right in <hi>them</hi> againſt whom <hi>he</hi> ſought?

There was no Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation in the caſe, when the Author of the <hi>Poſtſcript</hi> told you, that the Covenant was impoſed upon Children at the Schools, for he meant it of no other Children than thoſe younger ones who entered the Univerſity, and who were not allowed to delay their ſwearing the Covenant until they left it, but were forced as ſoon as they entred, to take it upon implicite Faith; if this is made evident, you muſt acknowledg that there was no <hi>Equivocation</hi> uſed by the Author of the <hi>Poſtſcript.</hi> If you ſet up for a Patron of <hi>Presbyterian</hi> practices, and muſt needs hector the World into a belief of your bluſtering Romances, if you intend to be ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, you ought to read more and write leſs; and becauſe the <hi>Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative</hi> is now mine, I am obliged to prove it, and if you deſire better proof, I'll make you amends; it is the following Act of the <hi>General Aſſembly.</hi>

            <p>Now Mr. <hi>Ridpath,</hi> I hope you are ſatisfied, that by <hi>Children</hi> were meant thoſe young ones who are but newly come from Country Schools.</p>
            <p>The word <hi>Equivocation</hi> brings to my mind ſome practices of the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> ſtill upon Record; I mean publick and Solemn <hi>Deeds,</hi> which ſeem to juſtifie <hi>Equivocation,</hi> if it be for the glory of God, <hi>i. e.</hi> if it promote the ends of the Covenant. It is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſee you or me <hi>equivocate;</hi> theſe are the failings of us two private, obſcure, and particular Perſons, but to ſee the <hi>General Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly,</hi> the true and only ſupreme Repreſentative of the <hi>Kirk</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſhift, double, and equivocate, is treachery and hypocriſie with a witneſs. To make you ſenſible of this, you are to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber as an introduction to what follows, that the Covenanters who went to <hi>Aberdeen</hi> to recommend the Covenant to the Clergy and <note place="margin">
                  <hi>An.</hi> 1638.</note> Profeſſors of Divinity there, told them, that notwithſtanding they ſhould ſwear the Covenant, yet they were left at liberty to Vote for <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> when the <hi>General Aſſembly</hi> met; but when the <hi>General Aſſembly</hi> met, they concluded <hi>primâ inſtantiâ,</hi> that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacy was abjured in the Covenant: This prevarication is complained of by the <hi>Marqueſs</hi> of <hi>Hamilton, His Majeſties Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner,</hi> in a printed Declaration, <hi>Anno</hi> 1639.

but only <hi>generally</hi> and <hi>virtually,</hi> by abjuring whatſoever was abjured in the <hi>Confeſſion</hi> 1580. Now the meaning of this is, by their <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> they abjured Epiſcopacy <hi>virtually,</hi> but not <hi>ſpecificè.</hi> But how could the Members of the Aſſembly be left at liberty to vote free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> after they took the Covenant, if <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> was <hi>virtually</hi> and <hi>generally</hi> abjured in the Covenant? this is as much to ſay, as, tho I am obliged by the Chriſtian Religion <hi>virtually</hi> and <hi>generally</hi> againſt all degrees of <hi>Theft,</hi> yet I am not obliged <hi>ſpecificè</hi> by my Baptiſmal Vow againſt picking a Man's Pocket of his Watch.

            <p>Now Mr. <hi>Ridpath,</hi> name any one Propoſition more knaviſh, hypocritical and damnable than this is, that the <hi>Swearer is neither bound to the meaning of the Impoſer, nor to his own meaning who takes the Oath, but to the reality of the thing ſworn, as it ſhall be afterwards explained by the competent Judge;</hi> which, in their meaning, was none elſe than the <hi>General Aſſembly.</hi> Did you ever read any thing worſe in the <hi>Caſuiſtick</hi> Writings of the <hi>Jeſuits?</hi> But it may be that your Curioſity reaches not ſo far as the moral Theology of <hi>Eſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar, Filiucius,</hi> or <hi>Emanuel Sa.</hi> Did ever the tranſcendent Power of <hi>Rome</hi> go higher? If Oaths neither oblige <hi>ſenſu dant is</hi> nor <hi>jurant is,</hi> but in the ſenſe of the Kirk, then we are obliged, without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Enquiries, to ſubmit our Necks to the infallible Decrees of the <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> tho we neither know what is in them, nor never intended to oblige our ſelves by them.

to the meaning of him that ſwore, but according to the Commentary and Interpretation of the <hi>General Aſſembly;</hi> and ſo the next <hi>General Aſſembly</hi> may pronounce, that by the Teſt (againſt which they objected ſo many ſad Stories) we are obliged to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and ſupport Presbytery, tho we ſwore it with quite contrary.

            </p>
            <p>Some grave Men have been diſpleaſed that the Presbyterian Fooleries have been expoſed to laughter; and for my part I was not of their Council who firſt aſſaulted them in that manner, yet thoſe Gentlemen who accuſe the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Clergy of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as if they had expoſed Religion it ſelf, by publiſhing ſome of the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent and ridiculons Bauble of Presbyterians, muſt conſider, that the learnedeſt and graveſt <hi>Divines,</hi> in this as well as other Nations, have treated Enthuſiaſts in no other manner.

Mr. <hi>Ridpath,</hi> you are very angry when we charge the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians with the odd and extravagant practices of the <hi>Cameronians,</hi> as if ſuch things were unagreeable to their Sentiments: to tell you the truth, I think the <hi>Cameronians</hi> are the moſt active and ingenuous Subdiviſion of the Presbyterians; <hi>they</hi> are the Pioneers in your Camp, whom you hug and embrace as your deareſt Brethren, when the rougheſt part of your Work is to be performed. Upon the late Revolution they drove the Clergy out of the Weſt, and guarded the Convention, and many other conſiderable Services (they'll tell you themſelves) they have done you; and yet forſooth they muſt not be allowed to be Presbyterians. The <hi>Act</hi> of the <hi>Weſt-Kirk,</hi> and the <hi>Remonſtrance</hi> in the Year 1650. are better Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of Presbyterian Principles, than all your little whiffling Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes and Evaſions. Our People took care to publiſh an Epitome of the <hi>Hind let looſe,</hi> not becauſe it was written by any of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meronians;</hi> but rather becauſe he that wrote it, gathered together the <hi>Publick Papers, Remonſtrances, Declarations,</hi> and <hi>Wreſtlings</hi> of that Party againſt the State, in which they lived ſince the Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and therefore if any ſuffered hard things under the late Reigns, they were the high-flown Presbyterians; ſuch of them as lived peaceably and modeſtly, ſuffered nothing at all: for our Laws ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver forbad any man to think but that Presbytery was preferable to Epiſcopacy, if his Opinions and Education led him to think ſo; but our Governours took care that the Principles of Presbyterians might not break out into Tumults and Inſurrections; ſuch as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly pulled down the <hi>Monarchy,</hi> overthrew the Fundamental Conſtitution, and turned our Nation into a <hi>Field of Blood.</hi>

I cannot deny but I was refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a little with this extraordinary Flight of your Fancy, and I leave it to all impartial Men to judge whether this <hi>Witticiſm</hi> of yours, or another which I am going to tell you, be more coherent, raptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and gentile; nay, I think I may leave it to your own deciſion, if you are but a little recovered from the career of your Paſſion: the Story is this, One of my Friends once perſuaded me to go along with him to ſee that ſad ſight of <hi>Bethlehem Hoſpital;</hi> as we entred the lower Apartments, we drew near to the Cell of a little grave Man, whom we found reading <hi>Ovid de Triſtibus</hi> with great Application. My Friend and I asked him ſeveral Queſtions, all which he anſwered very pertinently, ſo that we could not diſcover for a good while where
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93903:15"/>
his Madneſs lay: at laſt I asked him if he underſtood the Book he read, he told me he did, and convinced me that what he ſaid was true. I asked him again, how he came to have ſuch a kindneſs for that Book beyond other Books; at which he ſmiled with ſome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Diſdain, pitying my Ignorance, that I did not know a thing that he thought was known all the World over: why (ſaid he) <hi>Ovid</hi> is of our Family; and do not you know, (ſaid he) that <hi>Ovidius</hi> is from <hi>Ovis</hi> a Sheep, and the Butchers take <hi>Ovis</hi> by the <hi>Neck,</hi> and therefore he began his Book <hi>de Triſtibus,</hi> with <hi>Parve</hi> nec <hi>invidio;</hi> from all this he concluded that <hi>Ovid</hi> was of his Family; and, I think, he argued as wiſely as you do to prove us <hi>Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſts.</hi>

            <p>It is true, the Author of the Poſtſcript ſaid, that the <hi>Acts of the General Aſſembly</hi> did <hi>ſufficiently vindicate King</hi> Charles II. <hi>and his Miniſters of State from any Shadow of Rigour or Cruelty;</hi> but I muſt tell you that he meant other Acts than thoſe you gueſs, and it is a ſad thing to have to do with ſuch an Adverſary as you; it appears that you have a very good Opinion of your ſelf, and there is not a Quality more eſſential to a Presbyterian than Pride and Vanity, you have not read the Books you are concerned to read, if you ſet up for the publick Advocate of the <hi>Kirk;</hi> how came you to gueſs what Acts your Adverſary meant, unleſs he had cited thoſe Acts particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly: and therefore I adviſe you to read the Acts of the General Aſſembly more narrowly, and ſee if you can name any of the Papal Enchroachments upon the Civil Magiſtrate more daring and ambitious than that one Act which is cited in the Margine, and <note place="margin">

            <p>You tell us, after a long Declamation againſt King <hi>Charles</hi> II. his Government and the Doctrine of <hi>Paſſive Obedience,</hi> that Sir <hi>George Mackenzie</hi>'s <hi>Arguments in the defence of his Reign, are all of them built upon a falſe Narrative of Matter of Fact;</hi> as if the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions againſt King <hi>Charles</hi> I, and II. were not notorious, and known all <hi>Europe</hi> over. The <hi>Scotch</hi> Rebels laid King <hi>Charles</hi> I. up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Altar,</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Rebels ſacrificed <hi>him;</hi> and this is no other Cenſure than what is obvious to every Man's Obſervation.

Muſt we prove that Presbyterians are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels? that is as needleſs as to prove firſt Principles: for ſince the <hi>Covenant</hi> is the <hi>Magna Charta</hi> of your Religion, as you are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93903:16"/>
from other Chriſtians, why ſhould you think the Imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Rebellion to be any Reproach? Sir <hi>George Mackenzie</hi> gave the World a true <hi>Narrative</hi> of the firſt Riſe and Occaſion of thoſe Laws that you complain of. And we are very glad how much you write againſt it, you but wound your own head, and <hi>kick againſt the pricks:</hi> for his <hi>Narrative</hi> remains true, and founded upon the Records of Parliament, and Progreſs of your Rebellion, and ſtill unanſwered, as it is unanſwerable. I know that one of your <hi>Club</hi> wrote a Pamphlet againſt <hi>his Defence of King</hi> Charles II'<hi>s Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> entituled, <hi>a Vindication of the Presbyterians in Scotland,</hi> &amp;c. It peeped out, as if it were afraid to ſee the light, but no body knows where to find it, and in a few days it evaniſhed. 'Tis ſaid to be <hi>printed for Edward Golding,</hi> 1692. I got one Copy acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally, but all my Induſtry could not procure another. The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor is a very accompliſh'd Gentleman, no doubt of it; he tells you, in the very firſt <hi>page</hi> of his Pamphlet, that he left <hi>the Law part</hi> unanſwered. And this one Expreſſion is enough to proclaim him a Fool, that he who had no knowledge in the Laws, ſhould venture to anſwer Sir <hi>George Mackenzie</hi>'s Book; juſt as if one ſhould cenſure the Works of <hi>Tully</hi> and <hi>Quintilian,</hi> without any knowledge of the Rules of <hi>Oratory</hi> and <hi>Rhetorick;</hi> and, to let you ſee how groſly ignorant this poor Creature is, he tells us, that <hi>King</hi> Ch.

               <hi>the Subjects an Oath, commonly called the</hi> Tender, <hi>with great Severity,</hi> and that, <hi>it is not improbable but that the Covenant was a Counter-Oath to that.</hi> Now Mr. <hi>Ridpath,</hi> I ask you how any Man can for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear ſmiling to ſee how ſuch a little <hi>Shuttle-cock</hi> can aſſault the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory and Writings of Sir <hi>George Mackenzie?</hi> Was the Covenant no older than the <hi>Tender?</hi> and was the <hi>Tender,</hi> (by which Men were made to part with all degrees of <hi>Loyalty;</hi> and to renounce the <hi>Family of the</hi> Stewarts) impoſed with great Severity by King <hi>Charles</hi> I. and is this the Book that you think confutes Sir <hi>George Mackenzie</hi>'s <hi>Vindication,</hi> better than the Doctor can defend it? But your learned Author goes on, and tells us that <hi>the General Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly</hi> (I ſuppoſe he means that in 1638.) <hi>did not throw out the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 4.</note> 
               <hi>Biſhops without the Authority of Parliament, ſince they had their allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for it;</hi> as if the <hi>General Aſſembly</hi> that threw out the Biſhops had waited for the determination of a Parliament: and when Sir <hi>George</hi> pleads, that the <hi>Eccleſiaſtick State</hi> were always the firſt of the <hi>three Eſtates</hi> of Parliament, your <hi>little Man</hi> tells us, in oppoſition to this, ſome Stories of <hi>Monks</hi> and <hi>Culdees,</hi> by which the <hi>Church</hi> was governed from the beginning of Chriſtianity in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:93903:16"/>
But is this any thing to our purpoſe, when we plead, that by ſo many Laws and Parliamentary Conſtitutions, our <hi>Biſhops</hi> make up the firſt of the <hi>Three Eſtates</hi> of <hi>Parliament;</hi> and which is more, thoſe very Laws are not yet repealed, by which the <hi>Eccleſiaſtick State</hi> is declared to be the firſt. And tho in the days of the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> when the <hi>Biſhops</hi> were expelled by Tumult and Violence, <hi>one</hi> of the <hi>three Eſtates</hi> was ſplit into two, contrary to the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Conſtitution of Parliaments, yet by unrepealed Laws and immemorial Poſſeſſion, they remain the firſt of the <hi>three Eſtates</hi> of <note place="margin">Ibid</note> 
               <hi>Parliament.</hi> He tells us next, that <hi>there were no Biſhops during King</hi> James'<hi>s Reſidence, and conſequently none ſat in Parliament;</hi> and muſt we be put to the drudgery of confuting ſuch a ſad Creature as this is, when the Records of Parliament give him the lie? And I ſpeak it ſincerely, I never ſaw any thing in Print more ignorantly writ than that Pamphlet is: for he tells us again, that <hi>he knew of no Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi>

And if you pleaſe to defend your learned Brother, you may; for my part, if I am not conſtrained to it, I am reſolved never to look into his Pamphlet; nor do I know how to excuſe my ſelf at the Reader's hands, for inſerting ſo many of his lamentable Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinencies.</p>
            <p>In another place of your Book, you accuſe Sir <hi>George Mackenzie</hi> of having perſecuted <hi>Hallſide;</hi> but this Gentleman is here alſo, and no Man can ſpeak more to the advantage of Sir <hi>George Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenzie,</hi> in all Companies, and upon all occaſions, than he does; and he flatly denies all the malicious Fictions that you have heaped together on that Subject.</p>
            <p>If Laws have been made under the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> II, to reſtrain the Fury of Madmen and Incendiaries; neither the State, nor ſuch as adviſed thoſe Laws to be made are to be blamed; for there were no Laws made againſt the <hi>Speculations</hi> of Preſbyterians, but againſt the Practices of ſuch of them, whoſe <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Endeavours</hi> were equally deſtructive to humane Society, as they were pernicious to the particular Settlement of our Nation.</p>
            <p>The Paragraph that follows is a true ſample of your way of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> when you ſay that <hi>Nero</hi> and <hi>Julian</hi> the <hi>Apoſtate</hi> had the Advantage of the <hi>Primitive Christians,</hi> in regard of Quality, Senſe, and Intereſt. But I ſtill think that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> were Men of the beſt Senſe, and far beyond all their Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors. Mr. <hi>Ridpath,</hi> to do you no piece of Injuſtice (for I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain it, and one needs not take any Advantage of you) I let the Reader know, that in the Correction of your <hi>Errata</hi>'s, you adviſe
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93903:17"/>
to daſh out the word <hi>Senſe</hi> out of <hi>lin.</hi> 32. of <hi>pag.</hi> 27. but then when the word <hi>Senſe</hi> is daſhed out, you do not repeat faithfully the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s Argument: for you know very well that he reckons the <hi>Quality, Senſe</hi> and <hi>Intereſt</hi> of the Nobility that are for Epiſcopacy, as things that bear down the noiſe and clamour of all their Antagoniſts; you may raiſe <hi>Monſters</hi> as many as you pleaſe, and then fight with your own Dreams and Imaginations; but ſince you do not repeat an argument faithfully, you ſhould let it alone. And what followed in the ſame Paragraph of the Poſtſcript, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Epiſcopal Nobility</hi> were <hi>men of parts, honour and integrity,</hi> was to be conſidered in conjunction with the former; the Characters laſt named you do not deny to be true, and if ſo, how can <hi>men of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and integrity be perjured oppreſſors?</hi> For my part, I never thought that Honour in its true notion could be ſeparated from a good Conſcience: and the Author of the Poſtſcript intended to baffle the Calumnies of their oppoſers, by a compendious enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the outward and inward advantages that the Patrons of <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> poſſeſſed; ſo that if you was at the pains to anſwer this Argument, you ought not fraudulently to ſuppreſs ſuch words, as contained its frame and energy: and I am content that you call me as well as the Author of the Poſtſcript, a <hi>Pedant,</hi> an <hi>Aſs,</hi> a <hi>Blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer,</hi> a <hi>Villain,</hi> a <hi>Lyar,</hi> and a <hi>Papiſt;</hi> if I tell you that you ſeem to have nothing in your view than to raiſe a little Duſt, when you repeat an argument but not in the Authors words, it is no more his but yours; you may be taught your miſtake by that of the Poet,</p>

            <p>You tell us next, that Sir <hi>George Mackenzie</hi> owns, that <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian Miniſters, and Presbyterian Jurors who were ſummoned to the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pag 28.</note> 
               <hi>tryal of Malefactors of their own perſuaſion, ſeldom failed to condemn them;</hi> From this you conclude, that Sir <hi>George gives himſelf and the Dr. both the Lye,</hi> when they charge thoſe <hi>Principles</hi> upon the Presbyterians in general: and this you ſay, <hi>diſcovers the falſhood of that neceſſity, that the Epiſcopalians pretend the Government was under to make ſuch Laws againſt the Presbyterians in its own defence.</hi> Your argument may be reduced into form thus: Some <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian</hi> Miniſters who lived peaceably at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> blamed and condemned the practices and rebellions of the Cameronian Presbyterians: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the <hi>principles</hi> of Rebellion are not to be charged upon the <hi>Scotch</hi> Presbyterians in general. But Mr. <hi>Rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>path,</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:93903:17"/>
here I deny your <hi>Conſequence.</hi> For when we charge the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> in general with rebellious <hi>principles</hi> and practices, we do not intend to include every individual of that perſuaſion; for many of them do not ſee the juſt conſequences of their own Principles, many of them have not courage enough to put them in execution: many of them may be naturally of ſo ſweet a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that the felicity of their complexion reſiſts the malignity of their <hi>Tenents;</hi> yet notwithſtanding of all this, the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> for the moſt part are guided by a Spirit of rebellion and ill nature. When one ſays ſuch a thing is true of ſuch a Sect or Fraternity; <hi>generally ſpeaking,</hi> he does not intend that it ſhould be underſtood in a ſtrict univerſality, but with that latitude that the ſubject mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will allow; and if you ſay, that the ſevere Laws that you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of were made againſt ſuch <hi>Malefactors,</hi> as <hi>Presbyterian Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters</hi> themſelves <hi>condemned;</hi> then I infer, that the Laws were not made againſt <hi>Presbyterians</hi> as ſuch, but againſt thoſe Rebels who improved their <hi>Covenants</hi> and <hi>Aſſociations</hi> into Seditions, Tumults, and Inſurrections.</p>
            <p>'Tis very true, that thoſe Presbyterian Miniſters who were of a calmer temper, were ſometimes employed to reclaim the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> to their Duty, yet they could not prevail with them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Weſtern <hi>Enthuſiaſts</hi> had a higher opinion of their own Preachers, who were <hi>Remonſtrators</hi> and through paced <hi>Covenanters,</hi> than they had of the more peaceable and ſober <hi>Presbyterians;</hi> why then are our Laws and Governours blamed for reſtraining the mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſuch who were thought intolerable by <hi>Presbyterians</hi> as well as by the King and Parliament, and your reaſonings in this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph plainly infer, that the <hi>King</hi> had nothing in his view but to preſerve his hereditary Right, and the peace of his Subjects, when ſuch and ſuch Laws were made againſt illegal and tumultuous meetings, as men of all perſuaſions were neceſſitated to condemn.</p>
            <p>But you add further, that this conceſſion of Sir <hi>George Macken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zie</hi>'s, <hi>diſcovers the falſhood of that neceſſity which the Epiſcopalians</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>pretend the Government was under, to make ſuch Laws againſt Presbyterians in their</hi> own <hi>defence.</hi> Mr. <hi>Ridpath,</hi> if the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was aſſaulted, and the peace openly diſturbed, there was a plain neceſſity to make ſuch Laws as were thought proper to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain the fury of ſuch Zealots, whether they were <hi>Presbyterians</hi> or <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> all is one to me; and if you ſay that <hi>Presbyterians</hi> were not guilty of ſuch practices, then I ſay there were no Laws made againſt the <hi>Presbyterians:</hi> for the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament</hi> did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider them as <hi>Presbyterians</hi> but as heady, incorrigible, and ſtubborn
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:93903:18"/>
Rebels, who were reſtleſs in their nature, and gave them perpetual diſturbance.</p>
            <p>What follows is of the ſame nature with the former; You <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> tell us that Sir <hi>George</hi> ſays, that <hi>the hereditary Sheriffs refuſed to put the Laws in execution againſt Conventicles, by which they became formidable.</hi> This you pretend deſtroys two other Aſſertions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated by our Party, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Presbyterianiſm is not popular, and that none but the Rabble are their friends.</hi> But Mr. <hi>Ridpath,</hi> all this proceeds from your incurable precipitancy and ignorance. For ſome <hi>heritable Sheriffs</hi> might be inclined to favour Presbytery, and yet 'tis very true, that the moſt of their friends are among the Rabble; and when we ſay ſo, we do not intend to ſay, but that here and there an <hi>heritable Sheriff,</hi> or a Gentleman, may be a ſtiff Covenanter, and may differ very little in his Education and principles, from the inferiour ſort of people, and if at any time we ſay that the Rabble only favours the Presbyterians, we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that <hi>Propoſition</hi> in a limited ſenſe, as all ſuch Propoſitions muſt be underſtood, for generally ſpeaking (except it be in the Weſt of <hi>Scotland)</hi> the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> have very few Friends among the <hi>Nobility</hi> or <hi>Gentry;</hi> and though they had not the majority of the Nation, yet they might prove formidable, and when Sir <hi>George</hi> ſays that they were formidable, can you infer from it that they were more numerous than their oppoſites. At this rate you may prove, that <hi>High-waymen,</hi> and <hi>Robbers</hi> are more numerous than honeſt <hi>Citizens</hi> and Subjects, becauſe a very few of them are able to frighten a whole <hi>County.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are ever and anon told by you and the reſt of your Party, that <hi>the Majority of Scotland is for Presbytery;</hi> but the wiſer men of your Faction think otherwiſe, and therefore they took care to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure their <hi>incloſure</hi> (into which they ſtumbled by a fortuitous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of many accidents) by ſeveral Laws and barricadoes not to be named in this place.</p>
            <p>When you recollect your ſelf a little, perhaps you may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> that it is not wiſely done of you to abuſe ſo many of the <hi>Nobility</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> by ſuch infamous Lyes and Forgeries as you are pleaſed to print, particularly when you tell us, That <hi>the Court employed bloody, cut-throat Papiſts to ruine the Country.</hi> You name the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Airlie,</hi> and the <hi>Laird</hi> of <hi>Meldrum;</hi> 'tis true, this may paſs in a Coffee houſe at <hi>London</hi> where the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Air<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gile</hi> is not known; but there is not a Scots-man alive that ever heard that either of theſe Gentlemen were Papiſts. Now this is very ſad ſtuff Mr. <hi>Ridpath,</hi> and any man that undergoes the toil
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:93903:18"/>
of conſidering your Books, if he knew not whence they came, muſt be guarded by extraordinary patience, when truth and innocence are almoſt in every line ſo boldly invaded.</p>
            <p>What you mean when you tell the Dr. that he has wounded <note place="margin">Pag. 29.</note> 
               <hi>his pretences to Loyalty by defending Sir George Macknzie</hi>'s <hi>Book,</hi> is to me a Myſtery; for I am confident that you are but very little acquainted with him or his pretences either. But you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain that he did not anſwer your argument taken from the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>of Paſſive Obedience,</hi> and that he turns his back and takes no notice of you. Well, Mr. <hi>Ridpath,</hi> it is but juſt that a perſon of your valour ſhould be met in open Field; but you muſt not conclude that a man is puſillanimous when he retires, unleſs you have him ſo much under your authority that he dare not move a ſtep without your order, nor anſwer any thing unleſs in the method that you appoint him.</p>
            <p>You impute all the direful effects of Arbitrary Power, to the Epiſcopal Party and the Doctrine of <hi>Paſſive Obedience;</hi> yet I am apt to believe, that there is no people in the World loves Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Power ſo much as the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> do, and that they hate it only when it is not in their own keeping. If by <hi>Arbitrary Power</hi> the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> mean ſome ſuch <hi>power</hi> as is unaccountable to any earthly Tribunal, ſuch a power there muſt be in every Government, and if it be not managed by a true Chriſtian pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Spirit, it may be as grievous and intolerable in the hands of a Parliament, as in the hands of a King. To declaim againſt <hi>arbitrary power,</hi> is to declaim againſt all Government; for there is no Government upon Earth but exerciſes in its Supreme Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catories <hi>arbitrary power</hi> and juriſdiction. for which it is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to any but to God alone, where this finally <hi>deciſive</hi> and Supreme <hi>power</hi> ought to be lodged, is a Queſtion that I leave to <hi>Lawyers</hi> and <hi>Stateſmen;</hi> they know our municipal Laws and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions. When the ſins of a Nation provoke God, then he pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes them by fooliſh, extravagant; and cruel <hi>Magiſtrates;</hi> when it is otherwiſe, and that God is pleaſed with them, they enjoy good Laws, peace and protection under wiſe <hi>Governours;</hi> and this is all the remedy that is left in humane affairs, againſt publick calamities and diſaſters. There was no <hi>Meeting</hi> ſince the World began that declaimed againſt <hi>arbitrary power</hi> ſo much as the <hi>long Parliament</hi> did, nor was ever <hi>England</hi> ſo miſerable as under <hi>their</hi> Tyranny and Oppreſſions; as long as the adminiſtration of publick affairs is left to the diſpoſal of men, ſo long we may
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:93903:19"/>
be expoſed to <hi>arbitrary power;</hi> and the former muſt be as long as the World continues: a <hi>Parliament</hi> may be as tyrannical as any <hi>King;</hi> and when <hi>they</hi> are thus pack'd together to ſerve a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular deſign, we muſt truckle under them until thoſe Laws are repealed by another; ſo that <hi>Paſſive Obedience</hi> thus ſtated, is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary under all Forms and Models of Government; it is all one thing to me whether I am oppreſſed by the <hi>King,</hi> or by <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament;</hi> there is no Judicatory allows the remedy of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, and what all Judges determine <hi>in all Nations, and at all times, muſt be the Voice of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They who plead for the Supreme and <hi>deciſive</hi> Authority of the <hi>General Aſſembly</hi> in <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> affairs, ought to be more friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>Arbitrary power;</hi> for though their ſentence againſt any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Clergyman were never ſo unjuſt and oppreſſive, yet he muſt ſtrike Sail and hold his peace, and practice <hi>Non Reſiſtance</hi> to a greater heighth, than ever the <hi>Epiſcopal Clergy</hi> preached it, if he would not incur the higheſt Cenſures of the <hi>Kirk.</hi> And this <hi>Spiritual</hi> Tyranny is more inſupportable, than that which reaches only our temporal concerns; and I am content without any bluſtering or foaming to reaſon this modeſtly with your ſelf, or any other that you can name, but ſtill with this <hi>proviſo,</hi> that there be many more preſent than you and I, for I am afraid that we do not well underſtand one another, and therefore, if ever we meet we muſt have a <hi>Moderator</hi> to keep the peace.</p>
            <p>You ſay that the Dr. contradicts himſelf, becauſe he thought that <note place="margin">pag. 30.</note> there was no injury done to the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> in publiſhing a Book that expoſed their Fooleries; and yet he grants, that the Author of that Book <hi>was perhaps unwary as to ſome inſtances.</hi> Good Mr. <hi>Rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>path,</hi> I ſee no contradiction here at all, for a Book may ſerve the end for which it was publiſhed, though perhaps the Author mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes himſelf in ſome ſingle inſtances. There is no Author now adays ſets up for an infallible Dictator; and you tell us in another place of your laſt Pamphlet, that it is not poſſible to publiſh ſo many particular ſtories without committing ſome faults; there is no doubt but you have a very good opinion of your own Book that you laſt printed, yet I hope you are convinced before now, that <hi>the Covenant was impoſed upon Children when they entred the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity.</hi> Whether the Author of that Book miſtook himſelf or not, is not poſitively affirmed by the Dr. ſo your contradiction vaniſhes into air and noiſe. You raiſe more duſt than a <hi>Coach</hi> and <hi>ſix Horſes,</hi> when you are about to kill a <hi>Fly.</hi>

It is probable that the Author of the Poſtſcript may be chaſtiſed for having ſaid that Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi>'s Writings, in ſome places were paſt all human underſtanding. I have no commiſſion from him or any of his Friends to return your Language in <hi>Specie.</hi> You tell us, that if Mr. <hi>Ruhterford</hi> were alive, <hi>he would have ſcorned to have fouled his Fingers with ſuch an Epiſcopal Hawker;</hi> but indeed, Mr. <hi>Ridpath,</hi> I do not think that Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> was ſo proud, but that ſome time or other, <hi>he fouled his Fingers with meaner Creatures than the Doctor.</hi> But what was it that he ſaid of Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi>'s Writings? that, <hi>in ſome places they were very dark and obſcure;</hi> and was this any ſuch extraordinary Crime? Mr. <hi>Ridpath,</hi> I love to ſay very little of Men that are dead, if you think that his Writings are ſo clear, pray give us your Commentaries upon his ſecond Chapter of his ſecond Exercitation <hi>Pro divina Gratia.</hi> 2. Reſp. <hi>Diſtinguo vocem</hi> (verum) <hi>quod unuſquiſque tenetur credere, id eſt, verum, metaphyſicè &amp; fundamentaliter, in ſe &amp; quoad eventum, concedo majorem &amp; tum minorem pernego.</hi> But ſtill he left us to gueſs what the other Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Diſtinction may be. Therefore take it thus, <hi>Quod unuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſque tenetur credere, id eſt, verum, logicè, formaliter, extra ſe, &amp; quoad non eventum; nego Majorem.</hi> And then both the one and the other are good ſtrong Nonſenſe in all its formalities. But he goes on, <hi>Chriſtum enim pro unoquoque mortuum eſſe in ſe fundamentaliter &amp; metaphyſicè, non eſt verum ſed falſum. Chriſtum pro unoquoque Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuum eſſe metaphyſicè falſum,</hi> is a Phraſe I am not acquainted with; and if one durſt ſpeak it, the Author ſeems not, (notwithſtanding of all the Flights of his Metaphyſicks) to advert to the <hi>trite</hi> diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction between the <hi>Veritas Metaphyſica</hi> and the <hi>Veritas Logica.</hi> For <hi>Veritas Metaphyſica numeratur inter proprietates Entis, &amp; conſequenter non objectum fidei ſed ſimplicis apprehenſionis; at propoſitionibus logicè ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris aſſentimur vel propter teſtantis auctoritatem, vel propter rei evidenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am:</hi> And the Queſtion is not <hi>de Metaphyſica veritate hujus propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis,</hi>

               <hi>ſed de veritate Logica.</hi> This is not the only Inſtance that may be pick'd out of this Paragraph to prove it <hi>obſcure</hi> and <hi>unintelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible;</hi> that other Phraſe <hi>in ſe &amp; quoad eventum concedo Majorem,</hi> is as dark as any thing can be; nor do I remark here the Soleciſm of his <hi>Latin, quoad Eventum;</hi> but I name this <hi>Exercitation</hi> as <hi>unintelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible</hi> from the beginning to the end. And becauſe you are a Man of honour, and cannot endure Contradiction with any Patience, it were a more gallant Exerciſe for you to prove that this <hi>Exercita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of his, is plain and ſolid Theology, than to blot ſo much Paper with your imaginary Libels againſt the Clergy. You fight much at the rate that the <hi>Tartars</hi> do, when they are driven before their
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:93903:20"/>
Enemies; or rather like the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who are mounted on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back that they may flie with greater Convenience: but if you have as much Courage and Honour, as you have Bawling and Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, come to a cloſe Engagement, and prove that Mr. <hi>Ruther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>'s Anſwers to the forementioned Argument are ſolid, plain and intelligible. What miraculous Feats other <hi>Presbyterians</hi> can do, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to your purpoſe. Add to the former Inſtance Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi>'s Argument in his 22. Chapter of his <hi>Diſputatio Scholaſtica de divina Providentia,</hi> to prove that there is no oppoſition between Sin and the Divine Nature, which I cannot now tranſcribe, and yet ſtill I have the Confidence to ſay that it is fooliſh, childiſh and frivolous, and of the moſt pernicious conſequence upon the Morals of Mankind. For if there is no oppoſition between the Divine Nature and Sin, <hi>antecedenter ad liberum D E I decretum,</hi> Men may be brought to think that Sin is not ſo odious in it ſelf, nor at ſo great a diſtance from true Perfection, as the Scriptures repreſent it. But if you would ſee many more paſſages that are unintelligible, read his <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitiones de Ente poſſibili,</hi> and the former <hi>Exercitation,</hi> and if any thing can convince you, you may be then forced to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that his Writings are obſcure, and conſequently the Doctor's <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 32.</note> ſaying ſo did not furniſh you with the leaſt umbrage of charging Sir <hi>George Mackenzie</hi> with the groſſeſt Immoralities of Life, for ſuch I think the ſubornation of Witneſſes is.</p>
            <p>The next Blow is for his Incivility to Mr. <hi>Rule,</hi> that <hi>he does not allow him the Title of Doctor.</hi> Truly, Mr. <hi>Ridpath,</hi> if he wilfully made uſe of any other Complement towards him, than what is juſt, there is no Man alive more ready to retract his Error than he; he thought there was no rudeneſs in beſtowing upon him the Title by which he was ordinarily known; and if the <hi>Doctor</hi> knew not the ſeveral ſteps of his Promotion, I ſee no reaſon why you can accuſe him of Incivility, and the thing being purely indifferent; if he had been better informed, he would not deny any thing that he knew to be ſo eaſie and innocent.</p>
            <p>Next you tell us that you do not believe the two inſtances that are cited in that Poſtſcript againſt Mr. <hi>Rule</hi> upon the Doctor's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. But why, Mr. <hi>Ridpath,</hi> did the Author ſay ſo of him barely upon his own Authority, or are they not to be ſeen both of them in his Printed Books; and are not you much more uncivil to him, who revive Stories when perhaps they are entirely forgotten by others? The <hi>decretum praedamnatum</hi> was not the Fiction of my Friend, nor yet his new and unnaccountable <hi>Criticiſm</hi> of the word <hi>Ordinatio;</hi> and now you may add another, which is <hi>decretum prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teritum.</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:93903:20"/>
And you may ſee theſe new <hi>Decrees</hi> (never mentioned before by any Claſs of <hi>Divines)</hi> in page 66 of his <hi>Vindication of the Church of</hi> Scotland. And now I think one is ſufficiently provoked to call you impudent, that you bring above-board things that you neither underſtand nor defend.</p>
            <p>You complained, in your former Pamphlet of the Injuries done to Mr. <hi>Urqhuart</hi> and Mr. <hi>Kirkton;</hi> becauſe the firſt was ſaid to have ſpoken contemptuouſly of our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour</hi> and the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Prayer,</hi> and the other alledged, that <hi>Abraham run out of the Land of Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea for debt.</hi> The Author of the Poſtſcript told you that both theſe Stories (which you your ſelf thought unpardonable) could be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and I am confident many more of that nature. But you tell us that <hi>you are ſufficiently ſatisfied, by thoſe who have lately made enquiry into the Affair, that the whole is a malicious Calumny.</hi> So we muſt take it upon your Word and theirs, it might be reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably expected from you, that, at leaſt, you would have procured under their own hands ſolemn Atteſtations that they never ſaid any ſuch thing; and that was all that you could do to prove your <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative:</hi> and this might have been eaſily had, eſpecially from Mr. <hi>J.

            <p>The following <hi>Paragraph</hi> hath in it more Impertinencies than there are Lines, and yet it is probable that many of your Sect may think it <hi>ſeraphically</hi> witty. The Author of the Poſtſcript ſaid, that <hi>the abſurd and ludicrous Sect metamorphos'd Religion and its ſolemn Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerciſes into Theatrical Scenes.</hi> Another of the ſame Fraternity ſays, that <hi>your Preachers were whining Fellows that drivelled at Mouth and Eyes.</hi> And thus you make them contradicct one another, and then you run away with a loud <hi>holla'a,</hi> as if you were at the Head of the Rabble pulling down a Cathedral, to ſee ſo many <hi>Curates</hi> ſlain with the <hi>Jaw bone of an Aſs.</hi> The word <hi>Theatrical Scenes</hi> does not determine whether your Preachers acted <hi>Comedies</hi> or <hi>Tragedies,</hi> and a whining <hi>Scaramouchi</hi> may act his part in either; and if ſo, the many Words, which you have gathered to no purpoſe, diſcover your Ignorance, and not any Contradiction amongſt them whom you hate. But, Mr. <hi>Ridpath,</hi> are you not in a ſtrange Career when you can never hit upon the true nature of a Contradiction;
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:93903:21"/>
I am not ſurpriz'd that you do not know the Nature of a <hi>Comedy</hi> and <hi>Tragedy,</hi> for you never read <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>

               </gap>, nor none of the Commentators upon him, either ancient or modern; yet you might, in two months time (for ſo long I am told you was at the Univerſity) have learned what a ſtrict and formal Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction is.</p>
            <p>That the Presbyterians were better at Libelling than their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, is evident from all Records; and therefore the Author of the Poſtſcript had good Reaſon to ſay, that <hi>Libelling</hi> was their <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtick,</hi> as that which they moſt practiſed, and excelled all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in; that, in which they placed moſt of their Strength and Confidence, and which they will never forbear, if they happen to live where there is any to be accuſed. But you ſay that <hi>your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies were the firſt Aggreſſors,</hi> and their bold Attempts againſt the Godly, juſtifies all the rough Treatment that they have met with. Mr. <hi>Ridpath,</hi> there is one thing that I would entreat you to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to, and it is, in itſelf, very juſt and reaſonable, and unleſs you yield to it, we may fight to our laſt breath without ſatisfying one another or ſerving any good Deſign, the thing is this, when you accuſe Perſons and Parties, you muſt be more expreſs, definite and particular in your Libels. I am of the Opinion that it is not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for Presbyterians to forbear Libelling, eſpecially upon all pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Turns and Revolutions; their Libels againſt the Clergy both in <hi>England</hi> and in <hi>Scotland,</hi> are ſtill upon Record. Did you never ſee the <hi>Centuries</hi> of <hi>ſcandalous Miniſters</hi> accuſed before the <hi>Long-Parliament.</hi> The General Libel againſt the <hi>Biſhops</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> may be ſeen, when you pleaſe, in the <hi>King's Large Manifeſto,</hi> and in the <hi>firſt Volume of Nalſon's Collections,</hi> and if you believe neither of theſe Books, ſince they were both written by <hi>Malignants,</hi> read the <hi>Acts of the General Aſſembly,</hi> 1638, and there you have the very ſame Libels mentioned; and there is no Presbyterian but knows, that the Libels againſt the Biſhops, in the Year 1638, were read from all the Pulpits of the Nation where the <hi>Aſſembly</hi>'s Authority was obeyed: and what is ſaid, by the Author of the Poſtſcript, of their Behaviour towards Archbiſhop <hi>Spotſwood,</hi> is commonly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted by the oldeſt Men in that corner of the Country, near St. <hi>Andrews.</hi> Particularly this is more carefully preſerved in the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of <hi>Ballfour.</hi> And the <hi>Biſhop of O.</hi> and Mr. <hi>Sage</hi> of <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> had this very Story from the Laird of <hi>Ballfour</hi>'s own mouth. 'Tis true that there is an Act of the <hi>General Aſſembly,</hi> mentioning the <hi>Libels</hi> againſt the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> but there are alſo among the unprinted Acts, Acts of <hi>Excommunication and Depoſition againſt ſome Prelates;</hi> and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:93903:21"/>
when thoſe Acts are produced, I offer to prove, from their own Authentick Records, many more ſteps of their Fraud and Artifice. That there are ſuch Acts as I laſt named unprinted, vid. <hi>Index of the principal unprinted Acts of the Aſſembly at Glaſgow,</hi> 1638. And if they were not afraid of being diſcovered and expoſed, upon this very Head, thoſe Acts had been printed as well as the other <hi>Principal Acts;</hi> nay, the Act againſt <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> it ſelf was not printed, becauſe it could not but alarm all the <hi>Proteſtant Churches</hi> abroad againſt them, when the Order of <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as <hi>ſimpliciter</hi> unlawful; a thing unheard in the Chriſtian Church, until the mungrel Conventicle at <hi>Glaſgow</hi> ſat: therefore the Act againſt <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> was left unprinted as well as the Acts of <hi>Excommunication</hi> and <hi>Depoſition</hi> againſt ſome <hi>Prelates.</hi> And this is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther altogether unknown to, or diſſembled by Mr. <hi>Gilb. Rule,</hi> when he denies the Truth of that Story, as related by the Author of the <hi>Five Letters.</hi> And you are a Fool to think, that, in thoſe days, when Rebellion and Hypocriſie were triumphant, they would have ſtuck at ſuch little Punctilio's, and not practiſe all Arts to delude the Populace. I hope you do not deny what uſe they made of <hi>Margaret Mitchelſon</hi>'s Viſions, Raptures and Revelations, by which they perſuaded the People that the Covenant was authoriſed by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Revelations from Heaven, as well as by the Popular Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults at <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> The Knavery againſt Archbiſhop <hi>Spotſwood</hi> was an Injury done to him and the Church; but the counterfeit Raptures of <hi>Margaret Mitchelſon</hi> (countenanced by your Party) mocked and defied God's Juſtice and Providence, no leſs than it ridicul'd and prophan'd all Religion. [Vid. <hi>King's large Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.]</hi> Nay, they procured Libels againſt the Clergy from moſt <hi>Counties</hi> in <hi>England;</hi> and in thoſe <hi>Counties</hi> where they had none to work upon of their own Gang, they forged Libels, and preſented ſuch counterfeit Petitions in the name of ſuch Counties, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed their Forgeries for real Truths, to make their Party appear numerous, and the <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Nalſ. Coll.</hi> 1. Vol. pag. 795.</note> Clergy odious. And Sir <hi>Thomas Aſton</hi> pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioned the <hi>Houſe of Lords</hi> againſt this villanous Practice; but this was not welcome to thoſe <hi>Lords</hi> who favoured the Faction, and therefore Sir <hi>Thomas Aſton</hi> was reprehended, and the <hi>Forgerers</hi> gently rebuked. And my Author truly obſerves, that this was like to <hi>prove aglorious Reformation, which was built upon ſuch Foundations, and advan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ced by ſuch Arts and Methods.</hi> So that if you mean the <hi>former</hi> Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, they were the firſt Aggreſſors; and if you mean the <hi>modern,</hi> they practiſed this Trade of Libelling ever ſince the beginning
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:93903:22"/>
of the <hi>Revolution,</hi> and long before the Book appeared that provoked your diſpleaſure, and they are much better at it than their oppoſites; their curioſity reaches to the meaneſt concerns. There are no people in the World can give ſuch exact account of their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, <hi>when they riſe,</hi> and when they go to bed, what they eat, and what they drink, what they ſay, and with whom they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe; and this is the reaſon why they ſo often blow up the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood into flames of Contention and Calumny. Name me but one Man ſince the name of <hi>Presbyterians</hi> was known to the World, that ever gave them any ſenſible provocation, whom they have not perſecuted with their Tongues and Libels to the utmoſt of their power.</p>
            <p>They were not only the firſt Aggreſſors, but they continued their practices under the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> II. and ſince the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution the Libels againſt the Clergy have employed their Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries, Synods, and Aſſemblies, not to mention the Libels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Maſters</hi> of <hi>Univerſities,</hi> where there was no Accuſer. I have inſiſted the longer upon this, to let you ſee the vanity of a common topick that runs through both your Pamphlets; Libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is ſo peculiar to the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> that they cannot think of reforming it; in all their converſations their diſcourſe runs moſt upon them that are abſent. It is an idle thing to deny plain mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact, eſpecially when it is ſupported by publick Records, Practices, and the unanimous Suffrages of a whole Nation. I think it enough to prove by the moſt undeniable evidence, that in this art of Libelling you are the firſt aggreſſors, and the only experienced practitioners, without putting my ſelf to the pains of calling you <hi>Rogue, Villain, Raſcal, impudent Lyar,</hi> and ſuch like gentile names as you beſtow upon your Adverſaries.</p>
            <p>You add, <hi>That it is natural for a Cadet of Dumbarton</hi>'s <hi>Regiment, which uſed to plunder people of their goods, to rob Men of their good Names,</hi> and therefore <hi>ought not to be believed.</hi> This is a new Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle <note place="margin">Pag. 33.</note> which we have not heard of before, that he <hi>plundered people of their goods,</hi> and it ſupplies the defects of the Original Libel in the <hi>Inquiſition;</hi> and it is very ordinary for the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent ſuch as they Libel, actually guilty of the breach of the <hi>Ten Commandments:</hi> Now Your <hi>Woman amongſt the Corn,</hi> and <hi>the plundering people of their goods,</hi> added to the former Libel makes him actually guilty of the breach of all. For in the firſt Libel, He is accuſed of having <hi>no Religion,</hi> and <hi>of Swearing,</hi> ſo at one <hi>stroke</hi> he tranſgreſſes the <hi>firſt four;</hi> and the two Articles added in
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:93903:22"/>
your <hi>Continuation,</hi> together with his Reflections againſt the <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians</hi> make him guilty of the reſt, either expreſly or by neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary conſequence. But Mr. <hi>Ridpath,</hi> you do not know the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline of the <hi>French Army,</hi> and if he had inclinations to rob and plunder, this is a more proper time to practiſe it; when <hi>He</hi> is turned out of all his Poſſeſſions, and allowed no other employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under this Reformation than to anſwer Libels. And indeed I think if you were a Soldier, you have no principle to reſtrain you from plundering when you might venture with ſafety, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in a <hi>Popiſh Country,</hi> the true <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and <hi>Covenanters</hi> might take the <hi>Egyptian</hi> goods without ſcruple or remorſe; as they formerly did at <hi>New-Caſtle,</hi> contrary to Articles and Capitula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>Your Grammatical Lecture of the <hi>Literae Mutabiles,</hi> you may <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> recommend to your Scholars, and whatever proficiency you have made in Grammar, you ſeem to me to reaſon much like the Gentleman that I formerly named, who thought himſelf of <hi>Ovid</hi>'s Family.</p>
            <p>You had better let fall the mention of <hi>Archbiſhop Sharp,</hi> than bring him ſo often upon the Stage to the diſgrace of your Party. <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>He</hi> was certainly murdered, not by an accidental effort of fury and paſſion as you alleadge; but in a moſt deliberate manner, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter many Cabals and conſultations kept for that very end; and the Author of the <hi>Poſtſcript</hi> did not reaſon from <hi>Shields</hi> his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority ſo much as from the Principles he went upon, his Book being an accurate Collection of ſeveral authentick Papers, and avowed practices of his Party ſince the <hi>Reformation;</hi> nor was it ever ſaid, that ſober <hi>Presbyterians</hi> did allow of <hi>his</hi> Murder: but how few of them are ſober? and I can tell you more, that the Presbyterian Ladies in <hi>Fife</hi> at that very time, did induſtriouſly ſhun in all converſation to call this <hi>bloody Act,</hi> a <hi>Murder;</hi> but gravely ſaid, that <hi>indeed the Man was ſlain,</hi> but they could not think that any thing that was performed by ſo great a <hi>Saint</hi> as <hi>Rathillat</hi> and his religious Cut-throats, could be called a <hi>Murder.</hi> And when ſuch practiſes are charged upon the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, it is not intended (as I told you once already) to involve every individual; it is not poſſible to deprave the nature of ſome particular men to that degree, though they ſeem to maintain prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples that yield pernicious Conſequences.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:93903:23"/>
But, Mr. <hi>Ridpath,</hi> by converſing with your ſelf I am become a little more bold, and I offer to prove from Presbyterian prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, that <hi>Archbiſhop Sharp</hi> ought to have been murdered, are not all the Covenanters obliged to bring their <hi>Enemies to condign puniſhment?</hi> and when the Magiſtrates are open and avowed Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the cauſe of God, is it not lawful for ſome to interpoſe? eſpecially when acted by Heroical impulſe to ſtop the univerſal deluge of Impiety, that was likely to drown the whole Nation, to recover the freedom of the <hi>Church</hi> that was run down by Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny and Perjury, contrary to all National Obligations, former Laws and Liberties. Did not King <hi>Charles</hi> II. himſelf know <note n="*" place="margin">Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuat.</note>, that <hi>he had forfeited his Title to the Crown?</hi> and was it neceſſary according to you to delay the execution of Juſtice in this calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous poſture of publick affairs, unleſs it could be procured in due form? when it was not poſſible for honeſt men to be heard: eſpecially ſince the Covenanters ſtruck off the heads of <hi>Montroſe, Huntley, Haddo, Spotſwood,</hi> for acting by a Commiſſion from the very <hi>King,</hi> by whoſe Commiſſion they themſelves pretended to hold their places. What is there in the Murder of <hi>Archbiſhop Sharp</hi> that may not be juſtified by your Principles? Did not <hi>He</hi> deſerve death? No doubt you think he did; and if it be only the Forms that you ſtand upon, muſt the ſeaſonable execution of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice be delayed, becauſe it cannot be had in all its regular ſteps and formalities, when the Magiſtrates openly tyrannize and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs our Liberties Civil and Religious? At this rate you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own the moſt publick acts of the <hi>Covenanters.</hi> By what form of Law then in being, did the <hi>Tables</hi> of your Govenanters ſit at <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> when they were forbidden by open Proclamation to continue any longer their Conſultations and Cabals. If you pretend the neceſſity of their affairs, was there ever any ſtate of things more lamentable in it ſelf, than you repreſent the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> II. to be? and if ſo, why might not ſome reſolute and gallant <hi>Heroes,</hi> ſome true <hi>Sons</hi> of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> venture, without the ordinary forms, to do juſtice ſpeedily upon ſuch an eminent oppoſer of Religion as <hi>Archbiſhop Sharp</hi> was? The Laws of ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defence and preſervation, as you explain them, diſpence with Forms, when the thing is for the matter right in itſelf, and the Magiſtrate not only neglects, but avowedly oppoſes Truth, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and Innocence; then 'tis time for men of Courage and Reſolution to ſtep forth and aſſert their Religion and Liberties,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:93903:23"/>
not by the tedious method of Law, Order and Proceſs, when <hi>Covenants</hi> and <hi>Original Contracts</hi> are turned <hi>topſie turvy,</hi> but ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and by open Force pull <hi>Antichriſt</hi> from the Throne. Mr. <hi>Rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>path,</hi> be adviſed by me, do not ſtand ſo much upon Forms; elſe you muſt part with your beſt beloved Principle and Covenanted Reformation.</p>
            <p>And if the Murder of Archbiſhop <hi>Sharp</hi> be ſincerely diſowned by the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> ſince they are ſo often upbraided and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached with it; why do not they by ſome ſolemn Act of their Aſſembly declare, that the killing of Cardinal <hi>Beaton</hi> and Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop <hi>Sharp</hi> were villainous Murders? tho the firſt was uſheredin by Prayer, and the other by ſinging of Pſalms.</p>
            <p>You oppoſe your own Authority to Mr. <hi>Shields,</hi> and this I am ſure many of your own party will laugh at; whether you have the Aſcendent of the Doctor in the point of <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> I will give you my Thoughts of that before I end this <hi>Letter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Doctrine of <hi>Paſſive Obedience</hi> comes again in your way, and nothing is more odious to ſo brisk and daring a Spirit as the <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 34.</note> very thought of ſo tame and ſilly a Diſcipline; and you refer us to the incomparable Argument lately publiſhed by Mr. <hi>John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi> Mr. <hi>Ridpath,</hi> I agree with you, that the Preface of Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi>'s Book hath in it very pleaſant Stroaks of Wit and Fancy; but as to the argumentative part of his Book, it proves the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Paſſive Obedience</hi> to be <hi>Heterodox,</hi> by an Argument of equal Strength with that of your own, by which you prove the <hi>Epiſcopal Clergy</hi> to be <hi>Enthuſiaſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You tell us next, that his Defences of Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cant, are ſo like a Pedantick Doctor, that they deſerve no regard, and what you ſaid of them you can bring the Authors to avow it to their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi> Now we fall upon the Common-place of <hi>Pedantry;</hi> and, Mr. <hi>Ridpath,</hi> you muſt underſtand that there are <hi>Pedants</hi> in all Employments. If the vanity of appearing learned and knowing where there is no ſolid Foundation to ſupport the Character de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that Name, perhaps the citing ſo many <hi>Logical Axioms</hi> in your Pamphlet, which you do not at all underſtand, may, in the Opinion of ſome, make you paſs for a <hi>Pedant.</hi> But, to let this go, tho the Doctor's being a <hi>Cadet</hi> in <hi>Dumbarton</hi>'s Regiment, was not, in your Opinion, an auſpicious <hi>Omen</hi> of Piety and Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, yet one might think it a good Preſage of his Freedom from <hi>Pedantry,</hi> at leaſt as good as any of your moſt remarkable Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in my Lord <hi>Wh—ton</hi>'s Kitchin.</p>

               <hi>were Presbyterians;</hi> and this is another ſad Inſtance of your Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; for they were required to do nothing inconſiſtent with the Principles of moderate Presbyterians; and all the Ringleaders of the Covenanters, had their Miſſion from the Biſhops of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and do you think that they did not then conform to Epiſcopacy, or that they were not Presbyterians? I am afraid that the little <hi>Club,</hi> whereof you are Moderator, does not throughly underſtand the Principles of <hi>Presbytery.</hi> Had we no Presbyterian Miniſters in <hi>Scotland,</hi> but ſuch as deſerted their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in the Weſt after the Reſtoration? was it ever required of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:93903:25"/>
any of them that conformed to <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> to aſſert that <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> was preferable to a <hi>Parity</hi> of <hi>Presbyters?</hi> No; they ſtill enjoyed their own liberty of thinking what they pleaſed, if they obeyed their Superiours in <hi>licitis &amp; honeſtis.</hi> Were not Mr. <hi>Meldrum</hi> and Mr. <hi>Wilkie,</hi> and many others that I could name, Presbyterians, tho they conformed to Epiſcopacy? They themſelves think that they were ſo ſtill; to my certain knowledge the laſt was, and I know him to be ſo honeſt a Man, that he never endeavoured to hide his Principles, and he thought that he did nothing in conforming to <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> inconſiſtent with his own Opinions, and he would have continued ſtill in the Communion of the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Church if a later <hi>Teſt</hi> had not removed him. You muſt not think that all the Presbyterians are warmed to an equal degree of Heat: there are ſome, tho very few, more calm and ſolid than their younger Brethren. Read Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi>'s <hi>due right of Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery</hi> (and I cannot name a Book more acceptable) perhaps you may meet with ſome Notions there that are not ſo agreeable to the late Model of Presbytery; the laſt Edition of a Book is ſtill <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctior &amp; emendatior.</hi> And if it was a Blunder to ſay, that ſome who continued Presbyterian in their Principles, conformed to the external Order of the Church under <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> they who did ſo conform are obliged to defend him.</p>
            <p>You ſtill oblige your Adverſaries to prove <hi>Negatives;</hi> when you libel Dr. <hi>Canaries,</hi> you tell us, that <hi>tho the Miniſters and Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catories</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>declared, that they could make nothing of the Accuſation brought againſt him, yet that will not amount to prove it falſe;</hi> and becauſe a <hi>Negative</hi> in matter of Fact is not demonſtrated (a thing in it ſelf abſolutely impoſſible) you therefore conclude, that ſtill you may accuſe him as guilty; but if nothing could be made of it why ſhould you propagate or continue the Slander? for not only are you deſtitute of true and ſolid Proofs, but all your Evidences when they are aggravated by Presbyterian Malice, could never be heightned into a plauſible Preſumption of his Fault. If I ſhould accuſe you of having committed <hi>Inceſt</hi> with your <hi>Mother,</hi> you could not prove it to be falſe otherwiſe than by letting the World know, that <hi>nothing could be made of it;</hi> and if ſo, no honeſt Man will defame you upon that head.</p>
            <p>But you tell us, that <hi>there is unexceptionable Evidence of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>having declared the thing her ſelf.</hi> What <hi>thing her ſelf</hi> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red I know not; but for the unexceptionable Evidence, 'tis only

upon Record in the <hi>World of the Moon,</hi> elſe we had ſeen it in le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible Characters long e'er now. But you tell us, that <hi>the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of your Informer is fairer than that of either of the two Dr</hi>'s. Mr <hi>Ridpath,</hi> I do not know who this <hi>Gentleman</hi> is, and therefore in modeſty I muſt forbear to make compariſons; but if he will preſerve his Reputation, he muſt ſmother his Evidence.</p>
            <p>What you drive at towards the cloſe of this <hi>Section,</hi> is paſt my skill to find out; when you ſay, That <hi>we have a very pregnant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of a Perſon of no mean Note, whoſe accuſation, moſt in</hi> England <hi>are ſatisfied is true, and yet we ſee nothing can be made out, neither before the Judges nor the Lords.</hi> Mr. <hi>Ridpath,</hi> You leave it uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain whether the <hi>Perſon of no mean Note</hi> be the <hi>Accuſer</hi> or the <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed.</hi> But to demonſtrate the impertinence of this Inſtance, and that you underſtand <hi>Law</hi> as little as you do the Rules of <hi>Logick.</hi> I put the caſe, that <hi>Titius</hi> accuſes his wiſe <hi>Moevia</hi> of Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery; the Judges may be perſuaded that the accuſation of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> is true, though the evidences be not ſo full as the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires; yet being plain and poſitive in their nature, and but a degree removed from full proof; ſuch preſumptions of guilt which the <hi>Civilians</hi> call <hi>praeſumptiones juris &amp; de jure,</hi> leave deep impreſſions upon all, when duly conveyed to our knowledge: becauſe they are as near as can be to that which is <hi>plena probatio in foro.</hi> But pray, have you any ſuch preſumptions againſt the Dr? Is there any plain evidence againſt him? and if nothing can be made of it as the Judicatories declare, then 'tis many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees below a Preſumption; much leſs that higher preſumption which is the ground of a reaſonable Suſpicion.</p>
            <p>But you add, that, <hi>Suppoſe the accuſation againſt the Dr. to be falſe,</hi> yet <hi>it argues a great want of cleanly Men amongſt the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopalians,</hi>

               <hi>that they ſhould chooſe a Man for Agent who lay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a flagrant Scandal. The Apoſtle</hi>'s <hi>Rule is clear, that a Biſhop ought to be blameleſs.</hi> A ſurmiſe magnified by Presbyterian ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice illuſtrates rather than darkens a man's Reputation, and clears his innocence; not to be evil ſpoken of by ſuch whoſe Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is Calumny, is an argument of no great Spirit, and far leſs activity. But you ſay, that <hi>the Apoſtle</hi>'s <hi>Rule is clear;</hi> I ſay ſo too, but your Head is not clear becauſe the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſays, that <hi>a Biſhop ought to be blameleſs;</hi> therefore you conclude, that if <hi>Biſhops</hi> at any time are evil ſpoken of and traduced, they muſt be no longer <hi>Biſhops.</hi> At this rate the moſt innocent and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving

men muſt be diſowned, and the greateſt Luminaries of the Church muſt expect to be caſhier'd. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> was accuſed of abominable immoralities; and St. <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> was ſaid to have a Devil; and the <hi>Great Biſhop of our Souls</hi> was accuſed of being <hi>a friend to Publicans and Sinners;</hi> he went to Feaſts and entertainments which the <hi>Puritanical Phariſee</hi> could not behold without grumbling and cenſuring; they would quietly whiſper in their Neighbours Ears, that though <hi>he ſaid many good things,</hi> and <hi>wrought many Miracles,</hi> yet <hi>he was ſtill a ſtranger to the power of Godlineſs; he kept ill Company,</hi> and the Modern <hi>Phanaticks</hi> would add, that <hi>he</hi> was for forms of Prayer; and a great many other things <hi>he</hi> did, that the Spirit of detraction took by the wrong handle. If your Commentary upon theſe words, <hi>A Biſhop ought to be blameleſs,</hi> had appear'd before the <hi>Scotch Eloquence</hi> came abroad, it ought to have had its own room in that Book, <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> raiſed many Scandals, and they were Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals of <hi>Prelacy</hi> and <hi>Prieſt-craft</hi> too, againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron;</hi> and by your argument they ought both of them to have been deprived of <hi>their Honour</hi> and <hi>Government.</hi>

            <p>The next miſtake is as fooliſh and impertinent, though not <note place="margin">Pag. 37.</note> ſo dangerous as your wreſting the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> to ſerve the heats of your deluded Fancy. You tell us, that Dr. <hi>M</hi>
               <hi>—o</hi> was very angry that you ſaid of him, <hi>[commonly called Dr.]</hi> but I aſſure you, you miſtook his meaning: he could not but remark a <hi>Quaker</hi> expreſſion <hi>[commonly called]</hi> and ſo much the rather, that there are many <hi>Presbyterians</hi> who induſtriouſly ſhun the giving any ſuch Title; for thoſe Academick <hi>diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> look ſo near the <hi>Whore</hi> of <hi>Babylon,</hi> that it is not ſafe for the <hi>Saints</hi> to uſe ſuch words; and if the Dr. has any grains of Pride (which perhaps might be allowed in a <hi>Cadet</hi> of <hi>Dumbar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s Regiment) yet his ambition runs in another Channel than to affect <hi>empty ſounds</hi> and big words. I thought (and I think I know him better than you do) that a <hi>careleſs eaſineſs</hi> rather than <hi>reſerve, diſtance</hi> or <hi>ſingularity,</hi> made up his Character; the affectation of Titles at this time is very unſuitable to the <hi>Scotch Clergy,</hi> yet it is not in the power of might or malice to make ſome of them fawn upon the <hi>Presbyterians:</hi> and though we are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to <hi>forgive our Enemies</hi> heartily and ſincerely, we muſt not be ſo abject as to encourage them to continue their Hoſtilities, but there is a greater impertinence in your Cenſure of the Dr;

            <p>But now, Mr. <hi>Ridpath,</hi> you fall into a fit of Devotion, and you wiſh that the <hi>Falſhoods which have been mutually charged on one another, may oblige both to be more tender of publiſhing Reports upon truſt.</hi> Alas! Mr. <hi>Ridpath,</hi> is it come to this, that you acknowledge that there have been Falſhoods charged upon the Epiſcopal Party by the Presbyterians; no doubt a Man of your Tenderneſs and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity regrets this infamous Practice; yet in the next Breath you tell us, that when the Doctor was Parſon of<hi>—he was accuſed of</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>Villany with a Woman amongſt the Corn.</hi> Such Stories are the very things that confirm me in the Opinion that your Tribe is ſo very well acquainted in the <hi>World of the Moon.</hi> Where was he <hi>Parſon</hi> when he was accuſed? by whom was he accuſed? who heard of this Accuſation before your ſcurrilous Pamphlet appeared? You do not ſay poſitively that he was guilty. No; you let it ſneakingly drop thro your Fingers: ſo that the Queſtion now between you and me is not whether <hi>he</hi> was guilty or not guilty; but whether accus'd or not accus'd. The <hi>Affirmative</hi> part is yours, and if an honeſt Man had it by the end he would either prove it or retract it; the <hi>Negative</hi> is mine that <hi>he was never accuſed,</hi> and if none of them amongſt whom he lived, in the moſt eminent places of the Nation ever heard that he was thus accuſed, none but an impudent Liar will affirm it.</p>
            <p>But if you were to ſpeak your laſt, you can freely declare, that <hi>you do not know one Syllable of what you write to be falſe.</hi> At this rate, you may accuſe him of all the Crimes that the Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans invented againſt the <hi>Biſhops</hi> in the Year 1638, as I have told you before when I mentioned the Archbiſhop of <hi>Glaſgow;</hi> and of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:93903:27"/>
all the Crimes which your own Major <hi>Wier</hi> actually committed with <hi>Mares, Cows</hi> and <hi>Cats;</hi> not to name the Siſters that run with him from one Communion to another, for his extraordinary Gift of <hi>extempore</hi> Prayer; for after all, you may ſafely ſay, that you do not know them to be falſe; and if any ſhould accuſe Mr. <hi>Ridpath</hi> to have committed <hi>Inceſt</hi> with his Mother at <hi>Cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burnſpeth,</hi> before he went to the College of <hi>Edinburgh;</hi> I may ſafely ſay, that if I were to ſpeak my laſt I do not know it to be falſe. And how ſhould one know ſuch <hi>Negatives</hi> in matter of Fact without Omniſcience? and becauſe you do not know ſuch things to be falſe, you think you have liberty to ſpread and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate romantick Lies, pure and unmixt Calumnies againſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Perſons.

The ſtrict Alliance between the liberal Sciences and Arms is a <hi>Common-place</hi> too well known, and he is very ſure, that neither Scholar nor Gentleman will ever reproach him upon this head; and his paſſing ſome of his time in <hi>France</hi> (the great The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atre of Breeding and Civility) was a more auſpicious <hi>Omen</hi> of Piety and Humanity than the moſt remarkable Gallantries of your Life. <note n="*" place="margin">Aelian.

In ſome caſes it is not only allow able to borrow but expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, and if your Curioſity would engage you to read St. <hi>Cyprian de Idolorum vanitate,</hi> you would find that he hath ſeveral Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, nay the very turnings of <hi>Phraſes</hi> from <hi>Minutius Faelix;</hi> and this argues his Love to the Author and to the thing rather than any Indigence of his own.

Lines. I do not at all find fault with Mr. <hi>Williamſon</hi> for reading Biſhop <hi>Brownrig</hi>'s Sermons, nor yet do I blame him for preaching them to the People; would to God he would preach none elſe, but to borrow ſo much from a <hi>ſuperſtitious Sermon</hi> preached at the <hi>Inaugu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of King</hi> Charles I, <hi>a Martyr for Prelacy,</hi> and before my <hi>Lord Melvil,</hi> in a Diſcourſe calculated to incenſe the <hi>Meeting</hi> againſt <hi>Prelacy,</hi> was truly becoming Mr. <hi>Williamſon</hi>'s Genoriſity: I do not declaim againſt his Stealing, for I am as much obliged to Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>Brownrig</hi> as to any Book of that kind that ever I read. And this very Obſervation I have from another <note n="*" place="margin">R.

            </p>
            <p>Next comes your Compliment to the Memory of my Lord <hi>Dumbarton,</hi> as an Evidence of your extraordinary Prudence and Caution. You knew, that when your Book appeared my Lord Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi> was <hi>Commiſſioner</hi> to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and then you expected the thorough Settlement of Presbytery, which now you have in <hi>Folio,</hi> by the late Act; and therefore it was not ſafe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon my Lord <hi>Dumbarton</hi> or his Regiment. But good Mr. <hi>Ridpath,</hi> ſpeak out plainly, do you truly think that Perſons of my Lord Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi>'s Quality and Sence read ſuch Pamphlets as yours; certainly you cannot be ſo mad, your Books are calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for a lower order of Men, and tho you ſent ſome of them beyond Seas, yet they are only conſidered by ſuch who never read any thing but naſty Pamphlets, and who now and then dream of Plots, and reaſon about them with the ſame profound Senſe that you do when you cite your <hi>Logical Aocioms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now when you draw near to a Concluſion, you give the Dr. ſuch a Blow, that he is not able to recover: for the Author of the Poſtſcript ſaid, that you began your <hi>Title page with a Lie, that your Book might be all of a piece.</hi> And this again provokes your
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:93903:29"/>
Heroick Paſſion, and you load your Antagoniſt with ſome of the moſt odious Reproaches that your Dictionary could furniſh you with. But, Mr. <hi>Ridpath,</hi> what was it that he ſaid? why, he ſaid that your Book, was not printed for <hi>Tho. Anderſon</hi> near <hi>Charing-Croſs,</hi> and you charge him upon credit, to prove that it was not printed for him. And muſt you never be cured of this imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, that you oblige your Adverſary to prove a <hi>Negative</hi> in a matter of Fact? and then to make your ignorance the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous, you guard your deſire with a <hi>Logical Axiom, Affirmanti incumbit probatio.</hi> I am aſhamed of you, that you do not know the difference between an <hi>Affirmative</hi> and a <hi>Negative Propoſition;</hi> when he ſaid that it was not printed for <hi>Tho. Anderſon</hi> near <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring-Croſs,</hi> he affirmed nothing; and if he called you a Lyar, though ſuch a Propoſition ſounded like an <hi>Affirmative,</hi> yet it was no <hi>affirmative Propoſition,</hi> but finally reſolved into a <hi>Negative,</hi> and can no otherwiſe be proved than as a <hi>Negative</hi> may; and ſince he could meet with no Bookſeller near <hi>Charing-Croſs,</hi> who knew any ſuch man of their Trade, might not he reaſonably preſume that your <hi>Title-page</hi> had a Lye in the boſom of it; notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all this it may be true that your Book was printed for him, and that he lives in ſome dark Vault near <hi>Charing-Croſs.</hi> Such a thing is poſſible, though it be not very probable that a Bookſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller ſhould hide himſelf under ground; for that is not their ordinary way of ſelling Books. I inſiſt on this only to chaſtiſe your ignorance, and vanity, when you darken the whole Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere with Duſt, out comes your <hi>affirmanti incumbit probatio,</hi> as if your Adverſary had the <hi>Affirmative</hi> that ought to be proved.</p>
            <p>You are ſo fooliſhly vain, that if all the particular Paragraphs of your firſt Book have not been conſidered, you conclude that your Adverſary was convinced of their truth and ſolidity. The Error that I juſt now named brings to my mind another piece of fulſome ignorance of the ſame nature with the former. You may meet with it in the place cited on the <note place="margin">Anſw. to the <hi>Scotch</hi> Eloq. <hi>pag.</hi> 53</note> Margin. Your Antagoniſt loaded the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtencies, and particularly he expoſed your dorage and foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries concerning anniverſary Days, and he might do it with the greater ſafety, becauſe you ſtill retain ſomething in your pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice which overthrows your Principles: for you celebrate the great Charities of <hi>George Herriot</hi> by an Anniverſary commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:93903:29"/>
               <hi>Ergo</hi> (ſays he) you are not againſt anniverſary Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities. But you confute this argument very learnedly, and you prove from clear Scripture that <hi>Anniverſaries are unlawful,</hi> becauſe the <hi>fourth Commandment</hi> ſays poſitively, <hi>Six days ſhalt thou work: Ergo,</hi> you conclude, that all <hi>Anniverſary</hi> Solemnities are unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Now Mr. <hi>Ridpath,</hi> let us calmly conſider the ſtrength of your argument. All men are obliged by this Precept in the ſenſe that you put upon it, or they are not; if all are obliged (as no doubt they are) by what diſpenſation are they of <hi>Heriot</hi>'s <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi> exempted? and if particular Societies be exempted, why may not the whole Nation pretend an exemption? for one So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety is no more privileg'd than another, and if all Societies may equally pretend an exemption, why may it not be granted to the whole Kingdom, which is but the political <hi>aggregate</hi> of ſo many Societies? For, if they of <hi>Herriot</hi>'s <hi>Hoſpital</hi> may celebrate an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſary,</hi> why may not all the Inhabitants of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> do it? But you fortifie your Opinion by a <hi>Logical Axiom, Ex particulari non licet Syllogiſare,</hi> which you think ſignifies, that we muſt not draw <hi>precedents</hi> from the allowable practice of particular Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and this is the Philoſophy that you make ſuch a noiſe with, whereas every Boy in the ſecond <hi>Claſs</hi> that does not deſerve whipping, can tell you that the meaning of that <hi>Logical</hi> Rule is, that <hi>either of the premiſſes at leaſt muſt be an univerſal Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,</hi> whether <hi>affirmative</hi> or <hi>negative:</hi> for two particular <hi>propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions</hi> cannot bear the weight of <hi>a concluſion,</hi> no more than two <hi>Negatives.</hi> Now tell me ſincerely, whether the making ſuch a noiſe with <hi>Logical</hi> Rules, when you do not underſtand what they mean be not Nonſenſe and <hi>pedantry,</hi> in all their pomps and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities. If the practice of <hi>Herriot</hi>'s <hi>Hoſpital</hi> were to be defended by argument, the patrons of it would reaſon from the religious practice of all other Societies, the rules of gratitude, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of the place, and a concluſion regularly deduced from ſuch principles is not I hope <hi>ex particulari,</hi> as you ignorantly fancy. But not to trifle with you any more, the anſwer to your argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is contain'd in that ſhort, but undeniable <hi>Axiom</hi> received by all Divines, <hi>Praecepta affirmativa obligant ſemper, ſed non ad ſemper;</hi> and we may work <hi>ſix days, niſi interveniat feriationis cauſa legitima, auctoritate divinâ vel humanâ ſtabilita.</hi> Pray Mr. <hi>Ridpath,</hi> forgive all this <hi>Latine;</hi> for I do not think that the ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Latine</hi> is at all times <hi>pedantry,</hi> and many are apt to let

that paſs for pedantick which they do not underſtand; but if the phraſe, <hi>of your infectious Breath,</hi> be the Word that provoked the Severity of your Cenſure, the Dr. in all Humility retracts it; for tho your Breath be putrid, yet the Contagion ſpreads no further than People of your own Complexion, Men ſufficiently infected before you breath'd upon them.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Ridpath,</hi> I do not pretend that this Treatiſe is methodical, and therefore I take no other Care to methodize my Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions on your Book, than as they tumble into my Fancy, I lie open to the cenſure of your <hi>Hiſteron-Proteron</hi> as oft as you please. Your Dedication to the <hi>Scotch Parliament</hi> is as conſiderable as the Book it ſelf, for being the only Book that was dedicated to them, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains your own grave and ſerious Advice how to manage the publick Affairs. Next you fall upon the <hi>poor Dr.</hi> and he muſt be laſh'd and chaſtis'd for his Rashneſs and Precipitancy, becauſe he preſumed to give ſuch an account of your firſt Book: but ſince you paint him as an <hi>Aſs</hi> at the very beginning, why was you at ſo much pains with him? ſo mean a Creature was below a Man of your Elevation; and ſince you can defame and expoſe <hi>Crowned Heads, Dukes, Earls,</hi> and <hi>Prelates,</hi> why all this Noiſe to run down a poor <hi>Hermite.</hi> Your very firſt Blow hath in it ſo much Life and Wit, that one of his cold and phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Temper can never reach it, <hi>As Poſtſcript in Anſwer to the Firſt.</hi>

            <p>In the ſecond Page of your <hi>Continuation</hi> there is a Catalogue of the moſt tragical Stories, made up to juſtifie all the Bitterneſs and Buffoonry of your former Pamphlet.

And the truth is, if they intended by that Vote nothing leſs than what the Presbyterian Party advanced, <hi>they were inconſiſtent with their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples;</hi> but tho they concurred in that Vote, they took the Words <hi>a free and lawful meeting,</hi> not to ſignifie any Meeting of the People contrary to the <hi>King's Prerogative, Authority,</hi> and <hi>ſtanding Laws;</hi> but rather a Meeting to ſupport all the three, and they were to ſit notwithſtanding of a Prohibition, until ſuch time as they could duly inform the <hi>King</hi> of the Straits and Difficulties that they were involved in: Neceſſity made them bow under the Weight of that Oppoſition that they wreſtled with; and they hoped that a Vote might be forgiven, which their Practices would have vindicated from any ſuſpicion of leſſening the <hi>Royal Authority.</hi> But Mr. <hi>Ridpath,</hi> did you never hear of a Merchant throwing overboard his Goods in a Storm, his Principle is (no doubt) to preſerve, and improve his Stock, yet when Life, and Ship, and all is in hazard, Silver and Gold, and the beſt <hi>Cargo</hi> that he is Maſter of, muſt be flung over. Men ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, in the Simplicity of their Hearts, may yield to ſome publick Acts in a time of Danger and Confuſion, which, in their own Nature and Tendency are inconſiſtent with their Principles: the wiſeſt Men may ſometimes miſtake their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and the preſence of ones Mind does not perpetually attend

him. A great many of the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> took the Covenant as it was enjoin'd by King <hi>Charles</hi> I. in the ſenſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament,</hi> in the Reign of <hi>King James</hi> VI. yet this act of their duty and obedience was by the Leading-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanters thought inconſiſtent with their principles and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices, and therefore they were forced to diſown it afterwards, and to adhere to the Covenant it its true and genuine ſenſe of Sedition and Rebellion. All the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> after the Reſtoration of King <hi>Charles</hi> II. both Miniſters and People came to Church without ſcruple or heſitation, yet afterwards they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to think that this practice could not be reconciled to their mutinous Aſſociations and Covenants; and therefore for the moſt part all of them left the Church and publick Worſhip of the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopalians.</hi> There is a <hi>Proteſtation</hi> upon record in the Year 1641. in the journal of the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Commons,</hi> May 3. which in its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was but a Prologue to the <hi>Solemn League and Covenant,</hi> and very derogatory to the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>prerogative,</hi> and the ancient ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Nation; and yet I find that ſeveral of the <hi>Loyal No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,</hi> and <hi>ſix Biſhops,</hi> ſigned this <hi>Proteſtation.</hi> Things may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear <note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Nalſ. Coll.</hi> 1 <hi>Vol.</hi> from <hi>pag.</hi> 811, to 817.</note> very plauſible in the beginning, that are introductiory to the ſaddeſt conſequences. The <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Biſhops</hi> that ſigned the <hi>Proteſtation</hi> that I juſt now named, had reaſon to repent of their precipitancy, when the Faction owned above board, that no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation woul ſatisfie but <hi>the extirpation of Root and Branch,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the phraſe that then was in vogue. We are to take an eſtimate of mens principles, not from their indeliberate and caſual ſtumblings in time of darkneſs, uncertainty and danger; but rather from their conſtant Doctrine, their habitual Byaſs, their more calm and ſedate reaſonings, their Books, Homilies, and Sermons. I could name later inſtances than any that I have touched, which might reaſonably be preſum'd to be inconſiſtent with their Principles who were actors, and yet I am ſo far from thinking them diſingenuous, or treacherous, that I know them to be men of the greateſt Candor upon Earth. All this I have ſaid upon the ſuppoſition that the Biſhops who concurred with that Vote of the <hi>Convention</hi> intended it in its full extent and latitude; but I know that they intended no more by the words, <hi>free and lawful meeting,</hi> than what they are capable of in the loweſt ſenſe that they can be taken in, and as <hi>Privy Councellours</hi> ſome of the Biſhops might ſuſpend the execution of the <hi>King</hi>'s Orders con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained

in <hi>his</hi> Letters, until <hi>he</hi> ſhould be better informed of the ſtate of affairs, and until <hi>he</hi> ſhould reiterate <hi>his</hi> Commands: in that caſe I am apt to think that all who own <hi>his</hi> authority would leave the <hi>Convention.</hi>

            <p>Mr. <hi>Ridpath,</hi> I would gladly know whether you think that a Libel againſt Dr. <hi>Monro</hi> was a Book worthy to be dedicated to the <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>Scotland?</hi> and whether your returning to <hi>Scotland</hi> was ſuch an extraordinary advantage to the Nation, that you thought they would upon this conſideration go forward to the through ſettlement of Presbytery? for no doubt you are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the firſt of thoſe Students who promiſe to return, if your Model be eſtablished in its height. The Books that you have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten againſt our <hi>Kings, Dukes,</hi> and <hi>Parliaments,</hi> may make atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the former Gallantries of your Life. I deſpiſe the knowledge of your particular Hiſtory, and unleſs you are as ſtupid as you are petulant, you may gueſs by ſome dark hints in this Letter, (which I took care that no other ſhould underſtand but your ſelf) that I am not altogether a ſtranger to your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures. I had your Life ſent me, written by one of your Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintances, but though I may have many faults, yet I never loved perſonal Reproaches and altercations. When you are in the heighth of your humour and paſſion, I think you ſtill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Revenge: It may be that the <hi>Lay-Gentleman</hi> who is next to take you to task, may handle you more briskly; notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Presbytery is now triumphant, and ſetled by an Act of Excluſion of the Epiſcopal Clergy: Mr. <hi>Ridpath,</hi> I ſincerely wiſh you more ſenſe and modeſty, and I enter my Proteſtation before all reaſonable men, that I am not obliged to anſwer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definite Libels. If you think that you are ſo extraordinarily qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified to manage the Debates that are on foot: chuſe one of the Queſtions that are toſs'd between both the parties, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the the divine Right of <hi>Presbytery,</hi> or the unlawfulneſs of <hi>Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary</hi> Days, or ſignificant <hi>Ceremonies</hi> in the worſhip of God: I name theſe, becauſe you offer to vindicate your own Opinions concerning them in your Books; and ſince you cite the <hi>Epiſtles</hi> of S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> to S. <hi>Jerome,</hi> from which you ſay, the antiquity of <hi>Presbytery</hi> may be demonſtrated, pray do not forget to name that Epiſtle; but I am affraid you will be forced to go to <hi>the Bookſellers in the World of the Moon,</hi> before you can meet with it; and to make you amends, I offer to prove poſitively that there

is not one of your party in <hi>Scotland,</hi> that truly and ſincerely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents the Opinions of St. <hi>Jerom:</hi> nay more expreſly I offer to make evident from the writings of St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> that <hi>Eiſcopacy</hi> was eſtablished by the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and that he never dream'd of any ſuch period of the Church wherein the parity of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters prevailed after the death of the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> And if you muſt write Books, you ought to come out from behind the Curtains, and let us know where your Bookſeller may be found, and by whom they are Licenſed, and take the aſſiſtance of all your Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, read all the Books that you think defend your Cauſe to the beſt advantage, and let us plainly hear what grounds you have to aſſert, that your new and upſtart Diſcipline is founded upon <hi>devine Right;</hi> and why the Miniſters of the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion are turned out, if they do not ſolemnly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe <hi>never directly nor indirectly</hi>

            <p>Mr. <hi>Ridpath,</hi> If you are as reſolute as you are clamorous, you cannot but think it reaſonable to appear, for no man is obliged to conſider fulſome Lampoons, no accuſations ought to be heard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any man (far leſs againſt <hi>Kings, Dukes,</hi> and <hi>Prelates)</hi> unleſs the accuſer openly pawn his reputation to prove the Crimes fairly before a competent Judicature. There are many things in both your Books that I have not mentioned, yet I am ready to prove that they are leſs material and more ridiculous than thoſe I have named; for I know no man ſo puſillanimous as to turn his back upon you for fear of any harm that you can do him, and therefore I ſet down the initial Letters of name and ſirname, and that in Mr. <hi>Rule</hi>'s <hi>Latine,</hi> makes up <hi>Totum Nomen:</hi> and there are a great many here who know me, though at preſent I neither wear the Doctoral Scarf or Canonical Habit.

                  <p>EVer ſince I came to mans years, I have been very ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that we live here in the Neighbourhood of a Sullen ſett of People, that can never think themſelves ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure of any meaſure of Reputation, unleſs they raiſe it upon the Ruins of the good Name of innocent Men that are not of their Opinion in every thing, and am farther confirmed in this Thought by a late inſtance in what concerns me perſonally, in a ſlanderous Pamphlet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:93903:38"/>
                     <hi>An Anſwer to the Scotch Presbyterian Eloquence,</hi> It was ſome months in this place before I could procure a ſight of it; but when I had ſeen it, the thoughts I had concerning what I am wickedly Libelled of, were not ſo full of Anger as Diſdain, to find an obſcure ſorry Jack<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> anapes (for ſo he muſt be) attacquing me with ſo much Malice and arrant Calumny, though I was living very peaceably as I haye always done without being the Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor of any Perſon or Party. At firſt I was reſolved to ſlight it, as a thing that can never do me harm with any one that knows me; yet upon ſecond thoughts, and to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie a worthy Friend of mine, I give you the trouble of this line, which bears ſuch ſhort anſwers to the ill-natur'd and curſed accuſations of that infamous Libeller, as I think ſufficient.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Then he endeavours to vilifie and belie me, by ſaving I was an <hi>Underling</hi> at <hi>Leith.</hi> What he means by this I know not, the true matter is, that the firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance I made in my <hi>Sacred Office</hi> was as ſecond Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of <hi>Leith,</hi> to which I came regularly by a Preſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the Patrons, and Collation thereupon from the Dioceſan, I cannot apprehend any diſparagement in the thing, and I am ſure I have yet a very great kindneſs from all that People, excepting a few Bigots, and of very little intereſt. Next I remember he will needs have the World believe, that I Preached very odd things to the People, but has not ſo much as given one inſtance, not for want of Malice, but (it ſeems) invention, in that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. My poor gift of Preaching the Holy Goſpel was but ſmall, yet I bleſs God I am not aſham'd of it, and I hope I have ſomthing of the power of thoſe Divine Truths I declar'd to the World on my own Heart, and Seals of them upon the Hearts of others, but if this Railing Fellow doubt I be competently qualified, let him procure me Liberty and Safety I will not decline to Preach before the General Aſſembly.</p>

In another paſſage of that Pamphlet, this Silly Fellow charges me with being a notable <hi>Brawler,</hi> and for proof ſays, I was Suſpended for ſometime from the Exerciſe of my <hi>Office</hi> for beating of a <hi>Highlander.</hi> To lot you ſee what Impudence is in this Contrivance, I ſend you here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with incloſed a Copy of a Declaration, under the Hands of ſome of the honeſt Neighbours in <hi>Lieth,</hi> bearing, that I was never Suſpended the Exerciſe of my <hi>Office</hi> during my abode with them, and if it were neceſſary, I doubt not but I can eaſily obtain the atteſtation of all that are yet alive of them I left in the place. Its hard that I ſhould be obliged after fifteen years time to give them the trouble of atteſting my innocence againſt the ſnarlings of a rank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth'd <hi>Curr:</hi> but I have done it very eaſily. Now this being made appear a manifeſt lye, with a witneſs, there is no place left to ſuppoſe I made uſe of any method for returning to my <hi>Office</hi> which I never left, far leſs ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious and ſilly ones, as he ſays, and would have believed I did, and are not worth the mentioning, being ſuch as I fancy no man on Earth, (though of leſs heigth of Natural Temper than I, and almoſt of equal Villany with the ſcurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Author) could be guilty of; but was it not a Lucky thing that this mettled Spark charged me not with the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous Sins of Bestiality, Inceſt and Sorceries? Certainly he had not failed of it, if they had not been Vertues pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to the Saintſhip of one of his Friends, who was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly burnt betwixt <hi>Edinburgh</hi> and <hi>Leith,</hi> upon conſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the foreſaid Crimes, in my ſight and ſome thouſands beſides.</p>
                  <p>In ſome other part, he charges me with Robbing of a thouſand Marks <hi>Scots</hi> mony, from <hi>William Carfrey</hi> who came to pay me my Stipend due by the Town of <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh.</hi> I ſhall never think it worth my Pains to offer a Juſtification of my ſelf from ſo ridiculous a Story; the young man lives ſtill in the City, and is ſo Juſt and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:93903:39"/>
Honeſt to declare to ſome of my acquaintance that it is a moſt notorious Lye; but Innocence it ſelf cannot be ſecure againſt helliſh Impudence. There is one thing more in his Paper, (not worth the minding indeed) which I had almoſt forgot, <hi>viz.</hi> That I was, at the time of his Writing, a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabond at <hi>London;</hi> if a Man muſt be branded with this Character for going from one place to another, he has been much longer a Vagabond than I, as I am told, and I am ſure for his bloody uncharitableneſs, deſerves the mark of a ſecond <hi>Cain,</hi> and the Character of another <hi>Accuſer of the Brethren,</hi> having been made very skilful in the Art of Lying, by his Father, who has uſed it ſince the beginning. I leave this Letter intirely to your diſpoſal: I ask your pardon for this trouble, and am with all reſpect,</p>

               <hi>A Letter from a Gentleman in</hi> Scotland <hi>to his Friend in</hi> London. Edinburgh, July 22. 1693.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Had not yours till laſt Night, which lets you ſee that it hath been a month by the way, and this is the true Reaſon your return is ſo late.</p>
            <p>As to that ſilly Varlet <hi>Ridpath,</hi> all I can ſay of him more than yours to me contains, which I know to be moſt exact Truth, is, that being apprehended and made Priſoner here about <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> 1680, for contriving and writing a Bond of Combination, or kind of Aſſociation, for burning the <hi>Pope</hi> in <hi>Effigie,</hi> which you know was a folly never before that time attempted here, and was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd then by the Rogues of this City, particularly the Presbyterians, as an indignity to his (then) <hi>Royal Highneſs.</hi> This Bond being found in the cuſtody of this Villain, by the diligence of the Learned and Reverend Dr. <hi>Cant</hi> (then) Principal of King <hi>James</hi> his Univerſity of <hi>Edinburg,</hi> (who, though he was a Celebrated Champion for the Proteſtant Church, yet had he a juſt indignation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all Rabbling and Tumults.) This Bond, I ſay, is now in the Council Office, and I have often ſeen and read it. 'Tis indeed a young League and Covenant, containing a Clauſe of Mutual Defence, not excepting the King, or any in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority under him; and an invitation to Prentices, and all others to joyn in this their Aſſociation. Now a Bond of this Nature is by many Laws and Acts of Parliament de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Treaſon; and that, not only ſince the dreadful ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the Infamous League and Covenant, but even
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:93903:41"/>
by very old Acts in the Reigns of King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt, and Second, So much for this. This Scoundrel was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, who was not then a Boy, but a Fellow come to Years, and then a Servant to two Sons of one <hi>Gray,</hi> a perſon living on the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Border, and of the ſame Gang with his Man <hi>Ridpath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Fellow confeſs'd before the Committee of Council, that he had drawn this Bond, but would not own that he had been prompted to it, or aſſiſted in it by others, though the Council well knew, that many of the Ringleaders of the Party were the promoters of this Trick, which was deſign'd as a Prologue to a Rebellion againſt the (then) Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. For this Villany the Law here might have juſtly ſent him to the Gibbet, and perhaps the Council had put him in the hands of the <hi>Judges Criminal,</hi> had he not been preſerv'd by the unparallel'd Clemency of the <hi>Prince</hi> that (then) ſate at the Helm here, which you know is ſo natural to that Sacred Race. I remember the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Rothes</hi> the Chancellour, and ſeveral other great Lords having examin'd him, and finding him very falſe and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate in his Anſwers, ordered him to be committed Cloſe Priſoner till he were further examin'd. And as he was going to Priſon, ſeeing a Crowd about him, and conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them as a Rabble, he cry'd out aloud, that he was <hi>ſuffering for the Proteſtant Religion,</hi> the ordinary, but falſe pretence of all Seditions and Rebellions here. For which he was for ſome days put in Irons, and a little after by the Goodneſs of his (then) <hi>Royal Highneſs,</hi> who was always too compaſſionate to that <hi>Generation of Vipers,</hi> he was diſmiſſed. This is all I can remember or learn of this Creature.</p>
            <p>I hear in his late Pamphlet, which I have not yet ſeen, he has the Impudence to ſay, that one <hi>Margaret Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> (a Proſtitute ſufficiently infamous) ſhould have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd ſomewhat before the <hi>Criminal Court</hi> relating to the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:93903:42"/>
Archbiſhop of <hi>Glaſgow</hi> and me; I am ſatisfied that all that that Villain has ſcribled of the Biſhop be believed, if ever ſhe named either the Biſhop or me in her Confeſſions, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before that Court, or any Confeſſions elſe, whether publick or private. Nor did the Biſhop hear of ſuch a Creature, till the noiſe was made at her being taken na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in the Bed with the late <hi>Presbyterian Moderator Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedy</hi> his two Sons, for which they ſtand declared Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitives in the <hi>Juſtice Court</hi> Books, for the horrid Crime of Inceſt.</p>
            <p>As to what relates to the <hi>C—ks,</hi> I make you this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Return. In the year 1684, Sir <hi>Hugh</hi> and Sir <hi>George Campbels</hi> of <hi>C—k,</hi> with <hi>Baylie</hi> of <hi>Jerviſwood, Commiſſar Monro,</hi> Mr. <hi>William Spence,</hi> Mr. <hi>William Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtairs,</hi> and ſome others were ſent down Priſoners here by Sea, and were kept cloſe for ſome Weeks; during which time I had occaſion to be often with them, for the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil ordered any of their Friends to converſe with them, and ſee them, in preſence of any of the Clerks of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil; and ſuch of them as are yet alive, and their Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will bear me witneſs, that I was as eaſie to them that way as they could deſire. For, the truth is, they all profeſſed ſo much Innocence in the matter they were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of, (which was for being in a Conſpiracy with the late <hi>Monmouth</hi> and <hi>Argyle</hi> for raiſing a Rebellion in both Nations at the ſame time, and which fell out the next year accordingly) and that with all the circumſtantiated Imprecations to them and their Families, that I began to believe the Government had been impoſed upon in this matter, and contracted ſuch a compaſſion for them, as made ſome of our then <hi>Stateſmen</hi> angry with me: and yet <hi>Carſtairs</hi> upon the firſt application of the Thumb-Screw, even the firſt touch of it, confeſſed all, as may be ſeen in his Printed Confeſſion in the Tryal of <hi>Jerviſwood;</hi> and then <hi>Monro,</hi> and afterwards the two <hi>C—ks</hi> themſelves;
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:93903:42"/>
which two <hi>Campbels</hi> were upon their Judicial Confeſſion forefaulted in plain Parliament 1685, and their Eſtates annex'd to the Crown: tho the King gave them not only both Remiſſions for their Lives, but even ordered their Eſtates to be returned to them, upon their paying a very inconſiderable Compoſition to ſome of the then <hi>Stateſmen.</hi> That which the Raſcal <hi>Ridpath</hi> aims at, I ſuppoſe, is a Proceſs which was commenced ſome time before that, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt old <hi>C—k:</hi> the undiſguiſed matter of Fact was truly this, which you may rely upon for certain and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded Truth.</p>
            <p>There was one <hi>Wallace</hi> a Collector or Surveyor in <hi>Air<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> This Man gives Information to the Secret Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, that there were three Men in that Country who had aſſured him that old <hi>C—k</hi> had encouraged ſeveral Country People to the Rebellion at <hi>Both well Bridge,</hi> 1679; and that particularly he had ſaid to themſelves whom he rencountred with upon a place, called the Bridge of <hi>Gaſtoun,</hi> near his own Houſe, <hi>What meant ſuch young luſty Fellows to ſtay at home, when the People of God were in Arms for their Covenanted Cauſe;</hi> and bid them go on to the reſt (the Whig-Army being then at <hi>Hamiltoun,</hi> within ten Miles or thereby to that place) for he and the reſt of the Country would quickly be with them Upon which Information the three Fellows are brought in, and kept ſome time in the <hi>Cannon gate</hi> Priſon. I heard them examined before the Secret Committee, and all of them both jointly and ſeparately were very poſitive, clear, and diſtinct in their Depoſitions. Upon this an Indictment is raiſed againſt <hi>C—k,</hi> and the ſame Witneſſes are again examined upon Oath before the <hi>Juſtices,</hi> which is called by our Law a <hi>Precognition,</hi> and there they were again very firm, and ſeemed altogether clear and ſincere. But the Day of the Tryal being come, and a diſaffected Crowd getting in about theſe Witneſſes, when they came to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pone
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:93903:43"/>
they began to waver much, and upon the matter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny much of what they had twice clearly made oath of before; ſo that the Jury brought in <hi>C—k</hi> not guilty; and ſo he was acquitted from that Indictment. And the next day the ſame three Rogues begged to be heard before the Council, where I heard them again upon their Knees, and with all the Solemnities of Truth and Sincerity, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt and Swear, that what they had firſt Sworn was ſimple Truth, and that their Carriage the day before in the Court, was occaſioned by their being terrified to ſwear againſt <hi>C—k,</hi> ſo great a Man in that Corner of the Country. But upon the whole Matter, the <hi>worthy Sir George Mackenzie</hi> had no more hand in all this Affair, but meerly to purſue as the <hi>King's Advocate.</hi> And in general I can affirm, as in the ſight of the <hi>God</hi> of <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Truth,</hi> I do believe, after all the Enquiry I have made, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a perſon ſuffered in <hi>Scotland</hi> by Subornation or falſe Witneſſes employed by the Government ſince the <hi>Reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the <hi>Royal Family.</hi> Tho many of the Rebels have been brought off, and aſſolzied by the ſcandalous and bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced Perjuries of their own Party: for in the Tryals of thoſe Rebels, the Witneſſes for the King being formerly engaged in the ſaids Rebellions, made uſe of ſuch ſtrange and uncouth Fetches and Strains of Words, that no Jury could fix any Verdict or Doom upon; for being interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated, if they ſaw the perſon at the Barr in Arms with the Rebels (as particularly in the caſe of one <hi>Sprewel,</hi> an eminent Ringleader and Captain, ſeveral of his own Kinſmen as well as Acquaintances, and who had ridden under his Command) they were brought with great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to confeſs, that they thought they had ſeen a Man there which ſeemed to be ſomewhat like the Priſoner at the Bar, but for a <hi>World</hi> they could not ſwear, that this Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner was the perſon they ſaw there.

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:93903:50"/>
To the which I anſwered, <hi>viz. My Lord Chancellour,</hi> if it pleaſe your Grace, I humbly conceive they ſhould have been with us, according to the National and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn League and Covenant, at which Anſwer I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him to ſtorm. But, ſaith he, I heard ye have been over Seas, with whom did ye converſe there? Anſwer, with my Merchant: But, ſaith he, with whom in particular? Anſwer with one <hi>John Mitchel</hi> a Couſin of mine own. Saith he, I have heard of him, he is a Factor in <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> to which I conceded. But, ſaith he, did ye not converſe with Mr. <hi>Livingſton,</hi> and ſuch as he, to which I anſwered, I converſed with all all our baniſhed Miniſters. To which he replyed, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed Traitors, ye will ſpeak Treaſon at the Bar. Then he anſwered himſelf, ſaying, But they would call the ſhooting at the Biſhop an Heroick Act. To which I anſwered, that I never told them any ſuch thing, but where did you ſee <hi>James Wallace</hi> laſt? Anſwer, Towards the Borders of <hi>Germany</hi> ſome years a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go. But what alled you at <hi>My Lord St. Andrews?</hi> (pointing at him with his Finger) Anſwer, My Lord Commiſſioner, the grievous Oppreſſion, and horrid Bloodſhed of my Brethren, and the eager purſuit after my own, as appeareth this day to your Grace, and to all his Majeſties Honourable Privy Council. After which he commanded to take me away, that they might ſee what to do next with me.</p>
            <p>The Second is, the ſhooting of the Shot intended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Biſhop of St. Andrews,</hi> whereby the <hi>Biſhop of Orknay</hi> was hurt, to which I anſwered <hi>My Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor</hi> in private, <hi>viz.</hi> that I looked on him to be the main Inſtigater of all the Oppreſſion and Bloodſhed of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:93903:50"/>
my Brethren that followed thereupon, and the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual purſuing after my own, and, my Lord, as it was credibly reported to us (the Truth of which your Lordſhip knows better than we) that he kept up his Majeſties Letter inhibiting any more Blood upon that Account, until the laſt Six was execute: And I being a Soldier, not having Laid down Arms, but being ſtill upon my own Defence, and having no other End nor Quarrel at any Man (but according to my apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of him) that as I hope in Sincerity with fixing either my Senſe or Action upon the Covenant it ſelf, as it may be underſtood by the many thouſands of the Faithful, beſides the Proſecution of the Ends of the ſame Covenant, which was, and in that point the Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of Prelates and Prelacy, and I being a declared Enemy to him on that account, and he to me in like manner. So I never found my ſelf obliged, either by the Law of God, or Nature, to ſet a Centry at his Door for his Safety, but as he was always to take his Advantage, as it appeareth, ſo I of him, to take any Opportunity offered. Moreover, we being in no Terms of Capitulation, but on the contrait, I by his Inſtigation being excluded from all Grace and Favour, thought it my Duty to purſue him at all occaſions: Alſo <hi>My Lord, Sir William Sharp</hi> making his Apology, anent his unhandſome and cheating way taken, He took me, under pretence to have ſpoken with me about ſome other Matters. I not knowing him until five or ſix of his Brothers and his Servants were laying faſt hold on me, they being armed of purpoſe, deſired I would excuſe him, ſeeing what he had done was upon his Brothers account, which excuſe I eaſily ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, ſeeing that he thought himſelf obliged to do
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:93903:51"/>
what he did to me, without Law or Order in behalf of his Brother, much more was I obliged to do what I did in behalf of many Brethren, whoſe Oppreſſion was ſo great, and whoſe Blood he cauſed to be ſhed in ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance. Moreover, he perſiſting in his Bloody Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as witneſſeth the wounding of <hi>Mr. Bruce</hi> at his taking, by his Emiſſaries ſome few days before that fell out concerning himſelf. Now if by any means in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him away, I could have put a ſtop to the then currant Perſecution. Thus far I have truly resumed what paſſed.</p>
            <p>But this Anſwer to the ſecond part of the Inditement may be thought by ſome to be a ſtep out of my ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary way; wherefore I ſhall offer to your Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that paſſage <hi>Deut.</hi> 23. 9. wherein it is manifeſt, that the Seducer, or Inticer to worſhip a falſe God, is to be put to death, by the Hand of thoſe whom he ſeeks to turn away from the Lord, eſpecially by the Hand of the Witneſſes, whereof I am one, as it appeareth <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. which Precept I humbly take to be Moral, and not merely Judicial, and that it is not at all Ceremonial, or Levitical; And as every moral Precept is univerſal, as to the extent of Place, ſo alſo as to the extent of Time, and Perſons. Upon which Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, Sir, I think that <hi>Phinehas</hi> acted in taking away the <hi>Midianitiſh</hi> Whore, and killed him whom ſhe had ſeduced, <hi>Num.</hi> 25. 8. Alſo <hi>Elijah</hi> by virtue of that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept gave Commandment to the People to deſtroy <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts, contrary to the Command of the ſeducing Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, who was not only remiſs and negligent in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting Juſtice, but became a Protector and Defender of the Seducers. Then, and in that Caſe, I ſuppoſe it is the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:93903:51"/>
Chriſtians Duty not to be very dark. Moreover, we ſee that the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 31. 1. deſtroyed Idolatry not only in <hi>Judah,</hi> wherein the King concurred, but in <hi>Iſrael</hi> and in <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> where the King himſelf was an Idolater. And ſurely what all the People was bound to do by the Law of God, every one was bound to do it, to the uttermoſt of their power and capacity: And as it was in <hi>Zach.</hi> 13. 3. There the Seducer's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Mother ſhall put them to death: I take this to be meant of the Chriſtian Magiſtrate; but when he is withdrawn by the Seducer from the Exerciſe of Office and Duty, and is become utterly remiſs and negligent in putting the Seducer to death, according to God's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Law, which is not to be expected of him, for then he ſhould do Juſtice upon himſelf, but is become a Protector and Defender of the Idolater; then I doubt not, but that it doth become the Duty of every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, to the uttermoſt of his power and capacity, to deſtroy and cut off both Idolatry and Idolaters. Yea, theſe preſumptuouſly murthering Prelates ought to be called ſo by the Avenger of Blood, when he meeteth them, by the expreſs Commandment of God, ſeeing the thing is manifeſtly true, and not to have liberty to flee to ſuch Cities of Refuge, as the vain Pretext of Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Authority: But they ſhould be taken from the Horns of ſuch Altars, and be put to death. Moreover, was it ſpoken concerning <hi>Amalek,</hi> upon the account he deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and reſolved the Extirpation of the Lords People and Truth, which are his Throne, upon which he put forth his Hand, and becauſe he took occaſion againſt them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 17. 14. <hi>Num.</hi> 24. 20. he endeavoured God ſhould not have a People to ſerve him according to his Reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Will upon Earth: And if he could have effectuate
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:93903:52"/>
his Deſign, there ſhould none have lived, who would not have worſhiped and ſerved him, and his Idol Gods: And for the better effectuating his Deſign, he took occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion againſt them, when they were wearied coming out of <hi>Aegypt, Deut.</hi> 25. 17, 18. and the Reaſon there an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed is, he feared not God. And becauſe I know that the Biſhops both will and do ſay, that what they did againſt the Lords People, whom they murthered, they did it by Law and Authority, but what I did was contrary to both. I anſwer, the King himſelf and all the Eſtates of the Land, and every individual perſon of the Land, both were, and are obliged by the Oath of God upon them, to have by Force of Arms extirpated the perjured Prelates and Prelacy, and in doing thereof to have defended their Lives and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, the Covenants being engaged to on theſe Terms, <hi>viz.</hi> after Supplications, Remonſtrances, Proteſtations and all other Lawful Means have been uſed now for that Effect: As the laſt Remedy we took up Arms, upon which condition, our Nobility, and all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives of the Nation, according to the National Covenant, and Solemn League and Covenant, gave to the King both the Sword and the Scepter, and ſet the Crown upon his Head; and he accordingly received them, and promiſed and ſware by the ever living God, to uſe and approve them for the uſe aforeſaid: And e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in order to the performing this Article, <hi>viz.</hi> the Extirpation and Overthrow of Prelates and Prelacy, and now they vaunt of Authority; of what Authority do they mean or ſpeak of, truly I know not, except it be the Authority of their aggregated Gods, new Gods, Gods of whom they have their Gain, Life and Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Chemoſh</hi> or <hi>Bacchus,</hi> which drunken <hi>Moab</hi> delighted

And now ſeeing the Prelates poſſeſs whatever their God <hi>Chemoſh</hi> giveth them to poſſeſs: Then ſhould we not poſſeſs what the Lord our God giveth us to poſſeſs, <hi>viz.</hi> the eternal Truths manifeſted to us in his Revealed Will, and keep and defend the ſame from all Innovations and Traditions of his and our Adverſaries, defend our Lives and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties out of the Hands of our uſurping Enemies, <hi>Judg.</hi> 11. 29. for ſure I am, that God once diſpoſſeſſed the Prelates and Malignants of all theſe; and ſhould they again poſſeſs them through our Defect? God for bid, but the like of this Work our murthering Prelates like not, who plead like the Whore their Mother for Paſſive Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and that all the Lord's People, who may not comply with their Idolatries and Perſidies, ſhould lay

down their Bloody Axe, with whom too many of our hypocritical, time-ſerving and perfidious Profeſſors do agree, who had rather abide with <hi>Reuben</hi> among the Sheepfolds, than jeopard Life or Fortune in the Help of the Lord againſt the Mighty; do not conſider the bitter Curſe pronounced by the Angel of the Lord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Meroz,</hi> to which immediately he ſubjoins a Bleſſing on <hi>Jael</hi> the Wife of <hi>Heber</hi> the <hi>Kenite.</hi> Others excuſe themſelves thus, Vengeance is mine, and I will repay it, but ſo the Throne of Judgment is the Lords, and by this they will take away the Uſe and Office of Magiſtracy, which erroneous Principles I deteſt: For God even in the working of Miracles in dividing the Red Sea, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. 16. commanded <hi>Moſes</hi> to ſtretch forth his Rod: And Chriſt when he opened the Blind Man's Eyes, maketh uſe of Clay and Spittle, tho indeed I mean not of any who were willing to have helped, but wanted Opportunity, yet there are many peeviſh time ſerving Profeſſors, who ſhall never ſuffer, ſo long as they have either Soul or Conſcience to mortgage, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding that they may keep them from ſuffering. And if it will not do their Buſineſs, it ſeemeth before they ſuffer, they reſolve to ſell all out at the Ground.</p>
            <p>Now, <hi>Sir,</hi> I have neither miſinterpret Scripture, nor miſapplyed it, in regard of the perſons here hinted at, nor been wrong in the end, which ought to be the Glory of God, the Good of his Church and People.

be intreated to pray to the Lord in my behalf, that he would be pleaſed out of his Mercy and Goodneſs, to ſave me from ſinning under Suffering in this Hour and Power of Darkneſs: For my Soul is preſt within me in the Search betwixt Sin and Duty, <hi>viz.</hi> leſt I ſhould be niggard and too ſparing of my life, when God calleth for it: And on the other hand, too prodigal and laviſh of it, in not uſing all legal Defences in preſerving of it, and in any of the like nature; I am in a ſtrait, O Lord, undertake for me. <hi>Sir,</hi> I hope ye will excuſe me in ſending you theſe indiſtinct and irregular Lines, when you conſider my preſent condition. <hi>Sir,</hi> believe me, I would many times, when I am before them, think a Scaffold a ſweet Retirement, leſt they ſhould cheat and deceive me, in making me either to ſtain the declarative Glory of God, my own Conſcience, or his People and Intereſts, and wronging of them, either by opening the Enemies Mouth againſt them, or letting looſe their Hands upon them; henceforth let the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries both ſay and do what they can, yet <hi>the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous ſhall hold on in his way, and he who hath clean hands will be ſtronger and ſtronger,</hi> Job 7. v. 9. <hi>But he that ſaith unto the wicked, thou art righteous, him ſhall the people curſe, Nations ſhall abhor him,</hi> Prov. 24. v. 24.
