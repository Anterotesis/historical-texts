            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </opener>
            <p>AFter the Lord had appeared for our Army at Torrington, and had written his name in such visible characters before the faces of many, counsell was taken to pursue the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my into Cornwall, and the rather because the scattering of that body of Horse would after an especiall manner pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote our future designes, not onely in order to Exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but also to our Easterne imployment, I shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore give you an accompt, first of the steps we made into Cornwall; secondly, of the state of the Country; thirdly, the condition of the Enemy; fourthly of our owne Army.</p>
            <p>Upon our advance, the Generall gave me a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to apply my self to all means and expedients I could think of, for the stopping of the East parts of Cornwall from rising and joyning with the Enemies Horse, Foot being that which the Enemy (onely) wanted, and those they brought to Torrington blown into severall parts, and scattered, with a purpose not to appeare againe. Accordingly I rid to Plymouth, (though not without much difficulty) riding forty miles very neer the Enemies Guards; I dealt at Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61836:3"/>
with the Governour and the Committee there, who offered me all their furtherances, had Passes of them for any I should imploy into Cornwall, and was much engaged to Mr. <hi>Raw,</hi> of that place, (a discreete able man, and industrious) who undertooke to agitate my designes with the Enemy, and deserves exceeding well for his faithfulnesse and wisdome therein.</p>
            <p>When I was thus thoughtfull how to ingage the Cornish Foot from rising in the East, (whose exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple would have had a present influence on all the County) it pleased the Lord to send in one out of Cornwall, of very good quality, (and much interes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed) who came disguized into Plymouth, having the same designe with my self, for strong affections to the Parliament and their Cause, assuring me, that 3000. men stood ready to joine with the Enemies Horse, yet that there were good hopes, that the leaders being rightly informed, might not onely prevent it, but conditionally close with us.</p>
            <p>Their chiefes were old Master <hi>Colliton,</hi> Colonell <hi>Edgcomb</hi> of <hi>Mount Edgcomb,</hi> Master <hi>Thomas Lowre,</hi> and Lieutenant Colonell <hi>Scawen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To these I applyed my self (by writing) and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red what I had in Commission from the Generall, and sent it by the party by me imployed, who returned again, and gave me hopes, and yet professed much jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie on their part for the true performance on what I promised; and therefore to shorten my worke I offered my selfe an Hostage to them, till the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall should make good what I promised.</p>
            <p>By the next return they invited me into Cornwall, where foure of them should be ready, in the behalfe of themselves and others, to treate with me, and as
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61836:3"/>
they saw cause, to accompany me to the Generall.</p>
            <p>I adventured over to them, and there found Master <hi>Corriton,</hi> M. <hi>Thomas Lowre,</hi> M. <hi>Glanvill,</hi> the eldest Son of Serjeant <hi>Glanvill,</hi> and Major <hi>Trevise</hi>; who being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded of the truth of what I had engaged my self for, were perswaded to go to the Generall with me, and truly I found them very ingenuous, who had long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore distasted the Court way, and abhorred the practises of many of the Kings party.</p>
            <p>By this time the Generall had entred Cornwall, and (at Stratton) our men beate up a Guard of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and took 300. Horse: these Cornish Gentlemen, finding my words made good unto them, were much convinced and affected, receiving from the Generall Protections for themselves and that side of the Country against the violence of our Souldiers, as also Letters of recommendation to the Parliament, for this their service, which tooke such effect, that not onely these 3000. men, ready for their march, retired to their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, but also the whole County where we came, either came in to us, or sate still; and truly these Easterne Gentlemen are very considerable, and I am perswaded the old Master <hi>Coriton,</hi> (who suffered for <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> with Sir <hi>Iohn Elliot,</hi>) will returne to his interest againe, with many more of them.</p>
            <p>Upon our advance the Enemy retreated, the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall lay at Bodman to refresh our men, and to undeceive the County, if by any means we might, which the Lord himself was pleased to help us in, even to wonder, by an Irish Frigot, coming into Padstow, and bringing Letters to <hi>Hopton</hi> and others, from the Earl of <hi>Glamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,</hi> that Jesuited Papist, assuring them of ten thousand Irish ready for <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:61836:4"/>These Letters the Generall commanded me to read, at a great meeting of the Country men, in a field neere Bodman, which had such successe, that the arguments I used unto them, and what I read was received with divers acclamations.</p>
            <p>Upon this day fortnight a strong Party of ours was sent out to fall upon their maine Guard, under the command of that honest and worthy Gentleman Col. <hi>Rich,</hi> who accordingly met with one thousand of the Enemies Horse, routed them, and put them to flight, and tooke two hundred Horses, and one hundred Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners, amongst whom Master Generall <hi>Perts,</hi> who is since dead of his wounds, in whose pocket a copy of a Letter to the Princes Counsell about him, was found to this purpose.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the Kings condition is so low is not our fault, we are not able to breake through the Enemy, nor strong enough to fight them; therefore are resolved to compound for our selves, and leave you to doe what you please.</hi> Sir, it came from the Military part.</p>
            <p>Divers small skirmishes we had with them, Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Generall <hi>Cromwell</hi> himselfe, with some of his horses are setting out Parties and Guards, and attending their motions, adventured himselfe according to his wonted manner; and now the Enemies head Quarter being at Truro, and their chiefe strength not above five of sixe miles from us, the Generall resolving to fight them, or drive them to the Sea, sent them such Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions with a Summons, as he did conceive would take off much of their Forces, and bring them all to a sudden agreement; and upon the sending of these, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced still forward, and in our advance they met us with a desire of a Treaty, which accordingly was yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61836:4"/>
unto, and held sixe daies, there being matters not a few to be considered of, as appears by the Articles.</p>
            <p>Upon the last Lords Day, upon a Downe a mile from Truro, after I had Preached to our men, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the Enemies, they began to deliver up their Armes and Horses.</p>
            <p>The first Regiment was a <hi>French</hi> Regiment, under the command of Mounsier <hi>Laplane</hi> on Sunday last, yet I must much commend the civility of our Souldiers herein, that they let them passe without mocking, or jeering, or offering any affronts to them.</p>
            <p>On Munday there were three Brigades more disban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and on Tuesday the rest according to the Articles; If it shall be objected, That the Generall dealt too gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the County, or the Souldiery part there, I answer.</p>
            <p n="1">1 That the constitution of both the one and the other required it, the Souldiers being a strong Party, and in the Enemies Country.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The people needed it, and the same weapon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved their cure that made their wound, <hi>Hoptons</hi> mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, civility that first deceived them, and the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals now joyned with faithfulnesse tooke the scales from their eyes.</p>
            <p n="3">3 That we have all this year found it our advantage;</p>
            <p n="4">4 Meeknesse, sweetnesse and courage have been alwaies stirring in our Generall for digniority; we know that <hi>Caesar dando, sublenando, ignoscendo gloriam adepiusest,</hi> but of the Generall we may say by the like meanes, <hi>Patriam bene adeptus est.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5 We beleeve, that the Conduct of this Army de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light not to drinke blood.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:61836:5"/>6 The Parliaments aimes are not destructive, but reductive.</p>
            <p n="7">7 We look upon it as the Spirit of Christ in these latter times, and of the New Testament, to save, and not to ruine; and the Heathen could say:
<q>
                  <l>Magnanimo satis est praedam prostrasse leoni,</l>
                  <l>Pugna suum sinem, cum jacet hostis habet.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And this I am bold to adde, That such is the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God, that if we had fought and beaten them, we should not have scattered them as now they are; God hath restrained from the Enemies themselves this acknowledgement, that their Gods is not like ours; their men not like ours, their Actions not like ours: the very words of one of their chiefe Commanders were these:</p>
            <p>
               <q>"<hi>That their men counselled with drinke in their heads, ours with wit in their heads; our men silent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prosecuted and effected their worke, their men va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poured and did nothing: we had a Conduct and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, they acted without both</hi>; yea, <hi>that this Army was not to be fought against.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And all the Enemy are engaged never to take up Armes against the Parliament, except some very few onely.</p>
            <p>For the Country, the Gentry came almost all in unto us, the Cornish Souldiers brought us and laid downe their Armes at the Generalls foot, many of them professing they would but goe home and attend him.</p>
            <p>Some of the Arguments I used in speaking and preaching to them in their publike Assemblies were;</p>
            <gap reason="missing" extent="2 pages">
               <desc>〈2 pages missing〉</desc>
            </gap>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:61836:5"/>First for the Parliament, they did as a Iustice of Peace, sent out a Counstable to apprehended such as had broake the civill Peace: The Cunstable beaten back from his office, hath more helpe sent him, Towne and Cuntry who are re-resolved to pursue his disturbers, our taking up of Armes was not against Cornish men, nor any perticular men, nor any perticular County, but against such as disturbed both them and us, which if they deliver them to us; we had the end of our travells.</p>
            <p>Secondly I used an Argument of utily, wishing them to consider how they could subject without trade which are from the City of London, and other parts of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, What havock the Irish and French might make upon them if they landed; of which Gorings desperadoes have given them a taste.</p>

            <p>Fifthly, I answered a common murmuring amongst them, that their Country was never conquered. They were tould, that our Army was never conquered neither, and yet we were willing to wrestle with them in their one way, by embracing, and huging of them, they should conquer us, and we would conquer them, we would win the day, and they should gaine the field, or their fields: If they lost a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice B<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

done for them; whether their Examples, and Practises, Councels and indeavours, had led them to more holinesse, justnesse, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actnesse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many of them confessed, <hi>they were received by ill reports brought of the Parliament and the crueltyes of this Army, by Hopions flateries, and the Courtiers, and by the Kings, and Princes Personall apperance amongst them: and by their promises to them honouring of them, as more perticular appears, by this Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Kings, hanged up in every Church in the Country.</hi>

                  <hi>WEE are so highly sensible of the extraordinary merit of Our County of</hi> Cornwall, <hi>of the zeale for the Defence of Our Person and the just Rights of Our Crown, (in a time when We could contribute so little to Our owne Defence, or to their Assistance in a time when not onely no Reward appeared, but great and probable dangers were threatned to Obedience and Loyalty;) of their great and eminent Courage and Patience in their indefatigable Prosecution of their great Work against so potent an Enemy, block't with so strong, rich, and populous Cities, and so plentifully furnished and supplyed with Men, Arms, Money, Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Provision of all kinds; And of the wonderfull successe with which it hath pleased Almighty God (though with the losse of some most eminent Persons, who shall never be forgotten by Vs) to reward their Loyalty and Patience by many strange Victories over their and Our Enemies, in despight of all humane Probability, and all imaginable disadvantages; That as Wee cannot be forgetfull of so great deserts, so We cannot but desire to publish to all the World, and perpetuate to all Time the Memory of these their merits, and of Our acceptance of the same. And to that end Wee doe hereby render Our Royall thankes to that Our County, in the most publike and most lasting manner We can devise, commanding Copies hereof to be Printed and publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, and one of them to be read in every Church and Chappell therein, and to be kept for ever as a Record in the same, That as long as the History of those Times, and of this Nation shall continue, the memory of how much that County hath merited from Vs and Our Crowne, may be derived with it to Posterity.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>I wish there were some Evangelicall Ministers in each County of the Kingdom, that poor People might know there is God; that they might fear him, and love him, and be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with his Son, who is theirs and our life.</p>
            <p>The County is all cleerly reduced, except <hi>Pendennis, Helford,</hi> and the Mount; which the very Countrey (I hope) will bee willing to teduce themselves, <hi>Feymouth</hi> Harbour is free to us; we have taken St. Mawes Castle, with Twelve peices of Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in it, and one called the Roaring-Meg, a choice peice of brasse: the Generall is sending Eastward some of his forces, towards Barnstable and Exeter, and intends (having blockt up Pe dennis) to return himself.</p>
            <p>There came two out of Exeter to us, who caried in Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions with them; and of Barnstable we hope to give a good accoun shortly.</p>
            <p>At Foy upon Munday last, we took a ship called the Greene Knight, having 16 peices of Ordnance, and richly laden, they being ignorant that the Harbour was ours.</p>
            <p>Your Affaires have a good complexion upon them at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent; and doubtlesse, whilest you imploy good men, they will be good for you.</p>
            <p>I have observed in the whole Tract of this Western Work, divers promises fulfilled; As that the Lord would send an Hornest amongst them: that is, a Spirit of fear, and that they shall fly when none pursues them: wee could seldome make them stand any where; they never offered to beat up a Guard

of ours at any time, though they had Four Thousand fighting Horse.</p>
            <p>I have been tould in their quarters where I lay, as 3. times my lot was to lie in Hoptons own quarters in bed, where they tould me upon everie Alarme, <hi>the sh<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

They tooke an Alarme within, charged the Coults to stand; but they not understand the Language, kept on their way, put them to such a sight, that they tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled one upon the back of another to get away.</p>
            <p>Sometimes I thought of that promise in the first Psalme, that they shall be scattered as Chaffe before the winde, they are gone into severall Countries.</p>
            <p>Sometimes, the Lord saith he will bring his wheele upon them, and break them, we saw their power broken, their Councells broken, their intrests broken, their expectations broken, who would have broke the verie Axeltree of the State.</p>
            <p>Sometimes I thought of the Prophesy; when the Lord saith he would powre contempt upon Princes especiallie when I read writings from the Prince, thus, <hi>dated at our Court at Sillie</hi>: And though he be unwilling to play with words, yet I could wish that that place, and name might ever be the portion of those that councell Princes to their own Ruin.</p>

            <p>I would say something for my selfe, and yet so prove an Acombe, as not worth a minute of your time; though you have been pleased to bear with my rudenesse.</p>
            <p>Since my last being in the City, I have beene by some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented as one scandalizing of others; which as it hath no truth in it: so I blesse God, that there is a Parliament to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale unto, and I know not the cause hereof but from my forwardnesse and faithfulnesse to the Work in hand.</p>
            <p>This I am bold to say, <hi>Though it should be accompted a Crime to serve the Parliament, and I might be sory for the Despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which it shall never make me weary of my Duty, nor my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.</hi>

            <p>If in my death the State might be a gainer, I have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times thought I might be willing to come to that trial, if my life may serve you, you may command it, for I must make the same profession that he did to <hi>Caesar,</hi> that your former fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vours have done me that injurie, that I must live, and die ungratefull.</p>
