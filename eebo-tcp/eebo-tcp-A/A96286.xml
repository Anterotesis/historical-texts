         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ecauſe my weekly writing, is to no
other intent or purpoſe, then to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover,
and manifeſt the crimes of
this nation, the knavery and fraud
of the people therein, and the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality
of the abhominations
commited in it. Thinke it not
ſtrange if I particularly lay open,
and evidently proclaime to each
publique view the deteſtable guile, and politique inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of that arch Wizzard <hi>William Lilly,</hi> with which hee
ſeekes to coſen and delude the Common-wealth; as a thing
unobſervable, and as though no body tooke notice of him:
For which I thought it not amiſſe to ſeparate him by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
and place him out of the rank of all honeſt, nay all
manner of men in generall, as one not fit to accompany a
Chriſtian. For indeed had I but once beganne his odious
name in my weekly ſheet, I ſhould hardly have writ any
thing elſe, and beſides ſhould have infected my whole diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
with the meere apprehenſion of his villany. But
not to trifle away too much time upon ſo foule a ſubject, and
poſſeſſe my breaſt any longer then needs I muſt, with his
hatefull conceits; I will come to the point or occaſion of
my publiſhing this paper.</p>
            <p>Not long ſince my brother <hi>Eleneticus</hi> in his ſecond or
third booke (if you bee remembred) makes mention of a
notable fraudulent action, committed by this Wizzard <hi>Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>

               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:137411:3"/>
in betraying a Lady contrary to her will, and cauſing
her to marry one far below her degree and quality, to the
very much diſhonour, both of her ſelf and the whole family
of the <hi>Scroopes</hi> from which ſhee deſcended, (but you muſt
be ſure to <hi>Lilly's</hi> great profit and advantage) and ſo indeed
relates the whole ſtory as it was acted (which I doubt not
but you have already heard) therefore it is to no purpoſe
for me to recite it) thereby to perform his duty, in inform<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing
the people of his baſe craftineſſe, and ſubtile deluſions.</p>
            <p>Which hapned to the hands of th' foreſaid Wizzard, that
he thereupon grew very much troubled, that his perfidious
knavery ſhould be ſo openly diſcover'd, and apparently di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulg'd
to the whole world: And being through madnes ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
(at the preſent) to invent any means to demonſtrate
his fury, remained very diſcontented along time, till at the
laſt about two moneths after the relation, when it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
forgotten<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his block head bethought himſelf of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge;
&amp; ſo compos'd a ſubtile peece of nonſenſical Engliſh,
printed it in two ſheets of paper, and guilds it over with
a cloak of <hi>Th.</hi> As thus, <hi>To all Gentlemen Cavailers of this
kingdome, a Colonell</hi> Th. <hi>ſends this diſcourſe,</hi> &amp;c. when no
ſuch Col. Ile lay my life can be heard of, only a meere for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery
of <hi>Lilly:</hi> But yet he has another Title for the booke it
ſelfe, which is <hi>The late ſtory of Mr. Will. Lilly</hi> &amp;c. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it may well be ſtiled ſo, tis a meer ſtory, you may ſwear
it is one of his owne penning; truly it is the quinteſſence,
nay it is the very extract of Nonſence, the only naturall
character of ſimplicity. Do but marke how hee begins (as
it were) with a Narration of his deteſting or abhorring
himſelfe and actions, though in a blind way, as from the
mouth of the foreſaid Col. (yet God knowes his owne
words) and ſo proceeds in his folly, with an examination
of the Gentleman, the Lady, and all parties whatſoever ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining
either to them or any elſe, whereby hee might
know the truth concerning the ſaid relation of <hi>Elencticus:</hi>
But preſently cryes it down, avers it for falſhood, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
concludes with himſelfe (but a ſatisfaction to no
body elſe) that it is no ſuch matter, only a meer fable, a ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:137411:3"/>
reproachfully penned to bring an <hi>Odium</hi> upon his
name, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thus this ſtates grand Quack-ſalver flatters himſelf, and
feeds his owne fancy, with meer deluſions, thinking to
purblind the eyes of the people with that abominable ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
Pamphlet, as his owne already are with gazing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Starres: but alas! he is much deceiv'd, all this will
not ſerve; noe, nor can all his infernall black Art abſterge,
and cleanſe his putrified name and actions from their mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
corruptions, and their merited infamy.</p>
            <p>Look next how the Coxcombe, goes on, and preſents a
few Aſtrologicall lines in the ſhade of a Letter from the ſaid
Col. bur I cannot conceive any Cavalier invented it; for
to ſpeak the truth, it carries an excellent ſtile, in faith it is
admirable Rhetoricall non-ſenſe, <hi>Excellentiſſimum &amp; ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo
gra<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>u, pro-fec-to,</hi> 'tis worthy admiration, I do not think
but he div'd to the very bottome of his Father <hi>Pluto's</hi> bud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
for it; for 'tis impoſſible his moſſy pate ſhould produce
ſuch a monſtrous miraculous piece of Eloquence: well, it
ſhall ſcape me narrowly, but that ſome time or other, when
I have nothing elſe to do, I'le ſpend an houre or two to try
if I can get it by heart, and ſo ſay it by roat, that I may carry
it in my brain with me, up and down whereſoever I goe;
For indeed I intend not to oppreſſe my pocket with it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
it be to perform that neceſſary occaſion, you know
what I meane, for which <hi>Lilly</hi> himſelfe is hardly good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.</p>
            <p>Surely, he thought the City had great need of waſt
Paper, elſe hee would never have infected the Preſſe with
ſuch a meſſe of ignorance: Truly 'tis pitty that ſuch a large,
long, tall, mighty Hobby-horſe ſhould have no more wit;
Lord! how the villain playes the Aſſe in the City, like a
Fool in a Comedy, that once wrote a Letter to his Miſtris
before her face, after ſeal'd it, ſo preſented and read it to
her upon the Stage, in the preſence of the whole Multitude;
juſt ſo hath this Ideot done, goes and writes a Letter, a meer
forgery, as from a Colonell, and directs it to himſelfe, ſo
anſwers it according to his owne diſcretion, and after di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulged

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:137411:4"/>
it to the vaſt world. I pray tell me, which act con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taind
the more ſimplicity, and which of theſe two Ideots
was the greater fool? Truly 'tis a Queſtion ſoon to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved,
for 'tis a very eaſie matter to ſay <hi>Lilly,</hi> whom I judge
to be the worſe of the two, in that he is a very great, proper
Hobgoblin, and one that more deſerves, and better beſeems
the place then any of his owne Art I know. Go, go <hi>Lilly,</hi>
I am aſhamed an Aſtrologer ſhould commit and be guilty
of ſuch deformed actions: the very Boyes, could they but
underſtand thy Eleganticall language, would point, and
hoot at thee up and downe the ſtreets; But <hi>perge</hi> (Lilly)
<hi>quid ſequitur?</hi> 'Tis very well; what! more nonſenſe yet?</p>
            <p>In faith, heer is ſuch a heap of infernall Ignorance, that
my eyes never before beheld; I wonder where <hi>Lilly</hi> bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
it: borrowed, there's a word indeed, truly you are
mightily miſtaken, it is his own invention, it as naturally
flowes from the Conduit of his profound Brain, as doth
clear water out of a Spring.</p>
            <p>But you ſhall hear the ſequent, which is an anſwer to his
own Letter, which I mentioned before; <hi>I</hi> would have you
read it (if you can) but I feare it will puzzle you: for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it dazled my eyes at the firſt beholding, it was ſo gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
over with impudence, and his brazen face had caſt forth
ſuch a luſter upon each liue, that I could not have the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to read it any more then once over, and truly thought
that too much, for I could ſcarce tell how to pick ſenſe out
of it, but at lengh underſtood his meaning; where hee ſtrives
to poſſeſſe the people, that he acted nothing diſhoneſtly, or
to the prejudice of the afore-ſaid Lady, in the leaſt degree,
with many ſuch like ſubtile perſwaſions: But let him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
that will, for my owne part I know, <hi>Elencticus</hi> to be
(contrary to his falſe definition) an honeſt, diſcreet, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate,
wiſe Gentleman, one noe wayes guilty of what he
imputeth to him, nor one whit meriting the infamous
(though falſe) ſcandals with which this ſcurvy <hi>Lilly</hi> hath
abuſed him, and that all who knowe him can teſtifie.</p>
            <p>Well, Reader, I hope I am not to tedious in my wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
neither have I offenped thy cares with my diſcourſe,

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:137411:4"/>
truly if I have, I crave thy pardon; if otherwiſe, I will yet
intrude ſomewhat more upon thy patience, and tell but a
very little more, and ſo conclude.</p>
            <p>You know a Prophet's not without honor, except in own
his country (truly a very good maxim) wherfore <hi>Lilly</hi> ſaith
himſelfe he's very much eſteemed beyond the Seas (far e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
off <hi>England</hi> you muſt thinke) As in <hi>Italy, Venice,
Paris,</hi> and many other places, but I don't know where; yet
this I'me ſure, that for my part I never heard any of his own
nation ſpeak well of him. But it is no wonder, for as long
as hee is praiſed, and eſteemed ſo in the places aforeſaid,
what needs he be reputed here? I but, how can ye tell he
is ſo regarded? How can I tell, marry, theres a queſtion
withall my heart, why, doth not hee ſay ſo himſelf? what
greater teſtimony can you have? Indeed if you expect any
other witneſſe, I muſt entreat you to bee ſilent, or elſe e'ne
goe ſeek one; for I conceive it to be a bottomleſſe piece of
buſineſſe, and you may ſeach till Dooms-day and not find a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
unleſſe you meet with Collonell <hi>Th.</hi> by chance; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
I think it muſt be by the wheele of fortune, for if one
went on purpoſe to look him, hee ſhould find it as hard a
task as ever he undertook in his life: I'de hardly (for <hi>Lilly's</hi>
whole eſtate) be bound to weare one paire of ſhooes till I
accompliſht it; for ſhould I ſo engage my ſelfe, tis doubt
in the fine I ſhould be glad to run to the Wizzard, and get
him to unmask himſelfe, reaſſume the name, and metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſe
his rotten carkaſſe (as before) from a Round-headed
jugler, a diveliſh Negromancer, and a vile Aſtronomer; to a
Civill Cavalier, a Collonel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are very unfit (a
Hangman rather would have better becom'd) and ſhould I
have faill'd of my hopes there, truly I feare, that I ſhould
continually wander'd like a Gooſe barefoot; but I intend
not to run headlong into that labyrinth.</p>
            <p>Therefore you muſt of neceſſity beleeve him, without
you make a twelve-months journey on purpoſe, to goe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
