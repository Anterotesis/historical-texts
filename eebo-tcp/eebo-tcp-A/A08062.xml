         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Upon the <hi>Foundations</hi> laid

many ſacred <hi>Buildings,</hi> were

(by our <hi>Students</hi> of the later

plauſible to trim, and
ſtuffe out thoſe <hi>Volumes,</hi> by
which they purchaſe an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due

The reſt, they endevour to

<pb facs="tcp:13463:9"/>
former times.</p>
            <p>Though few are, now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes,
acquainted with him,
you ſhall find him among the
moſt ancient <hi>Greek Fathers:</hi>
And, this <hi>Tract</hi> of his (which
is pertinent to every member
of <hi>man-kinde</hi> capable of <hi>Book-knowledge)</hi>
was heretofore ſo
wel eſteemed, as to have been
twice interpreted, out of
<hi>Greek</hi> into <hi>Latine, (viz.)</hi> by
<hi>Georgius Valla Placentinus,</hi>
and <hi>Nacaſius Ellebodius,</hi> of
whoſe interpretations I have
made uſe.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Author</hi> was as honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
in his generation, as
thoſe that are more volumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous,
and more frequently
named: for, he was not onely
ſo eminent for his <hi>Naturall
Philoſophy,</hi> as to be called (by
way of excellency) NEME<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SIUS
the <hi>Philoſopher;</hi> but,
ſo good a <hi>Moralist</hi> alſo, and
<pb facs="tcp:13463:9"/>
ſo expert in the <hi>Lawes</hi> of the
<hi>Romane Empire,</hi> that, the moſt
Reverend, learned and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
<hi>Father</hi> GREGORIE
<hi>Nazian:</hi> (among whoſe <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ems</hi>
are Verſes written to this
NEMESIUS) hath highly
magnified him, both for his
<hi>Learning,</hi> and <hi>uprightneſſe:</hi> and
left it witneſſed, likewiſe, that
he was dignified with a <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidentſhip</hi>
in <hi>Cappadocia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When thoſe <hi>Verſes</hi> were
firſt written to our <hi>Author,</hi> he
had not embraced the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Faith.</hi> For, hee was by
them invited thereunto: And
their invitation ſeemed to
have taken ſo good effect,
that he became a happy <hi>Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;</hi>
an eminent <hi>Champion</hi> in
the <hi>Chriſtian Warfare;</hi> a <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop</hi>
of a City in <hi>Phoenicia,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the times of the <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours</hi>
VALENS and THE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ODOSIUS.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:13463:10"/>
Some have doubted whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he were the ſame <hi>Neme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi>
mentioned by GREGO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIE;
onely, becauſe he was
a <hi>Lawyer</hi> &amp; a <hi>Temporall Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate:</hi>
But queſtionleſſe hee
that was once an <hi>Infidell,</hi> and
afterward a <hi>Beleever,</hi> might
aſwell have been, alſo, a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,</hi>
and a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> after he had
exerciſed the Functions of a
<hi>Lawyer</hi> and a <hi>Iudge;</hi> ſeeing it
is no new matter, that they
ſhould execute a <hi>double-cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi>
who have received a
double portion of the <hi>Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For, in all Ages, (ſince
<hi>Princes</hi> became <hi>Nurſing-Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>
of the <hi>Church)</hi> it hath
been uſuall for <hi>Emperours,
Kings,</hi> and other <hi>Free States,</hi>
to make uſe of their <hi>Gifts,</hi> in
Temporall <hi>Iudicatures,</hi> and in
other <hi>publike Affaires,</hi> of
whoſe Wiſedome, and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe,
they had experience
<pb facs="tcp:13463:10"/>
in <hi>Eccleſiaſticall Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:</hi>
yea, and it was no
ſtrange thing for men of ſay
profeſſions, to be called from
common Affaires, to aſſume
<hi>ſacred Orders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And (though ſome are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreetly
offended thereat)
it is not onely both conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
and comely, that <hi>Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall
perſons</hi> (who neither
deſire, nor ambitiouſly affect
ſuch Employments) ſhould
be, ſometime, invited and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized
by their <hi>Soveraigns,</hi>
to joyne unto their <hi>spirituall
charge,</hi> an induſtrious care of
the <hi>temporall welfare.</hi> But it
ſo happeneth otherwhile, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
that this <hi>double Authority,</hi>
(though it double the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment)
proveth ſo farre
from being over-burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome,
or a hinderance to the
due execution of the firſt <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
calling,</hi> that hee upon who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:13463:11"/>
it is conferred, is thereby the
better enabled to mannage
both for the generall advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage:
And we finde this <hi>dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
calling,</hi> to have been ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
ſo commendably, and ſo
ſucceſſefully practiſed in the
moſt flouriſhing times, both
of <hi>Iewiſh,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweales;
that it may be
ſtill warrantably imitated, ſo
often as <hi>Soveraign power</hi> ſhall
be pleaſed therewithall.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Nemeſius</hi> (whoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold
<hi>employments,</hi> and gifts
of the Spirit, have perhaps,
occaſioned this digreſſion, to
ſome good purpoſe) embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the <hi>Chriſtian Faith,</hi> and
received his <hi>Epiſcopall digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
(as it ſeemes by circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces)
long after his <hi>Preſident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip:</hi>
For, as by the words of
<hi>GREGORIE</hi> may be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,
he had given faire te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies
both of his <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:13463:11"/>
and <hi>Vprightneſſe</hi> in that
<hi>Office,</hi> before his <hi>Converſion:</hi>
and his faithfulnes in the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploiment
of that <hi>ſingle talent;</hi>
firſt vouchſafed, by the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
grace,</hi> was rewarded with
a large encreaſe, through the
<hi>ſpeciall favour</hi> of GOD, as the
ſequele hath declared.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Authors</hi> whom he na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
(none of them having li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
ſince the <hi>Emperours</hi> afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned)
are a probable ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of his <hi>Antiquitie;</hi> and
ſo likewiſe, is the ſcope of this
Treatiſe, and his manner of
handling the ſame: For, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to this command,
<hi>When thou art converted,
ſtrengthen thy brethren;</hi> the
learned <hi>Converts</hi> of the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive

to fortifie their <hi>Profeſſion</hi> (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the many heathen <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers</hi>
who did then oppoſe
it) by turning the weapons

againſt themſelves; even
by fooling their <hi>carnall wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi>
in their owne logicall
reaſonings; and by the <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi>
of their own <hi>Philoſophie.</hi>
And in this performance, our
<hi>Author</hi> was both faithfull
and painefull; as will appeare
by the following <hi>Tract,</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to be preſerved and peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in all generations.</p>
            <p>For in what age, will the
knowledge of the <hi>humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
bee impertinent, or to
what perſon of that kinde?
nay, what <hi>knowledge,</hi> ſave the
knowledge of <hi>GOD</hi> is more
pertinent? Or, how can <hi>GOD</hi>
be well knowne, by him, that
knoweth not <hi>himſelfe?</hi> It is
that <hi>knowledge</hi> which this
<hi>Booke</hi> teacheth; and in my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
the ignorance of right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
knowing our owne <hi>nature</hi>
is one maine cauſe of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb facs="tcp:13463:13"/>
abſurdities, and unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
controverſies which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract
theſe times, yea, the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
thereof is a principall
cauſe that ſo many wickedly
blaſpheme <hi>GOD,</hi> &amp; unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
accuſe him (without
cauſe) of being niggardly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them in the Talents of
<hi>nature;</hi> and in requiring that
of them, which hee hath not
given them ability to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme.</p>
            <p>Hence ariſeth it alſo,
that ſome <hi>conſequently,</hi> and
ſome <hi>directly</hi> make our good
<hi>GOD</hi> the Author of all <hi>ſinne;</hi>
and MAN, not properly an <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,</hi>
but a <hi>patient</hi> only in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
evill. From this <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi>
likewiſe it proceedeth,
that wee neither husband the
gifts of <hi>nature</hi> (which is Gods
<hi>common grace)</hi> nor endevour
as we ought to doe, according
to that ability which we have
<pb facs="tcp:13463:14"/>
received: whereas, if wee
knew what were given into
our power, and what not; I
think we ſhould not ſo often,
(as many of us doe) fooliſhly
denie our <hi>eſſentiall propertie;</hi>
but <hi>beleeve</hi> and <hi>worke,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to <hi>Sanctified reaſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though our originall <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
were ſo depraved by
our <hi>firſt parents</hi> fall, that
wee loſt our <hi>Well-beeing;</hi> yet
wee loſt not our <hi>Naturall-beeing,</hi>
nor thoſe <hi>Faculties,</hi>
which made us capable of
being renewed by <hi>ſpeciall
grace,</hi> when it ſhould be ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
unto us. Though we fell
very low, &amp; were in a <hi>Down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall,</hi>
in which we ſhould never
have left ſinking; and from
which wee could never have
raiſed our ſelves, by any pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
remaining in our ſelves;
yet we were not at the loweſt
by our <hi>Grand-fathers</hi> offence.
<pb facs="tcp:13463:14"/>
For, the <hi>mercy</hi> of GOD, even
IESVS CHRIST, ſtayed
us from falling ſo low, as we
had elſe tumbled; and from
looſing abſolutely our <hi>Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality,</hi>
or any thing eſſentiall
thereunto, by that <hi>Tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea, though the <hi>Will,</hi> and
every other <hi>Powre</hi> of the
SOUL were ſo maimed and
bruized by the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi>
that, like a broken <hi>Watch,</hi>
their <hi>motions</hi> would have
been ſtill worſe and worſe,
till they had utterly periſhed;
and ſhould never have mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
rightly of themſelves,
(nor by any other meanes)
unleſſ the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi>
had, at leaſt, benefited us
without our owne <hi>righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi>
as much as the firſt <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
harmed us, without our
<hi>perſonall ſinne:</hi> yet, no man loſt
by the firſt <hi>Tranſgreſſion,</hi> ſo
<pb facs="tcp:13463:15"/>
much, as hee may loſe by his
own fault.</p>
            <p>By the firſt <hi>ſinne,</hi> wee loſt,
indeed, our <hi>light,</hi> but not our
<hi>eyes.</hi> And therefore, when
GOD ſent the <hi>light</hi> of MAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>KIND
into the World, hee
reprobated thoſe, onely, who
<hi>rejected</hi> it. And why? not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<hi>they ſaw it not;</hi> but <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they loved it not.</hi> For,
that they ſaw it, is manifeſt
by that place, which ſaid, <hi>It
enlightens every one which
commeth into the world.</hi> Yea,
the reprobate Jews could not
deny but that they <hi>ſaw it;</hi> for,
our Saviour told them, that,
if they could have truely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
to have ſeene this <hi>Light,</hi>
they ſhould not have had
their ſins imputed unto them:
which, (under correction) I
take to be the meaning of his
words.</p>
            <p>Now, if they <hi>ſaw it,</hi> wee
<pb facs="tcp:13463:15"/>
may truely inferre that <hi>they
received of his fulneſſe,</hi> that
<hi>common grace,</hi> and the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of every <hi>naturall facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
ſo far forth, as might have
<hi>enabled them, to become the
ſons of GOD;</hi> whereas, by the
neglect of that <hi>ſingle Talent,</hi>
they became loſers of more
then <hi>Adam</hi> loſt them; even
to loſe the right uſe of their
<hi>naturall faculties,</hi> and to be of
a <hi>Reprobate ſenſe;</hi> having <hi>eyes,</hi>
that <hi>ſee not: eares,</hi> that <hi>heare
not:</hi> and <hi>hearts</hi> as void of <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,</hi>
as the beaſt that
periſheth. And, all this comes
to paſſe through want of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering,
what is taught in this
<hi>Book,</hi> even for want of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what <hi>power</hi> wee have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
us, and how wee are to
exerciſe that <hi>power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let no man, therefore, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe
this meanes of <hi>Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
nor prejudicately conceive
<pb facs="tcp:13463:16"/>
(becauſe it may have ſome
expreſſions unſutable to their
opinions) that NATURE
is here magnified above
GRACE, or in any meaſure
equalled thereunto: or, that
any power is thereto aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
derogating from the <hi>free
mercy</hi> of GOD. Far is it from
our <hi>Authors</hi> intention: and for
ever, far be it from me, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
an inſtrument of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing
ſuch <hi>Doctrines.</hi> There
is not (in my judgement) one
ſyllable in this <hi>Tract,</hi> which
tendeth not to the glorifying
of GOD's <hi>Grace</hi> to <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde.</hi>
For, whatſoever is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed
to <hi>man,</hi> as being pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily
in him by <hi>nature,</hi> is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
to be the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
gift of GOD: That which
is affirmed to be left in him,
ſince the <hi>fall,</hi> is confeſſed to
have been juſtly forfeited, and
yet preſerved in him, by the
<pb facs="tcp:13463:16"/>
               <hi>free Grace</hi> of the ſame GOD:
The good <hi>effects</hi> of all thoſe
<hi>Faculties,</hi> which are affirmed
in <hi>mans</hi> power, were not (in
my underſtanding) ſo much
as thought, by this <hi>Author,</hi>
(nor are they ſo conceived by
me) to be wrought at any
time without the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
aſſiſtance of the <hi>holy
Spirit:</hi> neither is the <hi>naturall
power</hi> of <hi>man,</hi> or the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of his <hi>nature,</hi> here ſet forth
for <hi>mans</hi> owne glory, or that
he ſhould arrogate anything
to himſelfe: But, that GOD's
<hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>ſecond</hi> GRACE
vouchſafed unto us, might
the more manifeſtly appeare.
And that it might not be one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>ſaid,</hi> but made evident, alſo,
that the <hi>ſinne</hi> and <hi>unhappineſſe</hi>
of every <hi>man,</hi> is of <hi>himſelfe,</hi>
and not of GOD: all which is
implyed (though not directly
expreſſed) by the ſcope of this
<hi>Booke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:13463:17"/>
They affirme in effect, this
blaſphemy, that every <hi>ſinne</hi> is
GOD's, (though in word
they profeſſe never ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
againſt it) who will not
allow that MAN (as this
<hi>Treatiſe</hi> declareth) hath ſome
things naturally in his owne
power. For, unleſſe that be
granted, hee ſhould have as
little <hi>ſinne,</hi> as <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> of
his owne: and <hi>beaſts</hi> or <hi>blocks</hi>
might as well be reputed
<hi>righteous,</hi> or <hi>ſinfull,</hi> &amp; as juſtly
be termed <hi>Reaſonable-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi>
as <hi>men:</hi> yea, and many
other abſurdities are belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
and occaſioned, by the
ignorance of that, which is
here taught.</p>
            <p>Beſides that, which is the
maine ſcope of this Booke,
divers brief teſtimonies of
ancient <hi>Truths</hi> (lately ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
of novelty) are here and
there, occaſionally inſerted;
<pb facs="tcp:13463:17"/>
yea, and to ſome in theſe
dayes, that which was the
prime intention of this <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe</hi>
is, yet, as pertinent as
when it was firſt written:
For, there are not only as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſtill ignorant of their own
<hi>Nature</hi> as heretofore; but, the
ſame <hi>Stoicall Divinity,</hi> here
oppoſed, and confuted, is, in
ſome branches, ſo largely
ſprouted up againe, that, they
are ſuppoſed to be ancient &amp;
orthodoxe principles of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity;</hi>
and ſo are they cryed
up by a multitude of modern
voices, that few beleeve, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity</hi>
ever mentioned ought
in contradiction to what
they fancie to be the <hi>Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To make it appeare other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
this <hi>Father</hi> of the
<hi>Church</hi> ſpeakes now in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh,</hi>
what he ſpake in <hi>Greek</hi>
much above a thouſand yeares
paſt: And therefore, though it
<pb facs="tcp:13463:18"/>
were true (which as yet, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
not) that ſome of the
later times have as learnedly
handled the ſame ſubject; yet,
becauſe the noblenes of <hi>Truth,</hi>
is other while ſuſpected, when
her Pedigree is obſcured, I
thought it not in vaine, to
help to diſcover her Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
by the publication of this
<hi>Author.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You have him (if I am not
much deceived) according to
his Genuine ſenſe, though not
every where grammatically
interpreted; for that were but
to play the part of a <hi>Pedant.</hi>
And becauſe a ſhew of tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes,
might make the ſame
leſſe profitable, I have not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cauſed him to ſpeak as brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and as plainly to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
capacities, as I poſſibly
could, (which is not eaſie in a
Subject of this nature) but to
prevent weariſomenes, and
<pb facs="tcp:13463:18"/>
render it the more uſefull, I
have divided the longeſt
<hi>Chapters,</hi> into equall <hi>Sections;</hi>
&amp; before every <hi>Chapter</hi> and
<hi>Section,</hi> ſummed up the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
<hi>Contents</hi> of the ſame.
Which will bee eaſefull unto
thoſe who have not leaſure to
read out long continued <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes;</hi>
eſpecially when they
have ſome ſpeedy occaſion to
collect the Teſtimonies of
<hi>Antiquitie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now that I may every way
(as much as in me lieth) keep
my <hi>Nemeſius</hi> from being ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
miſconceived, or miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted;
I beſeech my common
<hi>Readers,</hi> to bee very heedfull
in the peruſall of him, leaſt
through want of underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in themſelves, they cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
him to be an Author not
<hi>Intelligible,</hi> (as it hath pleaſed
them to cenſure a learned
writer now living) for ſuch
<pb facs="tcp:13463:19"/>
halfe witted people, as are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
capable of the myſteries
of <hi>Nature,</hi> nor of ſuch tearms,
as may properly expreſſe
them, ſhould learne to know,
before they preſume to <hi>cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure:</hi>
which will never bee
attained, without humility &amp;
ſome diligence.</p>
            <p>Let them pleaſe to be heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
alſo, when this <hi>Author</hi>
ſpeaks in his own perſon, and
when in the perſon of others:
for, ſometime he bringeth in
<hi>Arguments,</hi> and continued
diſputes, out of <hi>Ethnick Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers,</hi>
(with all their cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
to confute their
fellowes; and if it be not well
obſerved when hee ſo doth,
ſome heatheniſh <hi>propoſition,</hi>
(interlaced therewith) may be
wrongfully taken for his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion:
And, perhaps alſo a well
meaning expreſſion may bee
miſunderſtood, contrary to
<pb facs="tcp:13463:19"/>
the minde of the <hi>Authour,</hi> by
a little obſcurity in the Text,
or by want of heeding, how

            <p>
               <hi>Nemeſius</hi> hath heretofore
ſuffred in this kinde, even by
no worſe men, then his two
<hi>Latine Interpreters;</hi> and one of
them hath charged him with
being of their opinion, who
beleeved the <hi>Tranſmigration
of Soules,</hi> whereof hee was
no way guilty, as may be
made probable, not only by
ſundry expreſſions in this
<hi>Tract;</hi> but by thoſe words al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
from whence this miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
aroſe; they being inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted,

            <p>They are to be found about

<q>
                  <hi>Iamblicus</hi> (ſaith he) hath af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
<pb facs="tcp:13463:20"/>
in his Booke called
MONOBIBLON, that
the <hi>changing of Soules</hi> never
hapneth from <hi>men</hi> to <hi>unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
creatures,</hi> nor from
<hi>unreaſonable creatures</hi> to
<hi>men:</hi> but from <hi>Beaſts,</hi> to
<hi>Beaſts,</hi> and from <hi>men,</hi> to
<hi>men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and in ſo ſaying, hee
hath not only conjectured
very well of <hi>Platoes</hi> opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but of the <hi>Truth</hi> it ſelfe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>By theſe laſt words, <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſius</hi>
hath ſeemed to juſtifie
the opinion, both of <hi>Iambli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi>
&amp; <hi>Plato,</hi> touching <hi>Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migration
of Soules.</hi> Now this
<hi>clauſe</hi> I have underſtood as if
it ſaid thus, rather: <hi>And in ſo
ſaying, hee hath not only well
gueſſed, but in my judgement
expreſſed the very truth of</hi> Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toes
<hi>opinion.</hi> Let the learned
judge, whether the Greek
words will not well enough
beare this <hi>Verſion</hi> (though not
<pb facs="tcp:13463:20"/>
in a ſtrict Grammaticall
ſenſe) eſpecially ſince the
context proves his opinion
concerning the <hi>Soule</hi> to be the
ſame which is generally belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
among <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> for my
part, till I ſee more cauſe to
ſuſpect the contrary, I ſhall
alway ſo conceive of it.</p>
            <p>That which is mentioned
by another concerning his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
touching the <hi>Soules</hi>
preexiſtence before the <hi>Bodie,</hi>
is not a matter <hi>of faith,</hi> or ſo
preciſely decided, as that <hi>he</hi> or
<hi>we</hi> are (for ought I know) ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged,
to be peremptorily for
it, or againſt it; and therefore
I my ſelf have not yet ſo much
thought upon it as to reſolve
which way to encline: or
what to anſwer for him. If
any man can aſſure me whether
part is without errour, that
will I embrace; and I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
ſo would Nemeſius
<pb facs="tcp:13463:21"/>
have done, if any man could
have proved unto him that
his opinion was erroneous, in
that point; which if others
beleeve of him, (as they have
no juſt cauſe to the contrary)
no more needes to be ſpoken
of this matter.</p>
            <p>If any be offended that hee
argues <hi>philoſophically,</hi> rather
then by proofs of <hi>Scripture,</hi>
and citeth <hi>Moſes</hi> not as a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Prophet, but a <hi>Wiſeman;</hi>
Let them conſider, that hee
had ſuch to conteſt withall,
as neither beleeved the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi>
nor aſcribed more unto
<hi>Moſes,</hi> or any other, then the
Reaſonableneſſe of their affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
ſeemed to deſerve; The
alledging of <hi>Scripture,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
to ſuch men, had been to
caſt pearles to ſwine, and
more to the deriſion, then to
the honour of his cauſe. This
courſe was practiced by the
<pb facs="tcp:13463:21"/>
Apoſtles themſelves; To the
<hi>Iewes</hi> and beleeving <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi>
they brought the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of the Prophets: but to
Unbeleevers, they cited their
owne <hi>Poets,</hi> or convinced
them by <hi>Reaſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Had our Author argued
with</hi> Chriſtians, <hi>the holy</hi>
Scriptures <hi>onely, ſhould have
been Judges of their</hi> Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies:
<hi>For he himſelfe ſaith,
Cap. 2. Sect. 7.</hi> To us the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the divine Scriptures
are al-ſufficient, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but againſt
thoſe who embrace not the

doe) we muſt prove by Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration,

            </p>
            <p>In theſe times, there be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,

yet they doe as bad (or
worſe rather) for they deny
the true ſenſe of them, and
make interpretations accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb facs="tcp:13463:22"/>
to their owne luſts and
fancies. To theſe alſo, the <hi>holy
Scriptures</hi> are impertinent
proofs, till by ſome reaſonable
Demonſtrations we can make
them underſtand and confeſſe
their true meaning: And ſome
of theſe have ſo long, and ſo
violently profeſſed againſt
Reaſon, as unuſefull in the
conſideration of the <hi>Divine
myſteries,</hi> that there is little
hope either to work upon
them by a <hi>rationall diſpute,</hi> or
to convince them by <hi>divine
Authority,</hi> till GOD ſhall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
their deniall and abuſe
of his <hi>common graces,</hi> upon
true repentance for the ſame;
and reſtore the <hi>Vnderſtanding</hi>
which is worthily darkned

and ſo true is this <hi>Definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
that it may ſeeme he

comming to the <hi>ſoul</hi>
(as one diſtinct thing

               </p>
               <p>There be ſome, (and of

Of this mind alſo was

For, having laid

that the <hi>Vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi>
is a <hi>principall</hi> of the

conjectures that a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

was made together

aſſiſteth in the <hi>knowledge</hi>

By which means it comes

               </p>
               <p>PLATO ſeems to affirm
that MAN conſiſts not

to ſay, joyntly of a <hi>Soul</hi>
and a <hi>Body:</hi> but rather, that
he is a <hi>ſoul,</hi> uſing (as it were

or elſe by perſwading that

would, peradventure, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure
us to renounce the

things not primarily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent

but, chiefely belonging

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:13463:26"/>
appertaining to

               </p>
               <p>And it is indeed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
(not much other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe)
of all men, that the
<hi>ſoul</hi> is far more to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed
then the <hi>body:</hi> and
that the <hi>body</hi> is but as it
were an <hi>Inſtrument</hi> moved
by the <hi>ſoul,</hi> as is evident
in <hi>death.</hi> For if thereby
the <hi>ſoul</hi> be divided from

as much without motion,
as a Workmans <hi>Tools</hi>

aſide.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> This is manifeſt, that
MAN in ſome things par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipates
with <hi>creatures
void of life;</hi> and that he is
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:13463:26"/>
partaker alſo of <hi>life,</hi> as
thoſe <hi>living-creatures</hi> be,
which are <hi>unreaſonable:</hi>
and that he is indowed
likewiſe with <hi>underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi>
as are <hi>Creatures reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.</hi>
With <hi>inanimate
creatures Man</hi> partakes in
this, that he hath a <hi>Body,</hi>
and in his mixture of the
<hi>foure Elements.</hi> He agrees
with <hi>Plants,</hi> not onely in
that which is afore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
but in having alſo
both a <hi>nouriſhing</hi> and a
<hi>feeding-power.</hi> His cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
with <hi>unreaſonable
Creatures</hi> (over and above
all the former particulars)
is, in having a certaine
<hi>voluntary motion, appetite,
anger,</hi> and a <hi>power</hi> enabling
him to <hi>feele</hi> and <hi>breathe:</hi>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:13463:27"/>
for all theſe are common
both to <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
creatures.</hi> Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,
he communicates
with <hi>Intelligent incorpore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Natures,</hi> in <hi>reaſoning,
underſtanding, judging,</hi> and
in purſuing <hi>vertue</hi> and a
<hi>good life,</hi> which is the chief
end of all <hi>vertues.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe things conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
MAN ſtandeth in ſuch
a <hi>Being</hi> as comprehends
the <hi>ſenſible</hi> and <hi>intelligible
Nature.</hi> In reſpect of his
<hi>Bodily powers,</hi> and of his
<hi>Bodily ſubſtance</hi> (which is
ſubject unto <hi>ſenſe)</hi> hee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
both with <hi>living-creatures,</hi>
and with things
<hi>void of life.</hi> In reſpect of
his <hi>Reaſonable part</hi> he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates
with <hi>Subſtances</hi>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:13463:27"/>
which are <hi>bodileſſe</hi> (or <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall)</hi>
as hath been ſaid
before: For, GOD the
<hi>Creator</hi> of all things, hath
ſeemed by little and little
ſo to collect and knit toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſundry <hi>differing na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tures,</hi>
that all <hi>created things</hi>
ſhould become ONE
And indeed, it will be a
manifeſt proofe unto us,
that there is but <hi>One Crea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tor</hi>
of all things, if we well
conſider how fitly he hath
united the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuall

the ſeverall <hi>ſpecies</hi> (tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowout

excellent <hi>ſympathie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For, as in every <hi>living</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/>
                  <hi>creature</hi> hee hath joyned

that all theſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Even ſo he hath
joyned one to another,
every particular <hi>ſpecies</hi>
which was created, by <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering</hi>
and <hi>compounding</hi>
that <hi>agreement</hi> and <hi>diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement</hi>
which is in their

things <hi>inanimate</hi> doe not
greatly differ from <hi>Plants</hi>
which have in them a <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitative</hi>
and <hi>nouriſhing life;</hi>
neither are <hi>Plants</hi> wholy

as that they have no natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall

whereby they may be

               <p>For even in <hi>ſtones</hi>
(which are <hi>inanimate crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi>
not having in them,
for the moſt part, ſo much
as a <hi>vegitative life)</hi> there
is otherwiſe a certaine
<hi>power,</hi> making them to
differ from each other e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in their <hi>ſtony properties:</hi>
but the <hi>Loadſtone</hi> ſeemeth
very far to exceed the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and vertue of other
<hi>ſtones,</hi> in that it both at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:13463:29"/>
                  <hi>Iron</hi> thereunto, and
alſo detaineth it (being
ſo attracted) as if it would
be nouriſhed thereby.
Neither doth it exerciſe
this vertue upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one peece
of <hi>Iron</hi> alone; but, by that
one peece, linketh faſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
and imparteth his

thereunto: yea <hi>Iron</hi>
draweth <hi>Iron,</hi> when it is
touched by the <hi>Loadſtone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, when the
<hi>CREATOR</hi> paſſed from
<hi>Plants</hi> to <hi>living-creatures,</hi>
he ruſhed not (as we may
ſay) all at once, into
things whoſe nature is to
<hi>remove from place to place;</hi>
and, to ſuch as are indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:13463:29"/>
proceeded, rather, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,

did not perfect him in

all at once;) but, firſt, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffed

               <p>The ſame <hi>Order</hi> (if it

               <p>Furthermore hee made

THeſe things conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<hi>Moſes</hi> in expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the Creation of the
World, did very properly
affirme that MAN was laſt
made. Not only, becauſe
all things being made for
MAN, it was moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient,
that all ſuch
things ought firſt to bee
provided, which were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
pertinent to his
uſe; and that he who was
to have the uſe of them,
ſhould afterward be crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
But, in reſpect both
<hi>intellectuall</hi> and <hi>viſible ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,</hi>
were created, it
ſeemed alſo convenient
that <hi>One</hi> ſhould be made,

was MAN made ſuch a <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving-creature,</hi>
as might

                  <hi>Such as the earth is, ſuch

and indeed that which

is to avoid and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<hi>Evill,</hi> and love and

                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:13463:34"/>

he is a MAN, (and not

to <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Piety.</hi>
But we will anon ſhew
diſtinctly what things
pertain to <hi>Vertue,</hi> and
what to <hi>Piety,</hi> when we
come to diſcourſe of the
<hi>Soul</hi> and of the <hi>Body:</hi> For,
ſeeing wee doe not yet

for us to treat

               <p>The <hi>Hebrewes</hi> affirme <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:13463:35"/>
that MAN was made from
the beginning, neither al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
<hi>mortall,</hi> neither
wholly <hi>immortall,</hi> but, as it
were, in a ſtate betweene
both thoſe <hi>natures,</hi> to the
end that if he did follow
the affections of the <hi>body,</hi>
he ſhould be liable to ſuch
alterations as belong to
the <hi>bodie;</hi> But if he did
prefer ſuch good things
as pertaine to the <hi>ſoul,</hi> he
ſhould then be honoured
with <hi>Immortalitie</hi> For, if
GOD had made MAN ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
<hi>mortall</hi> from the
beginning, he would not
have condemned him to
die after he had offended;
becauſe it had beene a
thing needleſſe to make
him <hi>mortall</hi> by condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:13463:35"/>
who was <hi>mortall</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
And on the other
ſide, if he had made <hi>Man</hi>
abſolutely <hi>immortall,</hi> hee
would not have cauſed
him to ſtand in need of
<hi>nouriſhment;</hi> for, nothing
that is <hi>immortall</hi> needeth
<hi>bodily nouriſhment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, it is not to
be beleeved, that <hi>God</hi>
would ſo haſtily have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
himſelf, and made
<hi>Him</hi> to be forthwith <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall,</hi>
who was created ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
<hi>immortall:</hi> For it
is evident that he did not
ſo in the <hi>Angels</hi> that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
but (according to the
nature which they obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
from the beginning)
they remained <hi>immortall,</hi>
undergoing for their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:13463:36"/>
not the penalty of

that MAN was indeed

in ſuch wiſe that if hee

IT being inexpedient,
rather then any way
helpful, for MAN to know
his own <hi>nature,</hi> before he
came to his <hi>perfection,</hi>
GOD forbad him to taſte
the <hi>Tree of Knowledge of

               </p>
               <p>When hee fell away

               <p>But as for the <hi>Earth,</hi>

II Man only is a

Arts and Sciences:
A Definition of Man,
and Reaſons juſtifying
every branch of that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition.
III. The
World was not made for

To him was committed
the government of the

THere are alſo two
<hi>Priviledges</hi> which <hi>Man</hi>
hath ſpecially gotten a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all other. One is, to
obtaine <hi>pardon</hi> by <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;</hi>
the other is that
his <hi>body</hi> being <hi>mortall</hi>
ſhould be brought to <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie.</hi>
This <hi>(privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge)</hi>
of the <hi>body,</hi> he get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
by meanes of the
<hi>ſoul;</hi> and the priviledge of
the <hi>ſoul,</hi> by reaſon of the
<hi>bodie:</hi> Yea, among <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
creatures, Man</hi> only
hath obtained this <hi>Peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar,</hi>
that God vouchſafeth
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:13463:46"/>
him the pardon of ſin up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
repentance; For nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the <hi>Devils</hi> nor the
Angels are vouchſafed
<hi>pardon,</hi> though they doe
repent.</p>
               <p>Hereby the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
<hi>Iuſtice,</hi> and admirable
<hi>mercy,</hi> of GOD is both
fully proved and evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
declared: For, good
cauſe is there why pardon
ſhould not bee granted to
<hi>Angels,</hi> though they doe
repent; becauſe there is
nothing in them, which
naturally allures or draws
them to ſin; and in regard
alſo that they (of their
own nature) are free from
all paſſions, wants, and
pleaſures of the <hi>body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But MAN, though hee
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:13463:47"/>
be indowed with <hi>Reaſon,</hi>
yet hee is alſo a <hi>bodily li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
creature,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his wants (in that
hee is ſuch a <hi>living crea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture)</hi>
together with his
<hi>paſsions,</hi> do often blinde
and captivate his <hi>reaſon.</hi>
And therefore (when he
returnes againe by <hi>repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi>
and applies himſelfe
unto <hi>vertue)</hi> he obtaineth
<hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>forgiveneſſe:</hi>
For as it is proper to the
<hi>Eſſence</hi> of MAN to have
the ability of <hi>laughing</hi>
(becauſe it agreeth to <hi>man
only, to all men,</hi> and <hi>ever
to man)</hi> ſo (in reſpect of
thoſe things, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from the <hi>grace</hi> of
<hi>God)</hi> it is proper unto <hi>Man</hi>
above all <hi>Creatures</hi> indued
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:13463:47"/>
with Reaſon, to bee deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
by <hi>Repentance,</hi> from
the accuſation and guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe
of all thoſe things
wherein he hath formerly
tranſgreſſed. Yea, this
<hi>Grace</hi> is given to MAN
<hi>onely; to all men;</hi> and <hi>ever
to man,</hi> during the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
of his life in this
world, and no longer:
for after <hi>Death</hi> there is
no more <hi>Forgiveneſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some there bee who
give a reaſon why the
<hi>Angels</hi> could no more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<hi>pardon by repentance</hi>
after they had fallen; and
it is this that followes.
The <hi>Fall of Angels,</hi> was
<hi>(as they affirme)</hi> a kind of
<hi>Death</hi> unto them; and
God vouchſafed them the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:13463:48"/>
tender of a pardon before
their utter <hi>falling away,</hi>
when like account was to
bee made of them, as is
made of <hi>Men</hi> during this
<hi>life:</hi> But becauſe they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
not the <hi>grace</hi> offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
they received after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
(as a juſt reward)
puniſhment everlaſting
without <hi>pardon.</hi> And
hereby it plainly appeares
that ſuch as refuſe <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi>
doe reject that
which is a ſpeciall good
gift of God, and peculiar
to MAN.</p>
               <p>This alſo is one of the
things proper and peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar
unto MAN, that of all
other <hi>living creatures</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the <hi>body</hi> of MAN ſhould
ariſe againe after <hi>Death,</hi>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:13463:48"/>
and aſpire to <hi>Immortalitie.</hi>
This priviledge the <hi>body</hi>
gaineth in reſpect of the
<hi>immortalitie</hi> of the <hi>ſoule;</hi> as
likewiſe the <hi>ſoule</hi> obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
the other (that is to
ſay, <hi>pardon after Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance)</hi>
in reſpect that the
<hi>Body,</hi> is weake and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
with many <hi>paſsions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a thing proper al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
to MAN only, to learn
<hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences,</hi> and to
worke according unto

               </p>
               <p>He is tearmed a <hi>living-creature,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>He is ſaid to be indued

               </p>
               <p>He is called <hi>mortall,</hi> to

that are <hi>immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And, this clauſe <hi>[capable

is added thereunto, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
wee come to <hi>Arts</hi>
and <hi>Sciences</hi> by learning
of them; having in us na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
a certaine potenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all

               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:13463:49"/>
There be ſome, who
ſay that this laſt clauſe
was lately added to the

beene good enough with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the ſame, were it not,
that ſome bring in their
<hi>Nymphes,</hi> and other <hi>petty
Deities</hi> of thoſe kinds,
who are ſaid to live

MAN from thoſe,
theſe words, <hi>Capable of
conſideration and ſcience</hi>
were judged needfull; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,
none of that ſort are
thought to <hi>learne</hi> any
thing; but, to <hi>know natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,</hi>
whatſoever they are
ſaid to <hi>know.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Iewes</hi> are of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/>
on that the whole <hi>World</hi>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:13463:50"/>
was made for MAN (even
immediately for his ſake)
as Oxen with other beaſts
for tillage, or to bear bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens;
and, as graſſe was
made for the <hi>Beaſts.</hi> For
ſome things were made
for their owne ſakes; and
ſome for the ſakes of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
All <hi>reaſonable-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi>
were made for their
owne ſakes: <hi>Vnreaſonable-creatures</hi>
and things <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
life,</hi> were ordained for
others, not for themſelves.</p>
               <p>Now, if ſuch things
were made in reſpect of
others, let us conſider for
whom they were, indeed,
created. Shall wee think
they were made for the
<hi>Angels?</hi> Doubtleſſe, no
wiſe man will ſay that
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:13463:50"/>
they were made for their
ſakes; becauſe, the things
made for the reſpect or
ſake of another, muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
either the <hi>making,</hi> or
the <hi>continuance,</hi> or the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation</hi>
of thoſe things for
which they were made:
For, they are made ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in reſpect of the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation</hi>
and <hi>ſucceſsion</hi> of
their kinde; or of their
<hi>nouriſhment;</hi> or to <hi>cover</hi>
them; or to <hi>cure</hi> them, or
for their better <hi>welfare</hi>
and <hi>reſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Angels</hi> need
no ſuch things; for, they
neither have any <hi>ſucceſsion</hi>
of their <hi>kind,</hi> neither want
<hi>clothing, bodily nouriſhment,</hi>
nor any thing elſe: And, if
<hi>Angels</hi> have no need of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:13463:51"/>
ſuch things, it is then evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that no other <hi>nature</hi>
having place above the
<hi>Angels;</hi> can have need of
them; becauſe by how
much higher the place of
it is, ſo much the leſſe need
hath it of ſupply or aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
from another.</p>
               <p>This being ſo, we muſt
ſeek out a <hi>Nature</hi> which is
indued with <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and
yet needeth ſuch things as
are aforementioned; and
what other <hi>nature</hi> can be
found of that ſort, if MAN
be paſſed over? Surely
none: And if no other can
be diſcovered, it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
by good reaſon that
both <hi>things void of life,</hi>
and <hi>unreaſonable-creatures,</hi>
were made for the ſake
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:13463:51"/>
of MAN; and if they were
ordained for him (as it is
evident they were) then,
that was likewiſe the
cauſe why he was conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
the <hi>Governor</hi> alſo of
thoſe <hi>creatures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, it is the duty of a
<hi>Governour,</hi> to uſe thoſe
things which are put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his government, in
ſuch manner and meaſure
as need and conveniencie
ſhall require; and not to
abuſe them untemperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
or to ſerve voluptuouſly
his owne delicate Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite.
Neither ought he to
bear himſelf tyrannouſly
or ungently towards thoſe
whom he governes. For,
they that ſo doe (yea and
they that uſe not merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:13463:52"/>
their <hi>unreaſonable-cattell)</hi>
are therein great
Offenders; neither per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
the part of a <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour,</hi>
nor of a juſt man,
according to that which
is written, <hi>The juſt man
hath compaſsion upon the

taken from the

(for the moſt part) very
ſerviceable to MAN. III.
And laſtly, it is proved by

which ſeeme to be rather
harmfull then profitable
to Mankind.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BUt ſome perhaps will
ſay, that nothing was
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:13463:53"/>
made inreſpect of another
but every thing in reſpect
of it <hi>ſelfe.</hi> Therefore, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing
firſt between
things <hi>inanimate</hi> and thoſe
that <hi>have life,</hi> let us ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
whether things <hi>void
of life</hi> are likely to have
beene created onely for
their <hi>owne ſake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For if thoſe things were
made in reſpect of <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi>
how, or upon what
ſhould <hi>living-creatures</hi>
feed? wee ſee that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
out of the earth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth
food both of
fruits, and of plants, to
every <hi>living-creature,</hi> ſome
few excepted, whoſe fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
is upon fleſh; yea,
and thoſe creatures which
are nouriſhed by eating
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:13463:53"/>
fleſh, doe feed on ſuch
beaſts as are ſuſtained by
eating the fruits of the
earth: For, Lions and
Wolves, feed on Lambes,
Goats, Harts, and Swine.
Aegles alſo, and all ſorts of
Hawkes, devoure Partrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
Doves, Hares, and
ſuch like; which are fed
with what ſpringeth out
of the ground.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the nature
of thoſe <hi>Fiſhes</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voure
one another, doth
not ſo extend it ſelf to all
fiſhes, that they do gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
devoure the fleſh of
one another; but it brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
off in ſuch as eate
weeds and ſuch other
things as grow in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
For, if all ſorts of fiſhes
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:13463:54"/>
had been inclined to eate
the fleſh of one another,
ſo that no kindes of them
could feed on any thing
elſe, but on the fleſh of
themſelves, verily they
could not have long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
(no not for a ſmall
time) but would have
beene utterly deſtroyed,
ſome of them each by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and the reſt for lacke
of meat.</p>
               <p>To the intent then, that
it might not ſo happen,
certaine <hi>Fiſhes</hi> were ſo
made, that they might ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine
from the fleſh of
the reſt, and feed (if I may
ſo tearme it) on the <hi>graſſe
of the Sea,</hi> that, by them,
the other ſorts of fiſhes
might be preſerved. Theſe
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:13463:54"/>
fiſhes feed upon weedes;
other fiſhes feed upon
them; Thoſe, againe, are
food for other greater fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes.
So, by the feeding
on ſuch fiſhes as laſt of all
doe eate the <hi>weeds of the
Sea,</hi> (which come of the

all ſuch like things, were
made in reſpect of

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> It reſteth not to con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſider
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:13463:56"/>
whether the nature
of <hi>unreaſonable creatures,</hi>
was made in reſpect of it
ſelfe, or for MAN's cauſe:
and ſure, it cannot but be
very abſurd, to affirme
that <hi>things incapable of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,</hi>
and living on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by an inſtinct of <hi>Nature</hi>
(yea, things groveling to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the earth, and by
their very ſhape declaring
their bondage) ſhould be
brought into the world
for their owne ſake. Much
might be ſpoken to prove
the contrary, even ſo
much as would ſpin out
this one point to the

briefly mention in this

               <p>By ſeriouſly conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
(as it were in a glaſſe

which are <hi>without us</hi> by
ſuch things as are <hi>within
us,</hi> we ſhould make a plain
demonſtration hereof;
yea, and by conſidering
the very <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of the
things themſelves, which
are in queſtion. For, if
wee ponder in our minde
that part of <hi>our ſelves,</hi>
which is <hi>irrationall,</hi> and
the parts thereof (I mean
<hi>appetite</hi> and <hi>anger,</hi> which
are ordained to ſerve the
<hi>Reaſonable-part)</hi> wee ſhall
there ſee, that <hi>Reaſon</hi> ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth,
and that the <hi>unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable-parts,</hi>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:13463:57"/>
are ruled; that

and ſerviceable
to ſuch uſes, as <hi>Reaſon</hi> will
have them to bee ſubject
unto; if MAN preſerve
that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition which doth
naturally appertaine unto
him.</p>
               <p>Now then, if our <hi>part</hi>
which is <hi>reaſonable</hi> doth
beare rule over our <hi>unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable-parts,</hi>
which are
<hi>within us;</hi> ſeemeth it not
much more probable, that
our <hi>reaſonable-part</hi> ſhould
have dominion over ſuch
<hi>unreaſonable-things</hi> as are
<hi>without us?</hi> and that ſuch
things were ordained to
ſerve our neceſſities? e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
ſeeing it is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:13463:58"/>
to the law of Nature
that the <hi>unreaſonable</hi> ſhold

<hi>in our ſelves?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This may bee further
manifeſted, by conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that divers creatures
are made even fit for the
neceſſary ſervices of
MAN. For, Oxen and all
bearing cattell are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
fitted for the tillage
of the earth, and for bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of burthens. Sundry
other beaſts of the field
alſo, and many fiſhes and

doe not alwayes ſerve to
ſuch pleaſing uſes, but
that there are ſome which
may ſeeme rather to harm
and deſtroy <hi>man;</hi> it is to
be conſidered that when
thoſe things were created,
the ſpeciall end of whoſe
creation was at firſt for
<hi>man's</hi> ſervice; all other
things which might be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
uſefull were then
created alſo, that in the

no defect, or want of ſuch
things whereof there
might bee afterward any

               <p>Neither were ſuch

Some of them affirm that

               <p>
                  <hi>Thales,</hi> who was the firſt
of that opinion, held that
the SOUL <hi>was alwaies in
motion, and had that motion
from it ſelfe. Pythagoras</hi>
thought that it was a

Plato</hi> affirmed that it was
a <hi>ſubſtance (to be conceived
in mind) that received mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from it ſelf,</hi> according
to NUMBER and HAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MONY.
<hi>Ariſtotle</hi> taught
that it was <hi>the firſt continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all-motion

then gathered into it ſelf

were the <hi>Manichees</hi> and

it ſhall be ſufficient to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

and by <hi>Amonius</hi> the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:13463:67"/>
of <hi>Plotinus,</hi> who thus
affirme:</p>
               <p>All <hi>Bodies,</hi> being by

and ſuch as may be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
diſperſed and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

parts (and having nothing
remaining in them which

ſomething to cloſe them

to knit them into
<hi>one;</hi> and (as it were) to hold
them faſt united: And,
this we ſay is done by the

               <p>Now if the SOUL be

though it be a body con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
of the moſt thin
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:13463:68"/>
and ſubtile parts, what
will you ſay holds that to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
as that knitteth
the <hi>Bodie</hi> in <hi>One?</hi> For, as
we declared before, every

the parts of it together;
<hi>yea the Bodie of this</hi> SOUL,
<hi>that knits together our viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
BODIE, <hi>(if we ſhould
grant the ſame to be a corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reall</hi>
SOUL) <hi>and the next to
that alſo, infinitely, it would
ſtill have need of ſome other

found out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If they anſwer, as the
<hi>Stoicks</hi> doe, that, there is a
certaine <hi>motion</hi> pertaining
unto <hi>Bodies,</hi> extending
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:13463:68"/>
both to the <hi>inward</hi> and
<hi>outward</hi> parts of the <hi>Body:</hi>
That the <hi>motion</hi> tending
<hi>outward,</hi> effects the <hi>quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
and the <hi>qualities</hi> of the
<hi>Body;</hi> and, that the <hi>motion</hi>
tending <hi>inward,</hi> is cauſe
both of <hi>uniting</hi> the <hi>body</hi>
and of the <hi>eſſence</hi> thereof;
wee will then aſke them
(ſeeing every <hi>motion</hi> doth
proceed from ſome <hi>power)</hi>
what kinde of <hi>power</hi> it is,
which that <hi>motion</hi> hath?
in what conſiſteth it? and
what gives <hi>eſſence</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto?</p>
               <p>If this <hi>power</hi> bee a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<hi>matter</hi> (which the
Greekes call Hylen) wee
will uſe the ſame reaſons
againſt them, which wee
objected before. If they
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:13463:69"/>
ſay it is not <hi>matter,</hi> but a
<hi>materiall thing,</hi> (for <hi>matter</hi>
and <hi>materiall things</hi> thus
differ; <hi>That which hath
matter in it, is called a mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
thing)</hi> wee then aſke
them, whether that which
hath <hi>matter</hi> in it, be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<hi>matter,</hi> or <hi>void of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?</hi>
If they ſay it is <hi>matter,</hi>
we demand how it can be
both <hi>materiall</hi> and <hi>matter?</hi>
If they anſwer, that it is
<hi>not matter,</hi> then they muſt
grant it to be <hi>void of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
and if it be <hi>void of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
wee will eaſily prove
it to be no <hi>Body;</hi> becauſe,
every <hi>body</hi> hath <hi>matter</hi> in
it.</p>
               <p>If they alleage that <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi>
have the three <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions</hi>
in them, and that
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:13463:69"/>
the SOUL extending it
ſelfe through the whole
<hi>Body,</hi> hath in it alſo the
three <hi>Dimenſions,</hi> and
therefore muſt neceſſarily
be a <hi>Body;</hi> wee will then
thus anſwer them; <hi>It is
true, that all BODIE'S
have in them the three Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions,
but every thing ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the three Dimenſions
is not a BODY.</hi> For <hi>place,</hi>
and <hi>Quality</hi> which in

if they bee in ſuch

               </p>
               <p>In like maner the SOUL
in reſpect of it ſelfe, is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
void of the <hi>Dimenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi>
but, accidentally it
hath <hi>Dimenſions;</hi> becauſe

                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:13463:71"/>
having in it the three <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions,</hi>
wee ſo conceive
it, together with the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi>
as though the Soule
alſo had in it the three
<hi>Dimenſions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We argue further, and
ſay thus: Every <hi>Body</hi> hath
his <hi>motion</hi> either from
<hi>without</hi> it ſelfe, or from
<hi>within.</hi> If the <hi>motion</hi> bee
from <hi>without</hi> it ſelfe, it
muſt then be <hi>void of life:</hi>
if it be from <hi>within it ſelfe,</hi>
it muſt be <hi>indued with life:</hi>
now, it is abſurd to ſay
that the SOUL is either
<hi>indued with life,</hi> or <hi>without
life</hi> (one of which muſt
neceſſarily be affirmed, if
the <hi>Soule</hi> bee a <hi>corporeall
ſubſtance)</hi> therefore the
ſoule cannot be a <hi>corpore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Eſſence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:13463:71"/>
Againe, the SOUL, if it
be nouriſhed, it is nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
by that which is <hi>void
of Body</hi> (for, <hi>knowledge</hi> is
the nouriſhment thereof)
but, no <hi>corporeal eſſence</hi> is
noriſhed by things <hi>bodileſs,</hi>
therefore, the SOUL can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be a <hi>Body. Xenocrates</hi>
thus concluded this <hi>argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi>
If <hi>(ſaid hee)</hi> the
SOUL be not nouriſhed, it
cannot be a <hi>corporeal-ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance;</hi>
becauſe, the <hi>Body</hi> of
every <hi>living-creature</hi> muſt
be nouriſhed.</p>
               <p>Thus much in generall,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/>
in confutation of all thoſe
who generally affirm, that
the SOUL is a <hi>bodily thing.</hi>
Now, we will treate par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
againſt them
who are of opinion that
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:13463:72"/>
the SOUL is either <hi>Blood,</hi>
or <hi>Breath;</hi> becauſe, when
either <hi>Blood</hi> or <hi>Breath</hi> is
taken away, the <hi>living-creature</hi>
dyeth.</p>
               <p>Wee will not ſay (as
ſome well accounted of
have written) that, part
of the SOUL falleth away
when any part of the
blood faileth, if the SOUL
be the <hi>Blood:</hi> for, that
were but a ſlender anſwer.
In thoſe things which
have <hi>every part</hi> of like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
with the <hi>whole,</hi> the
<hi>part remaining</hi> is the ſame
with the <hi>whole:</hi> Whether
the <hi>water</hi> bee much or lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
it is every way perfect
<hi>water.</hi> In like maner, gold,
ſilver, and every other
thing, whoſe parts do not
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:13463:72"/>
eſſentially differ from each
other, are ſtill the ſame, as
is afore ſaid: And even ſo,
that part of <hi>blood</hi> which
remaineth (of what quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
ſoever) may be called
the SOUL (aſwell as the
whole quantity) if the
<hi>blood</hi> be the SOUL.</p>
               <p>We, therfore, will rather
anſwer them thus: If that
be rightly accounted the
SOUL, upon whoſe taking
away, the <hi>death</hi> of the <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
creature</hi> enſues; then,
ſhould it needs bee, that
<hi>flegme,</hi> and the two <hi>chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi>
muſt be alſo the SOUL,
ſeeing, if any one of theſe
faileth, it brings the <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving-creature</hi>
to his death.
The like falleth out in the
<hi>Liver,</hi> in the <hi>Braine,</hi> in the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:13463:73"/>
                  <hi>Heart,</hi> in the <hi>Stomach,</hi> the
<hi>Reines,</hi> the <hi>Entrails,</hi> and in
many other parts, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
if you bereave a <hi>living-creature,</hi>
it will immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
periſh.</p>
               <p>Moreover, there are
many things <hi>without blood,</hi>
which have life in them,
nevertheleſſe; as ſome
ſmooth and griſtly fiſhes;
ſome alſo of a ſofter kind,
to wit, Sepiae, Teuthides,
and Smyli (as the Greekes
call them) and Lobſters,
Crabs, Oyſters, and all
ſhel-fiſh, whether they
have hard or ſoft ſhells.
Now if theſe things have
a <hi>living-Soule</hi> in them (as
we know they have) and
yet are void of <hi>blood,</hi> then
it plainely followes that
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:13463:73"/>
blood cannot bee the
SOUL.</p>
               <p>Againſt thoſe who ſay
that <hi>water</hi> is the <hi>Soule,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things may bee ſaid to
diſprove their opinion,
though <hi>water</hi> helps to
quicken and nouriſh all
things; and though it bee
(as they ſay) impoſſible to
live without <hi>water.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wee cannot live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>nouriſhment,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if their aſſertion bee
true, wee may aſwell af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
that all <hi>nouriſhment
in generall,</hi> and every <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
nouriſhment</hi> is the
SOUL. And whereas they
have ſaid that no <hi>living-creature</hi>
can live without
water, wee finde the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to bee probable; for
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:13463:74"/>
it is written of ſome Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles,
and of Partridges,
that they live without
<hi>drinke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And why ſhould <hi>water</hi>
be the SOUL rather then
<hi>ayre?</hi> Seeing it is poſſible
to abſtaine from <hi>water</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
long, whereas wee can
hardly live a moment
without breathing the
<hi>Aire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet, neither is
<hi>Aire</hi> the SOUL: For, there
are many creatures which
live without breathing
the <hi>Aire;</hi> as all <hi>Inſectae</hi> (ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veted
creatures) ſuch as
<hi>Bees, Waſps,</hi> and <hi>Ants;</hi> as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
all bloodleſſe creatures,
all thoſe which live in the
<hi>waters,</hi> and ſuch as have
no <hi>Lungs.</hi> For, none of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:13463:74"/>
thoſe things that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>Lungs</hi> can breath <hi>Aire.</hi>
The <hi>propoſition</hi> is true al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
if it be converted, <hi>There
is no creature having Lungs,
which doth not breath aire.</hi>

(to prove the</hi> SOUL <hi>a corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reall.
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:13463:75"/>
ſubſtance)</hi> wee will
here deliver ſomewhat in
anſwer of them; and it
ſhall be the ſame which
the <hi>Platoniſts</hi> have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
replyed heretofore.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cleanthes</hi> compoſeth a
ſyllogiſme in this manner;</p>
               <p>There is (ſaith hee) a
<hi>likeneſſe</hi> betweene us and
our parents, not in reſpect
of the <hi>Body</hi> onely, but in
regard alſo, of the SOVL,
as in <hi>Paſsions, Manners,</hi> and
<hi>Affections:</hi> now it pertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
to a <hi>body</hi> to have in it
<hi>likeneſſe</hi> and <hi>unlikeneſſe;</hi>
and <hi>likeneſſe</hi> and <hi>unlikeneſſe</hi>
cannot belong to things
void of Bodie; Therefore
the <hi>Soul</hi> is a <hi>bodily-thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is here to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
firſt, that he proveth
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:13463:76"/>
things <hi>univerſall</hi> by things
<hi>particular (which is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable
by the Rules of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick.)</hi>
Next, whereas he
ſaith that <hi>likeneſſe</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likeneſſe</hi>
cannot pertaine
to any thing <hi>void of bodie,</hi>
it is falſe. For wee know
that <hi>Numbers,</hi> which have
their <hi>ſide-numbers</hi> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
in proportion, are
like one to another, as the
<hi>ſide-numbers</hi> to <hi>ſixe</hi> and to
<hi>foure and twentie.</hi> The <hi>ſide-numbers</hi>
to <hi>ſixe</hi> are <hi>two,</hi> and
<hi>three:</hi> The <hi>ſide numbers</hi> to
<hi>foure</hi> and <hi>twenty</hi> are <hi>foure,</hi>
and <hi>ſixe.</hi> Now, there is like
proportion of <hi>two</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of <hi>four;</hi> and of <hi>three</hi>
in reſpect of <hi>ſixe:</hi> For they
have a <hi>double proportion,</hi>
each in reſpect of other;
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:13463:76"/>
                  <hi>foure</hi> being twice as much
as <hi>two,</hi> and <hi>ſixe</hi> twice as
much as <hi>three.</hi> Thus it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
that <hi>Nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers</hi> are like
unto <hi>Nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers,</hi> &amp; yet Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
are no <hi>bodily thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Likewiſe, <hi>Figures</hi> (in
<hi>Geometrie)</hi> are like unto
<hi>Figures,</hi> ſo many of them
as have both their <hi>corners</hi>
equall, &amp; their <hi>ſides</hi> which
incloſe their <hi>equall-corners,</hi>
anſwering one another in
<hi>proportion:</hi> and even the
<hi>Platoniſts</hi> themſelves will
confeſſe, that ſuch <hi>Figures</hi>
are no <hi>Bodily-things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, as it is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety
in the predicament
of <hi>Quantity,</hi> that a thing
ſhould be <hi>equall,</hi> or <hi>une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall;</hi>
So, alſo, it is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety
in the predicament
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:13463:77"/>
of <hi>Quality,</hi> that things
ſhould be <hi>like,</hi> or <hi>unlike.</hi>
Now the predicament of
<hi>Quality</hi> is an <hi>Incorporeall</hi>
thing; Therefore, a thing
<hi>incorporeall</hi> may be like
unto another thing, that is
<hi>incorporeall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cleanthes,</hi> thus frameth
another Argument: No
<hi>Incorporeall</hi> thing (ſaith
he) can ſuffer together
with a thing <hi>corporeall;</hi>
neither can a <hi>bodily-thing,</hi>
ſuffer with ſuch a thing as
hath <hi>no body;</hi> but, things
<hi>corporeall,</hi> only, may ſuffer
one with another. Now it
is evident, that if the <hi>body</hi>
be diſeaſed, and wounded,
the SOVL ſuffereth grief
with it; The <hi>Bodie</hi> ſuffereth
alſo with the SOVL; for,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:13463:77"/>
when the <hi>mind</hi> is afflicted
by <hi>ſhame,</hi> the <hi>Bodie</hi> bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
and when the <hi>minde
feareth,</hi> the <hi>body</hi> looketh
pale. Therefore the SOVL
is a <hi>corporeall thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One of his <hi>Aſſumptions</hi>
is falſe; and he taketh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
himſelf that which no
man granteth. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
he ſaith, that no <hi>Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal
thing</hi> can ſuffer with
a thing having a <hi>bodie;</hi>
what if this be true onely
in the SOVL? This is as if
we ſhould argue thus; <hi>No
living-creature moves the
upper jaw; But a Crocodile
moves the upper jaw; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi>
a Crocodile <hi>is no li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving-creature.</hi>
The <hi>major</hi>
of this <hi>propoſition</hi> is falſe;
becauſe, in ſaying, <hi>No li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving-creature</hi>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:13463:78"/>
moves the
<hi>upper-jaw,</hi> hee taketh as
granted that which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied:
for, behold the <hi>Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codile</hi>
both moveth his
<hi>upper-jaw,</hi> and is alſo a
<hi>living-creature.</hi> The like
arguing uſeth he, who
ſaith, that Nothing, <hi>void
of body,</hi> ſuffereth together
with a <hi>bodily-thing;</hi> for, he
taketh unto himſelf, in his
<hi>negation,</hi> that which lieth
in queſtion.</p>
               <p>But, if we ſhould grant
(for argument ſake) that
no <hi>Incorporeall-thing,</hi> doth
ſuffer together with a
<hi>thing-corporeall;</hi> yet, that
which is inferred there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
is not fully confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
(to wit) that the <hi>Soul</hi>
ſuffereth with the <hi>Body,</hi> if
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:13463:78"/>
it be ſick, or wounded:
For, it is yet in controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
whether it be the <hi>Body</hi>
onely that ſuffereth pain;
which having taken ſenſe
from the <hi>Soul,</hi> leaves the
ſame inſenſible of ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings;
or whether the <hi>Soul</hi>
be grieved together with
the <hi>Bodie.</hi> The former o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
hath hitherto been
moſt generally received
among <hi>learned men;</hi> and
therefore, <hi>Cleanthes</hi> ought
not to have made his <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions</hi>
of things in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion;
but, of ſuch onely as
are quite out of doubt: for
in doing otherwiſe he in
vaine laboureth to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate
that, for which
he contendeth.</p>
               <p>And yet (to make the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:13463:79"/>
faſhood of his <hi>Aſſumption</hi>
more evident) it might be
proved, that ſome things
<hi>void of body,</hi> doe ſuffer to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with ſuch things
as <hi>have body:</hi> For, <hi>Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
being <hi>things-incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reall,</hi>
doe ſuffer with <hi>corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reall-things</hi>
when they are
altered: yea, both in the
<hi>corruption</hi> of the <hi>body,</hi> and
in the <hi>Generation</hi> of the
ſame, the <hi>Quality</hi> thereof
ſuffers change and altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
therewith.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
                  <hi>Chryſippus</hi> thus argueth.
<hi>Death</hi> is a ſeparation of
the <hi>Soul</hi> from the <hi>Bodie:</hi>
Now, nothing <hi>void of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi>
is ſeparated from a <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;</hi>
becauſe, a thing <hi>incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreall</hi>

touched by the <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:</hi>
and is alſo ſeparated
from the ſame: Therefore
the <hi>Soul</hi> is a <hi>corporeall-eſſence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Among theſe <hi>propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
this is true, that <hi>death</hi>
is a ſeparation of the <hi>ſoul</hi>
from the <hi>body:</hi> But, this,
that <hi>a thing void of body</hi>
cannot touch a <hi>body,</hi> is
falſe, if it be generally ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken;
and true, if it be affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of the <hi>ſoul.</hi> It is falſe;
becauſe, a <hi>Line</hi> which is an
<hi>incorporeall-thing</hi> doth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
touch a <hi>corporeall-eſſence,</hi>
and is alſo ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from the ſame; as alſo
<hi>whiteneſſe.</hi> Yet, in the <hi>Soul</hi>
it is true; by reaſon the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:13463:80"/>
                  <hi>Soul</hi> doth not (ſo) touch
the <hi>Bodie.</hi> For, if the <hi>Soul</hi>
ſhould (ſo) touch the <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi>
it muſt needs follow
that it muſt be laid (as it
were) along by it. And if
that be ſo, then it lieth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
by the whole <hi>bodie</hi>
(that is, by every part of
the ſame) which is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.
For, how can a <hi>whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body,</hi>
lie along by every
part of another <hi>body?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Or, if it ſhould be that
the <hi>Soul</hi> ſo touched the
<hi>Bodie;</hi> then, the whole
<hi>Creature</hi> ſhould not have
life: For, if it (ſo) touched
the ſame, it would indeed
conſequently follow, that
the <hi>Soul</hi> were a <hi>corporeall-eſſence;</hi>
but, then, the <hi>thing
made alive,</hi> ſhould not
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:13463:80"/>
have <hi>life</hi> in it, throughout
every part of the ſame.
And, contrariwiſe, if the
whole <hi>living-creature</hi> hath
life in it, then the <hi>Soul</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
touches the <hi>Bodie,</hi>
neither is it a <hi>bodily-thing.</hi>
But, the whole <hi>living-creature</hi>
hath life in it;
therefore, neither doth
the <hi>Soul</hi> touch it; neither
is the <hi>Soul</hi> a <hi>bodily-thing;</hi>
and, being a thing <hi>void of
body;</hi> is, nevertheleſſe, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
from the <hi>bodie,</hi>
(contrary to the propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Chryſippus.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is manifeſt, by what <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/>
hath been hitherto ſaid,
that the <hi>Soul</hi> is no <hi>corpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all-ſubſtance:</hi>
it now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines
that we prove the
ſame to be a <hi>ſubſtance.</hi>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:13463:81"/>
And, becauſe <hi>Dinarchus</hi>
defines the <hi>Soul</hi> to be an
<hi>Harmonie;</hi> And <hi>Simmias,</hi>
contradicting <hi>Socrates,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes
the ſame; compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the <hi>Soul</hi> to an <hi>harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,</hi>
and the <hi>body</hi> to a <hi>Harp;</hi>
we will here ſet downe
the ſame confutations of
them, which we finde in
<hi>Plato's</hi> Dialogue called
<hi>Phaedon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One of them is taken
from what <hi>Plato</hi> had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by things granted:
For, he had demonſtrated
that when we doe <hi>learne,</hi>
we doe but <hi>call to minde</hi>
things that were ingraffed
formerly in us: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
taking this unto him
(as a thing granted) hee
thereupon confirmes his
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:13463:81"/>
Argument in this maner;</p>
               <p>If (ſaith hee) the <hi>lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of things</hi> be nothing
elſe, but the <hi>recalling of
them to minde;</hi> then, our
<hi>ſoule</hi> had a <hi>being,</hi> before it
was in the <hi>forme</hi> of MAN:
Now, if it were a <hi>Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>
it was not before the
<hi>body,</hi> but came after it,
when the <hi>body</hi> was harmo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>niouſly
joyned together.
Such of neceſſity muſt the
<hi>compoſition</hi> bee, as the
things are whereof the
<hi>compoſition</hi> is made: For,
<hi>compoſition</hi> is a certaine
common joyning toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of thoſe things, which
are compounded, having
a <hi>harmony</hi> in the ſame:
and, it cannot bee other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
in reaſon, but that
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:13463:82"/>
the <hi>Harmony</hi> muſt <hi>follow,</hi>
and not precede thoſe
things whereof it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.</p>
               <p>Theſe matters conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
this ſaying, That the
SOUL is an <hi>Harmony,</hi> is
contrary to this other ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
That, the <hi>learning of
things</hi> is the <hi>recordation of
things:</hi> But the opinion
concerning <hi>recordation</hi> (as
is aforeſaid) is true; <hi>even
in their judgement who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
the</hi> SOUL <hi>to bee an</hi>
HARMONIE; therefore
the SOUL is not a <hi>Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>
according to their
owne <hi>Principle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe, the SOUL is a
part repugnant to the <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;</hi>
and is in ſtead of a <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,</hi>
exerciſing a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:13463:82"/>
over the ſame. But
<hi>Harmony</hi> neither exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
any government o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the <hi>Body,</hi> neither is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

therefore, the SOUL
is not an <hi>Harmony.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, one <hi>Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>
may bee more or leſſe
<hi>Harmony</hi> then another, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as it is ſlackned or

as if we ſpoke of the

ſeeing it is impoſſible
there ſhould be <hi>intenſion</hi>

nature thereof,) but wee
meane <hi>Harmony</hi> as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth
in joyning toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the <hi>notes:</hi> For, if

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:13463:83"/>
matched together,

a diverſitie in the <hi>Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>
by reaſon of joyning
together of the <hi>notes,</hi>
more or leſſe reached
forth, though they retain
the ſame nature in the
<hi>greatneſſe</hi> of the <hi>ſounds:</hi>
But one SOUL is not more
or leſſe SOUL then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
therefore, the SOUL
cannot be a <hi>Harmony.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Futhermore, the SOUL
in that it receives <hi>contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
ſucceeding one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
is a <hi>ſubſtance</hi> and a
<hi>ſubject:</hi> But, <hi>Harmony</hi> is a
<hi>Quality,</hi> and <hi>in</hi> the <hi>ſubject</hi>
Now the predicament of

the predicament of <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:13463:83"/>
is another; therefore,
the SOUL and <hi>Harmony</hi>
are two diſtinct things. It
is indeed, no abſurdity, to
ſay that the SOUL hath
<hi>Harmony</hi> in it; howſoever,
it followeth not that the
SOUL is therefore an <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony:</hi>
Becauſe, though
the SOUL hath <hi>vertues</hi> in

thereupon inferred that
the SOUL is <hi>vertue.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>I. It is here declared, that the
SOUL is not (as Galen
implicitly affirmeth) a
Temperature in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.
II. It is here proved
alſo, that the SOUL is no
particular temperature
or quality. III. And it
is likewiſe demonſtrated,
that the SOUL is rather
governeſſe of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratures
of the Body,
both ordering them, and
ſubduing the Vices,
which ariſe from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily-tempers.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>GAlen,</hi> hath determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
nothing peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily
of the SOUL; yea,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:13463:84"/>
hee himſelfe affirmeth
plainly, in his writings of
<hi>demonſtration,</hi> that hee
hath delivered nothing
preciſely of the ſame: But,
it may bee collected by
ſome of his expreſſions,
that he could be beſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to affirme that the
SOUL is a <hi>temperature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For, he ſaith, that the
diverſitie of <hi>manners</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
the <hi>temperature</hi> of
the <hi>Body,</hi> and confirmeth
his opinion by certaine
collections out of <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates:</hi>
Wherein, if hee
delivered that which hee
truly thinketh, then,
doubtleſſe, hee beleeveth
alſo, that the SOUL is
<hi>mortall:</hi> not the whole
SOUL, but that onely
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:13463:85"/>
which is <hi>irrationall;</hi> for,
hee maketh a doubt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the <hi>reaſonable ſoul,</hi>
as his words declare.</p>
               <p>Now, that the <hi>tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
of the <hi>Body</hi> cannot be
the SOUL, it may be made
evident by theſe reaſons:
Firſt, every <hi>body,</hi> aſwell
that which hath <hi>life</hi> in it,
as that which is <hi>void of life,</hi>
is made of the <hi>temperature</hi>
of the foure <hi>Elements</hi> (for,
the <hi>temperature</hi> of theſe
<hi>Elements</hi> make all <hi>Bodies)</hi>
And if the SOUL bee the
<hi>temperature</hi> of the <hi>body,</hi>
there can be no <hi>body</hi> with
out <hi>life:</hi> For, if the <hi>Soul</hi> be
the <hi>temperature,</hi> then, every
<hi>body</hi> hath <hi>life</hi> in it, becauſe
every <hi>body</hi> hath his <hi>tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratures.</hi>
And if every <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:13463:85"/>
hath <hi>life</hi> in it, then
there is <hi>no body</hi> void of
life: So, conſequently,
neither ſtone, nor timber,
nor iron, nor any other
thing can be without life.</p>
               <p>But he did not meane,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
perhaps, to affirme in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall,
that every <hi>tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
of the <hi>body</hi> was the
SOUL; but rather, that
ſome ſuch, or ſuch a <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature.</hi>
Wee, then, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
what <hi>temperature</hi> it
is which maketh a <hi>living-creature,</hi>
and ſtandeth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of the SOUL? For,
let him name what <hi>tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature</hi>
ſoever hee can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe,
we will finde him out
the like in things <hi>without
life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are (as hee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:13463:86"/>
hath declared in his
<hi>Booke</hi> intituled OF THE
TEMPERAMENTS)
nine <hi>temperatures;</hi> eight
<hi>diſtempered;</hi> and one in
<hi>good temper;</hi> by which (as
he likewiſe affirmeth) eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man is tempered,
whoſe <hi>temperature</hi> kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth
a meane. But by the
other <hi>diſtemperatures</hi> other
<hi>living-creatures</hi> are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
(every one accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the ſeverall kinde
thereof) with a certaine
<hi>intenſion</hi> and <hi>remiſsion,</hi> to
the more and to the leſſe.
Yea, and all the nine <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratures</hi>
are found alſo
more or leſſe in things
<hi>void of life;</hi> as he himſelfe
hath taught, in his booke
of <hi>ſimple-medicaments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:13463:86"/>
Moreover, if the SOUL
be a <hi>temperature,</hi> then is
the SOUL ſubject to <hi>alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;</hi>
for, the <hi>temperatures</hi>
are altered according to
the diverſitie of <hi>Ages, Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi>
and <hi>Dyets:</hi> And, if
the SOUL be altered, then
wee have not at all times
the ſame SOUL; but, a
<hi>Soule</hi> varied according to
our <hi>temperatures;</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
the <hi>soule</hi> of a Lion,
ſometime of a Sheepe,
and ſometime of other
creatures, which were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdly
affirmed.</p>
               <p>Againe, our <hi>temperature</hi>
doth not oppoſe it ſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
any luſts of our <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi>
but rather helps to
provoke them, or effect
them, for, it is that which
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:13463:87"/>
ſtirreth up the <hi>deſires:</hi>
But, the SOUL bendeth it
ſelfe againſt thoſe <hi>deſires;</hi>
therefore our <hi>temperature</hi>
is not the SOUL.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, the <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature</hi>
is a <hi>quality;</hi> and a
<hi>qualitie</hi> may be in the <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi>
or abſent from it
without the deſtruction of
the ſame <hi>ſubject:</hi> Now, if
our <hi>temperature</hi> bee our
<hi>ſoule,</hi> it will then follow
(by the reaſon afore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned)
that the <hi>ſoule</hi> may
be ſeparated from the <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi>
(which is the <hi>ſubject</hi>
thereof) without the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of the ſame. But,
this is univerſally knowne
to be falſe; therefore, the
SOUL can be neither <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature</hi>
nor <hi>qualitie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:13463:87"/>
None will imagine it
more poſſible to change
that which is of the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of a <hi>living-creature,</hi>
into the contrary thereof,
and yet preſerve the <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving-creature,</hi>
then, in
<hi>fire</hi> to change the nature
of <hi>heat</hi> into <hi>coldneſſe,</hi> and
yet ſtill continue the <hi>fire.</hi>
But it appeareth plainly
that our <hi>temperature</hi> doth
alter into the contrary; (&amp;
that ſuch as <hi>Galen</hi> was are
they, who change our <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratures,</hi>
by their art of
<hi>Phyſick.</hi> Therefore the
<hi>ſoule</hi> (which is the eſſence
of a <hi>living-creature)</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be the <hi>temperature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither is the <hi>Soule</hi> a
<hi>quality</hi> of the <hi>body:</hi> For,
the <hi>qualities</hi> of every <hi>body</hi>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:13463:88"/>
are ſubject to <hi>ſenſe;</hi> But
the <hi>ſoule</hi> is not ſubject to
<hi>ſenſe,</hi> but to <hi>underſtanding</hi>
onely, and therefore it is
not a <hi>Quality.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wee know that this
good <hi>temper</hi> of <hi>blood</hi> and
<hi>ſpirits,</hi> accompanied with
<hi>fleſh</hi> and <hi>ſinewes,</hi> and ſuch
other things, is <hi>ſtrength.</hi>
And, that the good <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature</hi>
of <hi>hot</hi> and <hi>cold, dry</hi>
and <hi>moiſt</hi> things, is <hi>health.</hi>
And that the <hi>meaſurable
proportion</hi> of the <hi>members,</hi>
with a <hi>freſh colour,</hi> is cauſe

               </p>
               <p>But, wee ſee by often

               </p>
               <p>But, there bee ſome,

Now, that which <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth</hi>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:13463:89"/>
is <hi>one thing,</hi> and
that which is <hi>overcome</hi> is
<hi>another thing:</hi> Therefore,
the <hi>temperature</hi> is alſo one

But, firſt, let me make it

meaneth by <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,

               </p>
               <p>He divideth a <hi>ſubſtance</hi>
into three parts: The
firſt is <hi>matter</hi> (which is as
it were the <hi>ſubject)</hi> and
this <hi>matter</hi> is in it ſelfe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but a <hi>generating
power,</hi> out of which ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing may bee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
               <p>The ſecond part of the
<hi>Eſſence,</hi> is <hi>forme,</hi> (or <hi>ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
kinde)</hi> by which the
<hi>matter</hi> is brought unto a
certaine <hi>forme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:13463:92"/>
The third part, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth
both of <hi>matter</hi> and
<hi>forme united</hi> together, and
<hi>endued with life:</hi> The <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
being a thing in <hi>poſsibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
only, and the <hi>forme</hi> an
<hi>actuall thing</hi> conſiderable
two wayes. That is to ſay,
either as you conſider of a
<hi>ſcience,</hi> or of a <hi>contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
according to the <hi>ſcience;</hi>
as a <hi>habit;</hi> or, as <hi>working</hi> by
that <hi>habit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is conſiderable as a
<hi>ſcience;</hi> becauſe, in the
very <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of the <hi>Soule</hi>
there is a kinde (as wee
may call it) both of <hi>ſleepe</hi>
and of <hi>waking.</hi> This <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king</hi>
is analogically anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
unto <hi>contemplation;</hi>
and <hi>ſleepe</hi> repreſents the

               <p>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:13463:92"/>
The <hi>Science,</hi> is, before
<hi>working</hi> according to that
<hi>ſcience;</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> calls
the <hi>forme</hi> it ſelfe <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
that is, the <hi>firſt
continued motion:</hi> The
<hi>working</hi> according to this
<hi>forme,</hi> he names <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
the <hi>ſecond continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
motion.</hi> As for example:</p>
               <p>The <hi>eye</hi> conſiſteth of a
<hi>materiall ſubject,</hi> and of a
certaine <hi>forme.</hi> This <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall
ſubject,</hi> is in the <hi>eye</hi>
it ſelfe; even that which
containeth the <hi>ſight</hi> (I
meane the <hi>matter</hi> of the
<hi>eye)</hi> and this <hi>matter</hi> is equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocally
called the <hi>eye.</hi> But
the <hi>forme</hi> and <hi>continuall
motion</hi> of the <hi>eye</hi> is the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration
wherby it ſeeth:
A whelp before he can ſee
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:13463:93"/>
though he hath neither
of the <hi>two motions</hi> afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned,
hath yet, an
aptneſſe to receive ſuch a
<hi>motion:</hi> Even in ſuch ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
we muſt conceive of
it in the SOUL. When
<hi>ſight</hi> commeth to the
welp it perfects the <hi>eye;</hi>
and when the SOUL
commeth unto the <hi>Body,</hi>
it perfects the <hi>living-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So then, in <hi>a perfect li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving-creature,</hi>
neither can
the SOUL bee at any time
without the <hi>Bodie,</hi> neither
the <hi>Body</hi> without the <hi>Soul:</hi>
For, the SOUL is not the
<hi>Body</hi> it ſelfe; but, it is the
SOUL of the <hi>BODY:</hi> and
therefore, it is in the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi>
yea, and <hi>in ſuch a kinde
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:13463:93"/>
of body:</hi> for, it hath not an
exiſtence by it ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> firſt calls the
<hi>poſsible (inferiour)</hi> part of
the <hi>ſoul,</hi> by the Name of
the <hi>ſoul,</hi> ſevering the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable-part</hi>
from it, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
hee ſhould have taken
the whole <hi>ſoul</hi> of <hi>Man</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and not have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
his judgement of the
<hi>whole,</hi> by a <hi>part,</hi> much leſſe
by the weakeſt part there
of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hath affirmed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
alſo, that the <hi>body</hi> hath an
aptneſſe to live, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>ſoul</hi> commeth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it: For he ſaith, that the
<hi>body</hi> hath in it ſelfe a <hi>poſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi>
to live.</p>
               <p>Now, the <hi>body</hi> which
hath in it ſelf a <hi>poſsibility</hi>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:13463:94"/>
to live, muſt firſt be <hi>actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi>
a <hi>body,</hi> before it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
that <hi>form:</hi> For, ſuch
a <hi>body</hi> is a <hi>matter</hi> void of
all <hi>qualities.</hi> Therefore it
is impoſſible that the
thing which is not actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
it ſelf, ſhould have in it
an aptneſſe whereby ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing may be made
of it.</p>
               <p>If it be a <hi>bodie,</hi> and hath
in it ſelf, no other <hi>being,</hi>
but in <hi>poſsibility</hi> only; how
can that which is a <hi>bodie</hi>
but in poſſibility, have a
poſſibility of <hi>life</hi> in it ſelf?
Though in other things, it
is poſſible, that a man
ſhould have ſomewhat
which he never uſeth; yet
in the <hi>ſoul</hi> it is impoſſible:
For, the <hi>ſoul</hi> doth not
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:13463:94"/>
ceaſe to worke, even in
them that are aſleep; but,
a man, even in ſleeping,
is nouriſhed, &amp; groweth.
and ſeeth viſions, and
breathes, which is the
chiefeſt ſymptome of <hi>life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is hereby very plain
that a Thing cannot have
the poſſibility to live, but,
it muſt needs have <hi>life</hi>
actually in it: For, indeed,
it is nothing elſe but <hi>life</hi>
which doth principally
form the <hi>Soul,</hi> (it is plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
together with the
<hi>Soul)</hi> and it is in the <hi>bodie</hi>
by participation.</p>
               <p>If therefore any man
ſhall affirme, that <hi>Health</hi>
anſwereth proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
to <hi>Life;</hi> we will reply
that in ſaying ſo, he tal
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:13463:95"/>
keth not of the <hi>life</hi> of the
SOUL but of the <hi>body,</hi> and
ſo uſeth a ſophiſticall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning:
For, the <hi>corporeall-ſubſtance</hi>
doth receive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries
one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
but, in the <hi>ſubſtance,</hi>
which is the <hi>forme,</hi> that
cannot be poſſible; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,
if the difference,
which is the <hi>Form,</hi> ſhould
be altered, the <hi>living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
would be altered
alſo.</p>
               <p>It is not therefore, the
<hi>ſubſtantiall forme,</hi> which
receiveth <hi>contraries;</hi> but
the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> which is the
<hi>ſubject;</hi> that is to ſay, the
<hi>bodily-ſubſtance:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
alſo the <hi>Soul</hi> cannot
be, by any means, the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
motion</hi> of the <hi>bodie;</hi>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:13463:95"/>
but muſt be a <hi>ſubſtance</hi> all
perfect within it ſelfe, and
<hi>incorporeall;</hi> for that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth
<hi>contraries</hi> one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
another, (as <hi>vice</hi> and
<hi>vertue)</hi> whereof the very
<hi>Forme,</hi> by it ſelf, is not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/>
ſaith, that the <hi>Soul</hi> being
a <hi>continued-motion,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable
of it ſelf, is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
accidentally; and, that
it is not unlikely wee
ſhould be moved by an
immoveable thing; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we ſee by common
experience, that <hi>beautie</hi>
being a thing unmoveable
doth nevertheleſſe move
us.</p>
               <p>But, though <hi>Beautie,</hi>
which is <hi>unmoveable</hi> in it
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:13463:96"/>
ſelf, may move us, (as hee
ſaith) yet, the <hi>Beautie</hi> ſo
moving us, is a thing by
nature, apt enough to be
<hi>moved,</hi> &amp; not ſuch a thing
as is altogether <hi>unmovea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi>
Therefore, if the <hi>body</hi>
had any ſelfe-motion, it
had not been any abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to ſay it ſhould be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of that which was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable:
But, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
that a thing of it
ſelf <hi>immoveable,</hi> ſhould be
moved of that which is
alſo <hi>immoveable</hi> How then
ſhould the <hi>body</hi> attain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>motion,</hi> except it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it from the <hi>ſoul?</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it cannot have any
motion from it ſelf?</p>
               <p>It appeares, therefore,
that when <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> went
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:13463:96"/>
about to declare the firſt
breeding of <hi>Motion,</hi> hee
ſhewed us not the firſt,
but the ſecond. For, if he
had moved that which of
it ſelf is not moved, he
had then made the <hi>firſt-motion.</hi>
But, if (otherwiſe)
he move that which is
moved of it ſelf, hee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſeth
how the <hi>ſecond-motion</hi>
commeth.</p>
               <p>From whence then is
the firſt <hi>motion</hi> procured
to the <hi>bodie?</hi> If he ſay the
<hi>Elements</hi> are moved of
themſelvess; in regard
ſome of them are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
light, &amp; ſome heavy;
It is not ſo: For, if <hi>levity</hi>
&amp; <hi>weightineſſe</hi> were kinds
of <hi>motion;</hi> then, <hi>light</hi> and
<hi>heavy things</hi> would never
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:13463:97"/>
leave moving. But, they
ceaſe from moving when
they have attained their
proper place. Therefore,
<hi>lightneſſe</hi> and <hi>heavineſſe</hi>
are not cauſes of the <hi>firſt-motion,</hi>
but <hi>qualities</hi> of the
<hi>Elements.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it were granted (that
<hi>lightneſſe</hi> and <hi>heavineſſe</hi>
were cauſes of the <hi>firſt-motion)</hi>
how can the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities</hi>
of Reaſoning, of
Judging, and of holding
Opinion, be wrought by
<hi>heavineſſe</hi> and <hi>lightneſſe?</hi>
If they be not effects of
theſe; neither are they
effects of the <hi>Elements;</hi>
and if not of the <hi>Elements,</hi>
then alſo not of the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſide, if the <hi>ſoul</hi> be
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:13463:97"/>
moved accidentally, and
the <hi>bodie</hi> of it ſelf; then
ſhould the <hi>bodie</hi> be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of it ſelf, although it
had no <hi>ſoul;</hi> and if that
were poſſible, then it
might be a <hi>living-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
without a <hi>ſoul.</hi> But,
theſe things are abſurd;
and abſurd therefore is the
former opinion.</p>
               <p>Moreover, it is likewiſe
untruely affirmed, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
thing which is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<hi>naturally,</hi> is moved
alſo <hi>violently;</hi> and that
whatſoever is moved <hi>vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently,</hi>
is moved by <hi>nature.</hi>
For, the <hi>World</hi> being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
naturally, is not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
violently. Neither is
it true, that ſuch things as
are <hi>moved naturally,</hi> doe
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:13463:98"/>
                  <hi>reſt naturally</hi> alſo: For, the
<hi>World,</hi> and the <hi>Sunne,</hi> and
the <hi>Moone,</hi> are <hi>naturally
moved,</hi> and yet cannot <hi>reſt
naturally:</hi> In like manner
being naturally inclined
to a <hi>perpetuall motion,</hi> they
cannot reſt naturally: For

<hi>even</hi> or <hi>odd;</hi> but the SOUL
can neither bee termed
<hi>even</hi> nor <hi>odd.</hi> Againe, the
SOUL hath motion of it
ſelfe; but a <hi>number</hi> is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
unmoveable.
Againe, a <hi>number</hi> remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<hi>one</hi> and the <hi>ſame</hi> in

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:13463:100"/>
                  <hi>numbers:</hi> But, the <hi>Soul</hi>
remaining one and the

change his <hi>qualities,</hi> alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
from ignorance to
knowledge, and from vice
to vertue; therefore <hi>(all

the <hi>SOVL</hi> is not a

               </p>
               <p>Theſe were the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
                  <hi>Philoſophers</hi> opinions
concerning the SOUL. But
<hi>Eunomius</hi> defined it to be
a <hi>SVBSTANCE void of
body, and created in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi>
agreeing therein both
with <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi>
For, he took theſe words,
<hi>a ſubſtance void of body,</hi> out
of <hi>Plato;</hi> and theſe, <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the body,</hi> from <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle:</hi>
not conſidering
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:13463:101"/>
(though hee was other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
very quick witted)
that he endeavours to
knit thoſe things into <hi>One</hi>
which can by no meanes
be united together.</p>
               <p>For, every thing that
is engendred both <hi>bodily</hi>
and in <hi>time,</hi> is corruptible
and mortall. To this the
doctrine and judgement
of <hi>Moſes</hi> is agreeable. For,
in deſcribing the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of things ſubject unto
ſenſe, hee did not therein
deliver in expreſſe words,
that the nature of things
intelligible were then
made. But, ſome (though
otherſome are not of their
opinion) inſiſting upon
conjectures, are of that
minde.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:13463:101"/>
Now if any man ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
that the SOUL was
made after the <hi>body;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it was put into the
<hi>body,</hi> after the ſame was
faſhioned, he erreth wide
from the truth. For, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth <hi>Moſes</hi> ſay, that
the SOUL was at the ſame
time created when it was
brought into the <hi>body,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth any reaſon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
thereunto.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eunomius</hi> therefore,
might aſwell have ſaid
that the <hi>Soul</hi> is mortall, as
doth <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and the
<hi>Stoicks,</hi> as affirme it is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred
in the <hi>body.</hi> For,
if he will ſay the <hi>ſoul</hi> is an
<hi>incorporeall Eſſence;</hi> hee
ſhould have refuſed to ſay
that, <hi>it was created in the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:13463:102"/>
body;</hi> leſt hee give men oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to thinke the <hi>ſoule
mortall,</hi> and utterly void
of <hi>Reaſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſide, it ſeemes by
his opinion, that the
<hi>World</hi> is not yet repleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed;
but, is at this preſent
(as it were) no more then
halfe perfected, and ſtands
every day in want of ſome
additions. For, there are
every day added unto it,
at the leaſt five times ten
thouſand <hi>intelligible ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</hi>
And (which is
moſt unreaſonable) hee
ſeemeth to beleeve, that
when the number of <hi>ſoules</hi>
is finiſhed, then the whole
world ſhall bee diſſolved,
and the laſt not come to
light before the day of
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:13463:102"/>
the generall reſurrection.</p>
               <p>What can be more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to <hi>reaſon,</hi> then to
imagine that the <hi>world</hi>
ſhall be deſtroyed, aſſoone
as it is fully furniſhed? It
were like the play-games
of little children ſo to do.
For when they have
made any workes or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſes
upon the ſands, they
uſually tread them out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
as ſoone as they
have done them.</p>
               <p>Now if any ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/>
reply, that the <hi>ſoules</hi>
are now made by <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
and not by <hi>Creation;</hi>
and that there is no new
<hi>ſubſtance</hi> brought into the
world (whenſoever any
<hi>body</hi> is repleniſhed with a
<hi>ſoule)</hi> nor any other <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,</hi>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:13463:103"/>
but the ſame multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed,
by <hi>Providence,</hi>
which was before; doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,
they know not the
difference between <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
and <hi>Providence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For it is the ſpeciall
worke of <hi>Providence</hi> to
preſerve the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of
corruptible <hi>living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi>
by breeding them
one of another. I meane,
here, all ſuch corruptible
<hi>living-creatures</hi> as are
bred by generation, and
excepting thoſe which
are generated by ſome
<hi>rotten-matter;</hi> for, the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
of ſuch, is preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
(by the ſame provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence)
by generating
them of ſome other <hi>putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:13463:103"/>
But the chiefe operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Creation</hi> is, to make
things of <hi>nothing.</hi> If, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
the SOULS bee
made one of another: It
will alſo follow, that they
are corruptible, like thoſe
other creatures, which are
made ſucceſſively one of
another, according to
their kindes. If contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
the SOULS be made
of <hi>nothing;</hi> then their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
commeth by <hi>Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi>
and in ſo affirming, we
deny that place of <hi>Moſes:
God ceaſed from all his
workes.</hi> But both of theſe
opinions are abſurd;
Therefore, the <hi>Soules</hi> are
not now made. For, that
ſaving of the <hi>Scripture; My
Father worketh, &amp;c.</hi> by
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:13463:104"/>
the judgement even of
<hi>Eunomius</hi> himſelfe, is to
be underſtood not of the
workes of <hi>Creation,</hi> but of
<hi>Providence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Apollinarius</hi> held opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
that <hi>Soules</hi> were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred
one of another,
as <hi>Bodies</hi> are; and that the
SOUL proceeds by ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
from the firſt <hi>Man,</hi>
unto all men deſcending
from him, according to
the bodily ſucceſſion;
therein diſſenting both
from thoſe who conceive
them to have beene from
the beginning (as it were)
ſtored up; and from thoſe
alſo who thinke they are
daily created. For, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
to theſe tenets,
they affirme, that by them
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:13463:104"/>
God is ſet on work with
Adulterers when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
children. And they
further ſay that theſe
words of <hi>Moſes, God cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
from all his works, &amp;c.</hi>
ſhould be untrue, if God
continueth to create <hi>Souls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In anſwer hereunto,
we have already ſhewed,
that all things are mortall
which have a ſucceſſive
generation one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
For, therefore onely
they generate and are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated,
that the race of
corruptible things might
be preſerved. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<hi>Apollinarius,</hi> muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
deny the ſucceſſive
generation of <hi>Souls;</hi> or by
holding ſuch a generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
he muſt (conſequently
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:13463:105"/>
at leaſt) neceſſarily affirme
that the <hi>Soul</hi> is mortall.
Whereas hee mentions
children borne in Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery;
let us leave that unto
the <hi>Divine Providence,</hi>
whereof we are ignorant.
But, if we may preſume to
conjecture ought of the

be conceived that God ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well knowing a child ſo

               </argument>
               <p>NOw, it followes that
we examine the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the <hi>Manichees</hi>
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:13463:106"/>
concerning the SOUL. For,
they ſay truely, that the
SOUL is a <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> both
<hi>immortall</hi> and <hi>incorporeall:</hi>
But, they adde alſo, that
there is but one onely <hi>Soul</hi>
for all things; and that it is
parted, and (as it were)
peecemeal diſtributed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all <hi>particular bodies,</hi> as
well to <hi>bodies inanimate,</hi> as
to thoſe which are indued
with life.</p>
               <p>They affirme likewiſe
that ſome <hi>bodies</hi> receive
the ſame in more ample
ſort, and ſome in a leſſe
meaſure. <hi>Things indued
with life</hi> in a larger pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion;
<hi>Things void of
life,</hi> in the leſſe; And, <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
things</hi> in the moſt
abundant manner; and
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:13463:106"/>
that the <hi>particular ſoules,</hi>
are portions of that <hi>ſoul</hi>
which is <hi>univerſall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, if they had affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
the <hi>ſoul</hi> to have been
ſo divided, as that it had
not been divided into
parts, but after ſome ſuch
ſort as one voice is divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to the eares of many
hearers, the error had
been the more tolerable.
But, their opinion is, that
the very <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of the
<hi>ſoul</hi> is divided into parts;
and (which is moſt harſh)
they will have it to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
properly among
the <hi>Elements,</hi> and to be
diſtributed together with
the <hi>Elements,</hi> in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
up of <hi>bodily-things;</hi>
and for the collecting of
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:13463:107"/>
them againe into <hi>one,</hi>
when they are diſſolved,
as water is divided into
certain portions, and then
mingled again all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>They are of opinion,
likewiſe, that (after the
diſſolution of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies)
the pure <hi>ſoules,</hi> being
<hi>light,</hi> doe aſcend unto the
light, and that <hi>ſouls</hi> which
have been defiled by the
<hi>materiall ſubſtance</hi> (in
which they reſided) doe
paſſe into the <hi>Elements,</hi>
and from the <hi>Elements</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
againe into <hi>Plants,</hi>
and <hi>living-creatures.</hi> And
though they do thus man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of the
<hi>ſoul,</hi> by their fancies ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
it in effect both <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreall</hi>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:13463:107"/>
and ſubject to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbations,
they ſay ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe,
that it is <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, in theſe things they
contradict themſelves:
For, firſt, they ſay that the
<hi>ſouls</hi> which have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed,
doe returne back to
the <hi>Elements,</hi> and are min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
and tempered one
with another; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe,
in the paſſing
of <hi>ſoules</hi> from <hi>body</hi> to <hi>body,</hi>
they ſay that puniſhments
are inflicted on them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their offences,
joyning and ſeparating
again the nature of them,
<hi>(as occaſion ſerves.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They hold likewiſe,
that when it is light, <hi>ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes</hi>
are diſperſed; and
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:13463:108"/>
when all is covered with
clouds, that the <hi>ſhadowes</hi>
are gathered together;
which cannot poſſibly
come to paſſe in an <hi>intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible
Nature.</hi> For, if a <hi>Man</hi>
ſhould grant that <hi>ſhadowes</hi>
are diſperſed and gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
againe; we muſt then
count <hi>ſhadowes</hi> among
things ſubject unto <hi>ſenſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
                  <hi>Plato</hi> is of opinion that
there is both one <hi>generall
ſoul,</hi> and many <hi>particular
ſoules.</hi> One <hi>ſoule</hi> for the
whole world altogether,
and other <hi>ſoules</hi> for parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
things: In ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
that the whole world
is indued with a <hi>proper
ſoul</hi> of its owne, even with
that <hi>ſoul</hi> which belongeth
unto the whole <hi>world;</hi> and
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:13463:108"/>
ſo alſo, that particular
things are indued with
their <hi>proper ſoules,</hi> even
with the <hi>ſoul,</hi> which is
peculiar unto every one
of them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ſoul</hi> (ſaith hee)
which pertaineth to the

from the center of the

of the Heavens, (not
as though he conceived
ſuch a ſtretching forth as
is incloſed in <hi>Place,</hi> but
ſuch an extenſion rather
as is conceived in our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.)
And hee
ſaith, that this is the SOUL
which turneth about the
whole <hi>Globe,</hi> and which
holdeth in, and bindeth
together all ſuch things as
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:13463:109"/>
have bodily ſhape. For (as
hath been already decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
all <hi>corporeall ſubſtances</hi>
have need of ſomewhat
to hold them together;
and that is done by the
SOUL, which giveth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
every thing the <hi>forme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For, every thing that
liveth, hath a proper life
of his owne, and every
thing that is corrupted
hath his proper corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
(ſay the <hi>Platoniſts.)</hi> So
long as it is held, and knit
together, they terme it a
<hi>Bodie;</hi> and, when it is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved,
they ſay it is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
or deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>They affirme, alſo, that
all things <hi>live;</hi> but, ſay not
that all things are <hi>living-creatures.</hi>
For, they diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:13463:109"/>
                  <hi>Plants</hi> from things
<hi>inanimate,</hi> for that they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
and are nouriſhed
by a <hi>nouriſhing</hi> and <hi>vegita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive

the <hi>living-creatures,
void of reaſon,</hi> from <hi>plants,</hi>
by <hi>ſenſe;</hi> And the <hi>rationall</hi>
from the <hi>irrationall,</hi> by

               </p>
               <p>Thus, though they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme

the nature of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very

hold alſo to be the <hi>Soul</hi>
which governs the world;

gave unto it certaine
<hi>Lawes,</hi> whereby it ſhould
order this whole <hi>world,</hi>
(which <hi>Lawes</hi> they call

theſe men, ſayes that wee
muſt underſtand, that the
<hi>ſoul</hi> is of the ſame ſort that
the <hi>living-creature</hi> is; and
that there be divers kinds
of SOULS. He hath affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in his booke called
MONOBIBLON; that the
changing of SOULS never
hapneth from <hi>Men</hi> to
<hi>unreaſonable-creatures,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from <hi>unreaſonable-creatures</hi>
to <hi>Men,</hi> but from
<hi>beaſts</hi> to <hi>beaſts;</hi> and from
<hi>Men</hi> to <hi>Men.</hi> And in ſo ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he hath not only well
gueſſed, but in my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
expreſſed the very
truth of <hi>Plato's</hi> opinion:
As by many other of his
Arguments may be ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;

               <p>
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:13463:113"/>
No one of the motions
of reaſon (ſaith he) mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts
it ſelfe in <hi>unreaſonable
creatures:</hi> For, neither
<hi>Arts,</hi> nor <hi>Learning,</hi> nor
<hi>Conſultations,</hi> nor <hi>Vertues,</hi>
nor any other thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to an <hi>intelligible
nature,</hi> can bee found in
them. And, therefore it is
plaine that they have no
part of the <hi>reaſonable-Soul.</hi>
Though in <hi>Infants,</hi> which
are very young, there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
an <hi>unreaſonable-motion;</hi>
yet wee ſay they
have a <hi>Reaſonable-Soule;</hi>
becauſe, when they come
to yeares, they ſhew forth
the workes of <hi>reaſon.</hi> But,
in the <hi>unreaſonable-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
which, at no age, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
any token of <hi>Reaſon,</hi>
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:13463:113"/>
the <hi>Reaſonable-ſoule</hi> would
bee ſuperfluous; becauſe,
the force of <hi>Reaſon</hi> would
bee altogether, and at all
times, uſeleſſe unto him.</p>
               <p>All men have agreed
unanimouſly, that <hi>God</hi>
made no ſuperfluous crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
which being true,
it cannot be that a <hi>Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able-ſoule</hi>
ſhould be ſo ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluouſly
beſtowed, as
to be placed in cattle, and
wilde beaſts, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
exerciſe the ſame; leſt
it might bee objected as a
fault in the <hi>Creator,</hi> to
give an unfit SOUL to
the <hi>Body:</hi> For, it is not
the part of a good <hi>worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
(or of one who

               <p>

Now, if any ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
that there is in <hi>beaſts,</hi>
a certaine hidden <hi>habit of
reaſon,</hi> whereby they are
moved; and that their
ſhape makes them unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of <hi>artificiall workes,</hi>
as the want of a mans fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
depriveth him of
meanes to practiſe many
<hi>Arts,</hi> wherein he is expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced,
it makes nothing
to the matter: For, the
ſame abſurdity ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines;
implying that
God applyeth SOULS un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ſome BODIES, which
are ſo unfit, and ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
that they are hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
throughout all the
ages, of thoſe <hi>creatures,</hi>
from their operations.</p>
               <p>Beſide, they confirme
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:13463:114"/>
their <hi>propoſitions,</hi> by things
unknowne, and ſuch as
are not confeſſed: For,
who allowes this fancy,
that, <hi>beaſts have in them a
motion, according to an hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
habit of Reaſon?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is therefore better to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
hold, that a SOUL conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
for every <hi>Body,</hi> is fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
applyed thereunto:
That beaſts alſo have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more, according to
any <hi>hidden habit of reaſon,</hi>
then doth outwardly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
in their naturall and
ſimple actions; That
every ſort of <hi>unreaſonable-creatures</hi>
is moved likwiſe
according to a proper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
of their owne, to
ſuch uſes, and to ſuch
workes as they were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:13463:115"/>
unto, from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning:
and, that the
ſhapes of their <hi>Bodies</hi> are
likewiſe very fitly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated
for ſuch purpoſes</p>
               <p>Moreover, the CREA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TOR,
becauſe hee would
not leave them utterly
void of help in their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities,
hath placed in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very

<hi>underſtanding</hi> as is <hi>naturall,</hi>
though not <hi>reaſonable.</hi> In

repreſenting <hi>Art,</hi>
and having a ſhadow of

beene ſaid before.</p>
               <p>Now, that the <hi>brute-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/>
have not the uſe of

                  </hi> in doing theſe things
is evident in this, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very

things, and all of them in

Their practices dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
not in multitude, but
in this onely, that ſome

the ſame wiles.</p>
               <p>Every Hare doth uſe
the ſame ſubtleties, every
Foxe is alike crafty, and
every Ape imitates alike.
But, it is not ſo with <hi>Man;</hi>
For, his actions are infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
various, becauſe,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:13463:116"/>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> being a certaine
thing which is free; and
men having alſo many
things in their power,
their workings are not
one and the ſame, as it is
in every kinde of <hi>irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
creature.</hi> For beaſts
have their motion onely
by nature; and ſuch things
as are in a creature natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
are in all of the ſame
kinde. But, the actions
proceeding from <hi>Reaſon,</hi>
are after one ſort in one

the ſame in all men.</p>
               <p>But, if they ſhould ſay

proveth former things, by
ſuch as come after: For,
why ſhould reaſonable

can you ſay they had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
in the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>man</hi>
before they had entred at

               <p>
                  <hi>Galen,</hi> that admirable
Phyſitian ſeemeth to bee
of the former opinion, &amp;
to ſuppoſe that in every
ſeverall kinde of <hi>living-creature</hi>
there is a ſundry
kind of <hi>ſoul:</hi> For, in the

                  <hi>booke</hi> of that <hi>Tract</hi> which

<q>Though there be many

ſome greater, ſome
leſſe, (and ſome that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be divided into any
other kinde) every one
of them is uſefull ſome
way to the SOUL: For,
the <hi>Body,</hi> is the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the <hi>ſoul,</hi> and the
parts of <hi>living-creatures,</hi>
differ much from one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,

                  </q> By this it
may ſufficiently be decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that <hi>Galen</hi> thought a

planted in thoſe creatures
which were of divers

theſe matters.</p>
               <p>Seeing wee have <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/>
now proved (even by
their owne arguments
who have held the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary)
that the SOUL is
neither a <hi>corporeall eſſence,</hi>
nor a <hi>harmony,</hi> nor a <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature,</hi>
nor any other
<hi>quality;</hi> it will neceſſarily
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:13463:118"/>
follow, that it is a <hi>ſubſtance
incorporeall.</hi> All confeſſe
there is a SOUL; and if it
be neither a <hi>Body,</hi> nor an
<hi>accident,</hi> it is manneſt that
it is a <hi>ſubſtance</hi> without a
<hi>body;</hi> and no ſuch thing as
cannot ſtand by it ſelfe
without a ſubject: For
ſuch things may without
the deſtruction of the <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi>
be either in the ſame,
or abſent; but if the SOUL
be ſeparated from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
that body muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
be deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>We may uſe the ſame
reaſons to prove the <hi>Soul
immortall:</hi> For, if it bee
neither a <hi>body,</hi> whoſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is ſubject to diſſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and deſtruction, as is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid;
nor a <hi>quality,</hi> nor
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:13463:118"/>
a <hi>quantity,</hi> nor any thing
ſubject to corruption; then
it muſt needs bee <hi>immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There bee many other
demonſtrations, both in
<hi>Plato,</hi> and others, illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the <hi>immortality</hi> of the
SOUL, but they are full of
obſeurity, and can hardly
be underſtood, or borne
away by thoſe who have
beene trained up in the
ſame ſciences.</p>
               <p>To us the doctrine of
the divine Scriptures are
al-ſufficient, to prove the
SOULS immortality; &amp;
beare a ful credit in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
becauſe they were
inſpired by <hi>God.</hi> But, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
thoſe who embrace
not the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> as wee
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:13463:119"/>
                  <hi>Chriſtians</hi> doe, wee muſt
prove by demonſtration,
that the SOUL is no ſuch
thing, as is ſubject to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.
If it bee no cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible

needs bee incorruptible;

               <p>How then can the BO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DIE

preſerving ſtill his

without corruption and
confuſion?</p>
               <p>It ſeemes to be no way
elſe poſſible, but that the
<hi>Soul</hi> and the <hi>Body</hi> muſt
by their union one with
other, either become al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
one with the other,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:13463:121"/>
or corrupted with each
other, as the <hi>Elements</hi> are;
or elſe, (to avoid thoſe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities)
that they ſhould
not be truly united; but,
be ſo joyned onely as
<hi>Dauncers</hi> are in their
daunce, or lie one by the

<hi>ſumme,</hi> or at beſt be ſo
mixed, as <hi>wine</hi> and <hi>water.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, we have already
declared in my <hi>Treatiſe</hi>
upon the SOUL, that the
<hi>Soul</hi> cannot be laid (as it
were) along by the <hi>Bodie;</hi>
becauſe, if it ſhould be ſo,
that part onely of the <hi>body</hi>
ſhould have <hi>life</hi> in it,
which joyneth neare unto

which the <hi>ſoule</hi> toucheth

               <p>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:13463:121"/>
Moreover, wee cannot
ſay, that two ſundry things
placed one beſide the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
(as two pieces of
timber, two iron wedges,
or ſuch like) are one and
the ſame thing. And as for
ſuch a mixture as is made
of <hi>wine</hi> and <hi>water,</hi> wee
know it corrupts both the
one and the other; for
there doth remaine nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
pure <hi>water,</hi> nor pure
<hi>wine,</hi> after ſuch a mixture.</p>
               <p>Yet this mixture of <hi>wine</hi>
and <hi>water,</hi> is but (as it
were) a laying of them
one beſide another,
though our ſenſes be not
able to apprehend the
ſame, becauſe they are
hindred from perceiving
it, by the thinneſſe of the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:13463:122"/>
parts of thoſe things
which are mixed. For, the
<hi>wine</hi> and <hi>water</hi> may be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
againe the one
from the other, by a <hi>ſponge</hi>
dipped in oyle, or by <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi>
either of which will
ſuck away the pare <hi>water</hi>
from the <hi>wine.</hi> But, indeed,
it is utterly impoſſible to
ſeparate ſenſibly one fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the other, thoſe things
which are exactly united.</p>
               <p>If therefore, the parts of
MAN be neither united,
nor placed one beſide the
other, nor mixed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as aforeſaid; what
reaſon ſhould move us to
ſay, that one <hi>Living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>

parts, a <hi>Soul</hi> and a <hi>bodie?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:13463:122"/>
hereof, which partly
moved <hi>Plato</hi> to imagine
that this <hi>living-creature</hi>
did not conſiſt of <hi>Soule</hi>
and <hi>Body;</hi> but, that he was
a <hi>Soule</hi> having the uſe of
the <hi>Body,</hi> and to whom
the <hi>Body</hi> ſerved as a <hi>gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
But, even in affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
that, he occaſioned
as much doubting; for,
how can the <hi>Soul</hi> bee one
with what is but his <hi>gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
ſeeing a <hi>Coat,</hi> is not
all one with him that
wears it?</p>
               <p>But <hi>Amonius,</hi> who was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
maſter to <hi>Plotinus</hi> thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
this queſtion: even
by affirming that <hi>intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
things</hi> have ſuch a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
as may both bee uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
unto ſuch things as are
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:13463:123"/>
capable of them (and after
the manner of ſuch things
as are corrupted together
in their uniting) and yet
remaine as truly without
confuſion or corruption,
when they bee united, as
thoſe things do, which are
but laid along one by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</p>
               <p>It is true that <hi>Bodily-things</hi>
being perfectly u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited
together, muſt of
neceſſity ſuffer alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
by their union, and be
changed in every one of
thoſe parts which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre
thereunto; becauſe,
they are thereby changed
into other <hi>Bodies,</hi> as are
the <hi>Elements</hi> making <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
bodies;</hi> or as <hi>nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
being changed into
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:13463:123"/>
                  <hi>blood;</hi> or as the <hi>blood</hi> when
it is converted into <hi>Fleſh,</hi>
and other parts of the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But things <hi>intelligible,</hi>
may bee united, and yet
no alteration of the <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi>
thereupon enſue.
For, it is not agreeable to
the nature of <hi>intelligible-things,</hi>
to bee altered in
<hi>ſubſtance;</hi> but, either it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parteth
away, or is
brought to nothing, and
ſo can admit no alteration.</p>
               <p>The SOUL is <hi>immortall</hi>
and therefore cannot bee
corrupted, or brought to
nothing; for, then it could
not be <hi>immortall.</hi> It is alſo
<hi>life it ſelfe;</hi> and therefore
cannot be changed in the
<hi>mixture:</hi> For, if it ſhould
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:13463:124"/>
be changed in the <hi>union,</hi>
it ſhould be altered from
being <hi>life</hi> any more; and
what ſhould the SOUL
profit the <hi>Body</hi> if it gave
not <hi>life</hi> thereunto? All
theſe arguments conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
it muſt be concluded
that the <hi>ſoul</hi> is not altered
by being united unto the
<hi>Body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having thus proved
that the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of <hi>intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible-things</hi>
cannot be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered;
it followes neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
therupon, that as they
are not corrupted by their
<hi>union</hi> with other things;
ſo likewiſe, the things
whereunto they are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
remaine uncorrupted;
and that in the union of
the SOVL and <hi>Body</hi> there
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:13463:124"/>
is neither any <hi>corruption</hi>
or <hi>confuſion</hi> of the one or
of the other.</p>
               <p>That they are never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe
perfectly united,
is manifeſted by this, that
either of them partaketh
of that which chanceth to
the whole <hi>living-creature:</hi>
For, the whole man grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
as <hi>one creature,</hi> if any
cauſe of griefe happen to
the one part or the other,
(to the SOUL or to the
<hi>Body.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And, it is as plaine, that
they remaine united
without <hi>confuſion,</hi> in that
the <hi>ſoule</hi> being ſeparated
(after a ſort) from the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi>
when wee bee aſleepe
(and leaving the <hi>body</hi> ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in maner of a dead
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:13463:125"/>
Corps, and only breathing
into the ſame, as it were,
certaine vapours of <hi>life,</hi>
leaſt it ſhould utterly pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh)
doth worke by it
ſelfe, in dreames, whileſt
the <hi>Body</hi> ſleepeth; fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing
things to come,
and exerciſing it ſelfe
meerely in <hi>things intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The like hapneth when

occupied in <hi>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plation,</hi> &amp;
enters into the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>intellectuall-things.</hi>
For, even then the <hi>ſoule</hi>
endeavours by all poſſible
meanes to bee ſeparated
from the <hi>body,</hi> and to bee
alone by it ſelfe that it
may thereby aſcend to
the knowledge of things.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:13463:125"/>
For, being without <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi>
it ſeparates it ſelf from
the whole <hi>body,</hi> as things
which are therewithall
corrupted; and yet remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
uncorrupted as thoſe
things alſo doe wherein
there is no confuſion:
And keeping it ſelfe <hi>one</hi>
and <hi>alone,</hi> changeth that
wherein it abideth, by the
<hi>life</hi> which is contained in
it ſelfe; and yet is not
changed by the ſame.</p>
               <p>For, as the <hi>Sun,</hi> ſo ſoon
as it appeareth, changes
the <hi>ayre</hi> into <hi>light;</hi> ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
it light ſome, and ſo
diffuſing it ſelfe with the
<hi>ayre,</hi> that it is united with
the ſame, and yet not

<pb n="198" facs="tcp:13463:126"/>
with the <hi>Body,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines
without confuſion

within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe

a certaine <hi>place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> It is not ſo with the
<hi>ſoul.</hi> For, being void of
all <hi>Body,</hi> and not contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

and <hi>whole,</hi> through it own

of it illuminated thereby,
wherein it is not fully and

is it in the <hi>body</hi> as in ſome

compaſſed in by the ſame;
but the <hi>Body</hi> is rather in
the <hi>ſoule,</hi> and is thereby
held in and faſtned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>For, <hi>intelligible things</hi>
(ſuch as the <hi>ſoul</hi> is) are not
hindred by <hi>bodily things;</hi>
but, enter, and pierce, and
paſſe through every <hi>corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reall</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="200" facs="tcp:13463:127"/>
The <hi>ſoul</hi> is otherwhile

it <hi>conceiveth</hi> any thing:
And when it is ſaid to bee

to be there, as in <hi>place;</hi>
but, to be as it were in a

God is ſaid to be in <hi>us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For, wee ſay that the

And indeed, ſeeing it

               <p>Now, if any man ſhall

THat which is laſt afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid,

for, it is here diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,
that they may be

by the teſtimony of ſuch
as are in moſt eſteeme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong

               <p>The opinion of ſome
(eſpecially of the <hi>Eunomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans)</hi>
is this, that GOD the

not in <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> but by the

of the <hi>body</hi> (meaning of

the <hi>inſtruments</hi> thereof)
and therefore, in their
judgement, the <hi>Divine
powers</hi> being tempered
with the <hi>Senſes,</hi> is cauſe of
that <hi>uniting:</hi> But, wee
ſhall never be perſwaded
to grant unto them that
the <hi>Senſes</hi> are certaine

               </p>

               </argument>
               <p>GOe we now on, to
the <hi>Eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts,</hi> which
are conſequently
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:13463:141"/>
to be next handled in this
<hi>Treatiſe.</hi> An <hi>Element</hi> of
the world, is a moſt ſmall
part in the compoſition of
<hi>bodies.</hi> They are theſe
foure; <hi>Earth, water, ayre,</hi>
and <hi>fire,</hi> and if you begin
at the loweſt, and ſo paſſe
to the higheſt <hi>body</hi> of
them, they are placed in
ſuch order, as I have na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>bodies</hi> of theſe <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
are the firſt bodies,
and <hi>ſimple bodies,</hi> in reſpect
of other bodies: And e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<hi>Element</hi> is of the
ſame kinde, with thoſe
things, whoſe <hi>Element</hi> it
is. For, <hi>principles</hi> (as <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
forme,</hi> and <hi>privation)</hi>
are not of the ſame kinde
with the things which are
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:13463:141"/>
made of them: But, an
<hi>Element</hi> is neceſſarily of
the ſame kinde.</p>
               <p>Now, it is manifeſt
that theſe foure, <hi>Earth,
water, ayre,</hi> and <hi>fire</hi> are the
<hi>Elements;</hi> and it is as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that the <hi>(foure firſt)
qualities</hi> (that is to ſay)
<hi>Hot, cold, moiſt,</hi> and <hi>dry,</hi>
bee in thoſe <hi>Elements,</hi> in
the higheſt degree, both
potentially and actually
alſo. And, yet, there is
not one of theſe <hi>Elements,</hi>
which we can diſcerne by
our <hi>ſenſes,</hi> to bee altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
void of temperature,
and mixture with ſome
other <hi>Element:</hi> For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
all thoſe which wee
are ſenſible of, are in a
ſort ſomewhat counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:13463:142"/>
and participate each
of other, more or leſſe;
even when in their mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
their ſeverall na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
continue moſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant.</p>
               <p>Moreover, every one
of theſe <hi>Elements,</hi> hath
two coupled <hi>qualities,</hi>
which conſtitute the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
or nature of it. For,
EARTH is <hi>dry</hi> and <hi>cold;</hi>
WATER is <hi>cold</hi> and <hi>moiſt;</hi>
AIRE is <hi>hot</hi> and <hi>moiſt;</hi> and
FIRE is <hi>hot</hi> and <hi>dry.</hi> Yet,
theſe <hi>qualities,</hi> by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
cannot be <hi>Elements:</hi>
For, <hi>qualities</hi> are void of
<hi>bodie;</hi> and of things <hi>incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreall,</hi>
things <hi>corporeall</hi>
cannot be made.</p>
               <p>Neither is it poſſible,
that other <hi>bodies</hi> ſhould be
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:13463:142"/>
actually <hi>Elements,</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> have
not actually each of theſe
<hi>qualities</hi> in the higheſt

which have theſe <hi>qualities,</hi>
more or leſſe, ſhould bee
<hi>Elements,</hi> there would be
an infinite number of <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</hi>
and we ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
bee able to diſcerne
the <hi>Elements</hi> of each par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular

thing hath ſome <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
in it, more or leſſe.</p>
               <p>It followes therefore
neceſſarily, that every <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
is a BODIE and a
<hi>ſimple-body;</hi> and ſuch a one
as hath actually in it, in
the higheſt degree, theſe
<hi>qualities,</hi> HEAT, COLD,
MOISTURE, and DRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NESSE:
becauſe, of all
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:13463:143"/>
                  <hi>qualities,</hi> theſe onely and
no other doe make a

comming neare unto
a <hi>Body</hi> cannot make it
<hi>white</hi> thorow and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
(as wee ſay) neither
can ſuch a change bee
wrought by any other
thing; whereas <hi>Heat</hi> or
<hi>cold,</hi> can warme or coole a
body, not onely ſuperfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
but quite through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the ſame.</p>
               <p>Thoſe <hi>Elements</hi> are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
<hi>contraries,</hi> which
are directly contrary to
one another, in both their
<hi>qualities.</hi> Thus WATER
is contrary to FIRE: For,
<hi>water</hi> is <hi>cold</hi> and <hi>moiſt;</hi> and
<hi>Fire</hi> is <hi>hot</hi> and <hi>dry.</hi> In like
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:13463:143"/>
maner, EARTH is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to AIRE: For, <hi>Earth</hi>
is <hi>cold</hi> and <hi>dry;</hi> and <hi>Aire</hi> is
<hi>hot</hi> and <hi>moiſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And, foraſmuch as
things which are ſo repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
could not bee fitly
joyned one unto another,
without a <hi>middle-band</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
to knit them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
The wiſe Creator
hath placed <hi>water</hi> as a
<hi>meane</hi> between the <hi>Earth</hi>
and the <hi>Aire</hi> (which are
contraries) induing it
with her two <hi>qualities,
cold</hi> and <hi>moiſt,</hi> that being
the <hi>medium</hi> betweene
thoſe, which extreamely
differ, they might be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
thereby: For, by rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſon
of the <hi>cold,</hi> it agrees
naturally with the <hi>earth;</hi>
                  <pb n="234" facs="tcp:13463:144"/>
and by meanes of <hi>moiſture,</hi>
it is fitly joyned unto the
<hi>aire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe, in the middle
betweene the <hi>water</hi> and
the <hi>fire,</hi> (which are alſo
contraries in themſelves)
hee hath placed the <hi>aire,</hi>
which by his <hi>moiſt-quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie</hi>
doth very well accord
with <hi>water,</hi> and with <hi>fire,</hi>
by the <hi>quality</hi> of <hi>heat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus, God hath linked
every one of them each to
other (as in a chaine) by
placing betweene <hi>things
contrary,</hi> ſuch other things
as may both unite the ſaid
<hi>contraries</hi> to themſelves,
and to ſuch things alſo, as
are bound one to another
by them: Yea, (which is
an excellent kind of band)
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:13463:144"/>
hee hath joyned together
every one of the <hi>Elements,</hi>
by the one of his <hi>qualities</hi>
to that which went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
and by the other to
that which followed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>For example, the <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
being <hi>cold</hi> and <hi>moiſt,</hi> is
joyned unto the <hi>earth</hi>
(which if you beginne at
the loweſt, and aſcend, is
next beneath it) by his
<hi>coldneſſe;</hi> and by his <hi>moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture,</hi>
to the <hi>aire</hi> which is
next above it. The <hi>aire</hi>
likewiſe by the <hi>moiſtnes</hi> of
it, is joyned to the <hi>water,</hi>
which is next beneath it;
and by <hi>heat,</hi> to the <hi>fire</hi>
which is above it. The
<hi>fire</hi> alſo by the <hi>heat</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
is joyned to the aire
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:13463:145"/>
which is beneath it; and
by <hi>dryneſſe</hi> to the <hi>earth;</hi> to
which, being the loweſt, it
declineth it ſelfe <hi>(as it were
in a circular motion.)</hi> The
<hi>earth</hi> by <hi>coldneſſe,</hi> is united
to the <hi>water;</hi> and by <hi>dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi>
to the <hi>fire,</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clineth

                  <hi>Plato</hi> is of opinion that

               </p>
               <p>To the <hi>Earth</hi> he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares
the <hi>figure</hi> called a

The figure <hi>Icoſaedron,</hi>

whoſe <hi>motion</hi> is eaſier

               </p>
               <p>By theſe <hi>figures,</hi> he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devors
to prove demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratively
that the three
other <hi>Elements</hi> are chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
one into another, but
that no change hapneth
to the <hi>Earth:</hi> For, (ſaith
he) three of theſe <hi>figures,</hi>
that is to ſay, the <hi>Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mide,</hi>
the <hi>Octaedron</hi> and the
<hi>Icoſaedron,</hi> are made of <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angles,</hi>

whoſe ſides are
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:13463:151"/>
equall: now things which
are made of <hi>Triangles</hi>
whoſe ſides are unequall,
being diſſolved and mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
together again, may
be changed into another;
but, the <hi>Cubicall-figure</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
diſſolved cannot be
changed into any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
becauſe it is made
of equall-ſided-<hi>Triangles,</hi>
whereof none of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
three can be made.</p>
               <p>In like manner none of
the other <hi>figures</hi> can be
changed into a <hi>Cube.</hi> And,
for theſe reaſons it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
that the <hi>Bodies</hi>
formed of theſe <hi>ſpecies,</hi>
and the <hi>ſpecies</hi> whereof
they are formed, ſhould
in reſpect of one another
be ſuch as they were.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="249" facs="tcp:13463:151"/>
And, yet, the <hi>Earth</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth
not altogether
impaſſible; but, is divided
by <hi>bodies,</hi> having thinner
parts then it ſelfe; being
after a manner altered
from <hi>Element</hi> to <hi>Element,</hi>
and yet not changed into
thoſe things which doe
divide it: For, when it is
recollected againe unto it
ſelfe, it recovereth the
ſtate which it formerly
had, as appeares by it, in
the water.</p>
               <p>For, if you caſt a little
<hi>earth</hi> into the <hi>water,</hi> and
ſtir it often up and down,
that <hi>earth</hi> diſſolves into
<hi>water;</hi> but, if you leave
ſtirring of the ſame, the
<hi>water</hi> ſettles, and the
<hi>earth</hi> ſinks to a reſidence:
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:13463:153"/>
The like is to be thought
of the whole <hi>earth:</hi> and
this is not a changing,
but a diſſevering of ſuch
things as were mingled
together.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plato</hi> affirmes that the
<hi>earth</hi> is alſo ſevered by the
ſharpneſſe of the <hi>fire,</hi> and
being ſo diſſolved is ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
and carryed away
in the <hi>fire:</hi> So likewiſe in
the maſſe of the <hi>Aire,</hi>
when <hi>Aire</hi> diſſolves it;
and, in the <hi>water,</hi> when it
is diſſolved, in the <hi>water.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, <hi>Plato</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth
another diviſion
of the <hi>Elements,</hi> affirming
every one of them to have
three <hi>Qualities.</hi> The <hi>fire</hi>
to have <hi>ſharpneſſe, rareneſſe,</hi>
and <hi>motion;</hi> The <hi>Element</hi>
                  <pb n="251" facs="tcp:13463:153"/>
which is directly in the
extreame thereunto, (that
is to ſay) the <hi>earth,</hi> to have
<hi>dulneſſe, thickneſſe,</hi> and <hi>reſt:</hi>
So, in reſpect of theſe <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,</hi>
the <hi>earth</hi> and the
<hi>fire,</hi> be cleane contrary to
each other; whereas, they
were not ſo, by thoſe two
qualities, whereof we had
formerly ſpoken.</p>
               <p>He holdeth likewiſe,
that, by qualities taken
from the two extreames,
thoſe <hi>Elements</hi> were made
which are in the middle
betweene theſe two: For
(ſaith he) two <hi>qualities</hi>
(to wit) <hi>rareneſſe</hi> and <hi>moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
being taken from the
<hi>fire;</hi> and <hi>one</hi> (that is to ſay)
<hi>dulneſſe,</hi> being aſſumed
from the <hi>Earth, Aire</hi> is
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:13463:152"/>
thereof compoſed, whoſe
effecting <hi>Qualities,</hi> are
<hi>rareneſſe, motion,</hi> and <hi>dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi>
In like manner, two
<hi>Qualities</hi> are taken from
the <hi>earth,</hi> namely, <hi>dulneſſe</hi>
and <hi>thickneſſe;</hi> and one
from the <hi>fire,</hi> (to wit) <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
whereof proceeds
<hi>water,</hi> which getteth alſo
his forme, by <hi>thickneſſe,
dulneſſe,</hi> and <hi>motion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore, the ſame
that <hi>ſharpneſſe</hi> is in reſpect
of <hi>dulneſse,</hi> the ſame is <hi>fire</hi>
in reſpect of <hi>aire:</hi> ſuch as
<hi>rareneſſe</hi> is, in reſpect of

                  <pb n="253" facs="tcp:13463:152"/>
the like is <hi>aire</hi> in reſpect
of <hi>water.</hi> And as <hi>aire</hi> is in

in reſpect of <hi>earth.</hi> For, it

               </p>
               <p>There are, yet other
qualities aſcribed unto

WEIGHTINESSE,

is made fit for the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
thereof.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> in their
opinions concerning
the making of the <hi>heavens</hi>
and the <hi>earth,</hi> differ ſo
much from all others, that
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:13463:156"/>
but few have conceived
thereof as they doe: For
they affirme that they
were created of no fore
exiſting matter; accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to <hi>Moſes,</hi> who ſaid,
<hi>In the beginning,</hi> God <hi>made
the heaven and the earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, <hi>Apollinarius</hi> thinks
that God made the <hi>heaven</hi>
and the <hi>earth,</hi> of the <hi>depth
of waters.</hi> For, <hi>Moſes</hi> in
his deſcription of the
<hi>worlds</hi> creation, doth not
ſo make mention of the
<hi>depth of waters,</hi> as if it had
beene created; but, in <hi>Iob</hi>
theſe words are to bee
found; <hi>He made the depth
of waters.</hi> Therefore, hee
affirmed, that all other
things were made out of
that, as out of a <hi>matter</hi>
                  <pb n="259" facs="tcp:13463:156"/>
common to all.</p>
               <p>Hee doth not ſay that
this <hi>depth of waters,</hi> was
never made; but, that it
was laid downe by the
<hi>Creator,</hi> as a foundation,
before any other <hi>bodily-thing</hi>
was made, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things might bee
made thereof: For, the
very name of <hi>depth,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
the infiniteneſſe of
the <hi>matter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And indeed, whether
it bee this or that way ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
it is not much mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall;
For even by this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
alſo, God is confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the ſole <hi>Creator</hi> of all
things; and that hee made
every thing of <hi>nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, there bee ſome <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
who ſay, that there is but
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:13463:157"/>
one onely <hi>Element;</hi> either
<hi>Fire,</hi> or <hi>Aire,</hi> or <hi>Water,</hi>
                  <q>
                     <hi>(For Thales affirmes that
fire only; Anaximenes that
aire onely; and Heraclitus,
with Hipparchus Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pontinus,</hi>
that <hi>water</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is an <hi>Element)</hi> againſt
whom it ſhall be ſufficient
to alleage what <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>
hath ſaid in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe.</q>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <p>If (ſaith he) MAN
were compoſed but of
one onely thing hee
could never feele any
griefe; For, hee being
but <hi>One thing,</hi> nothing
could procure paine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him; or if hee ſhould
feele any griefe, there
could be but one thing
which might heale him:
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:13463:157"/>
For, that which feeleth
griefe, muſt needs bee
in a mutation with
ſome <hi>ſenſe:</hi> And, if there
bee but one <hi>Element,</hi>
there can then bee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
whereinto the <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving-creature</hi>
ſhould be
<hi>changed:</hi> And if it were
not <hi>altered,</hi> but continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſetled in the ſame
ſtate, it could not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
feele paine, though
it were never ſo ſenſible.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He ſaith further:</hi> It is
neceſſary that the thing
which any body ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
ſhould proceed
from ſome other thing:
but if there bee but one
onely <hi>Element,</hi> there can
be no <hi>quality,</hi> beſide the
<hi>quality</hi> of one <hi>Element,</hi>
                     <pb n="262" facs="tcp:13463:158"/>
whereby the <hi>living-creature</hi>
may be afflicted:
And, if neither can bee
changed nor ſuffer any
thing, how can it bee
grieved?</p>
               </q>
               <p>After hee had thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
the impoſſibility
thereof, he ſuppoſeth, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe,
the ſame to be
granted; and thereupon
thus inferreth. Grant
(ſaith hee) it could ſuffer
griefe, and then it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that there is but one
thing onely which can
cure the ſame; but expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
hath taught us that
there is not one thing on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but many things to
cure every diſeaſe; and
therefore <hi>Man</hi> cannot
be <hi>one onely intire thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="263" facs="tcp:13463:158"/>
It may be further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that there are foure
<hi>Elements,</hi> by the reaſon
wherewith every one of
them endeavoureth to
confirme his owne opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
(who affirme that there
is but one onely <hi>Element.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For when <hi>Thales</hi> affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
that <hi>water</hi> onely was
to bee accounted an <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
hee endeavoured to
ſhew that all the other
three were made of it;
ſaying that the faeces of it
become <hi>earth,</hi> the thin
parts become <hi>aire,</hi> and
that the thinneſt parts of
that <hi>aire</hi> are turned into
<hi>fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anaximenes,</hi> holding o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
that <hi>aire</hi> onely is
an <hi>Element;</hi> goes about to
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:13463:159"/>
prove likewiſe, that all
the reſt of the <hi>Elements</hi>
are made of <hi>aire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Heraclitus</hi> and <hi>Hippar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus
Metapontinus</hi> affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
that there is no <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
but <hi>fire,</hi> uſe likewiſe
the very ſame demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to make their argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſeeme reaſonable.</p>
               <p>Now, it will become
evident by the reaſons
which theſe men give to
juſtifie their aſſertion; that
every one of them is an
<hi>Element:</hi> For by ſome it
is demonſtrated, that all
other <hi>Elements</hi> are made
of the <hi>fire;</hi> by another, that
all the reſt are made of
<hi>water;</hi> and by a third that
they are all of <hi>aire;</hi> which
make it plaine that all the
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:13463:159"/>
                  <hi>Elements</hi> are changed one
into another <hi>(by their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
conſent, who other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
diſagree.)</hi> And if they
can all bee changed one
into another, it will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
follow that they
muſt all be <hi>Elements;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
which of the <hi>foure</hi>

will appeare that even

               <p>The <hi>Body (which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed</hi>

flowing out ſome part of

which is of like nature
with it ſelfe; partly by

back againe from the <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi>

wee could not know the

could not bee able to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect

               </p>
               <p>It remaines therefore
that the <hi>aire,</hi> wherewith

his <hi>eſſence</hi> of the nature of

makes an alteration even

untill it happen upon a

               </p>
               <p>For, the <hi>aire</hi> is ſuch an

               </p>
               <p>Now, that it is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the <hi>aire,</hi> to become

that whenſoever any

that the <hi>ſoul</hi> her ſelfe mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

               <p>For, that thing onely

               <p>Such is the nature of

that wee may ſee

more hardly) it paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
through <hi>earth,</hi> being
of a glaſſie or ſuch like

this is alwayes to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
that theſe things

               <p>But let no man bee ſo

that the <hi>ſight</hi> may of it

becauſe when wee ſee <hi>fire,</hi>
we know that it is <hi>hot;</hi> for
if you refer that ſpeech to
the firſt function of <hi>ſight,</hi>
you ſhall finde that when
the ſight firſt beheld the
<hi>fire,</hi> it perceived nothing
but the <hi>ſhape</hi> and colour
thereof. After that, wee
comming to <hi>touch</hi> it, and
thereby knowing the
ſame to be <hi>hot,</hi> our memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
preſerves in us the
knowledge which wee
firſt gained by the <hi>touch:</hi>
and ever ſince; when wee
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:13463:176"/>
behold <hi>fire</hi> (though wee
ſee nothing in it but the

by the helpe of

which are properly <hi>ſeene.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The like may be ſaid of
an <hi>apple;</hi> For ſeeing the

not onely in the <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour</hi>
and the <hi>ſhape,</hi> but in

is the <hi>ſight</hi> onely, whereby
we know the ſame to bee
an <hi>apple (becauſe we ſaw the

our <hi>memory</hi> had preſerved

as pertained unto her
<hi>ſenſe;</hi> when it perceived
the true <hi>colour</hi> and <hi>ſhape</hi> of
an <hi>apple.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, theſe three <hi>ſenſes,</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/>
                  <hi>ſight, hearing,</hi> and <hi>ſmelling,</hi>
are converſant about
things at a <hi>diſtance,</hi> and
ſuch as are not joyned
cloſe unto them by means
of the <hi>aire</hi> comming be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:13463:177"/>
them. But the <hi>taſt</hi>
cannot poſſibly feele any
thing but that whereunto
it is nearely joyned; and
the <hi>touching</hi> taketh part of
both: for ſometime wee
touch things bodily, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any <hi>intermedium</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
us and them; ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
againe, wee touch
them with a <hi>ſtaffe</hi> betwixt
us, and the things tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the <hi>ſight</hi>
hath now and then, want
of ſome other of the <hi>ſenſes</hi>
to witneſſe unto it the
certainty of that which it
perceiveth, when things
are artificially wrought
to deceive the <hi>ſight;</hi> as it
falleth out in <hi>painting:</hi>
For, it is the <hi>painters</hi> cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:13463:177"/>
to deceive the eye,
with counterfeit ſhadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
either of an <hi>Emboſt</hi>
or <hi>hollow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>worke,</hi> as the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires:
To the diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
whereof, the ſenſe
of <hi>touching</hi> is eſpecially
uſefull, and ſometime of
the <hi>taſt</hi> and <hi>ſmell</hi> alſo; as
appeared in the example
of the apple made of wax.
Yea, and otherwhile (at
no great diſtance) the
<hi>ſight</hi> it ſelfe maketh ſome
things appeare unto us to
bee that which they are
not: For, if a towne
which is <hi>foure-ſquare</hi> bee
but a pretty diſtance from
us, it will ſeeme unto the
<hi>ſight</hi> to be <hi>round.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>ſight</hi> erres like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:13463:178"/>
when wee looke
through a thick aire, or
through ſmoake, or ſome
ſuch things as otherwiſe
trouble the <hi>ſight</hi> by the
thickneſſe thereof. In like
maner, when we ſee things
in the <hi>water,</hi> being ſtirred;
for in the Sea an Oare
ſeemeth broken when it
is whole.</p>
               <p>So is it alſo when wee
looke in or through ſome
<hi>tranſparant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> bodie;</hi> as loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king-glaſſes,
or other
glaſſes and the like things;
or when the <hi>viſible object</hi>
is moved ſwiftly: For, a
<hi>ſwift-motion</hi> ſo diſtempers
the ſight; that thoſe
things are thereby made
appeare to be <hi>round</hi> which
are nothing ſo, and thoſe
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:13463:178"/>
to bee <hi>fixed,</hi> which are
<hi>moved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſame happeneth,
when the <hi>minde</hi> is buſied
about other matters; as
when a man (purpoſing to
meet his friend) paſſeth
by without heeding him
whom hee went to meet,
<hi>(though hee met him in the
way)</hi> by reaſon he had his
minde buſied with other
thoughts: But, indeed
this is not properly an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
of the <hi>ſight,</hi> but of the
<hi>minde:</hi> For, the <hi>ſight</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
his friend, and gave
warning; but the <hi>minde</hi>
heeded not that which
was brought unto it.</p>
               <p>Finally, the <hi>ſight</hi> nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
foure things for the
cleare diſcerning of all
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:13463:179"/>
                  <hi>viſible objects,</hi> namely; <hi>A
whole and ſound ſeat for that

of motion; a fit diſtance;
and the aire to bee pure and

               <p>I. Of the ſenſe of touching;
why the ſeat of it is in all

enjoyes that ſenſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as

which of the ſenſes Man

excell him.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>IT was by the <hi>Creator</hi>
of the world, ſo orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that hee made the

               <pb n="306" facs="tcp:13463:180"/>
two-fold, and confined
them to a certaine circuit
of place in ſome parts of
the <hi>body;</hi> For example,
hee hath made two <hi>eyes,</hi>
two <hi>eares,</hi> two paſſages
for the <hi>ſenſe</hi> ſcituate in
the <hi>noſtrill;</hi> yea, and hee
hath planted in every <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving-creature,</hi>
as it were,
two <hi>tongues.</hi> In ſome they
are evidently parted, (as
in ſerpents) and in ſome
other, they are joyned and
united, as in <hi>men:</hi> And
for this cauſe, hee made
onely two <hi>former-pans</hi> of
the <hi>braine,</hi> that the <hi>ſinewes</hi>
which ſerve for the <hi>ſenſes,</hi>
being ſent downe from
either of theſe <hi>braine-pans</hi>
might make the <hi>ſeats</hi> of
the <hi>ſenſes</hi> to be <hi>twofold.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="307" facs="tcp:13463:180"/>
Now, hee made them
<hi>twofold,</hi> in reſpect of that
exceeding tender love
which hee bare unto us;
that when the one of

which remained
might preſerve the <hi>ſenſe.</hi>
And yet, though moſt of

periſh, the <hi>living-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
may be <hi>alive:</hi> but as

doth inſtantly pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh.</p>
            <p>For onely the ſenſe of

to all <hi>livingcreatures;</hi>
and every <hi>living-creature</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Now, ſeeing the <hi>living-creature</hi>
loſeth life by the

hath allotted unto the

almoſt the whole body of

the <hi>haires,</hi> and certaine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

hapned that the <hi>ſeat</hi> of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very

another in reſpect of the

and yet is partaker both of
<hi>hot</hi> and <hi>cold</hi> things; partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pating
of <hi>heat</hi> and <hi>cold</hi> as
it is a <hi>body,</hi> and diſcerning
of colours, as it is the <hi>ſenſe</hi>
of <hi>ſight.</hi> The like may be
thought alſo of the <hi>taſt,</hi> of
the <hi>ſmelling,</hi> and of the
<hi>hearing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may hereupon bee
queſtioned how the <hi>tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching</hi>
can bee ſpred over
the whole <hi>body,</hi> ſeeing
that the <hi>ſenſes</hi> proceed
from the <hi>former braine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pans:</hi>
               <pb n="310" facs="tcp:13463:182"/>
for indeed the <hi>ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes</hi>
come downe from

into every part of
the <hi>body,</hi> doe there occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the ſenſe of <hi>touching.</hi>
And ſome were of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
(becauſe the haire
ſtands up as it were, with
a ſudden horror, when
the foot is caſually pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
with a thorne) that
the <hi>griefe,</hi> or at leaſt, the
<hi>feeling</hi> of the griefe, aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
up unto the <hi>brain,</hi> and
was there <hi>felt.</hi> Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
true, it might then be
concluded, that there
could bee no <hi>griefe</hi> in any
part of the <hi>body,</hi> that were
wounded, but in the <hi>brain</hi>
only.</p>
            <p>It were better there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:13463:182"/>
to make this anſwer,
that the <hi>ſinewes (which bee
diſperſed as aforeſaid)</hi> are
the <hi>braine</hi> it ſelfe. For,
they are a certaine porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>braine,</hi> contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

and diffuſing them
throughout the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

in ſuch manner as <hi>fire</hi> is

And whereſoever ſuch a

makes the part wherein it
is ingraffed to be partaker
of <hi>ſenſe;</hi> and to be ſo qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified,
that it may feele

<pb n="312" facs="tcp:13463:183"/>
of the ſame is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
up to the <hi>braine,</hi>
where all the <hi>ſinewes</hi> have
their beginning.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> Now the proper ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of <hi>tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching</hi>
are <hi>hot, cold, ſoft, hard,
ſlimy, ſtiffe, heavy,</hi> and
<hi>light:</hi> For, by <hi>touching</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
we attaine the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of theſe things;
whereas theſe next fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
are common both
to the <hi>touching</hi> and the
<hi>ſight,</hi> (to wit) <hi>ſharp, dull,
rough, plaine, dry, moiſt,
thick, thin, high, low,</hi> yea,
and <hi>place</hi> it ſelfe. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
is <hi>magnitude</hi> (when it

foggineſſe, cleareneſſe,

ſmall things) as alſo the

            </p>
            <p>Moreover, it is ſenſible
of <hi>number,</hi> as farre as <hi>two</hi>
or <hi>three,</hi> but no farther;
and thoſe things muſt alſo
be of no larger <hi>magnitude,</hi>
then may eaſily bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended

And theſe are better diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned

            <p>By that which we have

            <p>As the <hi>ſight</hi> uſeth at all

that theſe things
are ſo. Leſt we ſeeme to

give credit to that which
hath been ſpoken, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

            <p>A plaine <hi>demonſtration</hi>
thereof may bee taken
from the <hi>parts</hi> themſelves;
for, if by any meanes the
<hi>former braine-pan</hi> be hurt,
the <hi>ſenſes</hi> are much hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred;
but the <hi>cogitation</hi>
remaineth ſound. If only
the <hi>middle-pan</hi> be harmed,
the <hi>cogitation</hi> is maymed;
but the <hi>ſeat</hi> of <hi>ſenſe</hi> keepes
the <hi>ſenſes</hi> whole. If any
hurt befall both to the
<hi>former</hi> and <hi>middle-pan,</hi>
both <hi>ſenſe</hi> and <hi>cogitation</hi>
decay. If the <hi>hinder-pan</hi>
be onely diſordered, the
<hi>memory</hi> alone periſheth,
and neither <hi>ſenſe</hi> nor <hi>cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi>
               <pb n="338" facs="tcp:13463:196"/>
receive harme. But
if the <hi>former,</hi> the <hi>middle,</hi>
and the <hi>hinder braine-pans</hi>
be all together out of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
the party ſo diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
is maimed, in <hi>ſenſe,</hi>
in <hi>cogitation,</hi> and <hi>memory,</hi>
all at once; and the whole
<hi>living-creature</hi> is in danger
of deſtruction.</p>
            <p>This is made evident
alſo by many diſeaſes, and
accidents which are ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptomes
of diſeaſes, and
eſpecially in frantick men.
For in ſome of them their
<hi>cogitation</hi> onely is hurt,
and their <hi>ſenſes</hi> are preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
whole.</p>
            <p>Such a frantick man, is
mentioned by <hi>Galen,</hi> who
being in a place wherein
a <hi>wool-winder</hi> was at work
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:13463:196"/>
by him, roſe up, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
certaine glaſſe veſſels
which hee found in the
roome, ran to the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
and aſked ſuch as
paſſed by, whether they
would have ſuch or ſuch
glaſſes caſt downe unto
them, calling every veſſell
by the right name: And
when they who ſtood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
ſaid they would have
it ſo, hee threw them all
downe, one after another.</p>
            <p>Then hee aſked them
whether they would have
the <hi>wool-winder</hi> throwne
downe alſo; they (thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
he had but jeſted) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
<hi>yea:</hi> whereupon he
tooke up the <hi>wool-winder</hi>
and hurled him headlong
from a high place.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="340" facs="tcp:13463:197"/>
This man had his <hi>ſenſes</hi>
whole enough; for hee
knew which were the
<hi>glaſſe-veſſels,</hi> and which
was the <hi>wool-winder;</hi> but
his <hi>cogitation</hi> was diſeaſed.</p>
            <p>Others there be, who

               <pb n="353" facs="tcp:13463:203"/>
of <hi>anger</hi> is the <hi>heart,</hi> which

            </p>
            <p>Theſe things are ſaid

<hi>affection</hi> hath divers ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptations,
wee muſt firſt
diſtinguiſh the variety of

hath: for either it pertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
to the <hi>body,</hi> as when
it is ſick or ulcerated, in
which caſes we ſay it is ſo

and generally, in

and followeth either,
in <hi>griefe</hi> or <hi>pleaſure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For <hi>griefe</hi> doth follow
our <hi>affection,</hi> but the very
<hi>paſsion</hi> or <hi>affection</hi> it ſelfe,
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:13463:204"/>
is not <hi>griefe:</hi> for if that

there ſhould be <hi>griefe</hi> alſo:
but <hi>things void of life</hi> may
be <hi>patients</hi> and ſuffer, yet
feele no <hi>griefe.</hi> Therefore
it is not neceſſarily conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,
that whenſoever
wee are <hi>affected</hi> unto a

grieved, but then onely
when wee feele the thing
which hapneth unto us.
Yea, and that which fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth

            </p>
            <p>But this is the definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of ſuch <hi>affections</hi> as are
in the <hi>ſoul. An</hi> affection
<hi>is the motion of our power of</hi>
               <pb n="356" facs="tcp:13463:205"/>
appetite, <hi>ſubject unto</hi> ſenſe,
<hi>provoked by the appearance
of ſome good or evill.</hi> Or
elſe it may bee defined
thus: <hi>An</hi> affection <hi>is a
motion of the</hi> ſoule, <hi>void of</hi>
reaſon, <hi>ſuppoſing either ſome
good or ſome evill thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Affection</hi> in generall is

<hi>is a motion in one
thing, by the commotion of
another.</hi> The <hi>operation</hi> (or
<hi>action)</hi> is a <hi>motion</hi> working
that which is wrought.
And therefore <hi>anger</hi> is an
<hi>operation</hi> of that part of
the <hi>ſoule</hi> wherein <hi>anger</hi> is;
but it is an <hi>affection</hi> of
both parts of the <hi>ſoule;</hi> and

when our <hi>body</hi> by reaſon

            </p>
            <p>An <hi>operation</hi> (or action)<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/>
after another ſort, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
an <hi>affection;</hi> when it
diſagreeth from <hi>nature;</hi>
for the <hi>operation</hi> is a <hi>motion</hi>
according to nature, but
the <hi>affection</hi> is repugnant

an <hi>operation</hi> when it is
not moved according to
nature, is called an <hi>affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
whether it bee moved
of it ſelfe, or of ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
As for example, the
<hi>motion</hi> which is from the
heart in the pulſes, is an
<hi>operation;</hi> but that unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:13463:206"/>
appetite, <hi>ſubject unto</hi> ſenſe,
<hi>provoked by the appearance
of ſome good or evill.</hi> Or
elſe it may bee defined
thus: <hi>An</hi> affection <hi>is a
motion of the</hi> ſoule, <hi>void of</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Affection</hi> in generall is

            <p>An <hi>operation</hi> (or action)<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/>

whether it bee moved
of it ſelfe, or of ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
As for example, the

<pb n="358" facs="tcp:13463:207"/>
               <hi>motion</hi> which
commeth by feares or fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
is an <hi>affection</hi> or paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
For that great pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
proceedeth from the
heart it ſelfe unnaturally;
and from thence alſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
naturally the mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
beating of the pulſes.
Therefore it is no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile
if one and the ſame
thing bee called both an
<hi>affection</hi> and an <hi>operation.</hi>
For in reſpect they bee
certaine <hi>motions</hi> procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
from the paſſible

            <p>

Thus you ſee the <hi>moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of that part of the <hi>ſoule</hi>
which is <hi>irrationall,</hi> to bee

but thoſe which are moſt
vehement, or which (at

they may bee felt. For,
thoſe which are ſmall, and
which cannot be felt, are
not to be called <hi>affections</hi>
(or paſſions) while they

education, unskilfulneſſe</hi>
(or ignorance,) and by an

            <p>For, if wee be not well

and they are the <hi>pleaſures</hi>
which wee have in <hi>eating,

               <p>There is no <hi>pleaſure</hi>

               <p>Theſe <hi>pleaſures</hi> are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

any <hi>griefe</hi> at all, preceding

are pure, immixt, and free

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> For according to <hi>pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to's</hi>

                  <pb n="373" facs="tcp:13463:214"/>
there bee ſome of them
falſe, and ſome true. Thoſe
are falſe, unto the procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
whereof, <hi>ſenſe</hi> and a
<hi>falſe opinion</hi> is needfull;
and ſuch alſo as have <hi>grief</hi>
annexed unto them. <hi>True
pleaſure</hi> is that which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
to the <hi>ſoule</hi> onely,
even the <hi>ſoule</hi> by it ſelfe,
together with <hi>ſcience, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,</hi>
and <hi>prudence;</hi>
and ſuch <hi>pleaſure</hi> as is pure
without any mixture of
<hi>griefe,</hi> or ſubſequent <hi>repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi>
at any time.</p>
               <p>Some call ſuch <hi>pleaſures</hi>
as enſue upon <hi>contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and good actions, not
<hi>paſsions,</hi> but <hi>ſweetneſſes;</hi> and
others call them <hi>Ioy,</hi> as by
a proper name.</p>
               <p>They define <hi>pleaſure</hi> to
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:13463:215"/>
be <hi>a generation into a nature
ſubject unto ſenſe.</hi> But this
definition ſeemeth to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
onely to <hi>corporeall
pleaſure:</hi> Seeing by that
<hi>pleaſure,</hi> the wants of our
<hi>body</hi> are ſupplyed and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
together with ſuch
griefes as we ſuſtained by
thoſe wants. For when
we be <hi>cold</hi> or <hi>thirſty,</hi> wee
are delighted in the
<hi>warmth,</hi> and in the <hi>drinke,</hi>
whereby that <hi>griefe</hi> is cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
which proceeded
from <hi>cold</hi> and <hi>thirſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore theſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
are not <hi>good</hi> natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
or of themſelves, but
accidentally: for, as <hi>to be
in health,</hi> is <hi>good naturally</hi>
and by it ſelfe, whereas
<hi>to be healed,</hi> is but an <hi>acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:13463:215"/>
good,</hi> ſo theſe <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures</hi>
are onely <hi>accidentally
good;</hi> becauſe they are but
remedies for the curing of
other things. But the <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi>
taken in <hi>contemplation</hi>
is <hi>good naturally,</hi> and of it
ſelfe; becauſe it is not u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in reſpect of any want.</p>
               <p>Hereby it is plain, that
all <hi>pleaſure</hi> is not ordained

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>EPicurus</hi> the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
defines <hi>pleaſure</hi>
to be <hi>The taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
of every thing which
may grieve a man:</hi> and in
ſo defining it he ſayes the
ſame thing with him, who
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:13463:216"/>
affirms it to be <hi>A generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
into a nature ſubject unto
ſenſe.</hi> For hee ſayes that
<hi>our deliverance from that
which grieveth us is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure:</hi>
But ſeeing no <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
conſiſts of the ſame
proprieties, with thoſe
things which proceed
thereof, we muſt not
thinke that the <hi>generation</hi>
of <hi>pleaſure,</hi> is <hi>pleaſure;</hi> but,
ſome other thing beſide
<hi>pleaſure.</hi> For the <hi>generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
it ſelfe is converſant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
ingendring; but of
all things which are <hi>begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,</hi>
there is nothing which
is at once in <hi>begetting,</hi> and
perfectly <hi>begotten;</hi> ſeeing
it is evident that the <hi>acting</hi>
and the <hi>finiſhing</hi> of an <hi>act,</hi>
are diſtinct things, perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:13463:217"/>
by degrees. But that
which taketh pleaſure is
delighted all at once;
therefore <hi>pleaſure</hi> cannot
be a <hi>generation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Furthermore, every
<hi>generation</hi> is a making of
things which are not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
in being; but <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi>
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerneth ſuch things
as have their being alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
therefore <hi>pleaſure</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be a <hi>generation.</hi> Again,
<hi>generation</hi> may bee ſaid to
be ſpeedy or ſlow; but ſo
is not <hi>pleaſure</hi> ſaid to be.</p>
               <p>Moreover, of <hi>good
things,</hi> ſome be the <hi>habit,</hi>
ſome the <hi>operation,</hi> and
ſome the <hi>inſtruments.</hi> The
<hi>habit,</hi> as <hi>vertues;</hi> the <hi>ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi>
as the <hi>action</hi> agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to <hi>vertue.</hi> Again, the
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:13463:217"/>
                  <hi>habit</hi> is as the <hi>faculty of
ſeeing;</hi> the <hi>operation,</hi> as the
<hi>ſeeing it ſelfe;</hi> and the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments</hi>
whereby wee
worke, as the <hi>eye, riches,</hi>
and ſuch like.</p>
               <p>Now all the <hi>powers</hi> of
the <hi>ſoule</hi> which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant
about good or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
things, are the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of ſome <hi>habits</hi> or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Therefore, if <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi>
bee a good thing, and
not an evill thing; theſe
are the onely things in
which it can bee conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant.
But it cannot bee a
<hi>habit;</hi> neither is it as a <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue;</hi>
for then it could not
be ſo eaſily changed into

is contrary to <hi>privation;</hi>
                  <pb n="380" facs="tcp:13463:218"/>
ſeeing it is impoſſible that
a <hi>habit,</hi> and a <hi>privation,</hi>
ſhould meet in the ſame
ſubject; as <hi>pleaſure</hi> and
<hi>griefe</hi> may. For there bee
ſome who take pleaſure,
and are grieved both at
once; as they who are
gently ſcratched when
they itch; therefore <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi>
is not a <hi>habit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither is <hi>pleaſure</hi> an
<hi>inſtrument;</hi> For <hi>inſtruments</hi>
are ordained in reſpect of
other things, not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of themſelves, now
<hi>pleaſure</hi> is not for any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

to be an <hi>operation of a habit

ſhould bee <hi>pleaſure,</hi>
(ſeeing <hi>felicitie</hi> is ſuch an

and ſo his definition is

               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore</hi> Ariſtotle <hi>thus
correcteth his</hi> definition;
pleaſure <hi>(ſaith hee)</hi> is the

<hi>may bee, as it were,

felicity <hi>cannot be</hi> pleaſure.</p>
               <p>Now every <hi>operation</hi> is

            <p>When men are grieved

            <p>
               <hi>HERE wee will
treat of reſpiration,</hi>
which is alſo a
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:13463:242"/>
worke belonging to the
<hi>minde:</hi> For by the <hi>muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi>
the breaſt is opened,
which is the principall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
of <hi>reſpiration.</hi>
Our <hi>ſighing</hi> alſo, and our
thick drawing of breath,
when any great ſorow
happeneth unto us, is an
evidence, that the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
hereof belongeth
unto the <hi>minde.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, the variati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and alterings of our
<hi>breathing,</hi> whenſoever
need requires, are in our
power: For if we be grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in any part ſervicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to <hi>reſpiration,</hi> or in ſuch
parts as are moved by the
motion of any of theſe; as
the <hi>midriffe,</hi> the <hi>liver,</hi> the
<hi>ſpleene,</hi> the <hi>ſtomach,</hi> the
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:13463:243"/>
               <hi>ſmall-guts,</hi> or the <hi>loweſt-gut,</hi>
we then breath ſhort
and thick. Wee breath
ſhort, that we may not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-vehemently
ſmite the
grieved part; we breath
alſo thick, that the often
breathing may ſupply
what is wanting in the
length of our blaſt.</p>
            <p>When our leg is woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
wee ſet it forth very
leiſurely in our going;
which is done to the ſame
end, for which we breath
ſhort; and therefore as to
goe from place to place
belongs unto the <hi>minde,</hi> ſo
doth alſo this operation
of <hi>reſpiration.</hi> But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
we ſhould reſt and
not goe at all it were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
for us to live a long
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:13463:243"/>
time, whereas it were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
for us to hold our
breath the tenth part of
an houre, without death;
becauſe the naturall heat
which is in us, would bee
choaked up and quite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct
by a <hi>ſowltry fume.</hi> For
it is as if a man ſhould co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
a fire within a ſmall
veſſell, having no vent;
which would be immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
ſtifled and quenched
by it owne fume.</p>
            <p>For this cauſe it is very
neceſſary that when wee
are aſleepe, our <hi>ſoul</hi> ſhould
worke nevertheleſſe in
this part; becauſe if it
ſhould be idle therein
(though for a very ſmall
time) the <hi>living-creature</hi>
would periſh: And in
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:13463:244"/>
this it is againe manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted,
how the endeavour
of the <hi>minde</hi> and of <hi>nature</hi>
are knit together.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>minde</hi> exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
<hi>reſpiration,</hi> by an <hi>arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
which is a <hi>naturall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument;</hi>
and it is alwaies
in motion, that neither it

of the other <hi>arteries</hi> may
be intermitted. This not
being perceived by ſome,
(to wit, <hi>how the minde and
nature joyne together in this
worke)</hi> they ſuppoſed <hi>reſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
to bee onely a <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall

            </p>
            <p>Three things cauſe <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration,</hi>
the <hi>uſe,</hi> the <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi>
and the <hi>inſtruments.</hi>
The <hi>uſe</hi> is twofold: one
for the preſervation of
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:13463:244"/>
our <hi>naturall heat,</hi> and the
other for the nouriſhment
of the <hi>vitall-ſpirits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The preſervation of
our <hi>naturall heat</hi> conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth
both of <hi>drawing in,</hi>
and <hi>breathing out</hi> of aire,
For the drawing of the
breath doth not onely
<hi>coole,</hi> but (in a mediocrity)
ſtirreth up <hi>heat</hi> alſo. The
<hi>breathing out</hi> of the aire,
drives away the <hi>foggy heat</hi>
which is about the <hi>heart</hi>
(whereas nouriſhment of
the <hi>vitall-ſpirits,</hi> is <hi>reſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
onely) for the <hi>heart</hi> is
dilated abroad, and a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
portion of aire is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
thereunto.</p>
            <p>The <hi>power (which is a
cauſe alſo of reſpiration)</hi> is
that which it hath from
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:13463:245"/>
the <hi>ſoule:</hi> for it is the <hi>minde</hi>
which moves the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of <hi>reſpiration,</hi> by
meanes of the <hi>muſcles</hi> (and
eſpecially by the breaſt)
wherewith our <hi>lungs,</hi> and
the ſharp <hi>arteries</hi> (which
are alſo a part of the
lungs) are moved.</p>
            <p>For that part of the
ſharp <hi>artery,</hi> which is griſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
is the inſtrument of
the voice; the <hi>ligaments</hi>
thereof which are like
ſkinnes, are inſtruments
of <hi>reſpiration:</hi> and that
which is compoſed of
both together (which is
the forementioned <hi>artery)</hi>
is the inſtrument both of
<hi>reſpiration,</hi> and of the
<hi>voice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> The lungs therefore
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:13463:245"/>
are a compoſition fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
up together, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
of theſe foure, a
<hi>ſharp artery, a ſmooth arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
a veine,</hi> and of a <hi>ſpumie
fleſh;</hi> which <hi>fleſh</hi> doth fill
up all the void places of
the folded ſkin, as it were
a moiſt bed, <hi>(or the herbe
Sleve)</hi> both of the two <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries</hi>
and of the <hi>veine;</hi> ſo
that it becommeth both a
<hi>ſeat</hi> for them, and a <hi>band</hi>
keeping them together.</p>
            <p>The <hi>fleſh</hi> of the <hi>lungs,</hi>
doth naturally co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>coct the
<hi>ſpirits;</hi> as the <hi>liver</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocts
the <hi>humour</hi> which
commeth from the <hi>belly:</hi>
And as the liver, with his
utmoſt edges or ſkirts,
ſpreads it ſelfe about the
<hi>belly,</hi> becauſe it needeth
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:13463:246"/>
heat, ſo the <hi>lungs</hi> incloſe
even the very middle of
the <hi>heart;</hi> becauſe it nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
ſome cooling by <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the <hi>ſharp artery</hi> the
griſtle of the <hi>winde-pipe</hi> is
immediately joyned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
compounded of three
great <hi>griſtles,</hi> whereunto
the throat is annexed, and
which are continued unto
the <hi>mouth</hi> and <hi>noſtrils,</hi> by
both which, we draw the
aire that is without us.
From the mouth it aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
by a bone like unto a
ſieve, or like a ſponge,
which is full of holes, that
the <hi>braine</hi> may not be har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
if there bee any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
in the qualities of
the aire, or if too much
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:13463:246"/>
winde ſhould enter into
it at once.</p>
            <p>Here hath alſo the <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator</hi>
placed the <hi>noſe</hi> both
for <hi>ſmelling</hi> and <hi>reſpiration,</hi>
according as hee hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
the <hi>tongue,</hi> for the
<hi>voice,</hi> for the <hi>taſting,</hi> and
for <hi>chewing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the moſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
parts, ſerving both
for the very <hi>being</hi> of the
<hi>living-creature,</hi> and for the
neceſſary uſes of this life,
are divided together with
the <hi>powers</hi> of the <hi>minde:</hi>
and if any thing hath
beene formerly omitted,
it may bee underſtood by
that which is now expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
            <p>Now as it falls out in all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/>
other created things, that
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:13463:247"/>
ſome are made onely for

ſome onely for the <hi>ſakes

things fall out accidental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
together with ſuch
things as are made; Even
thus you ſhall find it to be
alſo in the parts of a <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving-creature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For all the forenamed
<hi>inſtruments,</hi> of thoſe three
principall things which
governe the <hi>living-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
are made for their
<hi>owne ſakes:</hi> For thoſe
things are eſpecially and
principally made which
are named according to
their proper nature; and
are ingendred in the wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>b
even of the ſeed it ſelfe, as

            <p>
               <pb n="441" facs="tcp:13463:247"/>
But the <hi>yellow choller</hi> is
made both in reſpect of it
ſelfe, &amp; ſome other thing;
For it helpeth <hi>concoction,</hi>
ſtirreth up to the avoiding
of <hi>excrements,</hi> and (in that
reſpect) is in ſome ſort,
one of the parts that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
for <hi>nouriſhment.</hi>
Moreover, it miniſtreth
unto the body a certaine
<hi>heat,</hi> as doth our <hi>vitall-faculty;</hi>
and in reſpect of
all theſe things, it ſeemeth
to bee made for it owne
ſake: But in that it pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
our <hi>blood,</hi> it ſeemeth
after a ſort, to be made in
reſpect of the <hi>blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>ſpleen</hi> alſo helpeth
<hi>concoction;</hi> and that not a
little: For being tart, and
of a ſharp aſtringent na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:13463:248"/>
it bindeth the belly
by powring out into the

ſtrengtheneth it alſo; aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth
<hi>concoction,</hi> and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
the <hi>liver:</hi> For which
cauſes, that part alſo ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to have beene or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
in reſpect of the
<hi>blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>reines</hi> likewiſe are
a purgation for the <hi>blood,</hi>
and a cauſe of the deſire
which we have to <hi>carnall
copulation:</hi> For the <hi>veines,</hi>
which (as we have decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
before) doe fall down
into the <hi>cods,</hi> paſſe along
by the <hi>reines;</hi> and from
thence carry with them a
certaine ſharpneſſe, which
provoketh <hi>luſt,</hi> even as a
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:13463:248"/>
certaine ſharp moiſture
which is under the ſkin,
procureth an itch. And
looke how much the fleſh
of the <hi>ſtones,</hi> is tenderer
then the other ſkin of the
body; by ſo much the
more, (being tickled by
that ſharpneſſe) are they
ſtirred up to the ejacula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>ſeed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe things therefore
and ſuch like, are made
both for their owne ſakes,
and alſo in reſpect of <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things.</hi> But the <hi>ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels,</hi>
and the fleſh are <hi>only</hi>
ordained in reſpect of <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

doe ſerve to cary up

that they may not be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
when they are lifted
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:13463:249"/>
up, or ſtretched forth with
any violent motions. And
the <hi>fleſh</hi> was made to be a
covering to the other
parts; that it might coole
the <hi>living-creature</hi> in the
<hi>ſummer,</hi> by being as it
were, a morning dew
thereunto, and that it
might in the <hi>winter</hi> bee as
it were a quilt of wooll to

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>skin</hi> was ordained
as a covering, both for
the tender <hi>fleſh,</hi> and all
thoſe parts that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.
The <hi>fleſh</hi> is of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

            <p>
               <pb n="445" facs="tcp:13463:249"/>
The <hi>bones</hi> are an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſetting

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>nailes</hi> are moſt

            <p>Many have them both
for a weapon of defence,
and alſo for a ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

horſes; and all ſuch as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide

that they might by ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
diſperſe the ſharp

            <p>The <hi>haires</hi> grow out

SUch things as are

The <hi>beginning</hi> of thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions

ſome other thing, and not

this is the <hi>definition</hi> of

<hi>It is an action not having

the thing done.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> Hereupon it may bee
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:13463:253"/>
queſtioned, when Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
caſt their lading into

by a te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>peſt; (or

theſe actions may be

to this clauſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to the <hi>definition (Hee
that is forced, doth nothing

to the executing of
ſuch things, the <hi>actors</hi> doe
of themſelves move their
<hi>inſtrumentall parts,</hi> even of

            <p>Such is their caſe who
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:13463:254"/>
caſt their lading into the
Sea; and theirs who offer
themſelves to abide any
ſhame or danger to bring
to paſſe a greater good, as
did <hi>Zeno,</hi> who bitt off his

out into the face of <hi>Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi>
the tyrant, becauſe he
would not utter unto him
what was to bee kept ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret;
or as did <hi>Anaxarchus</hi>
the Philoſopher, who
choſe to be tormented
unto death, by being row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
up together like a
wheele, rather then hee
would diſcloſe the ſecret
of his friend unto <hi>Nica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reon</hi>
the Tyrant.</p>
            <p>Therefore, generally,
when a man either choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
a leſſe evill, through
feare of ſome greater evil;
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:13463:254"/>
or, when a man accepts
the leſſe Good, in hope of
a greater Good, (which he
cannot otherwiſe attaine
according as hee would)
that thing which in ſuch
caſes he doth or ſuffereth,
is not utterly <hi>againſt his
will:</hi> for he <hi>doth</hi> or <hi>ſuffers</hi>
by his owne adviſe, and
choice; and ſuch things
are to bee made choice of
at that time, though they
be not to bee choſen of
their owne nature.</p>
            <p>Theſe are mixt <hi>actions,</hi>
partly <hi>voluntary,</hi> and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>againſt our will:</hi> For,
they are <hi>voluntary</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of the <hi>circumſtances;</hi>
but they are <hi>involuntary,</hi>
in regard of the <hi>actions</hi>
themſelves; and were it
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:13463:255"/>
not for the <hi>circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtances,</hi> no
man would make choice
of doing ſuch things.</p>
            <p>Moreover the <hi>praiſe</hi> or
<hi>diſpraiſe</hi> which followes
ſuch actions, declare them
to be <hi>voluntary:</hi> for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>praiſe</hi> nor <hi>diſpraiſe</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
ſuch things as are
done abſolutely by <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not eaſie to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
what things are to
be choſen before others,
in ſome difficult caſes:
But for the moſt part, wee
muſt chooſe rather to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide
griefe, then commit
any ſhamefull act; as did
both <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> and <hi>Suſanna;</hi>
and yet this holds not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes.
For doubtleſſe <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigen</hi>
fell groſſely when he

choſe to ſacrifice unto I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols,
rather then to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go
that diſhoneſtie which
the <hi>Aethiopians</hi> would
have put upon him.</p>
            <p>We ſee therefore, that
the diſcerning of ſuch
things is not eaſie; and
we finde alſo, that it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
hard for them that have
choſen, to continue in that
which they have reſolved
upon; becauſe perills <hi>to
come</hi> doe not ſo amaze or
diſcourage us, as thoſe tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which are <hi>preſently
inflicted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It ſo happeneth often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
that they who have
<hi>choſen well,</hi> doe depart
from their owne <hi>choice</hi> by
perſecution; as it hath
happened unto ſome, who
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:13463:256"/>
when they ſhould have
ſuffered <hi>martyrdome,</hi> fell
back from their ſtout and
reſolute beginnings, by
being through tenderneſs
unable to endure the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als,
and the torments of
adverſity, when they were
inflicted upon them.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> Let no man imagine
therefore, that either an
inconſtant <hi>falling away</hi>
from a well choſen reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
or an intemperate
<hi>luſt,</hi> or an <hi>angry rage,</hi> are
to bee accounted among
ſuch offences as are to bee
judged things done <hi>againſt
our will;</hi> by reaſon there
is an <hi>efficient cauſe</hi> of thoſe
actions <hi>without our ſelves:</hi>
For though the beauty of

ſaw her to ruſh into the
execution of an intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
luſt; and though ſuch
as are furiouſly angry,
were ſo provoked there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
by another man, that
the firſt beginnings therof
may bee truly affirmed to
have beene <hi>without them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;</hi>
yet the actors of
ſuch things doe worke by
<hi>themſelves,</hi> and by their
<hi>inſtrumentall parts:</hi> for
which cauſe their <hi>actions</hi>
come not within the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
of things done by
<hi>conſtraint;</hi> even in regard
they offered unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
the <hi>occaſions,</hi> and <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings</hi>
of thoſe actions;
and ſuffered themſelves
to bee eaſily incaptivated
by <hi>paſsions,</hi> through an
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:13463:257"/>
evill <hi>converſation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore all they who
doe ſuch things, are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily
reprehended, as men

II. The definition and

markes of things done

and the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

ignorance, and thoſe
which we doe being igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.
III. A catalogue of
ſuch particulars, the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
wherof makes an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to be involuntary.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>BY <hi>ignorance</hi> many
things are done by
us, whereof we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
after the deed: As
when a man killeth his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
at unawares (or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
his will) and yet is
glad that he is ſlaine.
Theſe, &amp; ſuch like things,
are neither accounted <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary,</hi>
nor altogether <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some things alſo are
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:13463:258"/>
done through <hi>ignorance,</hi>
for which we grieve after
they are done: And thoſe
are uſually called things
done <hi>againſt our will,</hi> after
the doing wherof we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
grieved for the act.
And by this it appeares
that there be two ſorts of
things done by <hi>ignorance;</hi>
the one not <hi>volu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tary,</hi> &amp; the
other <hi>quite againſt our will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is our purpoſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
to treat at this time
of ſuch things as are <hi>alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
againſt our will:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that which wee call
<hi>not voluntary</hi> (as aforeſaid)
may rather be reduced to
thoſe things which <hi>are
voluntary</hi> in regard it is
mixt of both.</p>
            <p>For though it hath <hi>a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning</hi>
               <pb n="463" facs="tcp:13463:258"/>
by <hi>conſtraint,</hi> yet
the <hi>end</hi> is <hi>voluntary;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
by the event, that
becomes <hi>voluntary,</hi> which
was firſt <hi>againſt our will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore a <hi>thing done</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
               <hi>againſt our will,</hi> is defined
in this manner; <hi>That is an
involuntary act, which is not
only againſt our wil, but hath
alſo griefe &amp; repentance an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
thereunto.</hi> Moreover,
it is one thing to doe an
act <hi>through ignorance,</hi> and
another thing to doe it,
<hi>being ignorant:</hi> For if that
thing which cauſed the
<hi>ignorance</hi> be in our power,
we doe it <hi>being ignorant;</hi>
but not by <hi>ignorance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For example, he that
is accuſtomed unto <hi>drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe,</hi>
or to <hi>anger,</hi> and
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:13463:259"/>
in his <hi>wrath</hi> or <hi>drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi>
committeth an evill;
he hath (indeed) <hi>drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi>
or <hi>anger,</hi> as a cauſe
of thoſe things which are
done by him: But never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe
thoſe things were
<hi>voluntary</hi> (for it was in his
power not to have beene
drunke (or ſo inraged) and
therefore in not ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
thoſe inordinate ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites,
hee himſelfe was
cauſe of his own <hi>ignorance;</hi>
and may in that regard be
ſaid to have done that evil
<hi>being ignorant;</hi> but cannot
be truly ſaid to have done
it <hi>through ignorance:</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is his act to bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
as done, by <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint,</hi>
but voluntarily;
for that cauſe he who
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:13463:259"/>
doth commit ſuch things
is juſtly reprehended by
good men: Even becauſe
his drunkenneſſe (which
occaſioned that act) being
<hi>voluntary,</hi> makes the act
which was therby occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,
to be voluntary alſo.</p>
            <p>But we are ſaid to doe
things <hi>through ignorance,</hi>
when wee our ſelves gave
no cauſe of that igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;
and when the deed
was by <hi>chance.</hi> As if a man
ſhould ſhoot in an uſuall
ſhooting place, &amp; happen
to hit and ſlay his father
walking thereabout.</p>
            <p>It is plaine by that
which is aforeſaid, that the
actions of ſuch a man are
not to bee accounted as
done <hi>againſt his will,</hi> who
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:13463:260"/>
is ignorant of ſuch things
as it behooveth him to
know; or which reputes
evill things to bee goo:
For this <hi>ignorance</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from his owne wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe;
and as his <hi>actions</hi>
are vitious, ſo his <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi>
alſo is to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
as a <hi>vice,</hi> for which he
is worthy of reprehenſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
And <hi>reprehenſion</hi> is due on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to thoſe things which
are <hi>voluntarily done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the <hi>ignorance</hi> of <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall</hi>
(or <hi>univerſall) things;</hi>
or of ſuch as are in <hi>choice,</hi>
is not accounted to bee a
thing <hi>involuntary;</hi> but the
ignorance of <hi>particular
things</hi> onely, is eſteemed
ſuch: For we may be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of <hi>particular things</hi>
               <pb n="467" facs="tcp:13463:260"/>
againſt our will. But of
<hi>univerſall things,</hi> our <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi>
is accounted <hi>volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary;</hi>
becauſe ſuch an <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi>
cannot bee in us
without our owne fault;
except we are <hi>madmen,</hi> or

            <p>This being thus deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/>
it now reſteth to

therefore it may be from
theſe things concluded,
that a thing <hi>voluntary,</hi> and

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> Neither is our <hi>appetite</hi>
and our <hi>choice</hi> all one. For
our <hi>appetite</hi> is divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
theſe three, <hi>deſire, anger,</hi>
and <hi>will.</hi> Now, that our
<hi>choice</hi> is neither <hi>anger,</hi> nor

made evident by this, that

whereas he doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
with beaſts in <hi>cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi>

in theſe laſt mentioned
he agree with beaſts, and
differs from them in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a <hi>choice</hi> of things;
then it is manifeſt, that
our <hi>choice</hi> is one thing, and
that our <hi>deſire</hi> and our <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi>

            <p>The ſame is proved by

            <p>That <hi>choice</hi> and <hi>will</hi> are
not all one, may bee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by this; that our <hi>Will</hi>
doth not agree unto all

doth aſſent. For we have
a <hi>will</hi> to be <hi>in health,</hi> or to
be <hi>rich;</hi> but to be in <hi>health,</hi>

Our <hi>will</hi> hath place

For our will extendeth
unto the <hi>end it ſelfe;</hi> but
our <hi>choice</hi> can reach no
further then to the means
which are in poſſibility to
attaine that end: and
there is betweene them
the ſame proportion
which there is betweene
the thing ſubject unto our
<hi>will,</hi> and that thing wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about

for the ſubject of
our <hi>will</hi> is the <hi>end</hi> of that

unto ſuch things
as are not in our power
to accompliſh; as when
would that ſuch or ſuch a
<hi>Commander</hi> ſhould obtain
the victory.</p>
            <p>It is then well enough
proved that our <hi>choice</hi> is
neither the <hi>concupiſcible,</hi>
nor the <hi>iraſcible appetite,</hi>
nor our <hi>will;</hi> and aſwell
by the ſame arguments, as
by other alſo, it may bee
made manifeſt; that it is
not <hi>opinion.</hi> For opinion
extendeth not onely to

things which are in our

            <p>Moreover, we ſay that
an <hi>opinion</hi> is either <hi>true</hi> or
<hi>falſe;</hi> but to ſay our <hi>choice</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Opinion</hi> concerneth

            </p>
            <p>Neither is our <hi>choice</hi> all
one with our <hi>conſultation:</hi>
For <hi>conſultation</hi> is an advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
about ſuch things as

to bee choſen which in

               <hi>conſultation</hi> is preferred:
yea, our <hi>conſultation</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates

            <p>Wee have hitherto de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/>
what this <hi>choice</hi> is

you what it is.</p>
            <p>Doubtleſſe <hi>choice</hi> is a
thing mixt of <hi>conſultation,
judgement,</hi> and <hi>appetite;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
neither the one nor
the other, but a certaine
compound of theſe. For
as wee ſay that a <hi>living-creature,</hi>
is a compound of
<hi>ſoul</hi> and <hi>body;</hi> and neither
a <hi>body</hi> by it ſelfe, nor a

<pb n="486" facs="tcp:13463:270"/>
even ſo ſay wee alſo
of this our <hi>choice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is plaine by the very
Etymologie therof, that it
is a certaine <hi>counſelling,</hi> or
<hi>conſultation,</hi> with an <hi>appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation</hi>
of ſome one thing
before the reſt; and that
it is not altogether the
ſame with <hi>conſultation:</hi>
For we are then onely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
to have made
<hi>choice,</hi> when one thing is
taken before another.
And no man preferreth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing in <hi>choice,</hi> before
he hath <hi>conſulted,</hi> neither
accepteth before hee hath
<hi>judged.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſeeing we are not
willing to execute or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit

which wee well approve

wee will proceed to

            </p>
            <p>We conſult then of thoſe

<hi>That is, ſuch as may

            </p>
            <p>We define it to bee <hi>of
thoſe things which are in
our power,</hi> becauſe our
<hi>conſultation</hi> is onely of
thoſe things which are to
be undertake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by us; which
things are in our power:
For we doe not <hi>conſult</hi> of
that kinde of Philoſophy,
which is called <hi>contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive;</hi>
neither of GOD;
nor of things which fall
out of <hi>neceſsity</hi> (by <hi>neceſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
               <pb n="492" facs="tcp:13463:273"/>
I meane thoſe things
which fall out alwayes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

that a man of ſixty ſhould

            <p>Neither <hi>conſult</hi> wee of

this <hi>clauſe</hi> was added, <hi>that
the thing</hi> (conſulted of)
<hi>ſhould be in our power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>definition</hi> ſaith fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that it muſt bee of
<hi>things which may be done by

<hi>conſult of all men;</hi> neither
of <hi>every thing,</hi> but of thoſe
which are in our power to
conſult of: For we <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
not</hi> how the common
wealth of our enemies
may be governed; nor of
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:13463:274"/>
them who dwell very far
from us, (albeit this bee a
thing which may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted
of among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.)</p>
            <p>Neither doe we <hi>conſult</hi>
of all things that <hi>may bee
done by us;</hi> nor of all things
that <hi>are in our power.</hi>
And therfore theſe words,
<hi>which have an uncertain end</hi>
were added to the defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
for if the thing bee
manifeſt, and confeſſed,
we <hi>deliberate</hi> no more
thereof.</p>
            <p>Neither is there any
<hi>conſultation</hi> of ſuch works
or actions as are according
to <hi>Science,</hi> and <hi>Art:</hi> For,
all their principles are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminately
knowne, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
a few <hi>Arts</hi> which are
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:13463:274"/>
termed <hi>conjecturall,</hi> as <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,</hi>
and the art of <hi>Exorci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,</hi>
and of <hi>governing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For, we doe not onely

ſuch an uncertaine end,
that the ſucceſſe may be as
well <hi>that,</hi> as <hi>this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it hath been decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that our <hi>conſultation</hi> is
not of the <hi>end;</hi> but of
things which tend unto
the <hi>end:</hi> For our <hi>conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
is not of <hi>being rich,</hi>
but of the <hi>meanes</hi> how to
<hi>be rich.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To ſpeake all in briefe; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/>
wee doe <hi>conſult</hi> of thoſe
things onely which are
doubtfull, and may be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:13463:275"/>
ſo, or not ſo: and of
thoſe things we muſt alſo
treate, that in our <hi>diſcourſe</hi>
nothing be wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting which
may make things evident.</p>
            <p>Thoſe <hi>qualities</hi> are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>faculties,</hi> whereby we
are enabled to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of any thing. For,
whatſoever we doe, wee
have the <hi>faculty</hi> of it; and
thoſe things wee cannot
performe, whereof the <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty</hi>
is not in us. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our <hi>action</hi> dependeth
upon our <hi>faculty,</hi> and our
<hi>faculty</hi> upon our <hi>eſſence:</hi>
yea the <hi>action</hi> proceedeth
from our <hi>faculty,</hi> and our
<hi>faculty</hi> from our <hi>ſubſtance,</hi>
and is in our <hi>ſubſtance</hi> And
as I ſaid before, theſe are
three things depending
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:13463:275"/>
one upon another. The
<hi>thing able;</hi> the <hi>faculty by
which it hath ability;</hi> and
<hi>the thing which is to be done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The thing <hi>able to doe it</hi>
is a <hi>ſubſtance.</hi> The <hi>faculty</hi>
is that whereby wee have
ability to doe it. The
<hi>thing to be done,</hi> is that,
whoſe nature may be pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed
upon, by our <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Of things that may bee
done,</hi> ſome are <hi>neceſſary,</hi>
&amp; ſome <hi>contingent.</hi> Thoſe
are termed <hi>neceſſary</hi> which
cannot poſſibly be hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
or thoſe, the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
whereof is unpoſſible:
And that is <hi>contingent,</hi>
which may bee hindered,
or whoſe contrary may
poſſibly fall out.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="498" facs="tcp:13463:276"/>
For example; It is <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary</hi>
that a man ſhould
breath as long as hee li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth;
for it is impoſſible
a man ſhould live and not
breath. It is <hi>contingent</hi>
that there ſhould be raine
to day; for it is poſſible
that this day it ſhould not
raine, which is contrary to
the other.</p>
            <p>Againe, things <hi>contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent</hi>
are ſaid to fall out
ſometimes <hi>often,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
ſeldome, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
indifferently, in this
maner or in that. They
are <hi>frequent,</hi> as to have
gray haires at three ſcore;
they are <hi>ſeldome,</hi> as not to
have gray haires at that
age: And they are <hi>indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent;</hi>
as it is equally in our
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:13463:276"/>
choice to <hi>walke,</hi> or not to
<hi>walke;</hi> or ſimply to doe
any act, or not to doe it.</p>
            <p>Now our <hi>conſultation</hi> is
of thoſe things onely
which may indifferently
come to paſſe, or not come
to paſſe; and a thing is
ſaid to fall out equally or
indifferently, when wee
may in like ſort, doe as
well the contrary thereof
as the thing it ſelfe: For,
if we could not doe both
equally, wee ſhould not
<hi>conſult</hi> thereof. Becauſe
no man <hi>conſults</hi> either of
things <hi>confeſſed,</hi> or <hi>impoſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi>
For if wee were able
to doe but one of thoſe
things which are <hi>contrary;</hi>
that ſhould be received
without ambiguity; and
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:13463:277"/>
the contrary ſhould not,
becauſe <hi>impoſsible.</hi>

of the opinion

            </argument>
            <p>OUr opinion is that
they who aſcribe
all things which

               <pb n="501" facs="tcp:13463:277"/>

For indeed, <hi>lawes</hi> are in
vaine, and <hi>judgements</hi> ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous,
becauſe they
puniſh innocent men,
without cauſe.</p>
            <p>If their opinion bee
true, it is alſo a thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable
to <hi>reprehend</hi> or
<hi>praiſe</hi> any man: yea, if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very

by <hi>deſtiny</hi> (or by an ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable

is he more then an <hi>inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
ſerviceable to the

every thought alſo which

            </p>
            <p>They that are of this

take away (together with

            <p>Nay <hi>God</hi> who is the

            <p>Thus, their abſurditie

that <hi>things may bee

ſome things (ſay theſe) is
given by <hi>deſtiny</hi> to every

<hi>plant</hi> to beare ſuch

or to be deſirous of things
<hi>agreeable unto them.</hi> And
when nothing (without

oppoſeth it ſelfe againſt

then it becomes perfectly

            <p>As long as the ſame

(as they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

               <pb n="507" facs="tcp:13463:280"/>
If this bee ſo, as they have

            </p>

But if our very <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring</hi>

            <p>We will ſhew you, that
in ſaying thus, they place
<hi>deſtiny</hi> among <hi>contingent
things:</hi> Now <hi>contingent
things</hi> are <hi>indefinite;</hi> and
<hi>indefinite things</hi> are <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne:</hi>
therefore by theſe

is overthrowne: and
that eſpecially which is by

they make moſt account
of all other, as of a thing

            <p>If they tells us that

(which they ſet)</hi> are very

to thoſe who are ſkilfull;
and that <hi>God</hi> hath hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

               <hi>figure</hi> hath not effect ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his proper ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue;
we will reply, that it
is abſurd to account <hi>praier,
and the ſervice of the gods</hi>
only, to be in our power;
and no other thing.</p>
            <p>For we will make this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
               <hi>quare,</hi> and aſke them how
it come to paſſe, that all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things (which are to
bee done or accepted by
men) ſhould depend upon
ſuch or ſuch a <hi>conſtellation,</hi>
or affection of the <hi>ſtarres;</hi>
and that <hi>prayer</hi> onely
ſhould bee in our power?
For it is not onely doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
whether this thing it
ſelfe be ſo; but as doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
alſo, for what <hi>cauſe,</hi>
and upon what <hi>neceſsity</hi> it
ſhould be.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="514" facs="tcp:13463:285"/>
If there bee an <hi>art,</hi> and
an orderly way whereby
men may attaine to thoſe
pacifications, which may
hinder ſuch things as are
effected by <hi>deſtiny:</hi> It may
be queſtioned, whether
all men may attaine this
<hi>method,</hi> or ſome few only.
If all may aſpire unto it,
then there is a poſſibility,
by that meanes to give
their <hi>deſtiny</hi> an utter over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw,
as ſoone as all have
learned that <hi>art,</hi> which
prevents and hinders the

            <p>If ſome onely may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
this meanes, and not

know what maner of
man, and who he is, that
ſhall determine of this
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:13463:285"/>
thing. For if <hi>deſtiny</hi> it ſelf
bee the cauſe, that ſome
ſerve GOD, and ſome do
not ſo; even that will bee
another proofe, that all
things are done by <hi>deſtiny,</hi>
whereas it appeared by
their opinion before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
that our <hi>praying,</hi>
and <hi>honouring of the Gods,</hi>
is in our power, not only
no leſſe then <hi>deſtiny;</hi> but
much more alſo.</p>
            <p>Now if it be not <hi>deſtiny</hi>
but ſome other thing
which is cauſe thereof,
then that thing ſhall ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be <hi>deſtiny:</hi> For all the
force of <hi>deſtiny</hi> conſiſteth
in this, that we either <hi>may</hi>
or <hi>may not</hi> obtaine that
which we petition for in
our <hi>prayers.</hi> If we <hi>may,</hi> then
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:13463:286"/>
is <hi>deſtiny</hi> of no <hi>force;</hi> and
if wee <hi>may not prevaile by
prayer,</hi> then all is ſubject
unto <hi>deſtiny:</hi> and it will
ſo fall out, that in ſome, all
things are done by <hi>deſtiny,</hi>
and that in ſome other, <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny</hi>
effecteth nothing at
all <hi>(becauſe prayer is preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
for ſome and not for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.)</hi>
And this is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that whoſoever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines
hereof, he is the
<hi>chiefe deſtiny:</hi> and ſo it
will be another way decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that all things are

            </p>
            <p>

the way of ſerving the

enſue upon thoſe

of <hi>Law.</hi> But all things
are in his hand, to
doe, or not to doe; even
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:13463:295"/>
thoſe things which were
otherwiſe <hi>neceſſary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that this might
plainely be declared, hee
ſtayed once the <hi>courſes</hi> of
the <hi>Sun,</hi> and of the <hi>Moone,</hi>
which are moved of <hi>neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,</hi>
and keep alwayes one
conſtant <hi>motion:</hi> thereby
ſhewing, that nothing
done by <hi>neceſsity</hi> doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
him; but that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his power all
things are <hi>contingent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet he made ſuch a day
but once (as wee finde it
in holy Scripture) that he
might onely ſet forth his
<hi>power,</hi> and not diſſolve
that ſtrong <hi>law</hi> which
was made by him at the
firſt, that the motion of
the <hi>Starres</hi> ſhould bee <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="535" facs="tcp:13463:295"/>
So likewiſe, he did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
ſome from death, as
<hi>Enoch,</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> who
were naturally mortall,
and liable to corruption;
that by all theſe things
we might perceive his

            <p>But the <hi>Stoicks</hi> have <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/>

both in <hi>longitude,</hi> and <hi>lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,</hi>
wherein every one

they ſhall within a

cauſe all to be ſet on fire,

(as they alſo affirme) the

ſhall be reſtored unto the

ſtate wherein it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>Yea, they ſay further,
that foraſmuch as the <hi>ſtars</hi>
ſhall have againe the ſame
courſe; every thing that
was in the former circuit
ſhall come to paſſe againe
without any alteration.
<hi>Socrates</hi> ſhall be as hee was
againe, and <hi>Plato,</hi> and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
particular man; having
the ſame friends, and the
ſame Citizens; and that
the like things ſhall befall
every one; yea, that every
man ſhall take in hand the
ſame worke which he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
wrought; and that
every City, Village, and
field ſhall bee brought to
the like ſtate againe: And
that the whole <hi>Vniverſe</hi>
               <pb n="537" facs="tcp:13463:296"/>
ſhall be reſtored unto the
former condition againe;
not one time onely, but as
often as the <hi>revolutions</hi> of
the <hi>Planets</hi> do come about
to the ſame point, which
<hi>revolutions</hi> they thinke
ſhall be <hi>infinite</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

            <p>They ſay alſo, that the
<hi>gods</hi> are not ſubject to this
corruption; and that when
they have obſerved one
whole <hi>revolution,</hi> they
know by that <hi>circuit,</hi> all
things that ſhall come to
paſſe in every ſucceeding

(as they dreame) no new
thing; but every thing
which was before, ſhall
bee reacted after one and
the ſame ſort, without any

alteration in the leaſt

            <p>And ſome have ſaid,

            <p>But the proper worke

which had their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
from our <hi>will</hi> and
<hi>choice,</hi> and yet produce in
the end ſomewhat elſe
then was intended by the

that is digging of a ditch,

hee who there laid
the treaſure, had any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
it ſhould be ſo found;
neither had the finder any

but the purpoſe of the

               <hi>one</hi> was to take it thence
when he himſelf thought
fit; and the intention of
the other was to make a
ditch; and there fell out
another thing beſide thoſe
which were purpoſed by

            <p>The workes of <hi>chance</hi>

            <p>It is not lawfull, nor

we aſcribe them to <hi>neceſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Therefore it remaineth

acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pliſheth ſuch, or ſuch

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> Moreover, if man bee

is ſuperfluous in him;
for to what end is <hi>delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi>
if hee have no acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

But it muſt needs be a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
abſurd thing to affirme
that to bee ſuperflous in
<hi>man,</hi> which is beſt, and
moſt honourable in him.</p>
            <p>If then he doe <hi>conſult,</hi>
he <hi>conſults</hi> about the do<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing
of ſome thing; for all
<hi>deliberation</hi> doth concerne

            <p>Moreover, of whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever

            <p>Now that the <hi>faculties</hi>

<hi>vertue</hi> are in our power, it
is very elegantly declared
by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> where he trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
of the <hi>morall vertues.</hi>
That ſaith he; which wee
learne by <hi>practiſe,</hi> we <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe</hi>
when wee have lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
it: For while we learn

            </p>
            <p>Wee may argue alſo in

this maner: It is confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
of all, that <hi>practiſe</hi> and

beareth ſway in <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits;</hi>
for <hi>cuſtome</hi> is as it
were a purchaſed <hi>nature.</hi>
If then practiſe rule the
<hi>habit,</hi> and if <hi>practiſe</hi> bee in
our power, then the <hi>habit</hi>
alſo muſt be in our power:
yea, and the <hi>actions</hi> alſo,

the <hi>actions</hi> are conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the <hi>habits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hee then which hath
the <hi>habit of juſtice,</hi> will do
juſt things; and hee that
hath a <hi>habit of injurie,</hi> will
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:13463:301"/>
doe injurious things.
Therefore God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
us a power to bee <hi>juſt</hi>
or <hi>unjuſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our <hi>counſelling</hi> alſo, and
our <hi>exhorting</hi> of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
doe declare that
there bee ſome things in

doth exhort us not to bee
<hi>hungry,</hi> or not to <hi>thirſt,</hi> or
to <hi>flye in the ayre;</hi> becauſe
theſe things are not in our

manifeſt, that thoſe things
whereunto our exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
doe ſerve, are in our

            <p>Moreover, if nothing
be in our power, then our

<pb n="548" facs="tcp:13463:302"/>
that they have power

<pb n="557" facs="tcp:13463:306"/>
place of the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> which
ſaith, <hi>He who lookes upon a
woman to luſt after her, hath
committed adultery already
w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> her in his heart.</hi> And we
read that <hi>Iob</hi> ſacrificed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God, for ſuch offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces as
his children might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
in <hi>thought.</hi> For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the <hi>beginning,</hi> either
of <hi>ſin,</hi> or of <hi>doing uprightly</hi>
is in our <hi>will;</hi> whereas the
<hi>doing</hi> of the thing it ſelfe,
is otherwhile permitted
by <hi>Providence,</hi> and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while
hindered.</p>
            <p>For, ſeeing there are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/>
ſome things in <hi>our power,</hi>
and a <hi>Providence</hi> beſide;
it is neceſſary that ſuch
things as are done ſhould
bee done by them both:
Becauſe, if they were
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:13463:307"/>
done by either of them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
the other ſhould be
to no purpoſe. Therefore
in regard all <hi>actions</hi> are
mixt, it will ſometime
happen that they ſhall be
in our power; another
while, that they ſhall bee
as providence alone dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth;
and ſometimes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
both according to
<hi>Providence,</hi> and as wee
<hi>would</hi> alſo.</p>
            <p>And whereas likewiſe
there is ſometimes a <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,</hi>
and ſometimes a <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Providence;</hi> it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
that the ſame
ſhould fall out in <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi>
things, as it doth in
things <hi>generall.</hi> For if the
aire about us bee dry, our
bodies are dryed alſo,
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:13463:307"/>
though not all alike. And
if a mother be given to ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otous
fare, or a diſtempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
dyet; even thereby
ſhall her children become
diſtempered in body, and
perverſe in ſuch things as
they attempt.</p>
            <p>It is plaine therefore,
by what hath beene ſaid,
that men may fall into a
diſtempered eſtate of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
either by the generall
diſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perature of the aire;
or by the dyet of parents;
or when they ſpoil them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
by their owne vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuouſneſſe;
and that
they may be diſtempered
ſometime by ſuch occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
as take their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
from themſelves; in
ſuch maner, that <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
               <pb n="560" facs="tcp:13463:308"/>
ſhall not altogether
bee the cauſe of ſuch
things.</p>
            <p>If then, the <hi>Soul</hi> ſhall
yeeld her ſelfe to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwayed
by the <hi>temperature</hi>
of the <hi>body,</hi> and give place
to <hi>wrath,</hi> or <hi>luſt;</hi> or bee
preſſed downe by <hi>outward
things,</hi> as <hi>poverty;</hi> or lifted
up, by <hi>riches,</hi> or the like:
if any evill commeth to
the ſame thereby; it ſo
hapned thereunto by the
<hi>ſelfe-will</hi> of that <hi>Soul.</hi> See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
if ſhee had not volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily
yeelded her ſelfe to
thoſe diſtemperatures, ſhe
might have overcome
them, and beene in good
caſe. For through well
ordering the <hi>affections</hi> of
the <hi>minde,</hi> by a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:13463:308"/>
               <hi>dyet,</hi> and a good <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,</hi>
ſhe might have
altered that <hi>temperature,</hi>
rather then have beene
perverted thereby.</p>
            <p>This is manifeſt by the
example of ſuch as are in a
<hi>good condition,</hi> and that all
ſuch as are not in a <hi>good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,</hi>
doe <hi>ſin</hi> voluntarily
<hi>(and not by conſtraint:)</hi>
And that it is in our pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
either to conſent, and
yeeld our ſelves unto our
<hi>bodily diſtemperatures,</hi> or
to reſiſt, and overcome
them.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſſe, there be
many who pretend theſe

SOmewhat remaines
to be declared, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it may bee mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
why <hi>man</hi> had <hi>freewill</hi>
beſtowed upon him.</p>
            <p>We affirme, that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately,
together with
<hi>reaſon</hi> this <hi>freewill</hi> entered
into us; and that together
with <hi>nature,</hi> there is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffed
into created
things a <hi>mutability,</hi> and <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration;</hi>
eſpecially in thoſe
things which are a <hi>ſubject</hi>
made of <hi>matter.</hi> For there
is a <hi>mutation</hi> even in the
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:13463:310"/>
very <hi>beginning</hi> of every
thing which is made; and
all <hi>making</hi> proceedeth
from an alteration of the
<hi>materiall ſubject.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is evident to any
man who conſiderately
beholds the <hi>plants,</hi> and <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving-creatures,</hi>
which have
their abiding either in the
<hi>earth,</hi> in the <hi>water,</hi> or in
the <hi>aire:</hi> For there is in
all thoſe a continuall <hi>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, that our
<hi>freewill</hi> enters into us, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with <hi>reaſon,</hi> hath
beene made plain enough
by thoſe things which we
have ſaid, to prove that
ſome thing is in <hi>our power;</hi>
as will appeare to them
who have heeded what
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:13463:310"/>
was delivered to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
But becauſe the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quell
of this <hi>treatiſe,</hi> doth
for ſome reſpects require
the ſame; perhaps it will
not be impertinent to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat
ſome part of that
which was formerly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>reaſon</hi> is divided
into <hi>contemplation,</hi> and
<hi>practiſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Contemplative rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi>
is that which concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
(univerſally) the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of things, as they bee
really; and <hi>active reaſon,</hi> is
that whereby wee <hi>delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi>
of things, and ſets
downe the right way of
putting them into execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>The <hi>contemplative part</hi>
is called the <hi>minde (or the
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:13463:311"/>
principall part of the ſoule)</hi>
and the <hi>active part</hi> is ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<hi>reaſon.</hi> The one is
likewiſe called <hi>wiſdome,</hi>
and the other <hi>prudence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now every one that <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberates,</hi>
doth for this
cauſe <hi>deliberate,</hi> even for
that the <hi>choice</hi> of ſuch
things as are to be done, is
in his power; and to the
intent that hee might by
<hi>deliberation,</hi> make choice
of that which is moſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy;
and that after he hath
ſo choſen, he might exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
the ſame.</p>
            <p>It is therefore neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
that he which <hi>delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates</hi>
ſhould have power
over his owne deeds: for

               <pb n="567" facs="tcp:13463:311"/>
will be fruitleſſe
alſo unto him. And if
theſe things be ſo; it will
follow, by a neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence,
that whereſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>reaſon</hi> is planted, there
is likewiſe <hi>freewill.</hi> For
either he is no <hi>reaſonable-creature;</hi>
or elſe, if he be a
<hi>reaſonable-creature,</hi> he hath
<hi>power</hi> over the beginnings
of his owne actions; and
in having that <hi>power,</hi> hath
alſo <hi>freewill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It hath beene declared <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
alſo, that things compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
of a <hi>materiall ſubject,</hi>
have a <hi>mutability</hi> in them;
out of which (together
with what hath been ſaid
before) it may bee infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that there muſt, of
neceſſity, be in <hi>man</hi> both
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:13463:312"/>
               <hi>freewill,</hi> and <hi>mutability.
Mutability,</hi> becauſe hee is
made of <hi>matter;</hi> and <hi>free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will,</hi>
becauſe he is indued
with <hi>reaſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whoſoever therefore
findes fault with <hi>God,</hi> for
that hee did not ſo make
man at the firſt, that hee
might not fall unto <hi>vice,</hi>
but gave him his owne
<hi>choice:</hi> Surely, thoſe men
are not aware, that they
reprove GOD for making
man <hi>reaſonable,</hi> and not
rather an <hi>unreaſonable-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For one of theſe two is
unavoidably neceſſary.
Either <hi>man</hi> ſhould have
beene made <hi>void of reaſon;</hi>
or elſe being indued with
<hi>reaſon,</hi> and exerciſed in
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:13463:312"/>
action, hee muſt have in
him <hi>freewill.</hi> Yea, and
thereupon it followes alſo
of neceſſity, that every
<hi>nature</hi> endued with <hi>reaſon,</hi>
hath <hi>freewill,</hi> and is <hi>muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
of his <hi>owne nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But thoſe <hi>natures</hi> have
eſpecially a <hi>mutability</hi> in
them which are made of a
<hi>materiall ſubject;</hi> aſwell in
reſpect that they were
<hi>made,</hi> as in regard they
were made of <hi>matter:</hi>
whereas thoſe <hi>natures</hi>
which were not made of
<hi>matter</hi> (as the ſubject)
have <hi>mutability</hi> in them,
but in one reſpect onely;
namely, in that they were
<hi>made.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, ſo many of
thoſe <hi>immateriall natures</hi>
               <pb n="570" facs="tcp:13463:313"/>
as were converſant in
earthly matters, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termedled
with ſuch infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
things, as are to bee
done, by reaſon of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating
with <hi>men;</hi> by
ſo much they became
more <hi>mutable</hi> then others
<hi>(of that immateriall nature)</hi>
And ſo many of them as
directed the excellency of
their nature, to approach
neare unto <hi>God,</hi> with an
inclination to love him;
and to enjoy a bleſſed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
in the minding and
fruition of him; ſo ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
themſelves inward,
and unto GOD only, that
they wholly eſtranged
themſelves from <hi>outward,</hi>
and <hi>materiall things.</hi> Thoſe
(by that meanes) became
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:13463:313"/>
ſo familiar with <hi>contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
and with GOD, that
they ſtill remaine without
<hi>mutation.</hi> Having a <hi>free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will,</hi>
in that they are indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with <hi>reaſon;</hi> and yet
are not now ſubject unto
<hi>alteration,</hi> for the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
cauſes.</p>
            <p>And this need not bee
wondred at. For even
thoſe men alſo, which
give themſelves to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation,</hi>
and ſeque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
themſelves from the
inordinate love, and med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in worldly affaires,
doe and may attaine unto
an immutable condition,
<hi>(and unto an eſtate of grace,
from which there is no fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
away.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I doe ſuppoſe,
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:13463:314"/>
that this (with what was
formerly ſaid) hath ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
proved, that in the
<hi>beginning,</hi> all the <hi>reaſonable
creatures</hi> were created in
ſo excellent a condition,
that if they had remained
ſuch as they were made,
they ſhould have beene
void of all <hi>vice,</hi> and that
their <hi>vitiouſneſſe (who have
been corrupted)</hi> came unto
them by their owne <hi>will.</hi>
For it ſo falleth out, that
they who remaine in the
condition wherein they
were placed by their crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
are ſetled in a moſt
bleſſed eſtate.</p>
            <p>Of <hi>incorporeall natures,
Angels</hi> alone have beene
altered: yet not all of
them: but ſome part;
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:13463:314"/>
even ſo many onely, as
creeping <hi>doneward</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
from that inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which they had to
ſupreame things, and the
contemplation of GOD.</p>
            <p>It is made plaine by the
things afore proved, that
the powers of our <hi>will</hi> are
<hi>mutable;</hi> becauſe we are of
a <hi>mutable</hi> nature: And
yet no man can blame
GOD, as if hee were the
cauſe that we are evill, in
regard the <hi>faculties</hi> are
<hi>mutable,</hi> which he gave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us.</p>
            <p>For <hi>vices</hi> conſiſt not in
our <hi>faculties<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> but in <hi>habits;</hi>
and our <hi>habits</hi> depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our <hi>will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the fault of our <hi>will,</hi>
that we are evill, and not
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:13463:315"/>
               <hi>(originally)</hi> of our <hi>nature.</hi>
But our meaning ſhall be
more plainly underſtood
by this that followes.</p>
            <p>Wee have ſaid hereto
fore, that a <hi>faculty</hi> is a
power whereby we are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to put in execution
whatſoever we doe. And
in all the <hi>faculties</hi> belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
to our <hi>choice,</hi> the
ſelf-ſame concerneth both
the <hi>contraries</hi> (as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample)
there is the ſame
<hi>faculty</hi> of <hi>lying,</hi> and of
<hi>ſpeaking truth;</hi> one and
the ſame faculty of <hi>tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi>
and <hi>wantonneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it cannot bee, that
in contrary things there
ſhould be the ſame <hi>habit;</hi>
as in <hi>wantonneſſe</hi> and <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance;</hi>
or in <hi>lying,</hi> and
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:13463:315"/>
               <hi>ſpeaking truth;</hi> becauſe of
<hi>contrary things,</hi> the <hi>habits</hi>
are contrary. For the <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit</hi>
which concernes <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance,</hi>
belongeth to <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue:</hi>
but all <hi>intemperance</hi>
is of <hi>vice;</hi> and therefore
the <hi>vices</hi> doe not depend
upon the <hi>faculties,</hi> which
are in us; but upon our
<hi>habits,</hi> and our <hi>will:</hi> And
it is not a <hi>faculty,</hi> which
maketh us <hi>wantons,</hi> or <hi>ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars,</hi>
but our <hi>will.</hi> For if
we <hi>would,</hi> we might ſpeak
the <hi>truth,</hi> and not <hi>lye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seeing then, <hi>vice</hi> is not
a <hi>faculty,</hi> but a <hi>habit; God</hi>
is not cauſe of our naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe,
which giveth us
the <hi>faculty;</hi> but a <hi>habit</hi> (is
cauſe thereof) which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in us, proceedeth from
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:13463:316"/>
our ſelves, and by our
ſelves, &amp; for our ſelves.
For if wee would endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
thereafter, we might
inſtead of an <hi>evill-habit,</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
unto the contrary
thereof.</p>
            <p>Now a <hi>faculty</hi> doth
herein differ from a <hi>habit;</hi>
all <hi>faculties</hi> are naturall,
but <hi>habits</hi> are procured by
uſe. Yea; and here alſo
they differ; our <hi>faculties</hi>
are in us <hi>without teaching,</hi>
and <hi>our habits</hi> are gotten
by <hi>learning,</hi> and <hi>cuſtome.</hi>
If therefore the <hi>faculties</hi>
that are in us, be naturall,
and without teaching; and
the <hi>habits</hi> gotten by uſe
and learning; then it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be that our <hi>(originall)
nature</hi> ſhould be the cauſe
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:13463:316"/>
our wickedneſſe; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
our <hi>evill education,</hi>
whereby wee have gotten
an <hi>evill habit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For that our <hi>habits</hi>
come unto us by <hi>cuſtome,</hi>
it hath beene already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared;
and that our <hi>facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
are in us by <hi>nature,</hi> it is
evident by this; that all
men have the ſame <hi>facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
(except thoſe which
are ſomeway maimed or
lame.) And that the <hi>habits</hi>
are not naturall, is as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
by this, that all have
not the ſame <hi>habits;</hi> but
ſome of them <hi>habits</hi> of
one ſort, and ſome of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
whereas things that
are <hi>naturall,</hi> are found in

in <hi>our power,</hi> that we ſpeak
next of <hi>Providence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We will divide our <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe</hi>
into three parts; the
firſt, proving <hi>that there is a
Providence;</hi> the ſecond,
ſhewing <hi>what Providence
is;</hi> and the third, <hi>What
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:13463:318"/>
things belong unto Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Iewes,</hi> unleſſe
they be mad, they cannot
be ignorant that there is a
<hi>Providence,</hi> knowing the
wonders which GOD
wrought in <hi>Aegypt;</hi> and
hearing of thoſe things
which hapned unto their
Fathers in the <hi>wilderneſſe;</hi>
wherein moſt manifeſt
viſions of <hi>Providence</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
more clearly unto
them, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by thoſe things
which wee now ſee with
our eyes. And they had
alſo many evide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t proofes
that things were done by
<hi>Providence,</hi> both in their
<hi>Prophets,</hi> and in their <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byloniſh
captivity,</hi> which
leave not any juſt occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:13463:318"/>
for them, to be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
of the ſame. As for
the <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> they have
not onely all thoſe things
which hapned unto the
<hi>Iews,</hi> to preach unto them
that there is a <hi>Providence;</hi>
but alſo that admirable
work of <hi>Providence,</hi> above
all other moſt divine,
which containeth in it
that exceeding great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
towards man, which
paſſeth common beliefe;
I meane, that GOD ſhould
take unto him a <hi>Body</hi> for
our ſakes.</p>
               <p>But ſeeing wee muſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
reaſon the matter, not
with ſuch onely, but alſo
with <hi>heathen men.</hi> Wee
will therefore endeavour
to prove there is a <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
                  <pb n="582" facs="tcp:13463:319"/>
by ſuch other things
as are alſo in credit with
them. And that there is a
<hi>Providence,</hi> may be proved
by thoſe argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we prove that there is
a <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For concerning the
continuance of things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and eſpecially ſuch as are
ſubject to <hi>generation,</hi> and
<hi>corruption;</hi> and the ſcitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and order of all
things that are, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
preſerved after one
maner; and the courſe of
the Starres nothing alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
at any time; and the
circuit of the yeare, and
the returne of the ſeaſon
of the yeare; and the
equality both of the night
and of the dayes of the
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:13463:319"/>
yeare, ſo that either of
them is both increaſed
and diminiſhed in the

how might all this conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
under ſo conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
a <hi>government,</hi> if it had
none to rule it by his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which follow ſin;
or (which is of more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port)
the detecting of
<hi>murthers,</hi> and offences

bewrayed <hi>(when there
is no witneſſe of the deed)</hi> by
ſome circumſtances; doe
ſhew that there is a <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Both the Scriptures of
the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> and the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of the <hi>Heathen,</hi> are
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:13463:320"/>
full of ſtories to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
Of this nature is
that which is written of
<hi>Suſanna:</hi> and in prophane

the ſame purpoſe of <hi>Ibicus</hi>
the <hi>Poet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For, when this <hi>Poet</hi> was

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d by certaine
ruffians, where none were
in preſence, either to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
him, or beare witneſſe
of the aſſault which they
made upon him; he ſeeing
<hi>Cranes</hi> not far from him,
cryed out and ſaid, oh yee
<hi>Cranes,</hi> be you revengers
of this murther.</p>
               <p>And ſo it fell out, that
when the Magiſtrates of
the City where he lived,
endeavoured to ſeeke out
the committers of that
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:13463:320"/>
murther, and could not
finde them: The people
being aſſembled together
into a common place for
that intent; the <hi>Cranes</hi>
flew over them; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>murtherers</hi> eſpying
them, laughed outright,
and ſaid, loe, where they
flie that ſhould revenge
the death of <hi>Ibicus:</hi> which
being overheard by one
that ſate next unto them,
and declared to the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates,</hi>
the ſaid murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
were thereupon exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,
and confeſſed the
fact.</p>
               <p>There be very many of
ſuch like things, recorded
by ancient writers, which
if a man ſhould collect to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
would enlarge this
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:13463:321"/>
                  <hi>Treatiſe</hi> to an infinite
length.</p>
               <p>And though all offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
be not deſcried; but,
that ſome do quite eſcape
the publike ſtroke of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice;
yet let no man for
that cauſe deny that there
is a <hi>Providence.</hi> For the
<hi>Providence</hi> of GOD,
taketh care of men, (and
brings the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance)
not one way alone; but
after divers and ſundry
maners.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure,
and proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
knitting together of
thoſe <hi>bodies,</hi> which are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
unto generation, and
corruption, and there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
kept alwaies alike <hi>(ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their ſeverall
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:13463:321"/>
kinds)</hi> is not the leaſt argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
proving that there is
a <hi>Providence,</hi> ſeeing the
great care <hi>(and wiſedome)</hi>
of divine <hi>Providence</hi> is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
manifeſt in every part
of the <hi>body;</hi> as they who
will take paines to peruſe
them, may learne out of
thoſe many <hi>Treatiſes,</hi>
which are made upon that
ſubject. Yea, the varieties
which are in the <hi>colours</hi> of
living-creatures, and their
keeping alwayes the ſame
comely mixture and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion,
are proofes of a
<hi>Providence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And among ſuch things <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/>
as are generally confeſſed
by all men, one evident
proofe declaring there is
a <hi>Providence,</hi> is that uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:13463:322"/>
conſent of men in
all times, and of all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that wee ought to
ſerve GOD, both by <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi>
and <hi>Oblations.</hi> For if
there were not a <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
to governe the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires
of this world, who
would <hi>pray?</hi> or to whom
ſhould we make our peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?</p>
               <p>Moreover, that earneſt
deſire which is in us, to
do good unto others (and
which they naturally, and
very diligently endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
whoſe mindes are
not perverted) is a plaine
demonſtration that there
is a <hi>Providence.</hi> For ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
received a benefit
which we are not able to
recompence, wee are the
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:13463:322"/>
more deſirous to be ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
helpfull to them, who
are not able to requite us
for the ſame.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Providence</hi> were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away, then every
man ſhould be permitted
to be injurious, according
to the power hee hath to
doe wrong. There would
alſo be no giving of <hi>almes,</hi>
nor any <hi>feare</hi> of GOD a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
men; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall
<hi>vertue</hi> and <hi>piety</hi>
would be quite rooted
out. For if GOD had not
a provident care of every
thing; neither did puniſh
<hi>evill-doers;</hi> nor encourage
thoſe that were <hi>well-diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed</hi>
nor defended <hi>innocents</hi>
from oppreſſion; Who
would worſhip GOD? or
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:13463:323"/>
who would ſerve him,
that could be no way pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
unto them?</p>
               <p>If there bee no <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi>
all <hi>prophecies,</hi> and
the <hi>fore-knowledge</hi> of
things, are likewiſe over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne.
But even thoſe
things which happen out
before our eyes, almoſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
day, are manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the ſame: For,
GOD often appeareth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us in our neceſſities <hi>(by
ſupplying our wants in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected
maner)</hi> many have
beene cured of their infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
by that which
hath beene revealed unto
them in <hi>dreames;</hi> many
<hi>predictions</hi> of things to
come have beene truely
uttered in all ages. And
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:13463:323"/>
many who have embrued
their hands in innocent
blood, or committed ſuch
like heynous offences,
have been horribly terrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
night and day.</p>
               <p>From the <hi>goodneſſe</hi> of
<hi>God,</hi> his <hi>Providence</hi> may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
be inferred; for hee is
the moſt excellent Good;
and as he is <hi>good,</hi> he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
to bee <hi>good</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall
to others; and if
he be inclined to be bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall
to others, he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable
alſo, to have a
<hi>Providence</hi> over others.</p>
               <p>What need I ſpeake
here of thoſe workes
which belong unto the
<hi>Creation?</hi> of their <hi>propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi>
of their <hi>harmony?</hi>
of their <hi>ſcituation?</hi> of their
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:13463:324"/>
                  <hi>order?</hi> or of the uſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
every thing ſerveth
in the whole world? ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all things may evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
appeare to have
beene perfected in ſuch
maner, that nothing
ſhould have been in good
plight, if it had beene o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
then it is now:
and that nothing can well
be added, nor any thing
be conveniently wanting
in any of thoſe things
which were made tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowout
the world: For,
both by <hi>wiſdome,</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,</hi>
all things therein
were created in a comely

fall into that overſight
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:13463:325"/>
whereinto thoſe <hi>writers</hi>
have ſlipped; who extoll
GOD's <hi>creation</hi> inſtead of
his <hi>Providence;</hi> when his
<hi>Providence</hi> was their
<hi>Theme.</hi> For though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<hi>Creation</hi> gives us an
occaſion to treat of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence;</hi>
yet ſo great is the
difference betwixt them,
that they are farre from
being <hi>one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is the worke of <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
to make well thoſe

to conſerve and take
care for ſuch things. And
theſe two are not alwayes
altogether in one; as wee

<pb n="595" facs="tcp:13463:325"/>
ſome when they have

which they have made; as

and the <hi>makers</hi> of other
<hi>handy-craft workes:</hi> and

but <hi>provide,</hi> and take care

               </p>
               <p>Theſe things conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
it will become us,
when we treat of <hi>Creation,</hi>
to ſhew that all the things
which were <hi>made,</hi> were
exceeding <hi>well-made:</hi> and
to declare when we come
to ſpeake of <hi>Providence,</hi>
that God was diligent in
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:13463:326"/>
the preſervation of thoſe
things which he had well
created.</p>
               <p>By this <hi>providence</hi> it
comes to paſſe, that <hi>men</hi>
beget <hi>men,</hi> that <hi>beaſts</hi> are
engendred of <hi>beaſts;</hi> and
that every thing ſprings
from his owne, and not
from any ſtrange ſeed.
And whoſoever ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verre,
that every thing (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

but confeſſe alſo, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a thing is <hi>created,</hi> there
muſt be alwayes a <hi>provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
to governe the ſame.
For in that the thing <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>
proceedeth on in a

manifeſted, that together
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:13463:326"/>

               <p>Whoſoever beholds the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
                  <hi>viſages</hi> of men, to bee ſo

and if he well conſider the

by whom ſo many diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
and diſtinct features
and countenances, were
brought forth.</p>
               <p>For if our <hi>viſages</hi> ſhould
be all of the ſame forme

a confuſion would there
follow? In how much

nor be able to diſcern

               </p>
               <p>Moreover, if this had

ſhould have been forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den

theſe inconveniences

a variety in the viſages of
men, <hi>alwayes,</hi> in <hi>all places,</hi>
and at <hi>all times.</hi> And it is

prove that this <hi>providence</hi>
extendeth unto every <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular;</hi>
in that every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
man is known one

For mans viſage is not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/>
the onely marke whereby
we may diſcerne him; but
(as if that were not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough)
<hi>providence</hi> hath
added another diſtinction
for our more advantage;
even the diverſity of <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours</hi>
alſo, to the intent
that the weakneſſe of our
nature might bee aſſiſted
divers wayes: And I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
likewiſe, that many
of thoſe living-creatures,
which in their generall
kinde, have in appearance
but one <hi>ſhape</hi> (and <hi>colour)</hi>
as <hi>Dawes</hi> and <hi>Crowes;</hi> yet
there may be certaine vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
differences, <hi>whereby
they might bee diſtinguiſhed
by good heed;</hi> and whereby
they diſcerne each other
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:13463:329"/>
when they ſhould couple
together. For though ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>Dawes</hi> and <hi>Crowes</hi> bee
gathered together in one

they diſcerne each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;

<hi>female</hi> know their owne
<hi>mate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But how could they
know each other, if every

proper diſtinction in the

might be well enough diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, through a

               <p>Laſtly, the <hi>ſignes,</hi> and

               <p>This Chapter declares, what
Providence is; and that
it is neceſſary &amp; conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent

both by arguments
already produced, and by
others which wee ſhall
have occaſion to mention
hereafter: wee will now
therefore, declare what
<hi>providence</hi> is.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Providence</hi> is a heedfull
proviſion for all things, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from <hi>GOD. Some
thus define it.</hi> Providence
is the will of <hi>GOD,</hi> whereby
all created things receive a
government fit for them.</p>
            <p>Now if Providence be
the <hi>will</hi> of GOD, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
that all things
ſhould be ordered as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably,
as excellently,
and as decently as the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the <hi>God-head</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires;
which is after ſo
good and perfect a maner
<pb n="605" facs="tcp:13463:330"/>
as that nothing may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
receive a better or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:
For neither is it a
thing of good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequence
nor agreeable to decency,
that one ſhould make
things, and another take
the care of their <hi>preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
and <hi>government;</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it were but an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of weakneſs to have
it ſo.</p>
            <p>Many types and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
of that which
we have ſaid, are ingraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed
in <hi>living-creatures:</hi>
For every thing which
<hi>breedeth</hi> ought, provides
food alſo for the thing
bred thereby; and <hi>man</hi>
provides for all other
things alſo, belonging to
the life of him whom hee
<pb n="606" facs="tcp:13463:331"/>
hath begotten, ſo far forth
as his ability doth extend.
And all creatures which
make not proviſion for
their young, doe therefore
not make it, becauſe their
weakneſſe is a hinderance
thereunto.</p>
            <p>Therefore it is truely
declared, that GOD is he
whoſe <hi>Providence</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
all: and that <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
is the <hi>will</hi> of GOD.</p>

whether in things <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall,</hi>
or things <hi>particular,</hi> or

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plato</hi> affirmes that it
hath government both of
<hi>univerſall,</hi> and <hi>particular
things;</hi> and he divideth his
diſcourſe of <hi>providence</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
three parts. The firſt
<pb n="608" facs="tcp:13463:332"/>
he calls the <hi>providence</hi> of
the firſt and ſupreameſt
GOD, and that this <hi>provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
is eſpecially over
the IDEAE <hi>(that is, the moſt
beautifull formes of things:)</hi>
and in the next place, over
the whole <hi>world in general,</hi>
as, over the <hi>heavens,</hi> the
<hi>ſtars,</hi> and all <hi>generall things;</hi>
even over the predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of <hi>ſubſtance, quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>

like: yea, and over all
things which are eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
contained under thoſe
<hi>predicaments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His opinion likewiſe is,
that the <hi>providence</hi> of a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
degree of <hi>gods,</hi>
which (as he conceiveth)
turne about the Sphaeres;
hath rule over the ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring

of all the baſer <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving-creatures,</hi>
&amp; of <hi>plants,</hi>
and of all things which are
ſubject unto <hi>generation,</hi>
and <hi>corruption.</hi> Yea, and
<hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelfe aſcribes
the ingendring of ſuch
things, to the <hi>Sun,</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>Zodiack circle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which according
to <hi>Plato's</hi> opinion, is the
<hi>third providence,</hi> hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie
over the <hi>events</hi>
and <hi>ends</hi> of thoſe things
which are begun or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
by us; as alſo over
the <hi>courſe</hi> and condition
of <hi>mans life;</hi> and over all
thoſe <hi>naturall</hi> and <hi>materiall
things;</hi> and over ſuch as
are called <hi>inſtrument all
things,</hi> whether they bee
<hi>good</hi> or <hi>evill.</hi> And the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
<pb n="610" facs="tcp:13463:333"/>
agents in this <hi>provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi>
he ſuppoſed to bee

ordained to bee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
converſant upon
the <hi>earth,</hi> and to have the
charge over thoſe things
which men doe.</p>
               <p>But hee affirmes that
the <hi>ſecond</hi> and the <hi>third
providence</hi> alſo, have their
whole eſſence from the
<hi>firſt;</hi> ſo that all things are
in effect, governed by the
power of the <hi>chiefeſt God,</hi>
who ordained the <hi>firſt,</hi> the
<hi>ſecond,</hi> and the <hi>third,</hi> to be
employed in the well-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering,
and governing of
things.</p>
               <p>Now this is praiſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
in <hi>Plato,</hi> that he refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
all unto GOD, and
<pb n="611" facs="tcp:13463:333"/>
affirmes all <hi>providence</hi> to
depend upon his <hi>will.</hi> But
whereas he ſayes there is
a <hi>ſecond providence,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
unto thoſe which
turne the heavens about
<hi>(as he hath ſaid)</hi> we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
him not in ſo affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.
For <hi>(if any ſuch
were)</hi> that which they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
is not a worke of
<hi>providence;</hi> but rather, a
worke of <hi>neceſsity,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
they were deſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
For, let them be figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
how they will, it muſt
neceſſarily follow, that
things muſt both be done
as they were done; and
that they might not be in
any other maner then
they are. And I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
ſhewed, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="612" facs="tcp:13463:334"/>
done by <hi>providence,</hi>
is ſubject unto <hi>neceſsity.</hi>

it is no wonder if they

               <p>
                  <hi>Euripides,</hi> and <hi>Menan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
have in ſome places
affirmed, that the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
parts of the <hi>minde,</hi>
which is in every man,
doth by <hi>providence</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne
each man, and no
GOD at all. But the <hi>minde</hi>
is converſant in thoſe
things onely which are in
<pb n="617" facs="tcp:13463:336"/>
                  <hi>our power;</hi> and they are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in <hi>actions which may

<hi>providence</hi> is buſied in
things which are not in

               </p>
               <p>For the workes of <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
are evident: and if a

puniſhed, and ſometime
let goe without puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
here is that perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
either to the <hi>minde,</hi>
or unto <hi>nature (as it is unto

will affirme that things
<pb n="618" facs="tcp:13463:337"/>
belonging to <hi>nature,</hi> and
unto the <hi>minde,</hi> are perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
unto <hi>providence;</hi> and
that things which follow
upon the choice of the
<hi>minde,</hi> and operations of
<hi>nature,</hi> doe afterward be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long

being granted, all that
ſhould bee in our power,
would be quite over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne.</p>
               <p>But the matter is not at
that point. For (as hath
beene already declared)
every thing belonging
unto the <hi>minde</hi> (whether
it be for <hi>practiſe</hi> or <hi>contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation)</hi>
is all in <hi>our power.</hi>
Neither doe all things
which are contained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>providence,</hi> belong to
<hi>nature;</hi> though every thing
<pb n="619" facs="tcp:13463:337"/>
belonging to <hi>nature,</hi> is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
by <hi>providence.</hi> For
many things wrought by

declared in diſcovering
the <hi>murtherer;</hi> neither is
<hi>nature</hi> in all points, the

though it be (as indeed it

And therefore theſe men

foreſaw alſo, that the <hi>rich,
man</hi> would be grievous to
others in the want of <hi>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi>
(by committing rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beries,

ſuffered him to enjoy <hi>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Poverty</hi> hath been ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

in making us to beare the

more contentedneſſe; and
in preventing the vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which might happen
by wicked ſervants; and
perhaps their lives would
have beene more bitter to
us then their deaths, if our

wicked; or if wee ſhould

<pb n="628" facs="tcp:13463:342"/>
ſervants. We foreſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nothing that is to
come; but beholding only
the things preſent, cannot
judge rightly of that
which may fall out; but
unto GOD all future
things are as evident as
thoſe which are preſent.</p>
               <p>Thus much wee have
ſpoken againſt thoſe who

GODS <hi>providence;</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
whom this part of

<hi>Shall the clay ſay to

that he who dares not

lawes to GOD, and
<pb n="629" facs="tcp:13463:342"/>
object againſt the workes
of his <hi>providence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But we will forbeare to
meddle further with ſuch
extravagancies, (or to
ſpeake more properly,
with ſuch impieties) and
proceed in diſproving
them, who ſay, that <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
things</hi> are not gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by any <hi>providence,</hi> and
yet allow that <hi>univerſall,</hi>
and <hi>generall things,</hi> are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
by a <hi>providence.</hi>
For no man can alleadge
more then theſe three
cauſes, to prove that there
is no providence of <hi>God</hi>
over <hi>particular things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Either it muſt bee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
GOD <hi>knoweth not

                  <hi>will not;</hi> or becauſe he <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not.</hi>
But nothing is more
eſtranged from that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<hi>Eſſence,</hi> then <hi>ignorance,</hi>
and <hi>unskilfulneſſe:</hi> For It
is <hi>knowledge,</hi> and <hi>ſcience,</hi>
and <hi>wiſdome it ſelfe.</hi> Nay,
there is none among men,
ſo ignorant (if he be in his
wits) but knowes, that if
all <hi>particular things</hi> ſhould
be deſtroyed, the <hi>generall
things</hi> could not poſſibly
conſiſt; ſeeing <hi>univerſall
things,</hi> are made up of <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</hi>
Yea, all the <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
things,</hi> and the <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
things</hi> are <hi>equall,</hi> and
<hi>converted,</hi> &amp; <hi>deſtroyed,</hi> and
<hi>preſerved</hi> together. If ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>particular things</hi> pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh,
the <hi>univerſall</hi> will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo

if no care were
taken of them from <hi>above.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now whereas to avoid

they ſpeake. And that is
no leſſe abſurd then the

               <p>For two other cauſes,
GODS <hi>providence</hi> is by

The one is, becauſe the

every one of thoſe <hi>indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dualls:</hi>
and extended more
infinitely then thoſe
things are, whereunto it
ſhould reach.</p>
               <p>And if this <hi>Providence</hi>
muſt be ſo fit, and ſo infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
in regard of the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
difference of <hi>indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dualls:</hi>
                  <pb n="648" facs="tcp:13463:352"/>
no doubt but the
<hi>reaſon</hi> and method of this
<hi>Providence</hi> is as <hi>infinite;</hi>
and if it be <hi>infinite,</hi> it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
poſſibly bee compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
by us. And it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
not us to deny that
gracious <hi>providence</hi> which
governes all things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
our <hi>ignorance</hi> is una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to comprehend it. For
thoſe things which wee
ſuppoſe to be amiſſe, are
knowne well enough un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the wiſdome of the <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator,</hi>
to be well <hi>ordered.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Becauſe wee are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of their occaſions, we
cauſeleſly judge many
things to be imprudently
done; and that which
chanceth unto us in other
things, by reaſon of our
<pb n="649" facs="tcp:13463:352"/>
ignorance, falleth out al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
in the workes of <hi>provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;</hi>
for we doe after the
ſame ſort co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceive of thoſe
things which belong to
<hi>providence;</hi> receiving by
obſcure likelihoods, and
by conjectures, certaine
<hi>formes</hi> or ſhadowes of the
workes thereof, by ſuch
things as we have ſeene.</p>
               <p>Wee ſay therefore, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/>
ſome things are done by
<hi>Gods permiſsion;</hi> and this
<hi>permiſsion</hi> is of many ſorts:
For he ſometime permits
that even the <hi>juſt man</hi>
ſhall fall into miſery, to
declare unto others, that
<hi>vertue</hi> which is concealed
as in <hi>Iob.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hee doth alſo permit
ſome abſurd things; that
<pb n="650" facs="tcp:13463:353"/>
by the act which appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
to bee abſurd, ſome
great and wonderfull mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
may bee brought to
paſſe, as <hi>the ſalvation of
men by the Croſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hee permits likewiſe
the bleſſed <hi>Saints</hi> to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
for another end; as
that they might not fall
from a ſincere conſcience,
and that the loftineſſe of
the minde might be aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
as when S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul was
buffetted by Satan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sometimes alſo, one
man is rejected, and left as
deſolate for a time; that
others conſidering his
caſe, might be inſtructed,
and amended thereby. As
in the example of <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
and the <hi>rich man;</hi> for,
<pb n="651" facs="tcp:13463:353"/>
when we ſee any man af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted,
our hearts are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
touched there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
according as <hi>Menan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
hath very well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed:
<q>
                     <l>By ſeeing others feele
the Rod,</l>
                     <l>We tremble with a fear
of GOD.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Otherwhile, again, one
man is afflicted for the
glory of another; and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for his owne ſin, nor
the ſinne of his Parents:
as, he that was blind from
his birth, for the glorify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the <hi>Son of man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is permitted alſo that
ſome ſhould be perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
to be a pattern of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy
unto others; and
that when their glory is
<pb n="652" facs="tcp:13463:354"/>
exalted, others might be
incouraged to ſuffer in
the like caſe, in hope of
the glory to come; and for
the bleſſedneſſe which is
expected after this life; as
in the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> and in
thoſe who have yeelded
up their lives for their

or for their <hi>maſters.</hi>

NOw, if any one thinke

that this life, is <hi>(not the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection

in reſpect of <hi>Vertue:</hi>
And the greater the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
and ſufferings are,
the more glorious Crown
of Glory ſhall be obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
becauſe the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence

Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to undergoe the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
afflictions and tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
which he ſuffered,
that he might obtain the
greater, and more perfect

can merit)</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the works of <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
are juſtly and very
decently performed.</p>
               <p>A man may the better
allow this to be ſo, (and
conceive that GOD go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns
all things, ſo well
and ſo fitly, that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of each thing cannot
more deſire) if he doe but
propoſe unto himſelf the
beleeving of theſe two
things which are general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="655" facs="tcp:13463:355"/>
confeſſed among men:
namely, that GOD, onely,
is <hi>good</hi> and <hi>wiſe:</hi> For, in
that he is <hi>Good,</hi> it is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
unto his <hi>goodneſſe</hi> to
employ his <hi>providence</hi>
over all things; and in that
he is <hi>wiſe,</hi> he hath a regard
to performe them wiſely
and exactly: becauſe, if he
uſed not his <hi>Providence,</hi> he
could not be <hi>good:</hi> and if
he did not uſe it <hi>well,</hi> hee
could not be <hi>wiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He therefore, that gives
his minde to conſider diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly
of theſe matters,
will not miſeſteem of any
thing which is wrought
by divine <hi>providence;</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſpeak evill thereof
without due examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
but rather accept of
<pb n="656" facs="tcp:13463:356"/>
all things, as exceeding
well performed: and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile
at their admirable
decency and perfection,
though the ignorant mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
judge according to
a falſe appearance: For
in conceiving otherwiſe,
wee bring upon our
heads (beſides the guilt of
blaſphemy) great blame
for our ſottiſh preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> Now, in that wee ſay,
<hi>all things are done well,</hi> wee
juſtifie not the naughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of <hi>men,</hi> or of ſuch
<hi>evill works</hi> as are in our
power to doe, or leave
undone; but, we ſpeak it
of the works of <hi>Providence</hi>
which are not in our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer.
For, if any man ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="657" facs="tcp:13463:356"/>
and ſay, How falls it
out that <hi>holy men</hi> are put
cruelly to death without
deſert? why, if they were
unjuſtly condemned, did
not Gods juſt <hi>providence</hi>
hinder thoſe murthers?
and if they deſerved to be
ſo put to death, why are
not they without blame
who cauſed them to bee
ſlaine?</p>
               <p>To this we anſwer, that
the murtherers of ſuch
men were injurious in
ſlaying them; and that
they which were ſo ſlain,
were ſlain either for their
deſert, or their profit
Somtime deſervingly, for
evills committed by them
in ſecret: and ſometimes
for their profit: Gods
<pb n="658" facs="tcp:13463:357"/>
providence, thereby pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
either future ſins,
or worſe miſchiefes to
come; and in thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
it was good for
them that their life ſhould
be ſhortned. Thus was
it with <hi>Socrates,</hi> and the
<hi>Saints.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, they who ſlew theſe
men, did not ſlay them
for any ſuch cauſe; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was it lawfully done;
but out of the corruption
of their owne minds, and
for gain and robbery: For,
the Act is in mans power;
but what ſhall follow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Act, (as whether
we ſhall be ſlain or no) is
not as he will: neither is
any death evill, except
for ſinne onely, as is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
<pb n="659" facs="tcp:13463:357"/>
by the death of the
<hi>Saints.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, wicked men, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they die in their
beds on a ſudden, and
without pain, doe never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe
die an evill <hi>death,</hi>
which brings them unto
an evill <hi>buriall:</hi> I meane,
to bee buried in their
ſinne; yet whoſoever
killeth any man murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly,
doth wickedly in
ſo doing.</p>
               <p>If hee killeth any one
for that which deſerveth
death; he is then to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
among <hi>hangmen</hi>
and <hi>executioners.</hi> If it be
for the gaining of ſome
profit by them that are
ſlaine, he is to be reputed
among cruell and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<pb n="660" facs="tcp:13463:358"/>
murtherers.</p>
               <p>The like may be ſaid of
them who murther their
enemies, or oppreſſe them
by extreame ſervitude, or
uſe any manner of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane
cruelty, againſt
them whom they have
overcome.</p>
               <p>They alſo are as little
to be juſtified, who ſeeke
the inriching of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
by extorting other
mens goods: for, though
it may be expedient for
thoſe, from whom they
were extorted, that they
ſhould be deprived of
them; yet, they which
wreſted away more then
their owne, were <hi>unjuſt,</hi>
in ſo ſo doing. For, they
take them out of a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous

deſire of thoſe good,
and not for that it was
