            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

EPISTLE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ince the Impression of Plays, is so
much the Practice of the Age,
that few or none have been Acted,
which fail to be display'd in Print; where
they seem to put on the greater formality of
Authors, while perhaps thus appearing, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested
of the life of Action, which gave no
small varnish to their figures, they suffer a
more severe Correction from the Reader:
Notwithstanding which disadvantage, I
have Adventur'd to be Companion in the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
of this Poem. And indeed I think it
some impudence to hazard the Reader's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
less Gentle than Spectators; the Press
being in some manner the Stages Tyring-House,
<pb facs="tcp:98946:3"/>
where all Ornaments are thrown off,
save native design and Language. And if
this Poem, either for Gravety or weight of
Argument, or deepness of <hi>Intreque</hi> (the
true Soul and Genius of the Stage) has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
(when Represented there) any grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Acceptation from the Judicious, who
pass few Enormities undiscerned, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
best able to take Plays in their highest
Magnitudes, to them I am obliged to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
it thus published. Not insensible what
disadvantage it may receive, passing in the
World on naked feet of verse, with other
Works that have their measures adored
with Trappings of Rhime, which how'ere
they have succeeded in wit or design, is still
thought musick, as the Heroick Tone now
goes: But whether so natural to a Play,
(that should most nearly imitate, in some
Cases our familiar Converse) the Judicious
may easily determine. But here I would not
be thought to detract from any that have
been Considerably welcom'd on the Stage in
<pb facs="tcp:98946:3"/>
this Garbe; since many Excellent Pens,
and Honourable Persons, have thought fit
to spend some Treasure of their Muses in
Compositions of this kind. The other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
which deserves some Reflection;
and which far more debases the Dignity of
the Stage, is that of <hi>Farce</hi> or <hi>Scommatick</hi>
Plays, which has so tickled some la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diences,
with I know not what kind of Jollity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that true <hi>Comedy</hi> is fool'd out of Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
and instead of Humor and wit, (the
Stages most Legitimate issue) leaves it to
the inheritance of Changlings. No less
Articke seems to many, the wresting in of
Dances, when unnatural and improper to
the business of the Scene and Plot, as if by
an unintelligable Charm of their Muses, the
Actors were like Faires Conjur'd up, that
the Play might vanish in a Dance. Yet
least I seem too much to carp at the delights
of others, (since Plays are but Diversions
in what kind soever understood) I willingly
wave this unnecessary Excursion; desiring
<pb facs="tcp:98946:4"/>
the Reader to think it meant rather an
Apology for my own: In respect it had not
this kind entertainment, and not a violent
Stemming against the Tide of Applause,
that so favourably has brought Plays of this
sort of Trimming, and Lading to an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor
on the Stage, where I leave them to
their Spectators, as I do this here to the
Readers impartial Reception,</p>

            <l>They may be Reviv'd, to be punish'd here.</l>
            <l>As now this Play, by some such Magick Call</l>
            <l>Has rais'd a bold Usurper up, to Fall.</l>
            <l>And if I may advise you Gentlemen,</l>
            <l>Faith let him live, if but to dye agen.</l>
            <l>His Crime was horrid, and it is not fit,</l>
            <l>One death of the Usurper Expiate it:</l>
            <l>Let him dye often, He's content that way,</l>
            <l>Still to be punish'd, so you'l spare the Play</l>
            <l>Which by our Authors aim was meant to be</l>
            <l>Here, a Record of all such Loyalty;</l>
            <l>That after long Contests, did safely bring,</l>
            <l>Subjects to Rights, and to his Throne our King.</l>
