            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

if they can wreſt any place of Scripture, though it be contrary to

                  <p>That Kingdoms and Common-wealths have their periods and
downfalls,<note place="margin">Propoſition 3.</note> is a concluſion which the premiſes of all former ages

more have numbred their years: and at this day have no ſtronger
fence then Paper walls, to keep their names from oblivion, the
great enemie of antiquitie. Now for the true cauſe of their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions,
it is a truth, which the greateſt wizards of this world,
after much ſtudy, and many ſerious conſultations with nature,
could never finde out. The <hi>Epicures</hi> attribute it to Fortune, the
<hi>Stoicks</hi> to Deſtinie, the <hi>Pythagorians</hi> to numbers. Which laſt
opinion <hi>Plato</hi> made ſuch reckoning of, that he will have numbers
to be the ſole cauſe of the tranſmutations of Common-wealths.
Whoſe words be ſo Aenigmatical, that <hi>Tullie</hi> makes them a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb,<note place="margin">Plato lib. 8. de rep. Cicer. lib. 7</note>

what vertue doth he attribute to 7. or 9. or 12. and their

have been hitherto in account, adding or detracting years at his

(for the Heavens in his opinion are unmoveable) but by the earth,
which he will have to be continually wheeled about, to be the

they groped in the dark, they miſſed their mark, as the <hi>Sodomites</hi>

he comes himſelfe <hi>in a ſoft voice,</hi> the gratious and ſweet promiſes

held out a Lamp, proclaiming a pardon to as many as would yeild

it is ſtoried of <hi>Tamberlain</hi> the <hi>Scythian,</hi> that whenſoever hee

continued untill the third day, then came out his black flagg, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacing
utter ruine and deſolations; this is Gods method. Firſt
he ſets out his white flagg of peace; if this be not regarded, then
comes his red flagge of correction, though not of deſtruction: if
this will take no place with them, then he ſets out his black flagge,

which my Prophet as I ſuppoſe meaneth, by <hi>executing of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
and <hi>ſeeking of the Truth,</hi> is like an Almanack out of date,
every man hath found out a new way, both to maintain and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his eſtate, this old way is too farre about. The bloud-ſucking
Uſurer, inſtead of lending and expecting nothing again, a leſſon
which our Saviour would have him to take out, if hee look for
the true treaſure, doth eat and conſume his needy Brother, even
as <hi>Pharaohs</hi> lean and il-favoured Kine devoured the other. This is
the way he taketh to ſupport his houſe, God loves not ſuch an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmetician
as ſpendeth his whole ſtudy about <hi>Multiplication,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Regula falſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis.</note> and the <hi>Rule of falſhood,</hi> and can never learn, the <hi>practiſe</hi> of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
The Lawyer who ſhould employ his beſt knowledge in
untying the knots of the law, and ſhould be an <hi>Atropos</hi> to cut off
the thread of controverſies between man and man: feedeth his
Client with golden hopes, and ſugred words, and in the meane
time like <hi>Lacheſis</hi> draweth in length the thread of contention, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
unneceſſary delayes, and poſting off the matters from Court
to Court, Tearm to Tearm, year to year, not unlike the cogging
Surgeon, who in hope of greater gain doth poyſon the wound,
that it may be longer in curing, or (if I may uſe a homely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon)
like the waggiſh Boy in the ſtreets, who when he ſeeth
two dogs ſnarling and grinning one at another for a bone, is never
at reſt till (for his own pleaſure, but little for their profit) hee hath
brought them <hi>à rictu ad morſum,</hi> to trie their right by their teeth,
till at length the weaker be enforced to reſigne up his right to the
ſtronger: this is a principall plot to maintain his eſtate.</p>
                  <p>The Citizen that liveth on his trade, is like to the idolatrous
Jewes in the Pſalmiſt, which worſhip the Images of <hi>Canaan;
Canaan</hi> ſignifieth a Merchant, and what is the Merchants Image
(ſaith <hi>Luther</hi>) but <hi>Denarius</hi> the Croſſe. This hee maketh ſuch
reckoning of, as that he careth not for making ſhipwrack, not of
a craſed, woodden veſſel, but of a good conſcience, ſo that he may
obtain it: hee ſelleth dayes and months, and years at a higher
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57497:25"/>
rate then his beſt ſtuffes; if his wares be too light, falſe ballances
muſt make up the weight, if too bad, too dear, a falſe oath muſt
mkae amends for both. The countrey Landlord (for though I
ſpeak in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> yet I do not doubt but ſome of every quarter
of <hi>Judah</hi> doth hear mee, whom the Lord hath endowed with am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

ſerve his turne, he farmeth out his livings (eſpecially in ſuch a

where he may live with much eaſe, little charges, and ſmall cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,

that a Papiſt ſhall live peaceably with us, and performe true
and ſincere obedience towards our Prince. To whom <hi>I</hi> might returne
the ſhort anſwer of the <hi>Lacones</hi> to their adverſary, <hi>Si:</hi> if it were ſo, my
ſpeech was not to no purpoſe, becauſe not only rebels to the King, but,
much more to God and his true worſhip and ſervice, are to be rooted
out of a Chriſtian commonwealth. And if thoſe be worthy a ſharpe
cenſure which agreeing with us in the fundamental points of Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
cannot away with the <hi>carved worke of our Temple,</hi> but cut it
downe as it were with Axes and Hammers, how much more thoſe <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballats</hi>
and <hi>Tobiahs,</hi> that ſtrike at the foundation thereof, and ſay of
it, as did the children of <hi>Edom in the day of Jeruſalem, down with
it, down with it, even to the ground.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I rather ſay, <hi>O ſi, I</hi> wiſh it were ſo, and that there were no
feare of danger by their meanes and deviſes. But this I doubt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be effected, unleſſe there be, I will not ſay with the Oratour, a
<hi>wall,</hi> but a <hi>ſea</hi> between them and us. Till then there is as great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
of peace between us, as there was of old time between the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks
and the Donatiſts, the Orthodoxall and the Arians, the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes
and the Aegyptians, the Iewes and the Samaritans:

                  </p>
                  <p>And for true loyalty, and faithful obedience there is as great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability,
as that the two poles ſhall meet. The King and the Pope are
two contrary maſters, none can truly ſerve them both; <hi>Either he muſt
hate the one, and love the other, or he muſt leane to the one and
deſpiſe the other.</hi> The obedience which either of them requires is ſo
repugnant, that they cannot lodge within one breaſt. This loyalty
which our adverſaries do outwardly pretend is but equivocal, no more
true loyalty, then a dead hand is a hand; it wants the very forme
and ſoule (if I may ſo ſpeak) of true dutifulneſſe, which is to perform
obedience voluntarily, and with a free heart for Gods cauſe, as to
Chriſts immediate Vicar over al perſons within his dominions. It is
with ſome ſecret reſervation, till their <hi>primus motor,</hi> the man of ſin,
upon whom their obedience depends, ſhal ſway them another way: <hi>rebus

diſcourſed of our Saviours mildneſſe,

of the Judaſſes of theſe times, from theſe
words of our Saviour:<note place="margin">Luk. 22. 48.</note> 
                     <hi>Iudas betrayeſt thou
the ſon of man with a kiſſe?</hi> Being command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

for this preſent occaſion, to look back into
the ſtory of our Saviours paſſion, and to ſeek out the cauſe of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>
his cruell, and more then helliſh fact, in betraying his Maſter,
which I find wrapped in the words already delivered unto you.</p>
                  <p>Theſe two queſtions, <hi>what will yee give me?</hi> and what <hi>ſhall
I give you?</hi> be two evils at this day much reigning amongſt men;
which though they may ſtand ſomewhat upon their antiquity, yet
they have little reaſon to bragge of their pedegree. For the one
may be fathered upon <hi>Simon Magus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act. 8. 19.</note> who offered to buy the gifts
of the holy Ghoſt for money: <hi>What ſhall I give you, that upon
whom ſoever I ſhall lay my hands, he may receive the holy Ghoſt?</hi> the
other upon <hi>Judas</hi> the traitour, who offered to ſell the giver of the
holy Ghoſt for a ſmall ſumme of money. <hi>What will yee give me,
and I will deliver him unto you?</hi> Both of them wicked, but the
ſpeech of <hi>Judas</hi> the more hainous. Who not contented with that
which he gat by ſtealth out of the bag which he bare, and being
diſappointed of a profit which he expected, in regard that that
boxe of ointment which he purpoſed to have ſold, (that he might
have converted a good part thereof to his own proper uſe,) was
powred upon our Saviours head: and perceiving our Saviour to
defend the fact of the woman, anon he goes out; and becauſe he
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:57497:31"/>
was fruſtrated of his hope of gaine by ſelling the ointment, hee
offers for a ſmall ſumme of money to ſell the Anointed. <hi>What
will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you?</hi> As if hee ſhould
have ſaid, I perceive that ye are marvellous deſirous to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
my maſter, but ye cannot eaſily effect your purpoſe, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the people, which make ſuch account of him, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
they would make an uproar, if any open violence ſhould
be offered unto him: yet if ye will liſten unto me, and follow
my counſell, I will quickly eaſe you of that care, upon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
that yee will afford me any reaſonable reward for my
paines; tell me therefore before I go, what ſhall my recompence
be, and I will undertake without any tumult to deliver him into
your hands. In which words obſerve theſe two points, 1 <hi>Judas</hi>
his queſtion, <hi>what will yee give me?</hi> 2 His promiſe to deliver his
maſter, ſo that he may be rewarded: <hi>and I will deliver him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the queſtion we ſee, that though <hi>Judas</hi> was an Apoſtata, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
from God, and led by Satan to betray his maſter, whom he lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
eſteemed, as appears by the price he ſold him for; yea though
he had a deſire to make his maſter away, leſt he ſhould afterward
get knowledge of his theft, yet he will not betray him unleſſe he
have ſomething for his pains. And therefore before he make any
promiſe of delivering him, he covenanteth for a price: whence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeth
this note, <hi>that even the wicked, and reprobate will abſtaine
from horrible and groſſe ſinnes when there is no provocation offered,
and when they ſee no end of committing them.</hi> There are in every
ſinne which is voluntarily committed two cauſes; An inward im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſive
moving them; and ſomething which may have the name
of a final cauſe, or elſe an externall object, alluring them. The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſive
cauſe in <hi>Judas</hi> was covetouſneſſe. The finall cauſe was to
obtain ſome money. The impulſive cauſe kept it ſelf cloſe, and
like a thiefe, lurked in a corner, till a fit opportunity was offered,
and a reward was expected. As it was in <hi>Judas,</hi> ſo was it in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan;</hi>
no doubt but <hi>Achan</hi> had given lodging to covetouſneſſe
before the overthrow of <hi>Jericho<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> but then he had the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
offered him.<note place="margin">Joſ. 7. 21.</note> He ſaw amongſt the ſpoile a goodly <hi>Babyloniſh
garment, and two hundred ſhekles of ſilver, and a wedge of gold,
and becauſe he coveted them he took them</hi> (contrary to the Lords
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:57497:31"/>
commandment) <hi>and hid them in the midſt of his tent.</hi> As it was in
theſe two, ſo was it in <hi>Gehazi.</hi> I make no queſtion but an inordinate
deſire of having, had poſſeſſed his heart, before that <hi>Naaman</hi> the
Syrian, came to his maſter, to be healed of his leproſie. But ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſuch an opportunity was offered, as was then: for when hee
ſaw <hi>Naaman</hi> offer his maſter ſome rich reward; for curing him,
and his maſter abſolutely refuſing them, he thought then was the
golden occaſion offered him to ſatiate his greedy deſires,<note place="margin">2 Kin. 5. 20.</note> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
poſts after <hi>Naaman</hi> to get ſomething of him. Wicked <hi>Ahab</hi>
who (as the holy ghoſt ſpeaketh) <hi>ſold himſelf to work wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi>
did not ſhed the blood of <hi>Naboth</hi> the Iſraelite, but to this
end, that he might obtaine the vineyard which lay neer unto his
houſe. Now as it is in covetouſneſſe, ſo with other ſinnes. And
the reaſon is very plain: for though the underſtandings of the
wicked be ſo darkned,<note place="margin">Iſa. 5.</note> that they call <hi>good evil, and evil good, ſowre
ſweet, and ſweet ſowre;</hi> though their appetites and affections be
ſo perverted, that they ſwallow up ſinne with greedineſſe, and
drinke iniquity like water: yet there is ſome reliques of the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
of God in their underſtanding, whereby they have a glimpſe
of good and evil, which though it cannot moderate the will,
and affections from running into ſinne, yet it doth ſo farre forth
bridle them, as that they will not commit any hainous impiety, but
when ſome thing is offered which puts as it were a vizard upon the
object of the will, and makes it chuſe that which otherwiſe it
would refuſe. For the will by nature is alwayes carried unto his
proper object, which is good, and abhorreth that which is evill.
So that when it chuſeth evill, it is not as it is a will, but as it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved,
and as the underſtanding, which judgeth of the object, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the will chooſe or refuſe it, counteth that good which indeed
is evil.</p>
                  <p>3. Here two ſorts of men are to be cenſured:<note place="margin">Vſe. 1.</note> the firſt is ſuch
as think themſelves ſufficiently excuſed for committing any ſinne,
if they can bring any occaſions or the allurements which have mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
them to commit it. The drunkard will ſay that company hath
drawn him to forget himſelf, and therefore he muſt be pardoned.
The adulterer will plead for himſelfe, that his own corrupt affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
hath moved him, and that the circumſtances of time and place
have cauſed him, and therefore he muſt be excuſed. But theſe
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:57497:32"/>
excuſes are ſuch, as that, if they would ſerve the turn, the wickedeſt
reprobate upon the face of the earth might be found not guilty.
For might not <hi>Judas</hi> have pleaded for himſelf, that he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have betrayed Chriſt, but that he expected ſome reward from
the high Prieſts? Might not <hi>Ahab</hi> have ſworn that he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have ſought <hi>Naboths</hi> bloud, if it had not been for his vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard
which was ſo commodious for his houſe? Might not <hi>Achan</hi>
have avouched that he would never have tranſgreſſed the Lords
commandment by taking of the excommunicate thing, but that it
ſo offered it ſelf that he thought he might have taken it, and none
been privy to it? Might not <hi>Cain</hi> have excuſed the ſlaughter of
his guiltleſſe brother, that he would not have killed him, if the
Lord had not had a greater reſpect unto <hi>Abels</hi> ſacrifice, then unto
his? It is true indeed, that ſuch objects may occurre, ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements
may happen, as that the deareſt of Gods children
(which as long as they remain in theſe houſes of clay do taſte too
much of the old <hi>Adam</hi>) may thereby be led to commit groſſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties.
We know, that the fear of death moved <hi>Peter</hi> to deny
his maſter: That idleneſſe, and the ſight of <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> cauſed
<hi>David</hi> to adultery: That <hi>Lots</hi> daughters brought their father to
commit inceſt: That <hi>Solomon</hi> by his wives was drawn to Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try:
That the fear of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> made faithfull <hi>Abraham</hi> to
diſtruſt Gods providence, and to ſay that his wife was his ſiſter.
But this onely ſhews their imperfections; it excuſeth not their
facts, that they had ſundry provocations to theſe ſinnes. If <hi>Peter</hi>
had thought that the fear that the Jews put him in, by reaſon of
the great cruelty which they uſed againſt his maſter, might have
excuſed him for denying Chriſt, he might have ſpared his teares.
If occaſion,<note place="margin">Mat. 26.</note> and time, and place, might have purchaſed a pardon
for <hi>David,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 51. 1.</note> he would never have been ſo vehement, and paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
in confeſſing his fault, and craving a pardon for the ſame.
And indeed this is the onely courſe to be freed from Gods plagues,
not to excuſe our ſinnes, and ſay that ſuch and ſuch provocations
brought us to them: (for ſo the wickedeſt reprobate might be
innocent) but to humble our ſelves before the Majeſty of God,
and to confeſſe our miſery, that he may receive us to mercy.</p>
                  <p>4 There is another ſort of men which if they commit not ſuch
iniquities as others do,<note place="margin">Vſe. 2.</note> (either becauſe their natures are not ſo
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:57497:32"/>
prone, and bent to thoſe vices, of becauſe ſuch objects and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements
are wanting, as others have had) will boaſt (at leaſt
within themſelves) that they have attained unto a farre greater
meaſure of holineſſe, then others, which by their naturall prone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
or ſome external cauſe, are drawn to wickedneſſe. But (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las)
what credit is it for the <hi>Scythians,</hi> that they were no drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,
when they never got wine nor ſtrong drink?<note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> What com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
for the old <hi>Germanes,</hi> that they abſtained from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
company of women, when by nature they were not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
to wantonneſſe? What credit is it for a young childe, or
withered old man, to abſtain from carnal pleaſure, when the heat
of youth in the one is quelled, and the other never knew what luſt
meant? What grace for a weak ſpirited man, who was never
moved with any exceſſive anger, not to be a murtherer? This is
rather commendation worthy, if we ſhall abſtain from thoſe
vices to which our corrupt nature doth moſt propend: If the
Dutch can leave his drunkenneſs, the Italian his luſtfulneſs, the
French his factiouſneſs, the Spaniard his haughtineſs, the Engliſh
his gluttony, and greedineſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if the cholerick can lay aſide his anger,
and raſhneſs; the phlegmatick his ſloath, and idleneſs; the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholick
his hatred, and enviouſneſs; the ſanguine his concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence,
and wantonneſs; in a word, if <hi>Herod</hi> can be contented
to part with <hi>Herodias,</hi> and every man his beloved ſin, to which by
nature he is moſt addicted.</p>
                  <p>When a certain Phyſiognomer looking upon <hi>Socrates,</hi> gathered
by his complexion that he was given to luſt and wantonneſs, the
people which knew the continencie, and vertuous life of <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>
mocked him as unskilful of his art, thinking that <hi>Socrates</hi>
was not addicted to any ſuch vice. But <hi>Socrates</hi> acknowledged
the judgement of the Phyſiognomer to be true, and confeſsed that
by naturall diſpoſition he was prone unto it; thinking it a greater
vertue to conquer, and keep under the corruptions of the fleſh;
then to keep himſelf under, and within the bond of reaſon, when
he had nothing to draw him away. And yet this is little worth,
unleſs it be at ſuch time, when ſome externall means, and provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
do concurre, for bringing that into act, which depraved
nature moſt affecteth. The drunkard will ſometimes abſtain from
his beaſtlineſs: but it is when he can get no wine. The oppreſsor
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57497:33"/>
from grinding, and grating the faces of the poore; but it is when
he lacks matter to worke upon. The wanton from his pleaſures;
but it is when he wants time, and place to effect his deſires. The
glutton from his exceſſive eating: but it is in a dearth or ſcarcity,
when he knowes not how to fill h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in <hi>Judas,</hi> if having a covetous minde, the high Prieſt
had come unto him, and offered him a large ſumme of mony, upon

                     <hi>becauſe ye think that the Son of God may be bought

that living among the effeminate and luxurious Aſians, he was
not infected with their faults. <hi>Laus illi tribnenda eſt, non quòd Aſiam

with this diſeaſe. They were indeed weake, and feeble in
the faith, and therefore <hi>Peter,</hi> though he followed him a far off,
and came into the high Prieſts hall, yet a poore damſell did ſo
ſhake the rock of his faith that preſently he denyed him, the reſt
immediately after he was taken forſooke him, and fled: but none
of them did entertain any ſuch ſuggeſtion as to betray him, ſave

Hiſtories are full of the like, which I will paſſe over with ſilence.
I wil only inſtance in one of our own country, (which methinks in
al points, ſave in the difference of the parties betrayed, may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to this of <hi>Judas</hi>) I mean <hi>Humphery Baniſter,</hi> ſervant to the
Duke of <hi>Buckingham:</hi> whom the Duke had tenderly brought
up, and above all loved and truſted, in ſo much that being purſued
by King <hi>Richard</hi> the third, he hid himſelfe in <hi>Baniſters</hi> houſe,
thinking it to be the only Sanctuarie, where he might ſafely repoſe
himſelfe. But when King <hi>Richard</hi> had promiſed 1000 pounds
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57497:34"/>
to thoſe that would finde him out, the deſire of gaine ſo wrought
with him, that preſently he betrayed his Lord and maſter into the
kings hands. As the fact was like to that of <hi>Judas,</hi> ſo the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
hath ſome reſemblance with it. <hi>Judas</hi> though he had no
bond for payment,<note place="margin">In the life of Richard the 3 written by Sir. <hi>Th. More.</hi>
                     </note> yet he got the money. The high Prieſts pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
better of their promiſe then the King. <hi>Judas</hi> did not enjoy
the money, for he went out, and hanged himſelf. <hi>Baniſter</hi> was
not executed, but was ſhortly after for a murther condemned:
his ſonne and heire became mad, and died in a hogſtie, his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
was infected with a leproſie, his ſecond ſonne deformed of his
limmes; his youngeſt ſonne drowned in a puddle.</p>
                  <p>6. By this which hath been ſpoken, you ſee my concluſion
plainly proved: that a covetous man, ſetting all reſpects aſide,
will not be afraid to commit any ſinne, ſo that he may be rewarded
for his pains. And how can it be otherwiſe? for hee is like an
hunger-ſtarved man which will do any thing, ſo that he may ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate
his appetite. Covetouſneſſe like the pit of hell, is never ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,

his ſleeves, and boſome, then glued as much as he could to the

that is <hi>Judas,</hi> no <hi>Saducee,</hi> nor <hi>Phariſee</hi> which oppugned his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
no profeſſed enemy which openly ſought his deſtruction,
but an Apoſtle, one of the twelve which he had choſen unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
and ſent abroad to preach the Goſpel, and to caſt out De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,
and to heal the ſick. Hence I infer this concluſion: <hi>that no
calling is ſo holy but that it hath ſome wicked impes, and diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
hypocrites (which though for a ſpace they may deceave the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:57497:37"/>
world with a viſard of holineſſe, yet time will unmaske and ſhew them
in their owne colours) intermixed with true profeſſors.</hi> A concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which if the inſtances of our time could not make good, the
premiſes of all former ages doe abundantly demonſtrate it. When
as yet our firſt Parents had no more Children then <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel,</hi>
the elder of theſe two,<note place="margin">Gen. 4.</note> the firſt that ever was borne of a woman,
the heire apparent of the whole world, was an Apoſtate: his hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocricie
was diſcloſed in killing his brother. When the whole
Church was compinged within the ſides of one Arke, all were not

<hi>who was the father of the faithful</hi>) there came an <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> as wel as an

ever be till the ſon of man come in the glory of his kingdom, as
long as the nett ſwims in the ſalt ſea of this world, till it be
brought to land, it ſhall containe both good and bad fiſhes. Till
the reapers come, there muſt grow wheat and teares together in
this field: till the ſhepheard come there muſt bee ſheepe and goats

the chaffe, till the Lord come with his fan in his hand to winnow

                  <p>2. The Lord by this meanes effecteth the converſion of ſome,
which are not yet called. For as the <hi>Aramits,</hi> by walking with the
Prophet,<note place="margin">2 King. 6.</note> were at unawares brought unto <hi>Samaria:</hi> ſo many who
are not as yet called by walking with the righteous, are catched
at unawares, and brought to Chriſts ſheepfold.</p>
                  <p>3. The Lord doth hereby exerciſe his children and keeps them
ſtill fighting, wheras otherwiſe they would be ready to fall aſleepe
in the cradle of carnall ſecuritie. The coldneſs of devotion, that
is in the worldlings, doth by an <hi>Antiperiſtaſis</hi> oftentimes ſtirre up
the heate of zeale in Gods Children. While the winds ſtrives to
blow out the fire, it increaſeth the flame, and while the wicked
doe indeavour to conſume the heate of zeale in Gods Children,
and to make them as cold as they themſelves are, they often blow
it up, and make it farre greater then it was before.</p>
                  <p>I told you before what <hi>Tully</hi> ſaith of <hi>Muraena,</hi> that his chaſtity
was more ſeene in living among the effeminate <hi>Aſians,</hi> then ever
it was at <hi>Rome.</hi> And I am ſure <hi>Lots</hi> continencie did farre more
appeare when he lived amongſt the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> then when he was

perſon betrayed. If <hi>Judas</hi> had betrayed one of his fellowes,
the ſinne had been horrible: but he makes it farre worſe, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayeth
his maſter. He goes yet further, for (behold whither man
doth fall,<note place="margin">Vnto you.</note> if the ſpirit of God do not direct his ſteps) he delivereth
him into the hands of his hatefull enemies,<note place="margin">Luk. 1. 71.</note> 
                     <hi>who came to deliver us
from our enemies and from the hands of all that hate us.</hi> He deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth
him to death, who came to reſtore us, that were dead in
our ſinnes, to life; who to ſatisfie for our hunting after vanities,
was himſelfe hunted like a <hi>Pelican in the wilderneſſe;</hi> to ſatisfie
for our carnal, and ſenſual pleaſures, left the boſome of his father
with whom is fulneſſe of delights, and at whoſe right hand is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
for evermore: to ſatisfie for our pride, humbled himſelfe and
<hi>took upon him the forme of a ſervant:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 7.</note> to anſwer for our gluttony,
taſted gall, and vineger; to anſwer for our covetouſneſſe, paid not
gold, nor ſilver, but the ranſome of his own bloud. Theſe things
I do but point at, having diſcourſed of them elſewhere, when I
handled our Saviours milde ſpeech unto <hi>Iudas,</hi> when he went to
betray him. Therefore I paſſe them over, and come to apply this
fact unto theſe preſent times.</p>
                  <p>14. <hi>Judas</hi> is dead, and all men cry, fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> upon him, and ſay that if
they had been in <hi>Judas</hi> his dayes, they would not have been part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
with him in the bloud of our Saviour. And ſo ſaid the old
<hi>Phariſees,</hi> if they had been in the dayes of their fathers, they
would not have been partners with them in the bloud of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.<note place="margin">Mat. 23. 30.</note>
And yet they fulfilled, nay they exceeded the meaſure of
their fathers wickedneſſe. And now a dayes howſoever many will
build the tombes of the Prophets, and garniſh the ſepulchres of
the righteous, yet we have <hi>Judaſſes,</hi> which will betray <hi>Chriſt</hi>
                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:57497:40"/>
unto the high Prieſts. I cannot reckon them all, but there are
3 <hi>tranſgreſſors,</hi> nay 4 which I cannot paſſe over. 1. The <hi>ſacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Church-robber,</hi> 2. The <hi>grinding oppreſſor,</hi> 3. The <hi>cloſe bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
4. The <hi>deceitful lawyer.</hi> All theſe do their beſt (nay their
worſt) to betray Chriſt, if not in his perſon, yet in his members,
into the hands of the helliſh <hi>Caiphas,</hi> And me thinks they do
ſomewhat reſemble thoſe 4. great plagues mentioned in the firſt of
<hi>Joel:</hi> which were the Caterpiller, the Locuſt, the Cankerworme
and the graſhopper. The Caterpiller eats the firſt fruits when they
are in ſetting. To him I compare the Church-robber, which lives
of the firſt fruits and tithes, which by the law are due to God.
The Locuſt (as Naturaliſts deſcribe him) is a great flie, which li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
upon the leſſe, and with no difficulty can burſt a ſpiders web,
wherein the ſmaller flies are quickly catched. To him I compare
the oppreſſour, which devours his inferiours, and will with no
leſſe difficulty paſſe through thoſe good ſtatutes that are made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, then a great Locuſt will burſt through a ſpiders web.
The Canker-worme doth ſecretly ſhave off the tender barks of
herbs and trees before he can be perceived. To him may be
likened the briber, which doth ſo cloſely carry himſelfe, that
none can perceive him, but the plant which he feeds upon. The
Graſhopper hath a chirping voice to allure a man after him, but
yet ſo nimble is his motion, that he which followeth him ſhall
ſcarcely finde him. Like to it, is the deceitful lawyer, which with
faire promiſes, and ſugered hopes, draws his clients after him;
but ſo nimbly he hops up and down, for his own advantage, that
ye ſhall perhaps not finde him twice in one tune, inſomuch that ye
ſhall be worſe reſolved in the end, then ye were in the beginning.
Theſe four lie as heavy upon our land, as thoſe four plagues did
upon <hi>Judah:</hi> ſo that we may ſay, <hi>that which is left by the Locuſt,
the graſhopper hath eaten, and the reſidue of the graſhopper, hath the
cankerworme eaten, and the reſidue of the cankerworme hath the
caterpiller eaten.</hi> Before I begin to ſpeak of theſe in particular,
let me uſe the Apoſtles proteſtation.<note place="margin">Rom. 9. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>I ſay the truth in Chriſt Ieſus,
I lie not, my conſcience bearing me witneſſe in the holy ghoſt.</hi> I do
not ſeek the diſgrace of any particular, it is the truths cauſe, and
Gods cauſe that moveth me to ſpeak and let my tongue cleave to
the roof of my mouth when I ſhall be afraid to diſcharge a good

conſcience in Gods behalf.) If then my muſick ſeem harſh, and
unpleaſant in the eares of any that heare me, I would have them
to know thus much, that the ſtrings upon which I am to play
are farre out of tune. If any man ſhall finde himſelfe wounded
with my ſpeech, I ſay unto him as our Saviour did to the adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſe,
<hi>Hath no man condemned thee? neither do</hi> I <hi>condemn thee;</hi>
yet I adde with <hi>Iohn,</hi>

                     <hi>God is
greater then thy heart and knoweth all things,</hi> and therefore I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe
thee with that ſpeech of Chriſt to the impotent man: <hi>go thy

                     <note place="margin">Joh. 5. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>and ſinne no more, leſt a worſe thing happen unto thee.</hi> Now to
the particulars.</p>
                  <p>15. In the firſt place come the <hi>Simoniacal Patrons,</hi> the heires
and eldeſt ſons of <hi>Iudas,</hi> the <hi>caterpillers</hi> of our Church, and the
notableſt thieves in all our land. Which will not part with that
portion which is due unto the ſons of <hi>Levi,</hi> and which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
unto them, as the golden apple was unto <hi>Paris,</hi> with this
motto ingraven upon it, <hi>detur digniori,</hi> let the moſt worthy have
it, unleſſe with <hi>Iudas</hi> they covenant for a price before hand. Let
a mans gifts of mind be never ſo good, yet if he bring no gifts in
hand; let his care, and induſtry, and learning be never ſo rare,
and extraordinary, yet if he do not ſpeak with the tongue of men,
and <hi>angels,</hi> yea <hi>arch-angels,</hi> he ſhall have little hope to prevaile in
his ſuit. He that will inſinuate himſelfe into their favours, muſt
come, as <hi>Iupiter</hi> came into <hi>Danaes lap, per impluvium,</hi> ſecretly in
at the chimney top, (not in at the door) and he muſt come as <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi>
then came, <hi>in a ſhower of gold.</hi> This is the way, this is the
beſt means to effect his deſire; for he that is as blockiſh and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid,<note place="margin">Plut. Apoth.</note>
as <hi>Philips Aſſe in Plutarch,</hi> if he be loaden with gold (with
that aſſe) oh he is a man of excellent gifts, of rare endowments,
no exception muſt keep him back; that which he wants in learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
he hath it in ſimplicity: as if it were <hi>ſimplicitas Aſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

not <hi>ſimplicitas columbina,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 10. 16.</note> which the Lord would have in his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters.
And what if he lack Latine? he hath <hi>gold</hi> enough, and
that is a farre more pretious metal. But if this way will not hold,
then they will take another courſe, they will act the parts of <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias</hi>
and <hi>Sapphira,</hi> and keep back part of that poſſeſſion, which
they ſhould voluntarily <hi>lay down at the Apoſtles feet.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act. 4. 12.</note> There muſt
be an exception in the general rule, a reſervation of their own
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:57497:41"/>
tithes, a limitation of ſuch a townſhip, or ſuch a field. Or they
will ſay with the harlot, 1 Kin. 3. <hi>Let it neither be thine nor mine,
but let it be divided.</hi> Here is treaſon in another kind; they do not
ſell the king of heaven, by covenanting for a price before hand,
as <hi>Judas</hi> did, but (which is all to one effect) they clip his coyn and
make it ſo light, that it will not ſuſtaine the ſonnes of <hi>Levi.</hi> And
this verily is a principall reaſon, that we have ſo many <hi>mutes,</hi> and
ſo few <hi>vowels</hi> in our croſſerow: that many lapwings which hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
out of their neſts with their ſhels on their heads, before e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
they get a feather on their backs, have builded in thoſe rocks
where eagles ſhould neſtle; and many which have never put down
their buckets, into either of the two fountains of this land (or
if they have, it hath been but <hi>tanquam canis ad Nilum,</hi> they have
onely wet their lips, and taken a lappe by the way) are advanced
to Eccleſiaſticall preferments, and made Paſtors of flocks being
not able to feed themſelves, and are become captains in the Lords
field, being not able of themſelves to take one ſtone out of Gods
brook to caſt at the forehead of the ſpiritual <hi>Goliath.</hi> I confeſſe
ſome of them will now and then be flinging in the pulpit, but they
be <hi>mentita tela,</hi> other mens weapons they fight with: they have,
indeed, as good a property in them, as they have in their benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,<note place="margin">Carmina Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus emit, jactat ſua carmina Paulus: nam, quod emit, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit dicere jure<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

1. The Patrons bounty, which though it be little, yet it is more

But the great number of the other (which I purpoſe not to leave

ſuſtaine Chriſt and his Apoſtles: or betray him in his maintenance,
and by a conſequence in his Members, the flock by withdrawing
their food. For if <hi>Succus pecori,</hi> then it muſt needs follow that
<hi>lac ſubducitur agnis:</hi> if the paſture be without the fleece, the
flock ſhall want their fodder. It is an objection which ſome
would faſten as a ſcandall upon our Univerſities, that many of our
preachers drone-like lurk in their owne hives, and flee not abroad;
that they bury their talent at home in their owne ſtudies as in the
ground; whereas, by ſettling themſelves in ſome Country charge,
they might put it out to their Maſters beſt advantage. But (I ſhall
tell you?) the caſe is with them as it was with the ſick impotent
man by the poole <hi>Betheſda</hi> in the 5. of <hi>John,</hi> gladly would they
be in the poole, but there is none to put them in: an <hi>angel</hi> troubles

gladly hold my peace, and not be judged by any to exceed the

inertiaeque condemnarent,</hi> the voice of the whole kingdome,
exclaiming againſt the great abuſes of theſe times, would condemn
me of negligence. The time is protracted, unneceſſarie delaies are
uſed, new doubts are dayly invented, inſomuch that the cauſes are
oftentimes more uncertaine in the latter end then they were at the
firſt beginning. What poſtings off from Court to Court! what
delaies and procraſtinations from tearme, to tearme, from yeare

The Lawes are made like a game at the cards, wherein all the play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
are looſers, and all the gaine comes to the butler, which found
them cards to play on. And the Lawyers prove ſuch Arbitrators,
as was <hi>Quintus Fabius</hi> in <hi>Tullie;</hi> who being appointed a daieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
between the <hi>Nolanes,</hi> and the <hi>Neopolitanes,</hi> touching the
borders of their grounds, tooke a great part of their right from
both: or rather like to <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon;</hi> who being choſen a
judge betweene two Brethren, touching their fathers king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
tooke it from them both, and reſerved it to himſelfe. They
take from both the Parties, though not the ſame <hi>numero,</hi> which they
contend for, yet the ſame <hi>ſpecie,</hi> (I meane the value of the
ſame) and gaine it to themſelves. The filly ſheep in a tempeſt
runs to a briar buſh for a ſhelter: when the ſtorme is overblown,
he is ſo clapſed in the briars, that before he get out, he is enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to leave ſome good part of his fleece behind him, ſo that he is
made unable to indure the next ſtorme. And yet better it is that
he ſhould indure with patience, then, by having recourſe to ſuch
an Harbour, have his skin riped by the bramble. I will not apply,
I reverence the profeſſion. It is good and neceſſary for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,
and a calling warrantable by Gods Word. And I
make no quſtion but there are many of this profeſſion, which doe
ſtudy to approve their doings in the ſight of God and man. And
ſo I am perſwaded of you all, though I thus ſpeake: but as the

All gentle meanes muſt be firſt tryed: and even in this act
of juſtice,<note place="margin">Plutarc. de au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diendis poetis.</note> ye muſt not altogether exclude mercy. When many
of the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> were drunke with wine, <hi>Lycurgus</hi> gave
charge that the Vines ſhould be cut downe; but <hi>Plato's</hi> coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell
was better, who willed, that the fountaines ſhould be cauſed
to runne among the Vines, and that the rage of <hi>Bacchus</hi> ſhould be
tempered with the ſoberneſs of <hi>Neptune,</hi> that is, that the water
ſhould be mingled with the wine. Though the extremity of
juice make ſome deſperate, (as did <hi>Draco's</hi> lawes, which for
their ſeverity are ſaid to be written in blood) yet muſt it not
therefore be taken away, but rather the rigour of juſtice muſt be
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:57497:48"/>
mixed with clemency, as his counſell was, that the rage of wine
ſhould be aſſwaged with the cooleneſſe of the water. For juſtice,
with out mercy is bloody cruelty, mercy without juſtice is fooliſh
pity; but juſtice with mercy is perfect Chriſtianitie. Oh then thoſe
which God would have joyned together, do not you put aſunder.
But let them both be ſo linked together, that yee may verifie that

he had betrayed his maſter, together with
the anſwer of the High Prieſts and Elders at
ſuch time when he being ſorrowful for the
fact, confeſſed his fault and reſtored the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.
They prettily excuſe themſelves what is
that to us: O Hypocrites, what is that to us? did not you hire
<hi>Judas</hi> to betray him? did not you incenſe Pilate to condemn him?
did you not all crie with one voyce crucifie him, and what is that
to us? O generation of vipers, how can ye eſcape the damnation
of hell? but my ſpeech at this time, ſhall be about the hiſtory of
<hi>Judas,</hi> wherein obſerve three things. 1. His condemnation, by
the virdict of his owne guilty conſcience, (then <hi>Judas</hi> when he
ſaw that he was condemned) 2. His mortification or imperfect
repentance, he repented, &amp;c. 3. His deſperation, he departed and
went, &amp;c. let us begin with the firſt, (then <hi>Judas</hi> when hee ſaw
that he was condemned) they may be underſtood two wayes;
either thus when he ſaw that his maſter was condemned; for
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:57497:49"/>
though Chriſt in this chapter comes after, yet that is not material.
For the Evangeliſts do not obſerve a ſtrict order of time in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
down the ſtory; but ſometimes by way of Anticipation ſet
them down before, and ſometimes by way of recapitulation
bring them after; or thus, when he ſaw that himſelfe was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned:
take them whether way you will and they afford us this
doctrine, there is no man ſo wicked but his conſcience will at one
time or other, upon one occaſion or other, convict and condemn
him for his ſins. He that ſhall a little look upon <hi>Judas</hi> before this
time, would think that all the threatnings of the law would not
mollifie his ſtony heart. When the High Prieſts and Elders ſend
Officers to apprehend Chriſt, <hi>Judas</hi> goes with them as their cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
and brings them to the place where Jeſus was, and though the
barbarous Souldiers and pittileſſe Officers and cruel ſervants were
ſo appaled and daunted with his ſpeech, that when he told them,
that he was the man whom they ſought, they were ſo farre from
apprehending him, that preſently they ſtarted back; <hi>veluti qui
ſentibus anguem preſſit humi nitens,</hi> as a man doth when he treads
upon a ſnake, and were beaten down with the breath of his mouth.
For the text ſaith, they went backward and fell to the ground,
<hi>John</hi> 18. 6. and moreover were ſtruck into ſuch amazement and
aſtoniſhment of heart, that when <hi>Peter</hi> drew his ſword, and
ſmote off one of their eares, they ſcarce (or as it is probable) not
at all obſerved it; For when they were come into the High
Prieſts hall, and <hi>Peter</hi> amongſt them, though they could ſay this
is one of them, and ſayth his ſpeech betrayeth him; yet none
could ſay this is he, that cut off <hi>Malchus</hi> his eare; yet all this
wind ſhakes not Judas.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Is ſeu dura ſilex ſtat vel Marpeſia cautes.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>all the thunderbolts of the law, will not make a breach in his flinty
heart, whereby repentance might enter in. For all this when hee
heares that Chriſt is condemned then he begins to repent. The
conſcience is of marvellous great force ſaith the heathen Oratour,
and that two wayes; for thoſe that have done well are not afraid,
<hi>&amp; poenam ante oculos ſemper verſari putant qui peccaverunt,</hi> and
thoſe which have done amiſſe think that God is alwayes ſhaking
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:57497:49"/>
his rod over them. The righteous is bold as a Lyon, his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
hath paſſed upon him, and found him not guilty: but the
wicked flieth when none purſueth, his own guilty conſcience hath
condemned him. He may perhaps be hid from the eyes of men,
but he can never aſſure himſelfe that he cannot be catched, as <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curus
in Seneca</hi> ſpeaketh. Suppoſe his ſinne be hid from the eyes of
men, let him think that the Angels that are about him do not take
the leaſt notice of it; let him imagine that he hath drawn a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
before the eyes of God, ſo that he cannot behold it; let him
ſay with thoſe Epicures in the Pſalmiſt, tuſh, God doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
it, there is no knowledge in the moſt higheſt. He hideth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
his face, and he will never ſee it; yet there is one within him
that noteth it in the table of his heart, as it were with a pen of
iron, and with the point of a diamond: it is a witneſſe to accuſe
him, a bayliffe to arreſt him, a priſon to contain him, a jury to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
him, a judge to condemn him, an hangman to kill and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
him. The Poets fable of <hi>Prometheus,</hi> that he was tied to the
mountain <hi>Caucaſus,</hi> and had an Eagle ſtill gnawing upon his heart
for offending <hi>Jupiter;</hi> me thinks it is a fit embleme of a ſinner, who
for offending his God is as it were tied to a ſtake, and hath the
worme of conſcience as a hungrie eagle ſtill gnawing upon his
heart. <hi>Plutarch</hi> compares it to a boyle or impoſtume in the fleſh.
For as a boyle pricketh and eateth the fleſh, ſo doth a ſinners con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
his mind. Now as thoſe that have cold or hot agues with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
them, are more troubled then when they are made cold with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
by the froſt, or heated by the beams of the ſunne. So thoſe
grievances which happen by ſome external cauſe, are farre eaſier
then this inward ſting of conſcience, and therefore (ſaith he) a
mind void of ſin, were more to be wiſhed for, then houſes, then
lands, then dignities, then riches, then any thing which this gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

Our great Grandfather <hi>Adam,</hi> had no ſooner tranſgreſsed Gods
commandement by eating of the forbidden tree, but preſently his
conſcience accuſed him, and made him aſhamed: for when he
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:57497:50"/>
heard the voice of God walking in the garden, in the
coole of the day, he hid himſelfe from the preſence of the Lord,
among the the trees of the garden. Why was <hi>Adam</hi> ſo afraid of
Gods preſence? had he not been with him before? He had made
him, he had made a helper for him, he had made him Lord o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the whole world, and put all things in ſubjection under his
feet, all Sheep and Oxen, yea and all the Beaſts of the feild, the
fowles of the aire, and the fiſhes of the ſeas, and therefore a man
would thinke, that he ſhould rather have runne unto God, to
have given him thankes for all his benefits, but it may be God
came in a more terrible manner then he was wont, not ſo the text
ſaith, <hi>the voice of the Lord came,</hi> he did but ſend his voice, not his
fearefull and terrible, which ſhakes the Wilderneſs, but his mild
and gentle voice, it came walking it came not running to take
vengeance, and therefore it muſt needs be that his guilty conſcience
made him afraid. <hi>Cain</hi> after he had murthered his innocent bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
howſoever he could prettily excuſe the matter unto
God, telling him that he was not his Brothers keeper, yet had
he an inward accuſer, which laid the murther ſo hard unto his
charge, that he was enforced to confeſs the fact, and deſperately
to cry out, my ſinnes are greater then can be pardoned.</p>
                  <p>Jacobs <hi>ſonnes, when they ſold their Brother</hi> Joſeph, <hi>were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

                  <p>4. I doe not ſpeake this as though I were of opinion, that all

there is great difference between the ſons of God, and the ſons of

ſuch as by long practiſe have gotten an habit. Sin is to the Children
of God, asit it were a thorne in their ſides, and a prick in their
eyes, they feel it at the very firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea, and that moſt grievouſly too,
but thewicked which ſinne with a high hand, have ſo overcharged
their conſcciences, that they are benummed and paſt feeling, as the
Apoſtle ſpeakes <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 19. ſuch have their conſciences burned
as it were with a hot Iron, as he elſwhere ſaith, meaning that
they are ſo dulled and hardened by cuſtome, that they can hardly
be brought to any feeling of their ſinnes, and no marvell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuetudo
peccandi tollit ſenſum peccati,</hi> cuſtome of ſinning taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the feeling of ſinne. I may compare the conſcience of Gods
Child to the eye of a needle which ſtreitneth the ſmalleſt thred,
but ſuch as have gotten a cuſtome of ſinne, their conſciences are
like to great broad gates, at which a loaden Camel may
finde eaſie entrance, or it may be likned unto a greene path, in
ſoft and mariſh ground, which in the beginning is ſo ſoft, that a
man cannot ſet his foot upon it, but will leave an impreſſion in
the ground, but in proceſſe of time by continuall paſſage, it is
worne unto the gravell and then a loaden Cart will ſcarce leave
any print behind it: ſo like wiſe the conſcience at the firſt is ſo
ſoft, that the leaſt ſinne leaveth a wound and print in it, but conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:57497:51"/>
in ſinne weareth it to the gravel, and maketh it ſo hard,
that the greateſt iniquity can ſcarcely be felt. Now the Children of
God commonly ſinning upon infirmity, ſeldom upon preſumption,
never upon habit, after they be effectually called, but the wicked
adding drunkenneſs to thirſt, that is, heaping one ſinne in the neck
of another, without entring into a due conſideration of their
wicked eſtate, it fals out that the ungodly for the moſt part are not
ſo ſoone touched with a feeling of their ſinnes, as are Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
when they have tranſgreſsed. Holy <hi>David</hi> after he had
committed adulterie with <hi>Bathſheba</hi> ſlept divers moneths in his
ſinne, (a thing not ſo ordinarily befalling the Children of God)
but he was no ſooner rouzed out of this Lethargie, by the Prophet
<hi>Nathan,</hi> then the prick of ſinne did ſting him to the heart, and
made him crie as in <hi>Pſal. 51. Have mercy upon me O Lord, according
to thy great mercies, and according to the multitude of thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſsions
doe away mine offences.</hi> One deep calleth upon another,
the deepneſſe of his ſinnes, calleth for the depth of Gods mercies,
but <hi>Herod</hi> had ſo long enjoyed <hi>Herodias</hi> his Brothers wife, that
the preaching of <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> a greater man then the Prophet <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi>
a Prophet yea and more then a Prophet, could not move him
from that particular, though he diſſwaded him from other ſins, to
which he was not ſo much inured. The ſame Prophet <hi>David,</hi> when
he had numbred the people (a thing of it ſelfe indifferent, if he
had taken no pride in the multitude of his Hoaſt) was ſmitten at
the heart, and ſaid unto the Lord, I have ſinned exceedingly, in
that I have done. If his Predeceſsor <hi>Saul</hi> had done the like, it may
be ſuppoſed he would have defended the lawfulneſs of the fact,
who was ſo ready to excuſe himſelfe for keeping the fat Oxen
of the <hi>Amalekites</hi> contrary to Gods commandement. Godly <hi>Auſtin</hi>
in his old age was moved in conſcience for the leaſt faults he had
committed when he was a Child, for playing at the Ball when his
Parents had forbidden him, for ſtealing a few wild Peares out of
his Neighbours Orchard; ſinnes which few will remember, or if
they doe, it is onely to brag of them: ſo then it is without que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
that ſuch as are not inured to any ſinn, will be ſooner mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
then thoſe which by long cuſtome have made it naturall unto
them; but yet none are ſo wicked, though with <hi>Ahab</hi> they sell
themſelves to worke wickedneſs, but their conſciences will now
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:57497:52"/>
and then check them, will accuſe them will condemne them, yea,
when the world doth take little notice of it: that which made
<hi>Caligula</hi> to hide himſelf under his bed, made <hi>Faelix</hi> to tremble,
and <hi>Nero</hi> to cry, <hi>Ego nec amicum habeo, nec inimicum,</hi> I have ſo
wickedly miſdemeaned my ſelfe, that I have neither friend to ſave
me, nor for to rid me out of my miſerie. And <hi>Pharaoh</hi> whoſe heart
was harder then braſs, or the nether milſtone, to ſay: <hi>I have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
God is righteous, but I and my people are wicked.</hi> The ſtorie of
<hi>Theodoricus</hi> King of the <hi>Gothes</hi> is notable for this purpoſe: When
the <hi>Romans</hi> (being backed by <hi>Symmachus</hi> and <hi>Boatrius,</hi> two worthy
men) would not give leave to the <hi>Arrians</hi> to erect any churches
where they might promulgat their blaſphemous hereſie againſt the
ſon of God. <hi>Theodorick</hi> ſent for thoſe two to <hi>Ticinum,</hi> and there
after he had for a time kept them in cloſe priſon, and confiſcated
their goods, commanded that they ſhould both be executed. <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doricus</hi>
was a man of that power, that few could, none would
revenge the blood of theſe two famous men, neither did God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
inflict any outward puniſhment upon him, yet his guilty
conſcience would not ſuffer his ſinne to ſleepe, for a little while
after, when the head of a fiſh was ſet before him on the Table, he
calling to minde how he had beheaded thoſe two men, thought
that he ſaw the head of <hi>Symmachus,</hi> with horrible jawes, and fierie
eyes, threatning death and deſtruction unto him, at the fight
whereof being ſuddenly aſtonied, and caſt downe, he willed his
Servants to carry him to his bed, where lying ſome ſhort ſpace,
after much ſorrow of his offence, he gave up the ghoſt. And here
another ſtorie comes in my mind, which I find recorded by <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch,</hi>
of one <hi>Beſſus,</hi> who had killed his father, but ſo ſecretly,
that none knew of it; as this <hi>Beſſus</hi> was going to ſupper with
ſome of his acquaintance: finding a ſwallowes neſt in the way, he
thruſt it downe with his ſpeare, and killed the young ſwallowes,
when the reſt reproved him for it, telling him it argued a cruell
mind, to kill the innocent birds, eſpecially ſeeing they were not
good for meat: why ſhould I not kill them ſaid <hi>Beſſus,</hi> ſeeing they
objected unto me that I had killed my Father; hereupon he was
examined before the Magiſtrate, where he confeſſed the Fact, and
ſuffered condigne puniſhment. The young Birds could not ſpeake,
and yet his guilty conſcience made him thinke that they cried to
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:57497:52"/>
Heaven for vengeance: here then wee may note another diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between the conſciences of the godly and the wicked; the
wicked though their conſciences be not ſo ſoon touched as the
conſciences of the godly: yet when they once begin to feel their
ſinnes, then they feel as it were daggers ſtabbing their hearts, which
ſeldome leave them before they be overwhelmed in the pit of
deſperation. The children of God are ſaid to have hearts of fleſh,
and the wicked to have hearts of ſtone: now the fleſh will be
eaſikly wounded, and oftentimes quickly cured; ſo Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
are eaſily wounded with the feeling of their ſinnes: but as
<hi>Pliny</hi> faith of the Harts, that when they have eaten any poyſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
hearb, then they runne unto the hearb Cinara, and by eating
thereof are cured; and when they are wounded with an arrow,
they have recourſe unto the hearb Dictamnum, by which they are
healed. So theſe, when they feel the poyſon of ſinne working in
their bowels, then they runne unto the good Phyſitian of their
ſoules, which giveth them a potion of his blood to cure them;
when Satan that hunter of men hath wounded them with his poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonful
arrowes, they have recourſe unto Chriſt, who with a pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of his merits healeth them. A ſtone will hardly receive any
characters, but when they are once graven in, then they ſtick faſt,
and cannot eaſily be raſed out, nor will the characters of ſinne be
quickly graven in the ſinners conſcience, but when they are once
ſtamped in, they remain for ever, ſo that they may be read in this
book, in the day of judgement. Thus have I proved, that ſinne is
a burthen unto the ſinners conſcience, a doctrine (if ever) in theſe
dayes moſt needful to be urged, where in the practiſe of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
part doth ſeem to croſſe the truth of that which hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered.
It was an old complaint of one, that there was in his
dayes, <hi>multum ſcientiae,</hi> but <hi>parum conſcientiae,</hi> much ſcience, but
little conſcience; another of later years doth aggravate the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint:
and ſaith, that in his time, the two firſt ſyllables <hi>con</hi> and
<hi>ſci,</hi> were taken away, and nothing remained but the latter end of
the word <hi>entia:</hi> pure beings without knowledge or honeſty; the
complaint is too true at this time; conſcience ſeemeth to be baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from moſt men, and knowledge from may; ſo that nothing is
left but the metaphyſical notion <hi>entia:</hi> mere beings, pure natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts.
They lade themſelves with ſinne, as a cart is loaden with
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:57497:53"/>
ſheaves; and yet they feel no weight. It is ſtoried of <hi>Milo</hi>
of <hi>Croton,</hi> that accuſtoming himſelf every day to carry a calfe into
the fields, he was able to hear it when it became an oxe: and theſe
have ſo accuſtomed themſelves to leſſer ſinnes, that great and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
ſinne, ſeem not a whit burdenſome unto their conſciences.
There is a ſtory of <hi>Mithridates</hi> King of <hi>Pontus,</hi> that he had ſo
uſed himſelfe to take poyſon, that in fine his ſtomack would di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt
it, as well as wholſome meat: and theſe men have ſo inured
themſelves to feed upon ſinne as the monkie doth upon the ſpider,
that they make as good, nay, more reckoning of it then the beſt
meats, wherewith their ſoules ſhould be fed unto eternal life:
wretched and unhappy men, which have their conſciences ſo fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that they cannot feel their ſinnes. Verily, <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and <hi>Cain,</hi>
and <hi>Judas,</hi> and <hi>Caligula</hi> ſhall ariſe againſt theſe at the day of
Judgement and ſhall condemn them. Thoſe ſinnes which they
drink with greedineſſe, even as the beaſt drinketh water, will
one day prove like Ratsbane to poyſon them; they will prove
like <hi>Johns</hi> book, which was ſweet as honey in the mouth, but bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in his belly: or like the head of Polypus which is ſweet in eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but afterward it cauſeth fearful dreams: they will in the end
ſting like a Serpent, and bitelike a Cockatrice; let them not ſay
to their ſoules, peace, peace, when there is no peace; for there is
no peace ſaith my God unto the wicked. When they promiſe
unto themſelves moſt ſecurity, when they ſhall ſay with the fool
in the Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

come upon them, as travail upon a woman with child: when they

Write ſuch a leſſon in their conſciences, that it will make their
countenance changed, and their thoughts troubled, and the joynts
of their loynes looſed, and their knees to ſmite one againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
But to leave theſe, and to make an end of this point. Seeing
that ſinne is ſuch a burden unto our conſciences, let us take head,
that we do not load them too much; if we were fully perſwaded
that ſuch and ſuch meats would cauſe an ague, we would willingly
abſtain from them. Now ſinne cauſeth a greater ſickneſſe unto
our ſoules, then is an ague unto our bodies (<hi>viz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

give thee grace to repent, that ſo thou mayeſt be ſaved: therefore
ſtrive alwayes to hav a good conſcience, and if thou wilt be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
that thine eye becauſe it is the moſt tender, and precious part
of thy body, be not troubled with the leaſt mote: Be much more
careful of thy conſcience (the eye of thy ſoul) that it be not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
with beams of great and horrible ſinnes. Wilt thou never
be ſad? live well; this is the beſt means, to gain the joy and
peace of conſcience. Happy is that man, who when his fatal hour

                  <p>Thus much of the firſt point, his condemnation; I proceed to
the ſecond, his mortification or imperfect repentance.</p>
                  <div type="part">
                     <head>He repented himſelf, &amp;c.</head>
                     <p>THis repentance was an extreme grief of heart, ariſing from
the curſes of the law, and apprehenſion of Gods wrath:
which as it was in <hi>Judas,</hi> ſo was it in <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and <hi>Ahab,</hi> and the
<hi>Ninevites,</hi> and many of the heathen. <hi>Oreſtes</hi> and <hi>Nero,</hi> when they
had killed their Mothers, were exceedingly troubled, and wiſhed
to be clenſed; and <hi>Hercules</hi> in the Tragedy, when he had kill'd his
wife and children, runnes up and down like a madman, and cries
out, that if the whole ſea ſhould runne through his hands, it would
not waſh him from that bloudy fact. So that this is no part of true
mortification, yet it is a preparative thereunto: The wheat muſt
be threſhed with the flayle, before it be fanned from the chaffe
with the wind, and a natural man muſt be as it were threſhed with
the terrours of the law, before he be fanned from his corruptions
with the wind of the Spirit. In natural mutations, before a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial
forme be corrupted, andan other educed <hi>è potentiâ mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riae,</hi>
certain alterations or previal diſpoſitions are required as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
for haſtning of this change. So in a Supernatural mutation
when a ſonne of wrath is to be made a ſonne of God, the terrours
of the law are required as neceſſary precedents for haſtning this
change.<note place="margin">Aug. 1.</note> The law like the ſhoomakers elſon pricks the heart, le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
ſorrowes and fears like the briſtle come after, and true morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
like the thread comes in the laſt place. Take the elſon and
the briſtle from the ſhoomaker, and he cannot uſe his thread take
legal ſorrow and compunction of heart from a natural man, and
he cannot be brought to true repentance. So that <hi>Judas</hi> goes well
thus farre, he goes yet further: he makes confeſſion of his fault,
firſt in general, I have ſinned; then in particular, I have been a tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour,
I have betrayed, and which is worſt of all, I have betrayed
the innocent blood.</p>

If <hi>Judas</hi> this repentance notwithſtanding be damned to hell;
merciful God what ſhall become of thouſands amongſt us, which
go under the name of Chriſtians, and come ſhort of <hi>Judas</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.
They are ſeldome touched with any ſorrow for their
ſinnes, but ſay they be, ſurely not half of that ſorrow that
<hi>Judas</hi> was in; admit they be, come they to the next ſtep: do they
make confeſſion? admit this too, come they to a third; do they
make ſatisfaction? doth the ſacrilegious Church-robber bring
back again that which he hath wrongfully taken from the ſonnes
of <hi>Levi,</hi> and ſay, I have ſinned? doth the bloud-ſucking Uſurer
reſtore that which he hath wrongfully taken from the poor, by
ſundry practiſes of covetouſneſſe, and ſay, I have ſinned? is there
any, who after that he hath done wrong, is ſorry for it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes
his fault, and is ready to make amends, and ſay, thus and
thus have I done, thus and thus have I ſinned? all theſe are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to ſalvation, but theſe are not all that are neceſſary to ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
We muſt go thus farre with <hi>Judas,</hi> but we muſt not here ſtay

and is tumbled into the pit of hell. We muſt go a ſtep further,
and faſten our feet upon the corner ſtone by a true and ſaving faith,
and then our ſinnes be they never ſo many, never ſo grievous,
ſhal not bring us to condemnation, but though they be as Crimſon,
they ſhall be made white as ſnow;<note place="margin">Iſa. 1. 18.</note> though they be red like ſcarlet,

out of which I have made choyce of this one branch. <hi>I

(<hi>ye are Gods</hi>) yet <hi>ſet not up your horns on high, and ſpeak not

me (<hi>I have ſaid:</hi>) and though ye be <hi>Gods,</hi> yet ye are but earthly
<hi>Gods,</hi> ye are <hi>Gods</hi> in office, not <hi>Gods</hi> in eſſence, ye are made of the
ſame metal that others are, and your end ſhall be like other mens
(<hi>you ſhall die like men.</hi>) In which words, not to ſtand upon the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
acceptions of any of them, may it pleaſe you to obſerve theſe
three points. 1. The party from whom Magiſtrates receive their
authority, it is from God, (<hi>I have ſaid</hi>) and Gods ſaying is his
doing. 2. Their preheminence above others, in that they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Gods (<hi>ye are Gods</hi>) 3. The limitation of their dignity, <hi>ye ſhall
die as men.</hi> Out of which I collect theſe three propoſitions.
1. <hi>Magiſtrates and Judges of the earth do receive their authority
from God. 2. They are Gods deputies to miniſter juſtice, and to judge
between party and party. 3. Though they be extolled above their
brethren according to their office, yet they muſt die as other men:</hi>
where is implied this general concluſion, <hi>that it is the lot of all
men, once to die.</hi> Theſe are the pillars of my intended diſcourſe:
of which while I ſhall plainly entreat, in the ſame order, that I
have now propoſed them, I beſeech you all to afford me your
Chriſtian attention.</p>
                  <p>2. Of all the corporeal creatures that God made,<note place="margin">1 Part.</note> none is more
exorbitant then man. The higheſt <hi>moveable</hi> is conſtant in his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
He doth not haſten, nor neglect his courſe. The <hi>Sunne</hi> is
preciſe in his courſe under the <hi>Ecliptick line,</hi> and turneth not an hair
breadth,<note place="margin">Pſal. 19. 5.</note> unto the right hand or unto the left, but <hi>cometh forth as a
bridegroom out of his chamber, and rejoyceth as a gyant to run his
race.</hi> The reſt of the <hi>Planets,</hi> though they turn to both ſides of
the <hi>Zodiacke,</hi> and are (the moſt of them) ſometimes <hi>direct,</hi> and
ſometimes <hi>ſtationarie,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>retrograde</hi> (as Aſtronomers
ſpeak) by reaſon of their motion in their imaginary <hi>Epicicles,</hi> yet
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:57497:58"/>
they have their conſtancie in this inconſtancie. Thou (O God)
<hi>haſt given them a law that ſhall not be broken.</hi> The elements keep
themſelves within their bounds. The beaſts of the forreſt, in their
kinde, have their policie, and ſociety. The raging ſea goes not
beyond his limits:<note place="margin">Job. 38.</note> God hath bound it (to uſe <hi>Jobs</hi> words) <hi>as a
child in ſwadling bands: he hath given it doores, and barres, and
ſaid unto it, hither ſhalt thou go, and thou ſhalt go no further, here
ſhalt thou ſtay thy proud waves.</hi> But man is more exorbitant then
all theſe: no bounds can keep him in. Therefore God hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in the heart, and conſcience of every man, that comes into
the world, a law, which we call the law of nature: as that <hi>God is
to be worſhipped, good is to be embraced, evil is to be avoided. That
which thou wouldeſt not another man ſhould do unto thee, thou muſt
not do to another man.</hi> And according to theſe general notions, hee
would have every perſon to direct his actions. But this law (like
an old inſcription upon a ſtone) is written in the ſtony heart of
man in ſuch blind characters, that he is put to his ſhifts before he
can ſpell it. And howſoever he underſtand it, in <hi>Theſi,</hi> yet in <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſi,</hi>
in the particular, he makes many ſoloeciſmes, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
calls good evil, and evil good. Therefore God hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
with his own finger a paraphraſe upon it, which we cal the
moral law, and added a large commentary of judiciall lawes, by
the hand of <hi>Moſes.</hi> Which benefit (though not the ſame <hi>nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi>)
he hath not onely granted unto Chriſtian Common-wealths:
but even to the heathen alſo, amongſt whom, in all ages, he hath
ſtirred up men of excellent ſpirit to make lawes, for the better go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of their ſeveral ſtates. The beſt of which did acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that they had them from God. Howbeit after the cuſtome
of nations, which held a plurality of Gods, they did not all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
in one name;<note place="margin">Diodorus Siculus.</note> 
                     <hi>Lycurgs</hi> affirming that he received his lawes
from <hi>Apollo, Minos</hi> from <hi>Jupiter, Solon,</hi> and <hi>Draco</hi> from <hi>Miner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,
Numa</hi> from the <hi>Nymph Egeria, Anacharſis</hi> from <hi>Zamolxis</hi>
the <hi>Scythian</hi> God.</p>
                  <p>3. But all this will not confine man within his bounds, for it is
true of him, which was ſpoken of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> that they knew
what was to be done, and yet did it not. And, which was objected
by the <hi>Cynick,</hi> againſt the old Philoſophers of <hi>Greece,</hi> that they
gave good rules, but put none in practiſe.

ſinne, are worthy of death,<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 31.</note> yet they do not only the ſame
themſelves, but alſo favour them that do it. The law of it ſelf is
but a dead letter. It is like a ſword in the warres without a ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier

the <hi>Lion,</hi> when he was faſt a ſleep. Therefore God hath added
the <hi>Magiſtate,</hi> as the life, and ſoule of the law, as a Captain to
manage this ſword. Him he hath made (if I may ſo ſpeak) the
<hi>ſummum genus</hi> of the common-wealth, by two <hi>generical diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences</hi>
of <hi>poena,</hi> and <hi>praemium,</hi> to coarct, and keep his inferiours in

                  <p>4. Now that <hi>they have this authority only from God,</hi> it is a point,
which I hope in this place,<note place="margin">Jam. 1. 17.</note> I ſhall not need long to inſiſt upon. <hi>For
if every good and perfect gift be from above, even from the father
of lights,</hi> much more this excellent, and ſupereminent gift of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning
Gods people, muſt proceed from this fountain. And to
think otherwiſe is but with the <hi>Epicures,</hi> to be of opinion, that
though God made the world, yet the government thereof, he
leaveth to <hi>fortunes</hi> diſcretion to be directed by her. One of the
ſtiles wherewith God is inveſted, is this, that <hi>he is the authour of
order,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>and not of confuſion: if of order then of Civil government,</hi>
ſeeing that an <hi>Anarchie</hi> is the cauſe of all diſorder, and confuſion
in the ſtate. Inſomuch that the reaſon of all the ſinnes that were
committed in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> is often in the book of Judges aſcribed unto
this, that they wanted a <hi>Magiſtrate: There was at that time no
king in Iſrael,</hi> Judg. 17. 6. 18. 1. 19. 1. 21. 25.</p>

It is a miſerable life, to live under a <hi>tyrant</hi> where nothing is
lawfull; but farre worſe, to live in an <hi>Anarchie</hi> where nothing is
unlawfull. But I ſhall not need to trouble my ſelf, or to tire out

This is naught in reſpect of that which followeth. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
God challengeth this as a prerogative unto himſelf, to beſtow
kingdomes on whomſoever he wil, and placeth the Princes of the
earth in authority next unto himſelfe, this they have perforce
taken from God,<note place="margin">2 Theſſ. 2. 4.</note> and beſtowed it upon him, that <hi>ſitteth in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God, and advanceth himſelf, above all that are called Gods.</hi>
It is he to whom (if ye will believe him, and his <hi>paraſites</hi>) all
<hi>power is committed, both in heaven and in earth.</hi> He is that <hi>King of
Kings,</hi> and <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>Lords,</hi> by whom Princes rule, and on whom
the right of Kings dependeth: all nations muſt fall down before
him, and all kingdomes muſt do him homage. The greateſt <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch</hi>
of the earth muſt proſtrat himſelfe before him, and kiſſe his
holy feet. The <hi>Emperour,</hi> if he be preſent when he taketh horſe,

He will not give it unto any other, but only ſo far, as hath he ſome
reſemblance with him. I find onely three in Gods booke, (to ſay
nothing of that eternall eſſence, to which it principally agreeth)
which have this name given them. The firſt is <hi>Satan,</hi> who, by
reaſon of his great and almoſt unlimited power, which he hath for

God. Theſe by reaſon of their ſupereminent offices, are called
<hi>Gods. Thou haſt made him a little inferiour to the Gods,</hi> Pſalm. 8. 5.

by reaſon of the baſeneſſe of his parentage: which when
the king obſerved, he took a <hi>golden baſen,</hi> wherein his gueſts
were wont to waſh their feet, and uſe to ſome homely purpoſes,
and thereof made an image of one of their Gods, and ſet it in an
eminent place of the city; which when the <hi>Egyptians</hi> ſaw (as
they were marvellous ſuperſtitious) they came flocking on heaps
unto it, and worſhipped it. Hereupon <hi>Amaſis,</hi> calling the people
together, told them, that he was like unto that baſen, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
was vile and abject, yet now was worſhipped, becauſe of the
forme it bare: ſo he, though before he was mean, and baſe, yet now
was to be honoured, becauſe he was the <hi>king,</hi> for the perſons ſake
whom he did repreſent. It skilleth not, what the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi>

his ſonne: which when his ſonne obſerved, he ſent a Sergeant, and
commanded him to light, and come on foot, if he would ſpeak
with the <hi>Conſul.</hi> The by-ſtanders thought it great arrogancy in
the young man to be ſo bold with his aged father. But old <hi>Fabius,</hi>
who had experience, what it was to be <hi>Conſul,</hi> knew well, that he
did no more then did beſeem him: <hi>experiri volui fili</hi> (ſaid he)
<hi>ſatin' ſcires Conſulem te eſſe.</hi> It is not for a <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> to debaſe

thus, <hi>Saul hath killed his thouſand, but David his ten thouſand?</hi> In a
word, is it not their aſſertion that <hi>Princes muſt not be ſuffered to

yea by all means poſſible.</hi> And therefore I leſſe marvel, why that
reviling <hi>Rabſhakeh,</hi> that braſen-faced fugitive <hi>Parſons,</hi> who bluſht
not to ſay any thing in his younger years, in his old age took upon
him a kind of modeſty, and durſt promiſe no more for his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
then this; that <hi>there was no impoſſibility for Papiſts to live
in ſubjection, and dutiful obedience unto the king of great Britain.</hi>
For poſſibility it is not the queſtion, but for probability it is no
more, then that the wind, and the ſea, light, and darkneſſe, the
Arke and Dagon, God and Mammon, the unbeliever and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidel
ſhall be together. For what I pray you is it, which knits
men, as it were with chains of adamant, in love amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and in loyalty and obedience unto their Prince? Is it fear
of puniſhment? Oh no, for <hi>malus eſt cuſtos diuturnitatis metus.</hi>
He never reignes long, whom every man feareth; <hi>Caveat multos,
quem timent ſinguli,</hi> let him beware of a multitude whom every
particular dreadeth. Is it hope of reward? not that neither. For
that is often fruſtrated, and then followeth an alteration in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.
It is neither of theſe. It is religion and the true fear of
God. This, this is it which knits the <hi>heterogeneal</hi> parts, of the
ſame kingdome unto the Prince, as the ſeveral parts of mans bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
are by arteries knit, and united unto the heart, and as the lines
of a circle, though they be farre diſtant about the circumference,
yet concurre in one middle point: ſo muſt it be with them.
Though they be different about the circumference of worldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires,
yet muſt they concurre in one common center of religion.
A good Chriſtian common-wealth is like unto <hi>Peters</hi> ſheet,<note place="margin">Act. 10.</note>
wherein were all <hi>manner of four footed beaſts, and creeping things,
and fowles of the heaven.</hi> There are in it all ſorts of men. There
are nobles flying aloft, like the fowles of the heaven; there are of
the baſer ſort, creeping as it were below; and there are of a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
ſort, men of all conditions, and callings. But this ſheet is knit
together (as that was) a the four corners (the moſt diſtant and
remote parts thereof) with the unity of religion.</p>
                  <p>22. This is ſo plain,<note place="margin">Ariſt. Pol. l. 5. c. 11.</note> that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> gives it as an eſpecial rule for
a <hi>Tyrant,</hi> if he mean to continue his government, to make an
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:57497:68"/>
outward ſhew of Religion. For ſuch kings (ſaith he) as ſeem to
be religious, are in leaſt danger of treacherous practiſes by ſuch
as are under them. Now where this unity of religion is wanting,
(as wanting it is, ſeeing we differ from the Papiſts, not in a few
circumſtances, but in ſundry fundamental points of Divinitie)
how can this knot be made faſt? Nay, ſeeing they are ſo far
from counting any Proteſtant Prince religious, that they count
him an heretick; and the more diligent he is in cleanſing and
refining his kingdom from the dregs of <hi>Romiſh</hi> ſuperſtition (as
our Saviour Chriſt was in purging the law from the abſurd gloſſes
of the Scribes and Phariſees) the greater perſecutor he is holden
with them to be of the Catholick faith. Verily I ſee no probability,
I had almoſt ſaid, no poſſibility, that they will hereafter prove
true and dutiful ſubjects to the King of <hi>Great Britain.</hi> They
may well make proteſtations, and outward ſhewes of love, and
duty, and obedience towards the Prince: but <hi>Lupus pilum, non

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:57497:69"/>
I finde no expreſſe mention in Gods book. This I finde, that man
was made of a matter, and that not gold, nor ſilver, pearl or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
ſtones, but of earth, the baſeſt and vileſt of all the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
yea, of the duſt of the earth, even of dry duſt, which is
good for nothing: that if he ſhall with proud <hi>Phaeton</hi> in the
Poet, boaſt that <hi>Apollo,</hi> God is his father, he might preſently
call to mind that poor <hi>Clymene,</hi> the earth is his mother; that he
was made of duſt,<note place="margin">Gen. 2. 7.</note> that he is but duſt, and that he ſhall return to
duſt.<note place="margin">Pſal. 103. 14.</note> And yet I know not how it comes to paſſe, but I am ſure
it is true,<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 19.</note> that many in authority reſemble the duſt in no property
better then one, that as the dry duſt in the ſtreets, is with every
blaſt of winde blown aloft into the air: ſo are their hearts blown
aloft, and ſwelled up with a windie tympanie of their own great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
But let them climbe as high as they can, God will one
day ſend a ſhower, and lay this duſt. They are but natural men;
and the threed of nature (as a Poet feigneth) is tyed unto the
foot of <hi>Jupiters</hi> chair: he can looſe it, when it ſhall pleaſe him.
Though <hi>Adams</hi> wit was ſuch, that he could give names unto
every creature, according to their natures, yet he forgot his own
name. He did not remember that he was called <hi>Adam, homo ab
humo,</hi> by reaſon of that affinity that was between him and the
earth. Theſe ſons of <hi>Adam</hi> are very like their old grand-father,
they are witty in ſeeking out the names, and properties of other
creatures, but they forget their own names, and their natures
too. And this is the <hi>cauſe why they be ſo holden with pride, and
overwhelmed with cruelties.</hi> They will with <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſaiah 14. 13.</note>
ſtrive to advance themſelves above the ſtars of God; and to
match their old grand-father, the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> who though he
was made of earth, yet with the wings of pride and arrogancie
would needs ſoar up into heaven, and care little for reſembling
their elder brother, the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> who took upon him our

nothing but a black boxe full of papers. Procraſtinations, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary
delayes, for filling of the lawyers coffers, and pilling of

might a thouſand times hereafter ere ever it be reformed. For ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
was it more ſpoken againſt then now, and never was it ſo much
practiſed as now. Well fare the old <hi>Athenian</hi> lawes, which (as
<hi>Anacharſis</hi> once ſaid) were like unto Spider-webs, that catched
the little Flies, and let the Waſpe, and the Bee, and the Beetle
burſt though them: in reſpect of them that hold Waſpe, and Bee,
and Beetle and all, and ſcarce any can burſt through them. But
what do I now? Condemn I the law? I do wrong. <hi>Is the law

                     <hi>and juſt, and good, but I am carnal, ſold under ſinne.</hi> So ſay I,
is our law ſin? Nay our law is juſt, and good. Here is the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neck
of all: too many of our Solliciters, Atturnies, and learned
Scribes, are meerly carnal and ſold under ſinne, uſing it not to that
end for which it is ordeined, the glory of God, and the peace of
the common-wealth. But as the fowler doth his net, for catching
of plovers to inrich themſelves withal: making that which
ſhould be for the common good, a <hi>Monopolie</hi> for themſelves, a
profeſſion of mockerie, and a meer ſhop of moſt horrible, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable
covetouſneſſe.</p>
                  <p>But it is the worſt thriving in the world to riſe with an other
mans fall. It was a ſhort, but a ſharp quip, which a captive gave

of the <hi>ſplene</hi> argueth the conſumption of other parts: ſo the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching
of the lawyer, the impoveriſhing of the client. If then
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:57497:72"/>
his cauſe be good (alas) why is it never ended? If it be nought,
why is it ſtill defended? If the cauſe be nought, the defence is
worſe then nought. Underſtand me rightly: it may be a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellours
hap to be a ſpeaker in an ill cauſe, and yet he not worthy
any blame. The party may miſinform him in the truth of the
cauſe. Judgements in the like caſe may be different, or ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
circumſtance may deceive him. But where it plainly appears
to be nought indeed, by nimbleneſſe of wit, and volubility of
tongue, to ſmooth it over with colourable probabilities, thereby
(as farre as thou canſt) to give the truth an overthow, this is but
to guild over a rotten poſt, <hi>to call good evil, and evil good,</hi> to let
looſe <hi>Barabbas,</hi> and deſtroy <hi>Jeſus,</hi> to make the devil, who is a
fiend of darkneſſe, to appear in the likeneſſe of an <hi>angel</hi> of light,
and therefore worſe then nought. Better with <hi>Papinian</hi> to have

                  <p>There is a kind of men in the world, who though they know
before they begin their ſuits, or at leaſt before they have waded
farre in them, as well as they know their own names, and the
number of their fingers, that the matter which they proſecute,
by extremity of law, is manifeſt wrong: yet either out of a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litious
humour, to give their adverſaries an overthrow, or becauſe
their ability is ſuch, that it will hold them out, or becauſe others
do joyn with them, and make it a common quarrel, or becauſe
they love (<hi>Salamander</hi>-like) to be broyling in the fire of conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
can by no means be diſſwaded from their wicked enterpriſe.
This matter ſo wickedly, and miſchievouſly begun, one counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
or other, (that loves (with the Eele-catchers in the old co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie)
to be fiſhing in muddy waters, and deſires alife to bathe
himſelf in any pool that an Angel ſhall trouble) muſt manage. He
muſt find ſome probable title in the law for it: he muſt as long as
the law will afford him any kind of weft, weave it out in length,
and when it fails, he muſt Spider-like ſpinne it out of his owne
bowels. He muſt prolong judgement, and deferre the matter from
one day to another, from one tearm to another, from one year to
another, from one court to another; till at length he who hath
both God, and the law, and a good conſcience on his ſide, for very
wearineſſe, be enforced to give it over, or be brought to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme

beggery, that he can follow his ſuit no longer, or till <hi>Atro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos</hi>
have cut in ſunder the thred of his dayes, and ſo made an end

                        <item>2. Its not enough for a Chriſtian to performe obedience to ſome

                  </p>
                  <p>But before I ſpeak of theſe, I gather from the connexion this
concluſion,</p>
                  <p>That no man can in this life perfectly fulfill the Will of God: <hi>it
followeth thus, becauſe as it is written,</hi> Curſed, &amp;c. <hi>So it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,</hi>

This doe and thou ſhalt live,<note place="margin">Rom. 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 7.</note> and the man that doth theſe things
ſhall live in them: <hi>So that the Apoſtle takes this for granted or

many places of Scripture,</hi> 1 Kings 8. 49. Eccleſ. 7. 22. Pſal. 143.
2. Iſa. 64. 6. Acts. 15. 10. Acts. 13. 39. 1 Ioh. 1. 8.</p>
                  <p>2. It is confirmed by reaſon: the firſt is drawn from the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of nature which is in the beſt Chriſtians; from which wee
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:57497:74"/>
may thus argue, he that conſiſteth of fleſh as well as of Spirit can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

fulfill the Law, no not in his beſt actions, but the beſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
that ever lived, conſiſteth of fleſh as wel as of Spirit, therfore
he cannot fulfill the law. The minor hath been formerly proved.
The Major is plaine, for as he is carnall, he is ſold under ſinne. The
wiſdome thereof is enmity againſt God, for it is not ſubject to the
Law of God, neither indeed can be: Thus it is proved from the
the death of Chriſt; for if righteouſneſſe be by the workes of the
Law, then Chriſt dyed without a cauſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 21. and if they
which are of the law be heires, then ſaith is made void, and the
promiſe is made of no effect, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 14. for he came to fulfill the
law, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 17. which was impoſſible to be fulfilled of us,
in as much as it was weake becauſe of the fleſh: Therefore God
ſent his ſonne in the ſimilitude of ſinfull fleſh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3. But the
Romiſh Sophiſters anſwer, that this maketh againſt the <hi>Pelagians,</hi>
which were of opinion, that a man might by the ſtrength of nature
fulfill the law; not againſt them which hold that this abilitie
comes from grace, and that the good workes of a Chriſtian pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from Chriſt, as the juice in the branches proceedeth from
the Vine.</p>
                  <p>To this I anſwer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. That neither the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> nor theſe againſt whom the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
diſputeth, did altogether exclude grace, and therefore if
it be ſtrong againſt them, it will be of force againſt the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts too.</item>
                     <item>2. Their anſwer is grounded upon a falſe ſuppoſition as that the
works of a Chriſtian doe proceed wholly from Chriſt; for, they
they doe in part proceed from the fleſh, and therefore though as
they are the workes of the holy Ghoſt (who applieth unto
the faithfull the force and efficacie of Chriſts reſurrection, they
be perfect, yet in reſpect of the fleſh they be ſtained and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted.</item>
                     <item>3. Chriſt died for us, not by any inherent, but by his imputed righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe
(which righteouſneſs is applyed and appropriated unto
us principally by the holy Ghoſt, inſtrumentally by faith, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
wee are, incorporate into Chriſt, and ſo partakers of his
righteouſneſſe wee might be juſtified.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>I thinke <hi>Abraham</hi> was as holy a man as <hi>Ignatius</hi> the father of
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:57497:74"/>
Jeſuits, or <hi>Dominicus</hi> and <hi>Franciſcus,</hi> the founders of Friers, in
whom ſaith <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> their very adverſaries can find nothing
that deſerveth reprehenſion, <hi>praeter nimiam ſanctitatem,</hi> ſave
their too much holineſs; and yet it was not his good workes, but
his faith for which he was counted righteous. I know that this
imputative righteouſneſſe, is counted with them a putative and
imaginarie righteouſneſs, but herein the injurie is not done unto us,
but unto him who ſaith, to him that worketh not, but believeth,
in him that juſtifieth the ungodly, his faith is imputed for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe.
Even as <hi>David</hi> declareth the bleſſedneſſe of the man, unto
whom God imputeth righteouſneſſe without workes, ſaying,
<hi>Bleſſed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth no ſinne,</hi> wee ſay
that faith was imputed to <hi>Abraham for righteouſneſſe:</hi> now it is
not written for him only, that it was imputed unto him for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,
but alſo for us to whom it ſhal be imputed for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>A third reaſon, to prove that no man can fulfill the Law, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
all have need to ſay, <hi>forgive us our debts:</hi> who more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
amongſt the old people (ſaith <hi>Auſtin</hi>) then the holy Prieſts,
and yet the Lord commanded them that they ſhould offer ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
for their ſinnes: who amongſt the new people holier then
the Apoſtles? and yet the Lord commanded them to ſay in their
prayers <hi>forgive us our debts.</hi> To this <hi>Bellarmine</hi> anſwereth, that
we may ſay forgive us our debts for veniall ſinnes, which in this
life we ſeldome or never want.</p>
                  <p>But I object. Either theſe ſinnes which they call veniall are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the law of God or not: if the former, then the faithfull doe
not fulfill the Law; if the the latter, then they are not <hi>debita,</hi> and
therefore wee need not ſay in reſpect of them, <hi>forgive us
our debts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This aſſertion is further confirmed by the teſtimonies of <hi>Hierom</hi>
and <hi>Auſtin. Hierom</hi> againſt the <hi>Pelagians lib.</hi> 2. I confeſſe that
there are juſt men, but that there are any without ſinne, this I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;
againe, behold the Apoſtles, and all the faithfull cannot doe
that which they would. <hi>Auſtin de ſpiritu &amp; litera cap. ultimo,
Siquanto major notitia, tanto major dilectio, profecto quantum nunc
deeſt dilectioni tantum perficiendiae juſtitiae deeſſe credendum eſt:</hi> and
<hi>de perfecta iuſtitia, tunc erit plena iuſtitia, quando plena ſanitas,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:57497:75"/>
tunc plena ſanitas, quando plena charitas, tunc plena charitas,
quando videbimus eum ſicuti eſt: neque enim erit quod addetur ad
dilectionem; cum ſides, pervenerit ad viſionem.</hi> And in the ſame book,
as long as there remaineth any carnall concupiſcence, wee cannot
love God with all our heart. Now what theſe Fathers maintained,
was the opinion of the Church at that time. <hi>Bernard</hi> came long
after them, when the Church had gathered much corruption, and
was becom like <hi>Glaucus</hi> the Sea God, who having ſundrie parts of
his bodie worne and conſumed by beating upon the rocks, and
the ſhelves, hath the ſame parts repaired with ſhels, and wreck:
yet what was his opinion in this point, we may gather out of his
fiftieth Sermon upon the Canticles: <hi>Si placet tibi de effectuali
charitate datum fuiſſe mandatum, non inde contendo, dummodo &amp;
acquieſcas tu mihi, quod minime in iſta vita ab aliquo homine poſſit,
vel potuerit impleri.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus wee have proved our aſſertion by reaſon, by Scripture, and
by teſtimonie of the antient Church. <hi>Contra rationem nemo fobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,
contra Scripturas nemo Chriſtianus, contra Eccleſiam nemo pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cificus
ſenſerit.</hi> Againſt reaſon no ſober man, againſt the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
no Chriſtian man, againſt the Church no peaceable man
will judge.</p>
                  <p>Thus much concerning the connexion: Now I proceed to the
firſt propoſition.</p>
                  <p>It is to no purpoſe to begin a good courſe of life, unleſſe thou hold
it out, and continue till the end.</p>
                  <p>For to forſake ſinne for a time, and to returne againe unto it, is
as ill as not to forſake it at all. <hi>If the righteous turn away from his
righteouſneſſe, and commit iniquitie, and doe according to all the
abominations that the wicked man doeth, all the righteouſneſſe that
he hath done ſhall not be metioned, but in his tranſgreſſions that he
hath committed, and in his ſinne that he hath ſinned, in them he ſhall
die,</hi> Ezech. 14. 24. nay, it is farre worſe, for if after they have
eſcaped the filthineſs of the world, they be yet intangled againe
therein, their latter end is worſe then their beginning, for it had
been better for them not to have known the way of righteouſneſs,
then after they have knowne it, to tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ne aſide from the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements
given unto them, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 20, 21. And if we ſinne wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:57497:75"/>
remaineth no ſacrifice for ſinne, but a fearefull looking for of
judgement, and of violent fire, which ſhall devoure the adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 26. And the Apoſtle elſwhere ſaith, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
for ſuch to repent. <hi>Judas</hi> runne well, but Sathan hindred
him, he caſt before him a golden Apple, which brought him out of
his way; it had been better for <hi>Judas</hi> to have been a ſtranger un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Chriſt as <hi>Pilate</hi> was, then to have forſaken him after he was
choſen, for though both of them did moſt grievouſly tranſgreſſe
in that they put to death the Lord of life, yet. <hi>Judas</hi> that delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him had the greater ſinne, <hi>Iohn</hi> 19. 11. as it is in bodily diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;
ſo it is in the ſickneſſe of the ſoule: if the ſick perſon be well
guided, oftentimes there is hope of recoverie; but if while he is
in recovering, he by negligence fall into a relapſe, his diſeaſe is
more dangerous then it was before, and for the moſt part proveth
incureable. Even ſo in ſpirituall ſickneſſes, thoſe that ſleep in their
ſinnes may be awaked, thoſe that are ſick with ſinne may be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
yea, thoſe that are dead in their ſinnes may be raiſed, but if af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they be awaked they begin to ſnort again, if after they be cured,
they fall ſick againe, if after they be raiſed they die againe (this is a
ſpirituall relapſe) their caſe is dangerous, if not altogether deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.
The reaſons hereof are divers.</p>
                  <p>1. Becauſe ſuch men refuſe the meanes of ſalvation, when they,
have been offered unto them, and therefore their ſinne is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
then if they had been hood-winked with a vizard of ignorance,
which though it doth not altogether excuſe, yet doth it extenuate
the offence. This made the Jewes more inexcuſable, in that when
Chriſt offered himſelf unto them, they rejected him. This is the
condemnation (ſaith our Saviour) that <hi>light is come into the:
world, and men love darkneſſe rather then light.</hi> Againe, if you
were blind you ſhould not have ſinne, but now ye ſay we ſee;
therefore your ſinne remaineth.</p>
                  <p>2. Such men commonly ſinne upon preſumption, neglecting
the commandements, contemning the threatnings, abuſing the
patience and long-ſuffering of Almighty God; now theſe ſinnes of
all others (that great ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt excepted) are
moſt pernitious, and therefore <hi>David</hi> prayeth God that he will
keep him from preſumptious ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>3. Such men do crucifie unto themſelves the Sonne of God,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:57497:76"/>
and make a mock of him, they tread under foot the blood of the
Covenant as an unholie thing, they make Chriſt like <hi>Siſiphus</hi> in
the Fable, to begin his worke of redemption anew, after that he
hath once finiſhed it, as if the ſick perſon, after that his Phyſitian
hath recovered his health, ſhould of purpoſe eate ſuch meats as
would renew his diſeaſe, and that to this end, that he may put his
Phyſitian to a new labour, and trie his skillin recovering him again,
or as if a banckrupt after that his friend out of his love hath diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
all his debts, and undertaken to be his ſuretie, he ſhould
of purpoſe runne upon a new ſcore, in hope that his friend will
pay it againe; and therefore (this may be the fourth reaſon) the
Lord giveth them over unto reprobate minds, and vile affections,
to do thoſe things that are not convenient, and to commit iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
even with greedineſs. Now as when the Pillar upon which
the houſe ſtandeth is taken away, the houſe muſt needs fall, and
when the Pilot is removed from the Ship, the Ship will be daſhed
upon rocks and ſhelves, and at length ſink: even ſo when the
Lord ſubſtracteth his graces from them, they preſently fall and
plunge themſelves headlong into the gulfe of perdition. Hitherto
may be added, that thoſe who have once been diſpoſſeſſed of Sathan,
and have begun to imbrace the truth, ſhall of all others be moſt
aſſaulted by Sathan, and to be inflamed with his fierie darts, then he
entreth in, and keepeth poſſeſſion more ſtrongly then he did before.
<hi>When the uncleane ſpirit is gone from a man</hi> (ſaith our Saviour
Chriſt) <hi>he walketh through drie places, ſeeking reſt, and when he
findeth none, then he ſaith, I willreturne into my houſe from whence I
came, which if he find empty, ſwept and garniſhed</hi> (ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him) <hi>then goeth he and taketh ſeven other ſpirits worſe then
himſelfe, and they enter in and dwell there, and the latter end of
that man is worſe then the beginning.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thinke upon this whoſoever thou art, which haſt begun to
leave the world, and profeſſe thy ſelfe a ſcholler in Chriſts ſchool,
beware of backſliding, all downfals are dangerous, be not wearie
of well-doing, but (with the bleſſed Apoſtle) forget that which
is behind, and ſtrive to obtain that which is before, remember
<hi>Lots</hi> wife when ſhe turned her eyes back towards <hi>Sodome,</hi> ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
a Pillar of ſalt, this came upon her for an enſample, and is

of ſinne, which is ready every moment, to call for fire and

that with his melodious harmony, he brought his wife out of

whence ſhe was brought, he loſt her. In vain doth <hi>Orpheus</hi> (I

and doſt thou now not greatly thirſt after it, nor eſteeme more of

vice which thou haſt once forſaken? Thy caſe is dangerous, this is a
ſpirituall relapſe, it had been as good, nay, better for thee, never
to have trodden in the path that leadeth to heaven, then thus to
turne out of the way: the more heedfull muſt thou be in looking
to thy ſteps, and in perſevering in that godly courſe, which thou
once haſt begun, and not with the Iſraelites to ſtart aſide like a
broken bow in the time of temptation, nor to be like the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> which being harniſhed and carrying bows, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
themſelves back in the day of battel.</p>
                  <p>Every block that ſatan can caſt in the way of Hypocrites, will
make them run out of the way as did <hi>Balaams</hi> aſſe, when the Angel
ſtood before him with a drawne ſword in his hand. Is the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
of Chriſt ready to be perſecuted? then there is a Lyon in the
way, they will walk no further; is not the profeſſion of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
like a ladder, whereby they may climbe unto ſome prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
then they will bid it adiew, <hi>Diſcede pietas,</hi> religion be gon,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:57497:77"/>
                     <hi>haec non ſucceſſit, alia tentanda eſt via,</hi> this way proved not ſo well
as was hoped, another courſe muſt be taken in hand, worldly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
on the right hand and on the left, are ſufficient motives to
draw them aſide, they muſt needs divert out of their courſe to
gather a poeſie of theſe flowers, though by that meanes they loſe
the goale of everlaſting felicity; but a true Chriſtian muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
in his courſe, he muſt reſemble the ſunne which comes forth
as a Bridegroome out of his chamber, and rejoyceth as a Giant,
to runne his courſe; and yet in one thing, he muſt be unlike the
ſun, he aſcendeth above the horizon in the morning and travai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
to the meridian, where he ſheweth himſelf in his beſt ſtrength
at noon-day, but from that hour he declineth, and caſteth his beams
more and more obliquelie, waxing faint by degrees, till at length
he hide himſelfe under the weſtern horizon: a Chriſtian muſt not
be like the afternoon ſunne, he muſt ſtill ſtrive towards the top of
Heaven, he muſt never decline: let all the powers of Hell ſtand in
his way, they ſhall never make him runne away, perhaps they
will beate him downe on his knees, but then he fals to prayer; if
they bring him to the ground, then he is humbled, and ſo <hi>Antaeus</hi>
like ſtronger then he was before; perhaps they may violenly drive
him backwards; but yet he will ſtrive againſt them, and paſſe
through the midſt of them, as our Saviour paſſed amongſt the
<hi>Jewes,</hi> when they would have ſtoned him, dangers before him, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors
and worldly preferments behind him, riches on the right hand,
pleaſures on the left hand, all theſe ſhall not make him diſcontinue
his courſe, but with greater ſpeed to flie towards Heaven, as a
Dove into the window, he muſt keep a ſtreight courſe like the
two kine that carried the Arke from <hi>Ekron</hi> to <hi>Bethſhemeſh,</hi> and
turned neither to the right hand nor to the left.</p>
                  <p>Thus have we ſeen what a danger it is for a man to fall into ſuch
ſinnes as he hath once left, to drinke the deadly poyſon of iniquitie
after he hath once been recovered, to runne into the danger of his
ſpirituall enemies, after he hath been once cured of his wounds
that were inflicted upon him, it may here be demanded, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a man relapſing into ſinne, may repent, and ſo be again recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
into Gods favour. <hi>Montanus</hi> the Heretick denied all hope
of ſalvation after a relapſe. This Hereſie was by the <hi>Novatians,</hi>
who for their uprightneſs did proudly tearm themſelves <hi>Catha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri,
Puritans:</hi> The <hi>Donatiſts</hi> who were the right <hi>Cathari,</hi> becauſe
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:57497:78"/>
they deemed their Church love without ſpot or wrinkle, refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to communicate, with ſuch as they ſuſpected to be polluted
with any ſinne. <hi>Tertullian</hi> who was much addicted to the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies
of the <hi>Montaniſts,</hi> inſomuch that in his old age he became a
<hi>Montaniſt,</hi> granteth, that a man may once repent after a relapſe,
but no more then once. And of this opinion ſaith B. <hi>Rhenanus</hi>
were many old writers, and amongſt others, St. <hi>Auſtin;</hi> but <hi>Auſtin</hi>
meaneth only that publick repentance, which he calleth <hi>humilima
poenitentia,</hi> and <hi>Lombard</hi> and the ſchool-men tearm <hi>poenitentia ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lennis,</hi>
which was impoſed onely for ſuch grievous offences, as
whereby a Citie or Common-Wealth was greatlie ſcandalized.</p>
                  <p>And the reaſon why it was but once granted by the Church,
was, leſt the medicine being made too common ſhould leſſe
profit the ſick, as <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaks in an Epiſtle written to <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donius,</hi>
in which Epiſtle he plainly averreth, that a ſinner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſing
after this ſolemne repentance, and afterward repenting
of his fall, may obtaine a pardon at the hands of God. But
wee have a better witneſſe of this point, then <hi>Auſtin,</hi> even
God that cannot lye, who by the mouth of his Prophet hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed,
that <hi>Whenſoever the wicked turneth from his wickedneſſe
that he hath done, and ſhall doe that which is lawfull and right,
he ſhall ſave his ſoule and live.</hi> And therefore be not diſmaied,
thou faint and drooping ſoul, which haſt fallen into ſuch ſinnes,
as were ſomtimes hateful in thine eyes. It may be that Sathan will
object the place of the Apoſtle before cited, <hi>if wee ſinne willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
&amp;c. for anſwer whereof thou muſt know that the Apoſtle
ſpeaketh not of every kind of backſliding; But</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Of that which is committed with a full conſent of the
Will (<hi>if wee ſinne willingly</hi>) and this the child of God after his
converſion can never commit, becauſe he is partly fleſh, and
partly Spirit: ſo that though the carnall part be ſtill
ready to draw him unto moſt hainous and groſſe ſinnes, yet the
Spirit is at his elbow, ready to pull him back againe; it is unto him
as the Angel was to <hi>John</hi> when he was ready to worſhip him,
ſee thou doe it not ſaid the <hi>Angel,</hi> ſee thou doe it not ſaid the
Spirit; or as <hi>Abigail</hi> was to <hi>David,</hi> who met him in the way
as he was going to kill <hi>Naball,</hi> and diſſwaded him from
that bloodie fact: and though it doe not ſtill prevaile, by reaſon
that the fleſh is like an headſtrong horſe, that can hardly be curbed,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:57497:78"/>
yet it prevaileth thus farre, that the Will giveth not his abſolute
conſent to the committing of ſuch ſinnes; and again the Apoſtle
meaneth, not every ſinne wherein the Will yeildeth his full aſſent
(for without doubt the elect before their converſion fall into ſuch
ſinnes) but of a generall, malicious, and purpoſed revolting
from the knowne truth, and a proud and ſcornſul rejecting of the
blood of Chriſt, once offered for ſinne, ſuch as was in <hi>Julian,</hi> who
firſt profeſſed Chriſtianitie, but afterward became a moſt bloodie
Perſecutor of Chriſtians, even till his laſt gaſpe: ſo that when he
was deadlie wounded with an Arrow, and ready to yield up the
Ghoſt, he thruſt his hand into the wound, and threw his blood
into the aire, crying blaſphemouſly againſt the Sonne of God,
<hi>Viciſti Galilee,</hi> O Galilean thou haſt overcome. So that this place
is underſtood of ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt, which ſhall not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given
in this world, nor in the world to come, of which alſo the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
ſpeaketh, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4 5. 6. it is impoſſible that they which were
once lightned, and have taſted of the heavenly gift, and were
made partakers of the holy Ghoſt, if they fall away
ſhall be renewed by repentance. In which places, if every relapſe,
were underſtood; then who ſhould be ſaved, for the deareſt of
Gods Children have ſliden backwards, after their converſion.
<hi>Lot</hi> into inceſt, <hi>Noah</hi> into drunkenneſſe, <hi>David</hi> to murther, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterie,
<hi>Solomon</hi> to Idolatrie, <hi>Peter</hi> to forſwearing his Lord and
Maſter.</p>
                  <p>2. The conſideration whereof made <hi>Conſtantine</hi> bid <hi>Aceſius</hi>
a <hi>Novatian</hi> Biſhop (who refuſed to communicate with ſuch as
had fallen after baptiſme) ſet a ladder for himſelfe to climbe into
Heaven, noting his intollerable pride, as if he and his followers
had guided their feet ſo well, that they had never ſlid after bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme.</p>
                  <p>It is very dangerous to commit ſuch ſinnes as have been once
left and forſaken (as hath been already proved) but yet Gods
Children have no particular priviledge. For Firſt, their inbre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d
corruption; though it be quelled yet it is not killed. And therefo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e
it is ſtill ready to give them the foile, and carrie them captives to
the Law of ſin; again, the cauſes remain, which may move God
to give over his Children a little unto themſelves, and to permit
them to fall, as namely to humble them, to make them more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
implore his help to ſhew unto them their own miſerie
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:57497:79"/>
in relapſing, and to make knowne his owne mercy in forgiving,
but ſtill he is ready to receive them again, if they returne unto him
by repentance. For if he would have us to forgive our Brethren
their treſpaſſes (when they turne unto us and ask forgiveneſs) not
ſeven times, but ſeventy times ſeven times, that is, as oft as they
offend us: much more will the Lord, out of the bottomleſſe depth
of his mercie, pardon his children when they fall, if afterward
they returne unto him by earneſt and unfeigned repentance. And
thus much in effect, the <hi>Novatians</hi> did at length confeſſe, holding
that ſuch as ſinned after baptiſme, were not to be admitted into the
congregation; but yet they ſhould be exhorted to repentance, that
ſo they might obtain remiſſion of ſinne of God, who alone can for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
ſinnes, meaning that if after their relapſe they ſhould repent,
the Lord would have mercie upon them: and this is the difference
betwixt Gods children and revolting hypocrites; theſe when they
fall, they fall away, but Gods Elect though they fall ſeven times,
yet they riſe as often.</p>
                  <p>The fall of the wicked is like the fall of <hi>Eli</hi> from his chaire,
or of <hi>Ieſabel</hi> from the window, it is a breakneck fall, but the fall
of the godly is like unto the fall of <hi>Eutychus,</hi> though they fall
from the third loft, yet they are taken up (though dead) and
ſome good <hi>Paul</hi> by embracing them with the ſweet promiſes of
his Goſpel doth revive them: the wicked are like to the Raven
which (as the vulgar corruptly reades it) went out of the Arke
and returned not, they goe out of the Arke (the Church) and
return not, but feed upon the carrion of this world; but the godly
are like the Dove, they flie ſomtimes out of the Arke (the church
of God) yet when they find no reſt for the ſoles their feet, they
returne again with an olive-branch in their mouthes, like the
Dove, I mean with an humble confeſſion of their offences, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
and hearty prayers unto Almighty God; which when they
do, then <hi>Noah,</hi> the true Preacher of righteouſneſs, will put forth
his hand, and again receive them into the arke. And therefore let
not the weake Chriſtian be diſcouraged with the remembrance
of ſuch ſinnes as he hath faln into after his juſtification, as if now
there were no hope of pardon, but let him proſtrate himſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the throne of God, and with many bitter groanes crie after
this or the like manner. Father I have ſinned againſt Heaven and
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:57497:79"/>
againſt thee, I dare not lift up my impure eyes unto the heavens, the
ſeate of thy majeſty. I am one whom thou haſt vouchſafed to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopt
to be thy ſon, and yet I have never reverenced thee, as a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Father, but like a ſtranger have tranſgreſſed thy precepts,
and neglected thy ſtatutes, ſo that I am moſt unworthy to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
thy ſonne. I am one for whom thou haſt given thine owne,
and only ſonne, Chriſt Jeſus, God and man, the very brightneſſe
of thy glorie, the engraven form of thy perſon, the eſſential word
by which thou madeſt all things, and yet I have been unmindfull of
ſo great a benefit, I have rejected the ſweet promiſes of thy ſons
Goſpel, I have denyed the faith. I have ſinned, Father, I have ſinned
againſt Heaven and againſt thee, I am no more worthy to be called
thy ſonne. I am one whom thou out of the bottomleſſe depth of
thy mercie (many others of better deſert being ſtill leftin dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe)
haſt illuminated with the light of thy word, haſt called unto
faith and repentance, haſt ingrafted into the true Vine; when I was
a wild branch, thou haſt made me partaker of thy holy ſacraments,
and yet theſe ineſtimable Jewels, theſe heavenly treaſures, theſe rich
indowments I have ſet at naught, and trodden under foot: I have
ſinned Father, I have ſinned againſt Heaven and againſt thee, I am
no more worthy to be called thy ſonne. I am one whom thou
haſt waſhed with the blood of thy deare ſonne, whom thou haſt
reſtored to newneſs of life, and yet I have returned like a dog to my
vomit, and with the Sow to the wallowing in the mire: to thee
therefore, to thee belongeth righteouſneſs, but unto me belongeth
nothing but ſhame, and confuſion of face<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet O my God, the
greater my offences are, the more earneſtlie I implore
thy help and the more ſhall thy mercie appeare, if thou par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
and forgive them: I have polluted and defiled all my
wayes, thou O Lord Jeſus which art puritie it ſelfe, which cameſt
into this world to ſave ſinners (whereof I am chief) waſh my
filthineſs, revive my deadneſs, quicken my dulneſs, awake my
drouſineſs, kindle my zeale, increaſe my faith; Lord Jeſus I flie
unto thee, my ſoule gaſpeth after thee as a thirſtie land. <hi>Peter</hi> deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thee, and thou didſt receive him again, the Apoſtles forſooke
thee, and yet thou forgavſt them; <hi>Paul</hi> perſecuted thee, and yet thou
dideſt receive him to mercie: <hi>David</hi> did grievouſly treſpaſſe, and
yet thou O God hadſt pittie and compaſſion upon him, the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi>
oftentimes provoked thee, and yet thou didſt in thy mercie
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:57497:80"/>
forgive them, thy love is not abated, thy bowels of compaſſion
are not leſſened, the bottomleſſe-Ocean of thy mercie is not dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
thou haſt proteſted, and made it to be proclaimed by thy He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rauld
the Prophet, that thou wilt not the death of a ſinner, but
that he turne unto thee and live. Lord, I turne unto thee, receive
me to mercie, let thy favourable countenance once againe ſhine
upon me. And when his heavenlie Father ſhall heare theſe, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that they proceed from an humble and contrite heart, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
he will have compaſſion upon ſuch a prodigall Child, and
fall on his neck and kiſſe him, and bring forth his beſt Robe, even
the Robe of Chriſts righteouſneſſe, and put it upon him, and put
a Ring on his finger, and ſhooes on his feet.</p>
                  <p>Thus farre of the firſt Propoſition; the ſecond followes,
<q>It is not enough for a Chriſtian to perform obedience to ſome of Gods
precepts, and to beare with himſelf wilfully in the breach of
others: <hi>Curſed is he that continueth not in all.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>There were ſome of opinion (as ſaith <hi>Lombard</hi>) that a man
might truely repent of one ſinne, and obtain pardon for the
ſame, and yet continue in another; but theſe did never rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
the nature of mortification, which requires a deteſtation
and forſaking of all ſinne, and not a paring away of ſome, which
may beſt be ſpared: as wee cannot at the ſame time look with one
eye into Heaven, and another unto the earth, ſo may wee not in
ſomethings ſerve God, and in other things be ſervants of ſinne:
when a man ſeeth his houſe on fire, he will not quench ſome part
of the flame, and let the reſt be burning, but he will uſe all poſſible
meanes to extinguiſh all the fire, leſt peradventure if one ſpark be
left, it ſpread abroad, and conſume the whole building. Sinne
is as dangerous to a mans ſoule as fire in the chimny top is dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to the houſe: he that would avoid the danger, muſt not caſt
water in ſome corner, not medling with the reſt but he muſt do his
beſt to quench it all, and not willingly leave one ſpark remaining,
leſt it ſpread abroad, and he at the length be burned with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable
fire. Chriſt never healed any man, but he healed him
all. <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> was poſſeſſed with ſeven Devils, Chriſt
did not caſt out ſix, leaving the ſeventh, but he caſt them out all.
And when a Legion of Devils did poſſeſſe one man, he did not
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:57497:80"/>
deliver him that was poſſeſſed from ſome of them, but from them
all; to teach us (as the Authour of the booke of true and falſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
which goeth under <hi>Auſtins</hi> name, doth moralize the
ſtorie) that he would not have us to forſake ſome of our ſinnes,
but leave them all, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall keep the whole Law</hi> (ſaith
<hi>James) and yet faileth in one point, he is guilty of all:</hi> which place
<hi>Auſtin</hi> underſtandeth of love, which is the fulfilling of the law:
this Expoſition is good; for he that coveteth or ſtealeth, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth
adulterie, loveth not his Neighbour as himſelfe, and <hi>he
that loveth not his Brother whom he hath ſeen, how can he love God
whom he hath not ſeen.</hi> Now of theſe two hang the whol law and
the Prophets. But I ſuppoſe that the meaning of <hi>James</hi> is rather
this, that God would have us to keepe the whole Law, and to
leave no commandement great or ſmall unobſerved. This expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
<hi>James</hi> ſeemeth to approve in the next words, for he that
ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt not commit adulterie,</hi> ſaid alſo, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill,</hi>
now though thou doeſt not commit adulterie, yet if thou killeſt,
thou art a tranſgreſſor of the Law, he then that offendeth in one is
guilty of all, becauſe he offendeth againſt him, who is the law-giver
of them all, and who would have us without reſpect, to obſerve
them all, and like wiſe becauſe he is lyable to that curſe (though
not according to the ſame degree) which ſhall come upon ſuch as
ſhall breake them all. For <hi>Curſed is everie man that continueth not
in all things, that are written in the booke of the Law to doe them.</hi>
God is not like the falſe mother, which would have had the child
to be divided, he will either have all or none, he uſeth not to hire
by halfes, he will either have all our ſervice, or elſe he will have
none at all, wee cannot ſerve him and Mammon too, he likes no
Mermaids, which are half fiſh, and half fleſh, no Ambidexters ſhal
dwell in his houſe, no ſuch Satyrs as can blow both cold and hot
out of the ſame mouth, no ſuch Monſters as the Romane Legate
ſaw at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> which was halfe white, and half black, no
ſuch worſhippers as thoſe <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> which ſerved God and their
Idols, no ſuch Jewes as ſweare by God and by <hi>Malcolme,</hi> no ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificers
like to him in the Poet, which offered one ſacrifice to ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
and another to winter, one to God and another to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill.
(But alas) how farre are the moſt from the practiſe of this
duty. Some (nay the greater part) make no more conſcience of
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:57497:81"/>
ſinning, then an hungrie man of eating his dinner, as if they had
no God but the Devil to ſerve. Others are like thoſe Eaſterne
people called <hi>Coords,</hi> which worſhip both God and the Devill:
God becauſe ſay they he is good, the Devill leſt he ſhould doe
them harm; theſe will with <hi>Herod</hi> fear <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> (the Preacher
of the word) and reverence him, and heare him gladly, and doe
many things which he exhorts them to doe, but they had rather
ſee his head off then part with their beloved ſinnes. <hi>Saul</hi> was
contented at Gods commandement to kill the leane kine of the
<hi>Amalekites,</hi> but the fat and well liking Beaſts he kept. So theſe
at the commandement of the Lord by the mouth of his Preachers
can be contented to kill their leane ſinnes, their little ſinnes, but
they have ſome fat ſinnes they muſt needs enjoy, theſe muſt of
neceſſity be ſpared. <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Syrian</hi> was contented to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
no other God ſave the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but yet he muſt needs
goe with his Maaſter into the houſe of <hi>Rimmon,</hi> the Lord muſt
be mercifull to him in this point; ſo it is with very many which
would be counted good Profeſſors, they can forgoe moſt of their
ſinnes, yet ſome beloved ſinne they muſt needs enjoy, the Lord
muſt be mercifull unto them in this point, the Covetous man can
abſtaine from exceſſe in eating and drinking, but uſurie and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
this is a fat ſinne, he will not kill it, the Lord muſt be
mercifull unto him in this point: the Drunkard can be contented
to hate uſurie and oppreſſion, but he muſt needs drinke till the
wine doe inflame him, oh this is a merrie ſinne, the Lord muſt
be mercifull unto him in this point: the wanton perchance can
be contented to bid them both adieu, but his carnall appetite
he muſt needs obey, this is a pleaſant ſinne, the Lord muſt be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull
unto him in this point; theſe men are like unto thoſe double
pictures, which if they be viewed one way, have the fices of men,
looke upon them another way and they have the ſhape of Foxes
or Goats, or ſome deformed Creatures, behold them directly,
and you ſhall ſee no perfect picture, but a mixture of divers. So
looke upon theſe in ſome of their actions, and you will take them
for good Chriſtians, behold them in other things, &amp; ye will think
them wicked Miſcreants, take a view of all at once, and you ſhall
find a mixture and confuſion of both, but God loves no ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion,
the livery of his Children is white, not party-coloured.
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:57497:81"/>
Some there be that have ſtept a foot further in Chriſtianitie, and
will be loath to commit any of theſe groſſe ſins, but yet they have
ſome little ſinne which they muſt needs enjoy, the Lord muſt be
mercifull unto them in this point. Oh ſaid <hi>Lot</hi> (when he came out
of <hi>Sodome) Let me flee into this little Citie</hi> (Zoar) <hi>behold it is a
little one, and my ſoule ſhall live,</hi> ſo it is with theſe; when with
<hi>Lot</hi> they are fled out of <hi>Sodome,</hi> they muſt needs goe with him
to <hi>Zoar,</hi> when they have left their great and groſſe ſinnes, they
have ſome little one as they call it, oh let them enjoy this and
their ſoul ſhall live, but (Beloved Chriſtian) thou muſt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
what I told thee before, that no ſinne of it ſelf is venial, for
the wages of the leaſt ſinne is death; and therefore thou muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware,
of theſe little ones as well as the other: what helpeth it a
man to eſcape the edge of the ſword, if he ſtab himſelfe with a
pen-knife? to eſcape drowning in the great Ocean, if he drown
himſelf in a little brook? and what will it profit thee to caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the great Cart-ropes of iniquitie, if thou ſtrangle thy ſefe
with the ſmal cords of vanitie? Thou muſt therefore be content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to forgo thoſe little ones, a great beam will put out a mans eye,
ſo may a mote too; a great flame may burn a houſe, ſo may a ſmall
ſparkle, a cart-rope may ſtrangle a man, ſo may a ſmall cord: a
ſword will take away the life of the ſtrongeſt man, and ſo may a
little pen-knife, nay the point of a needle: a Canon ſhot may mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a man, ſo may the ſhot of a pocket dagg; the deep Ocean
may drown a man, and ſo may a ſmal River. It is even ſo with ſin,
the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> were as ſurely drowned that laid dead on the
ſhore, as thoſe that were overwhelmed in the deep, ſo the leaſt
ſinne without repentance, drowns a man in the gulfe of perdition,
as well as the greateſt; and let me add this which is a moſt certain
truth (though at the firſt it may ſeeme a paradox) that more are

but theſe being breaches of Gods law, are in their own nature
mortall, and unleſſe repentance follow them, they are ſure to
bring death with them; not that theſe are more grievous in their
own nature then thoſe, or did more provoke Gods wrath, the
contrary is true in both, but becauſe they often find mercie when
the other doe not, becauſe they are often accompanied with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
when the other are not, and it is not the greatneſſe or
littleneſſe of the ſinne, that makes it mortall or venial; but the
continuance in it or forſaking of it, he that continueth in his ſin

that have been overtaken with grievous and crying ſinnes, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

been humbled, and upon their humiliation pardoned, and ſo their
mortall ſinnes made venial, whereas theſe leſſe ſinnes, wherein

bleſſe themſelves with the fancie, that they are free of many hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous

theſe, theſe I ſay bring many milions to hell: experience ſheweth
that many dangerous wounds being timely looked unto are cured
whereas the leaſt, as a ſtab with an Aule, or prickle of a black

not life; So the greateſt ſinne, ſoundly and timely repented ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
pardon, whereas the leaſt neglected as if there were no
danger, becauſe of it ſelf not ſo dangerous, brings death on the

                  <p>Thus much concerning the ſecond propoſition; the laſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition

meane divine and Apoſtolicall traditions, theſe wee reverence
and receive as well as they (<hi>viz.</hi>) if they be expreſly delivered
in the Scripture, or may by neceſſary conſequence be thence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:
this is not their meaning, but ſuch as are not written, but
only ſaid to be delivered by Chriſt and his Apoſtles: very well
but ſeeing the ancient received ſome for divine and Apoſtolical,
which are not rejected even by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as abſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

<hi>Bellarmine</hi> gives me a good rule, that is, without

in thoſe Churches where is a continued ſucceſſion of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
from the Apoſtles, where is that, marrie, onely in the
Church of <hi>Rome. Et ideo ex teſtimonio hujus ſolius Eccleſiae ſumi

proving of Apoſtolicall traditions.</p>
                  <p>This is the ſtrongeſt ſtake that ſtands in the Popes hedge, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low

is an individuall act, and admits of no degrees, yet
ſanctification comes by parts and degrees, for it fareth with him
as it doth with cold water when it is made hot by fire, as the cold
is by degrees expelled, ſo is the heate brought in by degrees, <hi>om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis
remiſſio eſt per admiſſionem contrarii:</hi> In like manner, as the
old man, which like the earth is cold, periſheth, ſo the new man,
heated by the fire of the ſpirit, quickneth and reviveth; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,

                  <p>One indeavouring to captivate and deſtroy the other ſo it is
betwixt theſe two, the ſpirit indeavoureth to conquer the fleſh,
but like a naturall agent <hi>agendo repatitur,</hi> it ſuffereth blows of the
fleſh which rebelleth againſt it, and leadeth it captive to the law of
ſinne, only here is the difference, that two contrary qualities may
be ſo tempered, as that a mean conſiſting of both, and not ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fically
diſtinguiſhed from both, may be produced of them, but
the fleſh and the ſpirit will never make one, and therefore the
ſpirit ſaith to the fleſh, as <hi>Alexander</hi> did to <hi>Darius,</hi> who offered
him half of his kingdome, ſo that he might quietly enjoy the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
half, but as one world cannot have two ſuns, ſo one kingdom
muſt not have two kings, and therefore 'twil endeavour utterly to
diſpoſſeſſe the fleſh, and depoſe it from its eſtate which it hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

it can no more live in agreement with the fleſh, then <hi>Sarah</hi> could

this world, ſo long there is a contention betwixt the regenerate
and carnall part, the fleſh which like a <hi>Zopyrus</hi> keeps within the
wals of the City,<note place="margin">Herodot.</note> is ever ready to betray him unto his enemies
hands, it is to him as the <hi>Canaanites</hi> were to the Iſraelites, thorns

then peradventure I could have hid my ſelfe from him, but it is
thou my guide and mine own familiar friend (my fleſh) which
eateſt my bread, that lifteſt up thy heele againſt me; on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide the ſpirit ſeeks to root out the earthy affections and
luſts of the fleſh, as the Hebrews by little and little rooted out
the Cananites, it ſeeketh to repreſſe this rebellion, as <hi>David</hi> did
the plots of his ſon <hi>Abſalom.</hi> Experience we have in the main
pillars of the ſpirituall Temple; <hi>David</hi> a man after Gods owne
heart, ſo moved at the proſperity of the wicked that he begins to
ſay,<note place="margin">Pſal. 73. 13.</note> that certainly he hath cleanſed his heart in vain, and waſhed
his hands in innocencie, there is a carnall <hi>David,</hi> which make his
feet almoſt to goe, and his ſteps well-nigh to ſlip, but when he
goeth in the Sanctuarie of God, then he underſtandeth the end of
theſe men; there is ſpirituall <hi>David,</hi> which makes him condemn
his former thoughts and ſpeeches; ſo fooliſh was I and ignorant,
even as it were of a Beaſt before thee. <hi>Peter</hi> who ſometime was
ſo confident as to continue true unto his Maſter, that he made
proteſtation, that if all ſhould deny him, yet he would never doe
it, preſently after he begins to follow afarre off, and anon after
the rock of <hi>Peters</hi> faith, is ſo ſhaken with the voice of a damoſel,
that he begins to curſe and ſweare,<note place="margin">Mat. 26.</note> that he never knew him; but
preſently again at the crowing of a Cock, the ſpirit is awakened,
and goes about to take ſome avengement of the fleſh,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 2.</note> he went
out and wept bitterly; who more ſtrong in the ſpirit then <hi>Paul</hi>
was, in zeale fervent, in labours abundant, in nothing inferiour
to the chief Apoſtles, and yet he hath given him a prick in the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:57497:87"/>
fleſh, the Meſſenger of Sathan to buffet him, which makes him
ſay when he would doe good,<note place="margin">Rom. 4. 23.</note> evill is preſent with him, and that
he finds a Law in his Members, rebelling againſt the law of the
mind, and carrying him captive to the law of ſinne; and good
reaſon it ſhould be ſo, for if the ſpirit ſhould ſo domineer over the
fleſh, then there were no reſiſtance and reluctation, then would
we not have an earneſt and longing deſire, to be out of this world,
we would not with the faithfully ſay,<note place="margin">Revel. 22. 22.</note> 
                     <hi>Come Lord Jeſus, come quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
we would not deſire to be cloathed with our houſe which is
from Heaven, but would ſay as <hi>Peter</hi> did, <hi>Maſter, it is good for
us to be here.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mark. 9. 5.</note> To end then; that wee ſhould long after our future
perfection, when corruption ſhall put on incorruption, and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallity

though the fleſh be ſtill luſting againſt the ſpirit, and we have
more fleſh then ſpirit, for fleſh is like to <hi>Goliath,</hi> &amp; the ſpirit is like
to little <hi>David;</hi> yet the ſpirit ſhall be in the end ſure to prevaile,
as <hi>David</hi> prevailed againſt <hi>Goliath,</hi> for though it be little in quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
yet it is fuller of activity, as a little fire hath more action
(though leſſe reſiſtance) then much earth: for it fareth with
theſe two, as with the houſe of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> the ſpirit like the
houſe of <hi>David,</hi> waxeth ſtronger and ſtronger, but the fleſh like
the houſe of <hi>Saul,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Sam. 3. 1.</note> waxeth weaker and weaker, it is with them
as it was with <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> and Chriſt, I muſt decreaſe (ſaith <hi>John</hi>)
but he muſt increaſe, the fleſh which like <hi>John</hi> is before, it muſt
decreaſe, but the ſpirit which like Chriſt comes after, whoſe
ſhoe latchet the fleſh is not worthy to looſe, it muſt grow and
increaſe, and this is plain, and of this place; for whereas the fleſh
objecteth, that man is ſick and periſheth, and where is he? and
again, <hi>If a man dye ſhall he live again?</hi> the Spirit replyeth,
and puts the fleſh to ſilence, <hi>All the dayes of my appointed

                  </p>
                  <p>Is it true beloved Chriſtians,<note place="margin">Uſe 1.</note> That the Children of God, yea
even in ſuch as have obtained the greateſt perfection that a meer
man hath obtained in this life, there is reluctation between the
fleſh and the ſpirit: Oh then let as many of us as long after life,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:57497:87"/>
and deſire to ſee good daies, even life everlaſting, and daies which
never ſhall have an end: Let us, I ſay, labour to ſubdue this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,
and bring it into ſubjection to the Spirit; for it is the Spirit
that quickeneth, the fleſh will profit nothing: The fleſh is like
<hi>Caligula,</hi> (who as <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſaith of him) was a good ſervant, but
an ill maſter: It will be a good ſervant if we keep it in ſubjection
to the ſpirit,<note place="margin">Tacit. Annal.</note> but it will be an exceeding bad maſter if it once get
the upper hand; and it will uſe the ſpirit as the <hi>Scythians</hi> ſervants
dealt with their maſters, who when their maſters had for many
years warred in the Southern parts of Europe and Aſia,<note place="margin">Juſt. l. 2.</note> in the
mean time married their wives, and got poſſeſſion of whatſoever
they had; and therefore we muſt uſe it as theſe <hi>Scythians</hi> uſed
their ſervants, who when they could not prevail againſt them
with open war, at length handled them like ſervants and ſlaves,
took rods and beat them, and ſo recovered their ancient poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
We muſt not proceed againſt the fleſh as againſt an equal
enemy; but we muſt uſe rods and ſcourges, we muſt chaſten and
correct it, and ſo bring it again in ſubjection to its lawful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander:
It is like the dumb divel, which could not be caſt out
but by prayer and faſting: we muſt implore the aſſiſtance of
Gods ſpirit (being of our ſelves unable) that we may be ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened
and enabled to overcome it;<note place="margin">Mat. 17.</note> we muſt by faſting withdraw
its food wherewith it is nouriſhed; I do not mean only our meat
and drink, but all worldly delight, and enticing allurements to
ſin: wanton and idle ſpectacles they be food of our carnal eyes,<note place="margin">Job. 31.</note>
theſe we muſt withdraw away, and with <hi>Job, Make a covenant
with our eyes that we will not look upon wantonneſs;</hi> fooliſh and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent
ſpeeches be the delight of the tongue; thoſe we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move

our mouthes, and keep the dore of our lips:</hi> In a word, whatſoever
will be an incitement to ſin, and is like to ſtrike fire in the tinder
of our corrupt affections, that muſt be debarred, and kept from
them. Let us then uſe the fleſh as the enemy uſeth a beſieged
City, obſerve and watch the by-wayes, that there be no inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
or ſecret compact between it and Sathan, that there be
no proviſion carried by Sathan and his vaſſals into it, that ſo it
may be inforced to yeild it ſelf, or as the Hunters uſe Mole and
Foxes in the earth, ſtop the paſſages that through hunger it may
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:57497:88"/>

delights wee pamper it, what doe we but arme our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
againſt us, and <hi>Goliath</hi> like, give him a ſword for the cutting

                  <p>Againe,<note place="margin">2. Vſe.</note> Is it ſo, that in the regenerate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo long as he remaineth
in this earthly Tabernacle, there remain not ſome few reliques,

the fleſh and the ſpirit? where then be the Papiſts which
maintain juſtification by works? <hi>Can a clean thing come out of that

wherein the fleſh and the ſpirit are mixed together, produce any
effect which is not impure and imperfect? and therefore farre

the Law, I do not ſay that they are ſinnes (that is but a ſlander
of the Papiſts) but they have ſome degrees of ſins and imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions

find ſo many ſins and imperfections lurking in every corner of our

on the right hand, that becauſe our years are determined we

God, we muſt not think that wee can keep our ſelves in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,

which is a ſeparation of the body from the ſoul, but an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
death which is a ſeparation both of bodie and ſoule

Ocean of the riches of the mercie, and bountifullneſs
of our God, who by the balme of Chriſts blood hath ſo tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
this popſon (that like Treacle which is made of vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous

God,<note place="margin">Aug. de civit. dei lib. 5. c. 4.</note> the puniſhment of ſin is to us turned, to a freedom from
ſin; it was ſaid to our firſt Parents (ſaith <hi>Auſtin</hi>) thou ſhalt dye

then it was ſaid, if thou tranſgreſſe the commandement thou

that they ſhould not ſin, is now to be undergon leſt they ſin,
then death was gotten by ſinning, now juſtice is fulfilled by

wicked, to the wicked it hath the ſame force which before
it had, to the godly it is like a ſleep which reſteththeir bodies,
and makes them more lively then before, to the ungodly it

                  <p>Concerning the firſt, The Church of God is called a Flock of

Oh theſe are high points of wiſdome: And as under the fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt

the Dove is from being a great States-man, or wiſe Politician: and

If the heart be full of deceit and hypocriſie, will there be truth in

our indifferent <hi>Apelles,</hi> our hollow-hearted Interimiſt, our luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm
Laodicean; which howſoever he make an outward ſhew
and profeſſion of Religion, yet he counts no more of it, then the
Gaderens did of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Matth. 8.</note> who made more reckoning of their ſwine
then they did of him: And this man rather then for Chriſts cauſe
he ſhould loſe a ſwine, hee can be contented that Chriſt ſhould
part out of his Coaſts. He will make an outward ſhew to the
world as if he did love and reverence the truth: he will perform
the outward works thereof as farre as the law of man binds him,
but all without a ſimple and ſincere heart, only upon ſome ſini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
reſpects, and indifferent conſiderations. As 1. becauſe he will
not be ſingular, but deſires to live at unity with the people with
whom he converſeth. 2. For feare of humane Laws. 3. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
is to him as a faire Cloak to a beggerly Swaggerer, it hides
his rotten rags, and keeps him from wind and weather. 4. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure
it ſerves him as a ladder to advance him unto ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerment,
and as ſoon as he hath attained the top of his hopes, he
cares not though he puſh it down with his heels.</p>
                  <p>Now becauſe he makes no account of Religion, but only as an
inſtrument to effect his owne private purpoſes, hereupon it falls
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57497:98"/>
out, that he is ready to embrace any Religion, or no religion, as the
circumſtance of perſons, time and place ſhall require. For as they
fable of the Sea-god called <hi>Proteus,</hi> that he doth always reſemble
the colour of the Rock upon which he lies, or as Glaſs reflects the
viſage of him that ſhall look upon it, or as water forms it ſelfe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the faſhion of the veſſel into which it is powred: ſo
he is always ready to joyne in profeſſion with them with whom
he liveth and converſeth; the reaſon in all is the ſame, the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
and the Glaſſe have no perfect colour nor viſage of their owne,
and therefore they reflect the colour and viſage of others that are
next unto them. The water hath no figure of his owne (for <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midum
ſuis terminis non eſt terminabile</hi>) and therefore it applies
it ſelfe to the veſſel that contains it: And this man hath no Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
of his owne, it is enough for him if he have ſome ſpecies and
reflection thereof from others. By this unſtableneſſe and muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of profeſſion, may this hypocrite be diſcerned, and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
from a true Profeſſour. For as wild Apes are catched
while they imitate the motions and dancing of men: ſo may this
ſame Ape be catched and diſcloſed by framing his Religion to the
diſpoſition and affection of others: For though hee hath no man
ſave himſelfe in his <hi>Pater Noſter,</hi> yet hee hath every man in his

Judgement, ſucketh the blood from guiltleſſe <hi>Naboth?</hi> If there
be, (as I hope there will) a <hi>non eſt inventus</hi> returned upon all
theſe. Let me go a little further: Is there any <hi>Ambidexter,</hi> that
can play with both hands? Any <hi>Satyr,</hi> that can blow both cold
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57497:99"/>
and hot out of the ſame mouth? Any <hi>Jew</hi> that can ſwear by <hi>God,</hi>
&amp; by <hi>Malchom?</hi> Any <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> that can ſerve God and his Idols? Is
there any that can be contented to hear a Sermon in the Church,
and to ſee a Maſſe at home? That yoaketh an Oxe and an Aſſe in
the ſame Plow, and weareth Linnen and Woollen in the ſame
Garment, and ſoweth his field with mingled ſeeds? To ſpeake
plain Engliſh, that hath not <hi>Joſhuah's</hi> reſolution; <hi>I and my houſe
will ſerve the Lord,</hi> but comes himſelfe to Church, leaves his
wife to ſay over her Beads at home, and permits to his children
and familie, greater liberty in their Religion, then in their Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
to shape what faſhion they like beſt? I pray God there be
no ſuch, if there be, I pray God turn their hearts, that there may
be no ſuch: but thoſe that will, maugre what can be ſaid or done
unto them, continue ſuch, and hang like a Thiefe upon a Gibbet
between Heaven and Hell, God and the Devil, the Pope and the

to any particular perſons what ſoever (he that knows the thoughts
of my heart, knows that I lie not) my worſt wiſh to any of you
is the ſalvation of his own ſoule in the day of Jeſus Chriſt. I am
perſwaded far better things of many of you, and for others, as
far as charity binds me, I judge the beſt; and therefore if any be
offended at my ſpeech, it is <hi>ſcandalum acceptum non datum,</hi> not
I, but his owne guilty conſcience that deſerves the blame. If I
ſhould in this place ſeek to pleaſe man, I were no fit Ambaſſador
of Chriſt: As long as the Chyrurgeon works according to the
rules of his Profeſſion, let his <hi>Patient</hi> weep, and cry, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain

                  <p>But let us come to the other Hypocrite, which I called the

unconſcionable dealer makes the Law his Patron, the oppreſſing
Land-Lord makes her his Sanctuary, the deceitful bargainer, makes
her his ſtalking horſe, the bloody Revenger makes her his
ſword and buckler, to offend his Enemies and defend himſelfe,
and thus ſhee that is ordained for a publick good, proves the
hurt of many, ſhe that is the Miſtris of Juſtice proves the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
of injuſtice, ſhe that is a Preſerver of Peace, proves a
Trumpet and an occaſion of War, not that of her ſelfe ſhe is any
ſuch cauſe, no no, but as the middle region, which of all the
three is the coldeſt, by antiperiſtaſis produceth the hotteſt effect,
Thunder and Lightening, as water which naturally doth quench,
being poured upon lime, cauſeth it to burn, as the morall Law,

                  <p>All the blame hereof reſts upon the heads of two men, the
wrangling Client, the unconſcionable advocate; the 1. is that <hi>Ahab</hi>
that troubles all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who is, as <hi>Jeremia</hi> ſpeakes of himſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
another occaſion, a contentious man, and a man that ſtrives
w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> the whole world, that rough <hi>Iſmael,</hi> that hath his hand againſt
every man, and every mans hand againſt him, that <hi>Salamander</hi>
that loves to be bryling and broyling in the fire of contention,
<hi>Et lachrymas mittit cum nil lachrymabile cernit,</hi> he is never
well but when he is doing or plodding ſome ill, he goes to
Law, not out of a deſire of publick peace, (for what hath he to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57497:100"/>
do with peace, he may ſay, as <hi>Nero</hi> did when he ſet <hi>Rome</hi> on
fire, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that it go well with him, he cares not if the
whole world be ſet on fire, not out of an honeſt defence of his own
Right (for his own conſcience tels him he hath none) but either of
a deſire of revenge, or becauſe he knowes himſelfe to be more
skilfull in packing and ſhuffling of Cards, then the party with
whom he is to play, or preſuming upon his own purſe, or upon
the ſimplicity of his Adverſary, or out of an hope by ſpinning
<hi>In infinitum</hi> the thred of contention, and bringing his oppoſite
into an inextricable maze of troubles, to inforce him, either wholy
to depart from his own right, or to ſay of it, as the Whore did of
the child, <hi>Let it neither be mine nor thine, but let it be divided,</hi>
or at leaſt (which is the ordinary work that ſuch Archers aime at)
to draw him to a Compoſition. This is ſometimes ſacriledge, when
it is for depriving the Church of her right, ſometimes theſe, when
it is for ſtripping men of their lawfull Rights, ſometimes murther,
when it is out of a deſire of Revenge, ſometimes other ſinnes, when
other ends are propoſed, ſhrowded and ſheltered under a cloak
of Law.</p>
                  <p>Well, the cauſe cannot be ſo bad, ſo repugnant to common E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
to Law, to Honeſty, to Conſcience, but ſome will be found
to ſollicite it, and not only privately to countenance and ſupport
it, but publickly, if need ſo require, to plead and report it; this is
done by ſuch as makes his vocation a <hi>Monopoly</hi> for himſelfe,
and levels all his paines, not at the publick good, but at his private
gaine, and in his heart applauds that ſaying of <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> to his
ſon <hi>Titus,</hi>

Of both theſe I may well uſe the words of the Heathen Orator,<note place="margin">Tull. off. lib. 1.</note>

                  <p>In the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> the third,<note place="margin">Fox. Acts ult.</note> there was a Phamphlet

The Aſſes confeſſor. The Argument is this, The Wolfe, the
Fox, and the Aſſe goe to Shrift, and doe pennance: Firſt, the
Wolfe confeſſeth himſelfe to the Fox, who doth both abſolve
him, and extenuate his faults; then the Fox makes confeſſion to
the Wolfe, who obtaines like favour; at laſt comes the Aſſe, and
makes his confeſſion, who as his fault was leſſe, ſo the more he
expected abſolution. And what was his fault? marry this: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very hungry, he had pulled a Straw out of the Sheafe of a
Pilgrim that was travelling towards <hi>Rome;</hi> this is no ſooner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed,
but it is made a capitall crime:

                  <p>Such, as for which he muſt have the rigour of the Law, and
that is to be ſlaine and devoured. The Author of that Book did,
no doubt, obliquely gird the Pope, whom he meant by the Wolf,
and his Prelates, whom he underſtood by the Fox. I thinke we
may not unfitly apply it to the perſons whom we have in hand:
The wrangling Client is the Wolfe, the unconſcionable Advocate
is the Fox, the plain dealing man is, I would ſay the Sheep, but
the Fable calls him an Aſſe, and indeed he is made the Aſſe, and
inforced to beare the burden away: The Fox and the Wolfe
ſhrive themſelves one to the other, and all their ſins are minced
and qualified, mountaines with them are but Mole-hills, blocks
in their wayes are but ſtraws, beams in their eyes are but motes,
great ſins are little ſins, and little ſins are no ſins: Let the
poore ſilly Aſſe when he comes to ſhrife, the leaſt wrong that
can be pretended, eſpecially if it be againſt one of them, though
it be but the turning of a ſtraw, <hi>Immenſum ſcelus eſt, &amp;c.</hi> It is
an action of Treſpaſſe, and unleſſe he will compound for the
wrong that he hath done, he muſt undergoe the rigour of the
Law.</p>

So then, as there are many Beames proceeding from the ſame Sun,
yet one Sun, in which they are United, many branches growing

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57497:102"/>
Rivers, yet one Sea wherein they all meet, many lines in a circle,
but one Center wherein they all concur: So the Members of
Chriſts Church, though in reſpect of themſelves they be divers,
yet they have all but one beginning, one Spring, one roote, one
Head, one Center, and in this reſpect all but one; as one in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of the Head, ſo in reſpect of the Spirit, which animateth
every Member thereof. This is the ſoule that informs the whole
Church, it is that <hi>Intellectus agens,</hi> of which Philoſophers have
ſo much dreamed, which is <hi>Vnas numero,</hi> in every Member of
Chriſts myſticall Body: So that as the integrall Members of

of them having a peculiar, eſſentiall, and ſpecificall form, yet
being informed with one humane Soule, they are but integrall
parts of the ſame man: So all Chriſtians in the World, though

mercy Seate, that is Chriſt, the two great lights that inlighten
the World, the old, like the Moon, to rule the night, the new,
like the Sun, to rule the: day that for the Patriarks, this for us,
the two Pillars to leade us from <hi>Egypt</hi> to <hi>Canaan,</hi> the old of
a Cloud, dark and obſcure in figures and ſhadowes, the other
of fire, bright and cleare, both of them making one, and abſolute
rule of our faith and profeſſion: ſhe is then one, becauſe one
ſpirit quickeneth her, one, becauſe one rule directeth her; that
is, the eſſentiall form, this is the proper paſſion flowing from
this form, by which the Church a <hi>Poſteriori</hi> may be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated,

Euſeb. lib. 10. hiſt. Eccl. Chap. 3. in ſomuch that as when any
member of the body is ill affected, all the reſt do conſpire to cure
it: or when a houſe is ſet on fire, the whole town will run to
quench it: So if any hereſie happened to ſpring in any part of
the World, their common deſire was to cruſh the ſerpents head, to
make it like <hi>Ionas</hi> his gourd, of ſhort continuance, and to ſmother
it in the birth, and make it like the untimely fruit of a Woman,
which periſheth afore it ſee the Sun: they did conſpire to heale
the affected member, and did concu to ſtay the flame from fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                  <p>Thus did they from the moſt parts of the world concur at

And long before theſe times, when as yet there was

                  <p>But now (O times) the one, and undivided ſpouſe of Chriſt
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57497:103"/>

the Orient,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.</note> and the Occident, each differ from other in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
materiall, and eſſentiall points of Faith. And here in the
Weſt, that Church whoſe faith was once famous through the
whole world, which was as a Beacon upon an hill, a guide for all
the Churches round about her, a Sanctuary for orthodoxall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iles,
one of the four Patriarchicall Seas, and that in reſpect of place
and order, the firſt; the Empreſſe of the World, the Glory
of Kingdomes, the pride and beauty of Nations, the faithfull
City, is ſo eſtranged from the Bridegroomes Voice, and hath ſo
depraved the purity of Chriſtian religion, both by looſing of her

muſt ſhee be called the only Catholike Church of Chriſt, and all
others that diſſent from her, although they do conſent with

us to have turned from the truth; when it is not we, but their

three points of difference made; and thoſe not of ſuch moment,
but that a reconciliation might have been made, if a charitable
conſtruction had been admitted on both ſides. It's worthy the

there was debare between the Herdſmen of <hi>Abrahams,</hi> and the
Herdſmen of <hi>Lots</hi> Cattel, <hi>The Canaanites and the Pereſites dwelled

to make a pacification: <hi>Let there be no strife between thee

nothing but Goſpel. Marry if he be walking, or riding, or ſitting
at Table, he will talk as madly as any of his Cardinals. Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

by a Pope: and ſhall I take this for an undoubted truth,
that whatſoever is there decreed is univerſally received amongſt
Papiſts? Oh but the very Councell it ſelfe, though it hath been
ſundry times attempted, yet could it not be received into the
Kingdome of <hi>France,</hi> nor is as I ſuppoſe to this day. Yea, and
in <hi>Italie</hi> and <hi>Spaine</hi> too, both private Doctors, yea and Popes
too have croſsed the determinations of that Conventicle. I will
inſtance in one particular; the Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> commands that
the old and vulgar edition ſhall be received for authenticall, and
that no man under any pretence whatſoever, ſhall once dare or
preſume to reject it. And yet <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> a great Champion of
that Synagogue, holds that in foure caſes it is lawfull to appeale
from it to the Original Languages: and <hi>Azorius, Vega, Sixtus
Sinanſis, Canus, Lindanus,</hi> and divers others ſince that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
do aver, that in that edition there are many groſſe errours,
and ridiculous Soloeciſmes, not only by the negligence of Writers
and Printers (which the <hi>Lovanianiſts,</hi> and <hi>Colonianiſts</hi> have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the Margent) but by the negligence and ignorance of the
Interpreter himſelfe: yea and Popes themſelves contrary to the
Precept and Decree of that Synod, have reviſed and corrected
the ſame. For about 43. years after the firſt publication of this
Decree,<note place="margin">Dr. James.</note> 
                     <hi>Sixtus</hi> 5. did review and correct the whole Bible; and
publiſhing it in the laſt yeare of his Popedome, did command
that that of his ſhould for evermore ſtand in force, upon paine
of the great Curſe: and yet within three years after this comes
<hi>Clement</hi> 8. with a new Edition in many hundred of places, diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
from that of <hi>Sixtus,</hi> the diverſities whereof being gathered
together by a painful Antiquary into a Book, which he intitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
<hi>Bellum Papale,</hi> doe make a pretty volume; and this latter
muſt (I trow) upon no leſſe penalty be received for authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call.
Theſe be they that boaſt of unity, and make Conſent a
mark of the Church.</p>
                  <p>But let us grant that unto the Papiſts which they are never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to make good, that <hi>Rome</hi> is at Peace with her ſelfe, will it
hence preſently follow, that that Church is this little Flock?
Theeves and Robbers are at peace amongſt themſelves, and true
men may goe to Law one with another. The Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees,
yea <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> agreed in crucifying Chriſt: <hi>The</hi>

Princes and Dukes and Judges, and all agreed in the dedication
of the Image which <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> bad ſet up; they muſt
either be at peace with God, or their braggs are winde: There
is no true peace amongſt men when they warr with God; there
is no truth in unity when there is no unity in truth. Now how
they agree with the Spirit of God ſpeaking unto us in the holy
Scriptures, he that will heare them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> ſpeak ſhall quickly
diſcerne. God forbids that any Image be made to any religious
uſe, or being made, to be worſhipped, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
commands both; God commands that the Sacrament ſhall be
miniſtred in both kinds, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> commands that
the greateſt part of Chriſtians have it but under one kinde:
God teacheth us, that howſoever before men we are juſtified
by works, yet before him we are juſtified by Faith without
the works of the Law; the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> teacheth that we
are not juſtified before God by faith without the works of the
Law. God tells us that we muſt pray with the underſtanding,
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> maintaineth praying in a ſtrange tongue;
God ſaith that Marriage is honourable amongſt all men, the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> denies it: God calls the prohibition of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
a Doctrine of Devills, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> makes the
prohibition of marriage equall to Canonicall Scripture: God
hath taken away all legall diſtinction of meats, and tells us that
every creature of God is good,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they, the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
puts more religion in abſtinence from meats, then in the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of Gods precepts: Briefly, whereas the ſumm of the
whole Bible is comprehended in the Decalogue and Creed, and
both theſe included in the Lords prayer; there is not a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
in the Decalogue, ſcarce an Article in the Creed,
or petition in the Lords prayer, againſt which, if not directly,
yet indirectly and by conſequence, they doe not offend; they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57497:108"/>
an inward religious worſhip to Saints, againſt the firſt
Commandement, they adore Images againſt the ſecond, they
maintaine ſwearing by the creatures, invocation of Saints, they
diſpence with Oaths againſt the third, with greater ſtrictneſſe
they obſerve their owne holidayes and faſting dayes then the
Lords day, againſt the fourth; they extoll the Pope above all
Emperours and ſecular Princes, they admit Children into reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Orders without conſent of Parents, againſt the fifth;
they teach and practiſe rebellions, murthers, and maſſacres of
ſuch as be oppoſite unto them in matters of Religion, againſt
the ſixth; they prohibite marriage and allow the Stews, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the ſeventh; they hold that in extreame neceſſity it is
lawfull to take another mans goods, againſt the eighth; they
maintaine equivocation and mentall reſervation, againſt the
ninth; they hold that concupiſcence, unto wich the will doth
not yeeld conſent, is not properly a ſin, and ſo overthrow the
tenth; that concupiſcence unto which the will yeelds her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
being forbidden in the former precepts.</p>
                  <p>Not to trouble you further, the ſumm of all is this, Such is
the unity of the Romiſh Church, as neither old Papiſts agree
with new, nor old with old, nor new with new, nor new with
old, nor Schoole Doctor with Schoole Doctor, nor Fryar with
Fryar, nor Prieſt with Prieſt, nor Jeſuite with Jeſuite, nor
Pope with Councill, nor Pope with Pope, nor one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
nor any with God: And therefore as he in <hi>Plutarch,</hi>
who when he caſt a ſtone at a Dogg, happened to light upon
his Step-mother, ſayd, <hi>That though it was beſides his purpoſe,
yet it was not greatly amiſſe:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Printer of Doctor Reynolds his Theſes.</note> Or as the Printer of a learned

incongruous Latine, nor falſe Engliſh. So if <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in
ſetting downe the works and rules of the Catholique Romiſh
Church, when he made <hi>Vnitas</hi> for <hi>One,</hi> if in writing of <hi>Vnitas</hi>
he had over-reached a little with his Pen, and added one Vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell
more and made it <hi>Vanitas,</hi> though it had been beſide his

truth: this being a proper paſſion immediately flowing from the
principles of that Church, and conſequently an inſeparable mark
whereby to diſcerne her.</p>

But to leave the Papiſts,<note place="margin">Laſt uſe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation to all.</note> and with an exhortation to all, to
make an end of all, Is the whole Church of Chriſt but one flock?
then let us all which profeſſe our ſelves to be members of this
Church, of what calling and condition ſoever we be, bend all
our endeavours, nor for our owne particulars, but for the peace
and good, and preſervation of the whole; even as the members
of a mans body (which is a fit embleme of Gods Church) do
not ſo much tender their owne good, as the ſafety and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the whole; and becauſe the bond of this Unity is
Peace, let it be the care of you that are Magiſtrates to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
peace, and of us that are Miniſters to Preach peace, and
of you that are Lawyers to procure peace, and of you that are
Jurors to conclude peace, and let us all with joynt conſents pray
for the peace of this <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that plenteouſneſſe may be
within her Pallaces, and peace within her Walls, peace in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of opinion, and peace in matters of action, peace in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of piety, and peace in matters of equity, peace with God
and peace with our ſelves, and peace with all men, remembring
that God himſelfe is called the God of peace, and his Goſpell
the Goſpell of peace, and his naturall Son the author of peace,
and his adopted Sons the children of peace.</p>
                  <p>But eſpecially let me intreat, yea and as an Embaſſadour of
Jeſus Chriſt, charge you that are Magiſtrates of our Countrey,
Juſtices of the peace, to make your practice agree with your
names: I uſe this exhortation the rather becauſe I may uſe the
ſame words to you which the Apoſtle did to the <hi>Corinthians,
It hath been certainely declared unto me that there are contentions
among you: and one ſaith I am Pauls, another, I am Apollos:</hi>
Who is <hi>Paul,</hi> or who is <hi>Apollos,</hi> but the ſervants of Chriſt, and
members with you of the ſame body; let no man ſo reſpect one
particular member, as that he neglect the whole, the whole

muſt guide the Compaſſe, <hi>Paul</hi> muſt preach, the Marriners
muſt row, every man in his place, all private reſpects ſet aſide,
muſt labour to bring the Ship to Land.</p>
                  <p>Let me then with the bleſſed Apoſtle beſeech you, that all
injuries forgotten, all wrongs forgiven, all factions abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
all contentions and diſcords buryed, yee walke as the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
of God, holy and beloved, put on tender mercy, kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,

one another, and forgiving one another, if any man
have a quarrell to another, even as God for Chriſts ſake for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gave
you; and above all things put on Love, which is the
bond of perfection, and let the peace of God rule in you, and
the God of peace ſhall be with you.<note place="margin">Coloſ. 3.</note>

                  <p>Once againe for concluſion of all, let me with the ſame A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
exhort you, if there be any conſolation in Chriſt, if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
comfort of love, if any fellowſhip of the ſpirit, if any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion

one another through love, endeavouring to keep the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

Preciſians, Cathariſts, Puritanes, and I wot not what: <hi>odio eſt

                  <p>Miſtake me not, I deſire to be counted a Son of our Engliſh

down the carved work of our Temple, as it were with Axes and

muſt be aboliſhed, becauſe they have been abuſed: for if
the abuſe ſhould make the thing unlawfull, there is nothing in
the world which a tender conſcience might not make ſcruple of:

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57497:112"/>
which we tread upon, the Aire which we breath, our Meat
and Drink which nouriſh us, our Apparell which cover us, the
Bells, the Pulpit, the Font, the Church, and what cannot have
been wickedly abuſed? We abridge the liberty of the Church
too much, if we think that it may not uſe any thing which the

them, yet were they both ſo far from Popery, that he that

Queen <hi>Maries</hi> daies to ſpend his beſt blood in defence of the
Goſpell. Our Elders, if not before the Egge was laid, yet before
the cockatrice of Popery was hatched, were of another opinion,
when they converted the Temples that were erected to heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
Gods, and the reverence which were due to the Veſtall
Virgins, and Idolatrous Prieſts to the ſervice of the true God.
And this is the meeteſt ſenſe that can be taken in the Judgment
of any that is not wedded to his owne conceit, to take away the
abuſe and keep the thing: we have no commandement to deale

multumque toroſa juventus:</hi> The name is ſo generally derided,
they cannot indure it. Thus then it hath been, thus it is at this
day, and thus no doubt it will be in times to come; they that are
in the ſight of God the deareſt, ſhall commonly in the eyes of
men be of little and baſe account.</p>
                  <p>The Reaſon of this Propoſition are cheifly two.</p>
                  <p>The firſt ariſeth from the difference of Judgment between the
World and the Sons of God.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond from the enmity and Antipathie of the Serpents
Seed againſt the Womans.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt, Gods Wayes are not as Mans Wayes, nor his
Thoughts as mans Thoughts. The Wiſdome of the World
is fooliſhneſſe with God; and the Wiſedome of God to a
naturall man ſeems fooliſhneſs. The reaſon is, becauſe a naturall
man cannot perceive the things of the Spirit of God, ſuch know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
is too wonderfull and excellent for him, he cannot attain
unto it, he wants a Spirituall Eye to diſcern Spirituall things.</p>
                  <p>The Mileſians objected to <hi>Thales,</hi> that the Study of Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomie
and other liberall arts, was idle and fruitleſſe, becauſe it
commonly fell out, that thoſe that ſtudy them the moſt, were
the pooreſt: and when the ſame of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> his learning
was ſpread abroad through all the Regions of <hi>Greece,</hi> many
deſirous to be acquainted with that which they heard by Report
from others, flocked to <hi>Athens</hi> to hear him read a Philoſophie
Lecture: when they were come into his Schoole, and heard him
make a large diſcourſe about the Subject of the Metaphyſicks,
<hi>Ens,</hi> and <hi>Vnum,</hi> and ſpeak never a word, how a man might aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
his Goods, and inlarge his Poſſeſſions; they altered their
Judgments, and (for all his wiſdome) counted him but a fool,
to leave that by which a man may become great in the World,
and diſcourſe about ſuch abſtruſe and abſtract notions as they
could not underſtand.</p>
                  <p>This is the Worlds judgement ſtill, to count light of all that
ſavours not of ſome preſent profit, or pleaſure; he declines his
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57497:113"/>
felicity no further then the preſent Tenſ a Leaſe for life in
this World is of more worth with him, then the Reverſion of a
Kingdome in another; and therefore the Childe of God that
looks not on the things that are ſeen, but on the things that are
not ſeen; and firſt ſeeks, and then ſets his affections on the things
that are above, and makes more reckoning of a peaceable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
then a worldly Kingdome, is by him contemned, and
reputed a foole by troubling himſelfe with ſuch metaphyſicall
notions as he (the worldling) cannot underſtand. A Jueller
makes reckoning of a Pearl, but <hi>Aeſops</hi> Cock, that knowes not
the uſe of it, counts it but a Bable. When <hi>Protogenes</hi> the Painter
did earneſtly eye a Picture made by <hi>Apelles,</hi> admiring the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſneſſe
of the workmanſhip; an ignorant man comes to him
and tells him, that he wonders why a Painter ſhould admire
that Picture, for I have ſeen (ſaid he) a hundred better: Oh
ſaid <hi>Protogenes,</hi> if thou hadſt mine eyes thou wouldſt never aske
me that queſtion, but wouldſt judge as I judge. The childe of
God looking upon heavenly things with a ſpirituall eye, prizeth
them at a dearer rate then ten thouſand Worlds all of Gold
and Pearle: But an unwiſe man that doth not conſider theſe
things, and a foole that doth not underſtand them (becauſe
he wants a ſpirituall eye) doth farr undervalue them; as he
that meaſuring the Sun by his eye, conjectures it to be but a
foot and a halfe broad (as <hi>Tully</hi> notes) which Mathematici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
know to be farr bigger then the whole Globe of the Earth
and Water.</p>
                  <p>When the <hi>Romanes</hi> for the good ſervice performed by the
<hi>Cappadocian</hi> Slaves, offered them liberty (which all creatures
naturally deſire) they not knowing the benefit thereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they had ever lived in bondage, refused it. The world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
ſcornes and contemnes that liberty which the Sons of God
have in Chriſt, becauſe having ever been bound with the evill
Angels in chaines of darkneſſe, he knowes not what that means,
<hi>If the Son make you free you ſhall be free indeed.</hi> This is the firſt
cauſe of contempt of Gods Children with the worldling, he
underſtands not the things of the Spirit of God; he counts
them fooliſhneſſe, and him that ſtudieth them no better then a
fool in reſpect of himſelf.</p>

The ſecond is the antipathy between the Womans Seed and
the Serpents: <hi>I will put enmity betweene thee and the Woman,
and between thy Seed and her Seed,</hi> ſaid God to the Serpent,
<hi>Gen. 3. 15. Hic incipit liber bellorum Domini,</hi> ſaith <hi>Rupertus:</hi>
true; for the whole Scripture is a Book deſcribing the Warrs
between the Serpents Seed and the Womans; which ſhall be
continued untill the conſummation of the World. <hi>Baſil</hi> writes
of the Panther, that he hath ſuch a mortall hatred againſt man,
that he cannot indure his picture, inſomuch that if he ſee it but
drawne in Paper he will preſently pull it in peices: The Serpent,
that Helliſh Panther, beares ſuch an inveterate hatred againſt
God, that he cannot indure his Picture; and therefore when he
ſaw Gods Image drawne in a peice of earth, I mean in <hi>Adam</hi>
at the creation, he was never at reſt till he had pulled it in peices:
and in whomſoever he ſhall finde it drawne anew (as it is in
all beleevers, though not ſo perfectly as was the firſt draught)
againſt them he and his Imps bear an implacable hatred, and
labours with tooth and naile to tear in peices this Image, if they
cannot this, then at leaſt to keep them under that weare it; or
as the <hi>Garderens</hi> dealt with Chriſt, to keep ſuch out of their
coaſts: By a Law of Oſtraciſme they will baniſh ſuch out of

                  </p>
                  <p>Here then (beloved Chriſtian) learn not to be diſcouraged
for this that thou art not reſpected,<note place="margin">Vſe.</note> nor had in account with
many worldlings as thou deſerveſt; the more the men of this

that it be without the loſſe of Gods favour: if thou canſt not,

ſo with any Nation, nor gave the Heathen knowledge of his
Laws: he that prohibits to caſt Pearls before Swine, and to

ground is preſerved: Chriſt hath a little Flock, but the Devill

mine:</hi> He lyed, but in ſome ſort his ſpeech was true; he is the
Prince of this World, he drives the whole World in a drift be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, as a Butcher doth his Flock to the Shambles: Chriſt
catcheth here a Sheep and there another out of Satans Drove,
to make up to himſelfe a little Flock; he hath the Vintage,
Chriſt hath the Gleanings, as the ſcattered Grapes when the
Vintage is ended, and as the after ſhaking of an Olive Tree,

in a Houſe there be Veſſels of honour and Veſſels of diſhonour,
the former onely are Chriſts, the other he leaves to Satan:
there be Sons in an houſe, and there be Servants, Chriſt makes
challenge to none but Sons and Daughters, the reaſon is plaine;
the way to Hell is a broad way, they may go by thouſands to it,
there is roome for Foot and Horſe, and Cart and Coach and
all; it is plaine and pleaſant, no hedges to keep paſſengers in,
no mire to withhold them, no blocks to ſtop and hinder their
paſſage: But the way to Heaven (like that deſcribed by <hi>Livie</hi>
to <hi>Tempe</hi> in <hi>Theſſalie</hi>) is but one ſingle narrow craggy path,
all that go that way,<note place="margin">Dec. 4.</note> muſt (as neer as may be) tread in the
footſteps of him that is gone before, <hi>Viz.</hi> Chriſt: There is the
ſharp thorny hedge of the Law to pale them in, and the fiery
Cherubs to affray them, and the blade of a Sword ſhaken to

their legs, as it were, in the ſtocks, and many blocks and ſtops
doth Satan caſt before them to bring them to the ground; and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57497:115"/>
when thou art come to the gate, it is but like a needles eye: If
thou be puffed up with luxury and drunkenneſſe, thou muſt
empty thy ſelfe: If thou bee ſwelled with pride and ambition,
thou muſt humble thy ſelfe: If thou be loaden with the droſſe

                  <p>This being thus, I much wonder why either <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> or

but to carrie ſo much as a ſhew of probability, I dare boldly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr
that neither <hi>Abraham,</hi> nor any of the Patriarchs; nor <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi>
nor any of the Prophets; nor <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> nor any of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxall
Biſhops of that time; nor Chriſt, nor any of his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
were of the true Church: all of which had multitude, and
glorious viſibility of Profeſſors as ſtrongly againſt them, as the
<hi>Romaniſts</hi> can prove it to be on their ſide. Where was this
multitude and viſibility, when <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Wife were
Pilgrims in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and <hi>Canaan,</hi> and had not ſo much as a child
to leave behind them? where, when <hi>Elias</hi> complained that he
was left alone, that ſmall remnant which God had reſerved to
himſelfe being ſo hid, that they were unknown to <hi>Elias</hi> himſelf,
though a principall member of the Church? Where, when the
Prophet complained, that not a righteous man could be found in
<hi>Jeruſalem? Jer.</hi> 5. 1. Where, when Chriſt firſt began to preach,
and made choiſe of 12. Apoſtles for this purpoſe, one of which
proved a thief. Where in the time of the <hi>Arian</hi> perſecution,
when to uſe <hi>Hieroms</hi> words, the whole world groaned and
wondered to ſee her ſelfe become an <hi>Arian?</hi> When this plague
ſpread over the whole Chriſtian world, and infected two Biſhops
of <hi>Rome,</hi> and was ſtrengthened by ten ſeverall Councels, in
which the decrees of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Synod were repealed. When
whole burthen of the Church (in reſpect of men) lay upon the
ſhoulders of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> and a few other forlorn Biſhops, which
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57497:116"/>
endured either impriſonment or baniſhment, or otherwiſe hid
themſelves, and durſt not ſhew their faces: By this which hath
been ſpoken, as it is evident that this note of multitude notes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
or if any thing, the contrary to <hi>Bellarmines</hi> note: So is it
alſo as cleare, that that glorious ſhew of viſibility (of which
theſe <hi>Thraſoes</hi> make ſuch great boaſt) neither makes their cauſe
good, nor hurts ours. Where was the Proteſtants Church for
divers hundreds of years before <hi>Martin Luthers</hi> dayes? many
there were not of that Church; true, there needed not. Chriſts
flock is little, gloriouſly conſpicuous it was not; true, for neither
was that needfull. Where was this great multitude of Believers,
and glorious ſplendor of Profeſſors, when the Prophet complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that he was left alone? When <hi>Eſay</hi> exclaimed, <hi>That from the
ſole of the foote to the crowne of the head there was nothing but
bruiſes and putrified ſores,</hi> Iſa. 1. When all <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
about the birth of Chriſt, when the Chriſtians groaned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the ten bloody perſecutions inflicted by the Pagans, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the eleventh cauſed by the Arians? As in thoſe times, ſo in
the times before <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> the weſtern Church was at a
low ebbe, and the Moon did ſuffer almoſt a totall Eclipſe: No
marvail, ſeeing it was foretold that there ſhould be an apoſtacy,
2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. And that the ſecond Beaſt ſhould cauſe all, both
great and ſmall, rich and poor, free and bond to receive a marke
in their right hands, and in their fore-heads, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 13. 16. And
that all Nations ſhould be drunk with the wine of the fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the whore of Babylon, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 18. 3. Yet even then I make
no doubt but God had his true Church, becauſe the gates of
Hell ſhall never prevaile againſt it. Although I could neither
neither name the perſons who, nor the places where (which
notwithſtanding I can do both) as I doubt not but wee had all
Anceſtors living 120. yeares agoe, and yet none of us can name
either perſon or place, or profeſſion of any of them: and I
doubt not but there is a moone immediately after the change,
although I cannot point out the place with my finger, and ſay
here it is.</p>

the Sacrament of Bapt. having one foot in the River where

indeed Warres are commonly Gods new brooms (which ſweep

That both parties ſuſtaine loſſe as then it fell out. But wee have
better examples then Poeticall fictions for illuſtration of this

                  <p>What was the cauſe of the drowning of the old World? See
<hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 12. Univerſality of ſinne: All fleſh had corrupted his

followeth.</p>
                  <p>Feare not.</p>
                  <p>Of that feare whereby a man is moved either to obey God,<note place="margin">Third part.</note> or
depart from his precepts, <hi>Peter Lombard</hi> ſets downe 4. kinds.
Servile, which hath <hi>poenam</hi> for its object; it ariſeth from the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
of Gods wrath, and curſes of the Law. He that is the
ſubject of this fear, will abſtaine from ſinne, and do that which
is good, <hi>Non virtutis amore, ſed formidine paenae,</hi> as <hi>Horace</hi>
ſpeaks. <hi>Non timore amittendi aeternum bonum quod non amat, ſed
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:57497:117"/>
timore patiendi malum quod formidat,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">In Pſal. 127. ver. 1.</note> as <hi>Auſtin</hi> notes. This is
a preparation, or previall diſpoſition to the next kind of feare,
which is called chaſt and filiall: <hi>It is the beginning of wiſdome,</hi>
as <hi>Solomon</hi> calls it, and it is to filiall feare, as the needle is to the
thread ſo <hi>Auſtin</hi> illuſtrates it) the needle makes way for the
thread, and draws it after it, yet ſo as that the thread, not the
needle remaines in the cloath, and tyes the parts together. Fili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
feare, the ſecond kind, is joyned with faith, and love of God,
and hath <hi>Culpam</hi> for its object: this is a ſpeciall part of Gods
worſhip: <hi>Thou ſhalt feare the Lord thy God and ſerve him,</hi> Deut.
6. 13. The third is <hi>Initialis,</hi> which doth not ſpecifically, but
modally and gradually differ from filiall: And indeed in the beſt
of Gods children, as all other vertues, ſo alſo filiall feare is but
Initiall. <hi>Cunctorum in terris gementium imperfect a perfectio est,</hi>
ſaith <hi>Hierome,</hi> they are pilgrims, and a pilgrims motion is (as
all mutations are) <hi>actus entis in potentia,</hi> as the Philoſopher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines
<hi>motus.</hi> The fourth is mundane and humane, unto which
we may referre that which ſome Schoolmen make a fifth kind of
feare, which they call naturall, which is not evill if it be kept
within its bounds. For to be touched ſomewhat with thoſe
things which be by nature <hi>terribilia,</hi> and may do evill, as Death,
Famine, want of neceſſaries for this life, is not evill. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>
notes it as a kind of brutiſhneſſe in the <hi>Celtae</hi> that they feared
not Lightnings, nor Inundations, nor Earth-quakes. But now to
exceed in this kinde, and for avoyding of mundane evills to
incurre the diſpleaſure of God: with <hi>Eliſha's</hi> ſervant, to ſee
thine Enemies, but not thy Friends: with <hi>Saul,</hi> to be greatly
afraid of <hi>Goliah,</hi> and not to ſee the power of God in little <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid:</hi>
It proceeds from an evill root, an immoderate love of this
world, and is joyned with a diſtruſt to his providence, who
hath ſaid, <hi>I will not leave thee nor forſake thee,</hi> and is here forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
by our Saviour, <hi>Feare not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Janus</hi>-like it looks both back-ward and forward. Backwards
to the precedents of this Chapter, &amp; ſo it contains the uſe which
we are to make of that which hitherto hath been delivered con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Gods providence. Forward to the latter part of the
verſe, and ſo it is a concluſion of an argument a <hi>majori,</hi> thus:
Gods elect are Kings ſonnes, States of Paradiſe, and heires appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57497:118"/>
to the crown of Heaven; <hi>Ergo,</hi> they need not feare, but he
will watch over them, with his fatherly proviſion, protection,
and direction in his kingdome of grace. Take it whether way ye
will, and it will afford us this propoſition; Such is Gods fatherly
care and providence over his children, that they need not be
diſcouraged by humane nor mundane fears.</p>
                  <p>As the night Crow ſees in the night, but is blind in the day:
So a naturall man is quick-ſighted in temporall things,<note place="margin">Aquinas 1. 2. quaeſt. 102. art. 6.</note> but blind
in ſpirituall; For as the Sun lighteneth the Earth, but darkeneth
the Heaven: So his underſtanding giveth him direction about
earthly things, but for heavenly and ſpirituall, them it darkneth
and obſcureth. This as by many other things it is evident, ſo eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
by the worlds raſh judgement touching Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
over his children while they remaine in theſe houſes of
clay; for they ſeeing that the godly are oftentimes hunted as a
Partridge upon the mountains, or as a Pelican in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and an Owle in the Deſart: whereas the ungodly (as
<hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks) have their houſes peaceable, and without fear, and
the rod of God is not upon them, they rejoyce in the ſound of
the Organs, and ſpend their dayes in wealth: They I ſay, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
theſe things, not being able to give the true reaſon of them,
(becauſe God made them neither of his Court nor Privie Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell)
and yet ſtorning to be ignorant in any thing (though they
knew nothing as they ought to have known) began to lye and
libell againſt that eternall power in which they live, &amp; move, and
have their being. Some of them, becauſe they would not ſeem
to impute any injuſtice unto God, thought that ſuch as they
ſaw groaning under the heavy burden of affliction, howſoever
unto the worlds eye they might ſeem devout and righteous, yet
in very deed, and before God, which ſeeth not as man ſeeth (for
man looks on the outward appearance, but God beholds the
heart) they were diſſemblers and hypocrites. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> when
he had gathered a few ſticks for the fire,<note place="margin">Acts 28.</note> and a Viper came out

                     <hi>Job,</hi> when the heavy hand of God was upon

his iniquity. Nay Chriſt our Saviour, that immaculate Lamb,
<hi>who had done no wickedneſſe, neither was there any guile found in
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57497:118"/>
his mouth, was judged by the Jewes as a man plagued and ſmitten

uſed to ſhoot up their arrows towards Heaven, and to tell God
that he cared for none but himſelfe) affirmed, that though God

in his hand, to which the whole world is tyed in certaine links of
Cauſes: <hi>Jupiter</hi> hath in his owne power the moving of the firſt

<hi>Babylon</hi> intended? Nay what hath he not intended againſt
her? He hath ſent his fierce Buls to puſh her down, &amp; to trample
her honour in the duſt. He hath thundred out his Canons charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

and Elephants; but when they came to tryal, proved
nothing but Oxen hides, ſtuffed and bumbaſted with ſtraw. His
Canons troll like <hi>Domitians</hi> thunder, a noiſe heard, but no bullet
felt. His locuſts hurt none, but ſuch as had not the Seale of
God in their foreheads. His plots and deviſes againſt Queen

previal alterations are no eſſential parts of natural generation,
(though preparatives thereunto.) Nor is there in the Matter
any more then a meer paſſive power for receiving the ſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
form: ſo neither are theſe previal diſpoſitions any eſſential
part of our ſupernatural regeneration: Nor is there in the wil
any active, but a mere paſſive power, for receiving this ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
being, which is only wrought by the finger of God.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtles evidences are ſtrong for this point; let us heare
them:<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>we are his workmanſhip, created in Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> meaning that
there is no more power in a naturall man for begetting himſelfe
a new, then there was in that dry duſt whereof <hi>Adam</hi> was
made,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2. 1.</note> for aſſiſting God in the creation of man. A naturall man
is dead in ſinne:<note place="margin">Coloſ. 2. 13.</note> Can a dead man revive himſelfe? Could <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi>
when he had been three dayes ſtinking in the grave, move
hand or foot, till Chriſt had put his ſoule into him? No more
can a natural man ſo much as move himſelfe to a ſupernatural
and ſpirituall work, till God regenerate him, and as it were cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
him anew, and infuſe into the powers and faculties of his
ſoule a quickning ſpirit.<note place="margin">Ezech. 11. 19.</note> He hath a heart of ſtone; (<hi>I will take
the stonie heart out of their bodies</hi>) a heart of ſtone, not a heart
of iron; for though iron be hard, yet the heate of the fire will
mollifie it, and the ſtroak of the hammer will turne it into a
new forme: but no heat will mollifie a ſtone, no hammer can
beate it out, or bring it into a new ſhape, but by breaking it:
So our hearts are by nature ſuch, that they cannot be ſoftned or
turned to that which is right, till they be broken in pieces, and
caſt in a new mould. And again, as no water can be drawn out
of a ſtone, ſo no goodneſſe can be educed out of a natural mans
heart. We are by nature evill trees, and an evil tree cannot
bring forth good fruit.<note place="margin">Matth. 7. 18.</note> The Apoſtle tels us, <hi>That of our ſelves
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57497:124"/>
we cannot ſo much as think a good thought: That it is God that
giveth both the will and the deed.</hi> And our great Maſter (whom
we are commanded from heaven to heare) ſaith, <hi>That without
him we can do nothing:</hi> That thoſe to whom <hi>Power is given to be
the ſonnes of God, are not borne of blood, nor of the will of the fleſh,
nor of the will of man, but of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. They are not borne of blood; that is, they come not by
naturall propagation, for by this nativity wee are children of
wrath.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>They are not of the will of the fleſh.</hi> This may be referred to
them which are borne of faithful Parents, yet begotten carnally.
For as the wheat is ſown without chaffe; but when it grows, the
chaffe comes up with it. Or as the Hebrew Males which were
circumciſed, begat children which were uncircumciſed, ſo the
moſt holy and ſpiritual man begets a carnal ſonne;<note place="margin">Aug. de pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torum merit, &amp; remiſſ. lib. 7. cap. 9.</note> the reaſon is,
<hi>Quia ex hoc gignit quod adhuc vetuſtum tenet, inter filios ſeculi,
non ex hoc quod in novitatem promovit inter filios dei,</hi> as <hi>Auſtin:</hi>
He begets according to that corruption which hee retains a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the ſonnes of men, not according to that perfection
which he hath attained unto amongſt the ſons of God.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>They are not borne of the will of man:</hi> That is, the will of
man doth not co-work with God at his regeneration, to receive
grace, and convert himſelfe. Let the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and <hi>Pelagians,</hi> and
<hi>Semi-pelagians</hi> buſie their braines, and confederate themſelves,
and joyne their forces againſt Chriſt and his Apoſtles, maugre
their beards it ſhall ſtand, which is confeſſed by an honeſt Frier,
that there is not in the whole world of natural men,<note place="margin">John Ferus in <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.</note> 
                     <hi>vel mica vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium,</hi>
ſo much as a dram or crum of power, whereby he may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
himſelfe, and become a ſonne of God. Thus then firſt he is
our Father, not only by grace of adoption, but by grace of rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration;
he regenerates and begets us a new, by the waſhing of
the new birth,<note place="margin">Tit. 2. 5.</note> and the renewing of the holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>2. To his children thus begotten and born anew, he gives new
names. <hi>Thou ſhalt be called by a new name,</hi> Iſa. 62. 2. <hi>To him
that overcometh I will give a white ſtone, and in the ſtone a new
name,</hi> Rev. 2. 13. <hi>I will write in it my new name.</hi> Rev. 3. 12. Old
things, when they are renewed, have new names given them: So
old <hi>Byzantiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> renewed by <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> was called after his name.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57497:124"/>
So a ſon of the old <hi>Adam,</hi> who of himſelf <hi>Is a child of wrath, a
firebrand of hell, Gods enemy, and an alien from the common-wealth
of Iſrael,</hi> being renewed and regenerate, and having given his
name to Chriſt, is called a Chriſtian. This is a new name recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from him, who after he had ſpoyled Principalities and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and like a triumphant Conqueror, ſhewed them openly in his
Chariot of triumph (ſo <hi>Origen</hi> calls it) the Croſſe, hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
a name above all names that are named, not in this world on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but alſo in that which is to come. The name alſo we receive
in our Baptiſme when we are admitted into Chriſts Church, is a
new name, and may put us in mind of our new and ſpirituall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
(as the other which we receive from our Parents and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors
is a mark of our natural ſtate we received from them:) So
that whenſoever we think of our names given us in our baptiſme,
we ſhould think of our new birth, and be more and more renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
according to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Old things are paſt, behold
all things are become new. Therefore as many as are in Chriſt, let
them be new creatures.</hi> New names and old natures are like new
wine in old veſſels, or like new cloath in an old garment.</p>
                  <p>3. He feeds us, 1. with corporall food for the ſuſtenance
of our bodies: The greateſt Prince of the world hath not ſo
much <hi>de proprio,</hi> as a morſell of bread to put in his mouth, but
what he receives from him who hath Heaven for his throne, and
Earth for his foot-ſtoole;<note place="margin">Iſa. 61. 1.</note> who opens his hand, and gives to all
creatures that wait upon him their meate in due ſeaſon; For
which cauſe Chriſt ſends us to heaven gates to begge our daily
bread,<note place="margin">Ezek. 4. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>viz.</hi> not only the ſubſtance of bread, but <hi>baculum panis,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dan. 26. 26.</note>
(as the Scripture calls it) the power and ſtrength to nouriſh
us, without whoſe benediction, be our tables furniſhed with
never ſuch variety of diſhes, wee ſhall be but like <hi>Caligula's</hi>
gueſts, at his golden banquet, we may well feed our eyes, but
not our ſtomacks: Or like to him that eates in a dreame, and
when he awakes, behold his ſoule is empty.</p>
                  <p>2. He feeds us with ſpiritual food; that which was figured
by the tree of life, and the waters that flowed out of the ſtony
rock (as ſome of the Fathers expound it) the bodie and blood of
Chriſt unto eternall life.</p>
                  <p>3. He cloatheth us,<note place="margin">Pſalm 45.</note> as the Kings daughter, with a veſture of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:57497:125"/>
gold, the robe of Chriſts righteouſneſſe, which we muſt put on
as a wedding garment, that our filthy nakedneſſe may not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
in his ſight:<note place="margin">Revel. 3. 18.</note> and withall by degrees makes us glorious
within, with the habite of ſanctification and inherent righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe.</p>
                  <p>5. He protects us againſt all dangers, as hath been already
ſhewed.</p>
                  <p>6. He corrects us for our offences,<note place="margin">Hebr. 12.</note> as a father doth his child
in whom his ſoule delighteth.</p>
                  <p>7. He provides for us an Inheritance immortall, and undefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in the heavens.<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>For it is your fathers good pleaſure to give you
a kingdome:</hi> The next thing that comes to be handled. But let
us firſt by way of uſe and inference reflect upon the point we
have in hand.</p>
                  <p>Is God Almighty a Father of his little flock,<note place="margin">1 Vſe.</note> and ſuch a father
as doth not only regenerate, but feedeth and cloatheth, and
protecteth, and directeth, and hath in a readineſſe a Kingdom for
the meaneſt of them that be his? Here then let us take notice of
the dignity, and worth, and happineſſe of the meaneſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
above all the ſonnes of <hi>Adam,</hi> be they never ſo great, ſwell
they never ſo high with a conceit of their owne worth. The
greateſt of heathen Philoſophers tells us, that felicity conſiſts in
a cumulation of moral vertues: Others place it in worldly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures:
The common ſort of men in worldly honours and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
and the higher a man is advanced, the more worthy,
the more happy they repute him. But (alas) what great felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is it for a baſe fellow to act a Kings part upon the Stage, and
when the Play is ended, to be contented with a ragged coate?
far leſſe to be a King in this world, and then to be caſt into Hell
fire. Here is the ſtate and condition of the greateſt Potentates
on Earth, that have not Chriſt for their Brother, and God for
their Father; when they have acted their parts upon the ſtage
of this world, downe they muſt goe into the infernall lake. The
Spider thinks her ſelfe no baſe creature, when ſhe hath got her
ſelfe into the roofe of a Princely palace, and there woven her
webbe, and reſts there ſecure (as ſhee thinks) from all danger;
but anon, when ſhe leaſt feares, up goes the broom, down goes
the Spider and web and all, and are troden in the duſt, and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57497:125"/>
there is an end of her pride. So it is with the greateſt of them
that are without Chriſt, when they have ſeated themſelves in
the higheſt roomes the world can afford, anon when they leaſt
think upon it, God ſends his broom of death, and ſweeps them
downe into the pit of hell and deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>What was that <hi>Lucifer,</hi> the ſonne of the morning (<hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar</hi>)
which did advance himſelfe above the ſtarres of

mighty hunters before the Lord:<note place="margin">Gen. 10. 9.</note> or as the Scripture phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth

and that he made the Earth to tremble whereſoever he came:
Or <hi>Tamberlane,</hi> the terrour of <hi>Aſia,</hi> who led a million of Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
againſt his Enemies, what were they, but as they ſtiled
themſelves, the one <hi>Flagellum Dei,</hi> Gods whip, the other <hi>Ira

                  <p>Its a world to ſee how many will ſtand upon their Gentry,

antiquity: and he that is proudeſt of his Parentage, and ſtands
moſt of the antiquity of his houſe, if he will take pains to climb
the line of his diſcent, he may within a few hundreds of yeares
run his name out of breath. But ſay that every ordinary Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
could derive his Pedigree from the firſt of his Nation: the

<hi>Goths</hi> or <hi>Vandals;</hi> the <hi>French</hi> from the <hi>Franci</hi> or <hi>Burgundians,</hi>
&amp;c. What were theſe at their firſt coming, and others which
like a generall deluge, after the removing of the Emperours ſeate
into the Eaſt, overflowed theſe Weſtern parts of the World, but
godleſſe, graceleſs, cruel Pagans, that uſurped other mens rights,
and reaped where they had not ſown.</p>
                  <p>Imagine (and its but an imagination) thou couldſt without
interruption derive the line of thy pedigree from <hi>Adam,</hi> what
canſt thou find there but ſhame, unleſſe thou ſhouldſt climbe a

ſonne of Adam, the ſonne of God?</hi> What is the ancienteſt in any
Pedigree, to him that is called <hi>The ancient of dayes,</hi> Dan. 17. 13?
And what is a dead ſtock unto the living God? This, this is the
ſpecifical Form which gives <hi>nomen</hi> and <hi>eſſe</hi> to a right Gentleman,
to have God for his Father, to have the Almighty, the <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum
genus</hi> and top of his Kinne: And without this all Gentry,
how ancient ſoever, is but loſſe, and droſſe, and dung, and guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
vanity, and golden damnation; or to give it a milder name,
it's but a grace of fleſh; or (as wee commonly call it) its but
blood: And what is the beſt blood of it ſelfe, if fleſh, and bones,
and nerves, and ſpirits, and a ſoul be not added, to make it a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
man? No more is parentage, if vertue, and grace, and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and other habiliments of body and mind be wanting. But
now as a ſanguine complexion is the faireſt and beſt of all, when
all the parts and members are correſpondent: ſo Gentry, when
it is adorned and beautified with Religion and other graces from
above, gives the greateſt luſtre. I may ſpeak of it, as <hi>Solomon</hi>
ſpeaks of old age (when it is found in the way of godlineſſe)
It's a Crowne, <hi>It's like apples of gold in pictures of ſilver.</hi>

we owe unto God as he is our Father, and we his children.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is to our Neighbour;<note place="margin">Jude 3.</note> For if God be our Father,
then all we which make profeſſion of that faith which was once
given to the Saints are brethren, and ſhould live as brethren, and
love as brethren. And how brethren ſhould be affected one to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
we ſee in the members of our bodies: our two feet are
as it were two brethren, one to ſupport another; two armes,
two eyes, two ears, one to help another; the utmoſt part of the
hand divided into five fingers, one for aſſiſting and ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
another. No otherwiſe, even by the judgement of naturall
men, ſhould one brother be affectioned to another. Hence in
Poets came the fable of <hi>Briareus,</hi> with one bodie and 100. hands,
and of <hi>Geryon,</hi> with one bodie and three heads; by the firſt was
meant fiftie, by the ſecond, three brethren ſo linked together in
the bands of brotherly love, as if they had all been members of
one and the fame individuall bodie. And he that for his owne
particular benefit ſeeks the loſſe and hurt of a brother, doth as
if one foot ſhould ſupplant and trip up another; or as if the fing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of the hand ſhould fall out, and one wreſt another out of
joynt. Nay further, a brother that forſakes his brother, and
joynes himſelfe into ſociety with a ſtranger (ſaith <hi>Plutarch</hi>)
doth, as if a man ſhould cut off one of his owne legs, and take a
wooden leg in the room of it. As their love is the greateſt, ſo
their hatred (if they fall out) is noted to be the greateſt, ſo that
of all others they are hardeſt to be reconciled. For as thoſe
things that are glued together, if they goe aſunder, may eaſily
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:57497:131"/>
be reunited; but a bodie that is all of one peece, if it be broken,
cannot be ſo faſtned againe, but you may diſcern where the
breach was. When friends, who by affections are joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
if they diſſent, may eaſily be reconciled: but brethre,
who are as it were one by nature, can hardly be ſo united, but
there will remaine ſome ſcarre behind, for which cauſe it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
them to avoid the leaſt occaſions of diſagreement.</p>
                  <p>Now (that I may bring that which I have ſpoken home to my
purpoſe, grace is a ſtronger bond then nature: If then naturall
brethren ſhould be thus affected one to another, how much
more brethren in Chriſt, begotten by one father, God, bred in
one womb, the Church, fed with one milke, the Word anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the ſame ſpirit, juſtified by the ſame faith.</p>
                  <p>And this love muſt ſhew it ſelfe chiefly in two things.</p>
                  <p>1. In pardoning wrongs without private revenge. If the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
be little, forget it; if great, yet muſt thou not be Judge in
thine owne cauſe, but as children ſay when they are wronged,
<hi>I will tell my Father,</hi> ſo do thou. All malice and private revenge
lay aſide, out of a zeale of juſtice make thy complaint to thoſe
who are the Miniſters of God to take vengeance on them that
do evill.</p>
                  <p>2. In ſupporting and relieving ſuch as ſtand in need of thy
help: As the great ſtones that are laid in the bottome of a build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
beare the weight of the leſſe that are laid above them; or as
a bundle of rods bound together (to uſe <hi>Seleucus</hi> his compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon)
do one ſtrengthen another: Or as when a faggot of grove
ſticks is laid on the fire, and warms and kindles another) and
that which he hath be ready to communicate to ſuch as want:
thoſe that are learned, to inſtruct others that are ignorant:
thoſe that be ſtrong, to ſupport them that are weake: they that
are rich, to relieve ſuch as be poore: that there be no ſchiſme in
the body of Chriſt, but the members may have the ſame care
one of another, and every man pleaſe his brother in that which
is good to edification and comfort.</p>
                  <p>Here me thinks I diſcover in my way troops, troops (to follow
the Hebrew phraſe) great multitudes, and whole legions of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
who though they profeſſe that God is their Father, yet
are they ſo farre from the practiſe of the duties of brotherly love,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:57497:131"/>
that if God ſhould ask them what is become of their brethren,
they might well reply with <hi>Cain, What is that to them, are they
their brothers keepers?</hi> They live as if only born for themſelves,
ſwine-like, hurtfull to all, good to few or none, as long as
they are alive, as if the ſtomack ſhould not onely deny to
communicate the meate which it receives from the mouth to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
parts of the bodie according to each particulars neceſſity,
but ſhould ſucke and exhauſt the nouriſhment from other parts
to it ſelfe.</p>

as well as a Thiefe, though he will plead not guilty to

Panther hath a buſh in a readineſſe to hide the deformity of his

every man, that <hi>Salamander</hi> that's never well but when hee is
in the fire of contention, who will neither doe right, nor take
wrong: If he have hurt his brother, let him right himſelfe as he
can, he ſhall buy it at a deare rate: If another have done him
the leaſt appearance of wrong, if he have troden upon his graſſe
if his beaſt have looked, over a wall, if he have taken a rotten
ſticke out of a hedge, if he have given him a harſh word, &amp;c.
any of theſe is enough to break in ſunder the knots of Gods net,
the bonds of brotherly love: A writ ſhall be procured, a ſuite
commenced, no tollerable condition will give contentment, no
private arbitrement will ſatisfie, no ſubmiſſion will be accepted;
but either he will be his owne carver, and take what he wil, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure
ten times more then the loſſe ſuſtained, or he will
try it to the utmoſt extreamity, to the impoveriſhing perhaps,
and undoing of the other party.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon ſuch as are ſons of peace, are willing to buy their
peace upon unreaſonable conditions (as a Traveller for ſaving
his life will part with his purſe to a Robber) rather then they
will ſpend their times, and waſt their monies, and neglect the
works of their callings, and hazard their eſtates upon the event,
and waite the finall determination of the Law, which too often
(not through fault of the reverend Judges (as I conceive)
but of others, who flee as rank about Courts of Juſtice, as the
Ravens did about <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſacrifice, and grow happy by other
mens miſery) a Sea of that deepneſſe, that he muſt be both a
ſtrong and skilfull ſwimmer that can dive into the bottome of it,
and a way of that length, that it will almoſt make an <hi>Hercules</hi>
weary, and cauſe him to ſet a <hi>Nihil ultra</hi> before he come to his
journeys end.</p>
                  <p>I am no <hi>Anabaptiſt,</hi> I ſpeak not againſt going to Law, where
the matter is of moment, the cauſe juſt, and cannot otherwiſe
be peaceably and friendly determined. To whom may a child
when he is wronged make complaint, rather then to his Father?
and to whom ſhall a man have recourſe for redreſs of injuries
done to him, but to them who are Gods Deputies, Fathers of
their Countries, and living Laws to give every man his owne?
And if every wrong ſhould be put up with patience, it would
imbolden ſuch as we ſpeak of to multiply their abuſes, and with
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:57497:133"/>
greater impudency to goe on in their lewd courſes. <hi>Veterem fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendo

                  </p>
                  <p>But yet it's not fit that Fathers of great Families (ſuch as our
reverend Judges) ſhould be moleſted with the petty complaints
of every peeviſh Boy that is in the houſe. In this caſe there is
utterly a weakneſſe of mind amongſt men, eſpecially in theſe
parts ſo remote from the chief Coures of Juſtice, that they go to
Law one with another. As for the Wrangler, of whom I was
laſt ſpeaking, (who makes the Law ſometimes a Sword to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
himſelf of his Brother, ſometimes a Coak to cover his
theft) Surely if that law of <hi>Pittacus</hi> was good, that he who
committed a fault when he was drunk, ſhould ſuffer a double
puniſhment, one for the offence, the other for being drunk;
then this deſerves a double one, one for abuſing the Law, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for wronging his Neighbour, to whom he ſhould perform
all duties of brotherly love.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But I leave him, and will end this branch with a generall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation:

thou robbeſt and waſteſt whole Kingdomes, to which thou
haſt no right, art called an Emperour; I by the miſery of a few

a great part of the World, haſt got the Sirname of <hi>Magnus.</hi>
If I had thy Navy by Sea, and thy Forces by Land to command,
I ſhould be ſaluted Emperour; if thou wert alone, and a poor
priſoner as I am, the whole World would condemne thee for
a notable Theife. For in the cauſe we differ nothing, ſave that
he is the worſe, who doth more manifeſtly forſake Juſtice, and
more notoriouſly impugne the Laws; thoſe whom I flee, thou
perſecuteſt, whom I after a ſort reverence, thou ſcorneſt; it
was the iniquity of Fortune, and want of neceſſaries that made
me; it's intollerable pride and inſatiable avarice that made thee
a Theife: had I more, I would be better; thou the more thou

                  <p>I am perſwaded we have at this day as many worthy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Gentlemen, as many learned and religious Lawyers, as
many reverend, learned, and religious Judges and Magiſtrates,
as ever <hi>England</hi> had: and for you (my Lords) although the
one of you is known to me but <hi>Ex auditu,</hi> but being ſuch as <hi>John</hi>

                     <note place="margin">3 John 12.</note> I may ſpeak to you both, as I concluded my

                  <p>Now as <hi>Plutarch</hi> writes of Garlick and Rue, that being plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

So the corruptions of evill men ſet by the vertues of the good,
make them more pleaſant in the noſtrills of all good men. The
condemnation of evill is a ſecret commendation of them. The
threatning of judgment to the evill, implies a promiſe of reward
to them that are good. Goe on in the name of God, and the
Spirit of the Lord, even the Spirit of wiſdome and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

                  <p>The laſt time I ſupplied this place, I ſpoke of the firſt, I will
now follow the words as they lie in order, and leaving that
which I noted in the ſecond place to the laſt, as it lies in my Text,
I will conclude the other two in this one Propoſition: Our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
father beſtows upon the members of his little flock, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
life in his Kingdome of glory, not for any merit either of
Faith or of Works, but meerly of his good will and pleaſure.
We do not now diſpute, whether any, being come to yeares of
diſcretion, can be ſaved without faith and new obedience; (I
grant none can) theſe and others be <hi>media ad ſalutem,</hi> and fruits
and effects of predeſtination to life; but the queſtion is, which
is the <hi>Sola cauſa</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> which internally moves God to do
this. Here we exclude both faith and works, yea predeſtination
in Chriſt, yea and Chriſt himſelfe, in whom, as in the head this
little flock was elected to a Kingdome, and aſcribe all thoſe to
the good pleaſure of his will. This is the little inward wheel
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:57497:137"/>
which ſets all the reſt on work: it's the <hi>Primus motor,</hi> which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
all the <hi>inferior orbes</hi> (Election to Salvation, the death and
merits of Chriſt, Vocation, and the reſt, with and under it. Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to glory is the firſt link in this golden chain, it's the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum
mobile</hi> that carries all the reſt with it: and for this, and ſo
conſequently for all the reſt, we find no praeviſion either of faith
or works, or of any other thing (for what could he foreſee to
ſee in man that is good, but what from eternity he decreed
to beſtow upon him; for his preſcience in order of nature fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
his decree, that is, he did not decree, becauſe he did fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee;
but he fore-ſaw, becauſe hee decreed things to be thus or
thus) but only <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the good pleaſure and will of God. And
ſurely this we may ſee as in a pure glaſſe (as <hi>Auſtin</hi> well notes)
in the very head of the Church. Mortal man is conceived of the
ſeed of <hi>David;</hi> by what works, by what vertue did this mortall
fleſh merit, that it ſhould be united unto the Divinity, that in
the very Virgins womb he ſhould be made the head of Angels,
the glory of the Father, the only begotten ſonne of God, the
righteouſneſſe, light, and ſalvation of the world? Surely he was
not made the Son of God by living righteouſly, but it was the
Fathers good pleaſure that he ſhould be dignified with this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
that he might make his little flocke partakers of his gifts.
But becauſe we are now about divine myſteries, in which we can
know no more then the Lord hath revealed in his word, let us
follow this word, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> followed the cloud, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
ſhews the way to the promiſed Land; and as the Wiſe men
followed the Star which led them to Chriſt, and it will bring us
into the Kings chamber, as a Father ſpeaks, <hi>Where are hid all the
treaſures of wiſdome and knowledge. God hath choſen us in Chriſt,
before the foundations of the world were laid, that we ſhould be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
&amp;c. And all this according to the good pleaſure of his will,</hi> Eph.
1. 4, 5. here almoſt every word is an argument.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>He hath choſen us:</hi> From whence did he chooſe us? Out
of that maſſe of corruption in which all mankind was drowned,
and was become ſonnes of wrath, and bond-ſlaves to Satan. Well
then, as there could be no merits in them which he paſt by (for
if they had merited, they had been elected:) ſo neither did wee
merit why we ſhould be elected, but from his good will and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:57497:137"/>
pleaſure have we obtained this grace.</p>
                  <p>2. Before the foundation of the world; Ergo, <hi>from eternity;</hi>
Ergo, <hi>not for works.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. <hi>That we ſhould be holy; Ergo,</hi> not becauſe we were holy;
and ſo the Apoſtle ſpeaks of faith, <hi>God had mercie on me: Vt
fidelis eſſem,</hi> not becauſe I was faithfull.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>According to the good pleaſure of his will.</hi> There is the
ground and cauſe of all: Our fathers good pleaſure; <hi>Even ſo
O father, becauſe thy good will and pleaſure was ſuch.</hi> Adde unto
this that of the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Tim. 1. He hath called us with an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
calling, not according to our works, but according to his purpoſe
and grace:</hi> Where to our works hee oppoſeth Gods purpoſe and
grace. And not to trouble you with other places, that in
<hi>Rom.</hi> 9. where ſpeaking of Gods free election of ſome, and reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
or (if you like the word better) praeterition of others, he
ſends us to the prine cauſe of all, the pleaſure and will of God.</p>
                  <p>1. He inſtanceth in <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Iſaac,</hi> both begotten by faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<hi>Abraham,</hi> yet one is elected, the other left out; but becauſe
the Jews might object that there was not the ſame reaſon of <hi>Iſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael</hi>
and <hi>Iſaac,</hi> the one being begotten of a bond-woman, the
other of a lawfull wife, <hi>Sarah,</hi> to whom he was promiſed before
he was conceived: Therefore hee brings another inſtance in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſau</hi>
and <hi>Jacob,</hi> who though they were both children of <hi>Iſaac,</hi>
and diſcended from faithfull <hi>Abraham,</hi> to whom the promiſe
was made: <hi>In thy ſeed, &amp;c.</hi> and were Twins of one Birth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
in all things like, ſave that <hi>Eſau</hi> was the Elder, yet is <hi>Eſau</hi>
left, and the birth-right given to <hi>Jacob,</hi> and that before they
were borne, when the children were yet unborn, when
they had neither done good nor evill, that the purpoſe of God
might remaine according to election, not by works, but by him
that calleth, it was ſaid, <hi>The elder ſhall ſerve the younger,</hi> as it
is written, <hi>I have loved Jacob, &amp;c.</hi> What will the enemies of
Gods grace and good pleaſure anſwer to this? Forſooth God in
<hi>Jacob</hi> demonſtrates that he makes choiſe of thoſe whom he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees
worthy of his grace; in <hi>Eſau,</hi> that he rejects thoſe whom
he ſees unworthy. But why doth he ſay the children were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne?
why adds he that they had neither done good nor evill?
why is it ſaid that the purpoſe of God might remaine according
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:57497:138"/>
to election, not by works. What wilt thou ſay to that which
followeth? <hi>What then ſhall we ſay?</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>Is there
injuſtice with God? God forbid:</hi> As if he had ſaid, although God
to thoſe that are equall give things unequall; although he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives
<hi>Eſau</hi> of his Birth-right, and gives it to <hi>Jacob,</hi> yet God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
that we ſhould accuſe him of injuſtice, ſeeing his will is the
rule of all juſtice, which in the words following hee proves to
be the prime cauſe of election and praeterition; therefore (ſaith
he) <hi>It is not in him that willeth, nor in him that runneth, &amp;c.</hi>
Again, <hi>He hath mercie on whom he will, &amp;c.</hi> And, <hi>O man who
art thou that diſputeſt with God? Hath not the potter power of the
clay? &amp;c.</hi> All that the Potter can do with the clay, is to bring an
accidentall forme into it; the clay he cannot make: but God is
Author, not only of the accidents, but of ſubſtances too, and
therefore hath greater power over his creatures, then the Potter
over his clay.</p>
                  <p>Well then, if you ask why God conferres a Kingdome upon
his Flock of Sheep, and not on Goats, why he loves <hi>Jacob</hi> and
hates <hi>Eſau,</hi> why he pardons <hi>Peter</hi> and not <hi>Judas,</hi> we all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
death, being plunged over head and eares in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of corruption? thou haſt the anſwer <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, &amp;c.
Its our fathers pleaſure, he will have it ſo. And why will he
have it ſo? I anſwer with <hi>Auſtin, Tu homoes, &amp; expectas re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſum
a me qui ſum homo; itaque ambo audiamus dicentem: O
homo,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Melior eſt fidelis ignorantia, quam temeraria ſcientia.
Occulta Jehovae,</hi> &amp;c. Revealed things belong to us and our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
but ſecret things to God: None hath ever pryed into his
Ark &amp; lived, <hi>Oculos amittunt qui eos acrius in ſolem figunt: ſic &amp;
nos omne amittemus mentis lumen ſi eam intendamus in hoc lumen.</hi>
Gods will is the ſupream cauſe; to aske further is to ſeeke a
cauſe of that which hath none. Now then, <hi>Compeſcat ſe huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na
temeritas &amp; id quod non est non quaerat, ne id quod eſt non in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniat:</hi>
Now humane Scrupuloſity muſt be ſilent, and not
ſearch for that that is not, leaſt it finde not that that is.</p>
                  <p>Let us leave <hi>Pelagins</hi> and his Bratt <hi>Arminius</hi> a little, and
ſpeak cloſely to the Papiſt, concerning merit of works.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Nothing can properly merit the Kingdome of Heaven,
but that which is abſolutely perfect, both in reſpect of parts
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:57497:138"/>
and degrees; if you look for Heaven by merit of works, you
muſt with the Sun in the Zodiack, keep a preciſe courſe under
the Ecliptick Line of Gods Law, and not divert an haires breadth
to the right hand or to the left; if thou faile but in the leaſt
Iota, heare thy doome, <hi>Curſed is he that continueth not</hi> &amp;c. <hi>He
that offendeth in one is guilty of all, Jam.</hi> 2. Let the Papiſt, with
his Forefathers, the proud Phariſees, boaſt that he hath been ſo
good a proficient in Gods Schoole, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> hee hath fulfilled all
Gods precepts from his youth, an eaſie matter ſo to do, he can
go further, and become a tranſcendent; and with the <hi>Icarian</hi>
wings of Supererogatory works ſoar above the predicaments of
the Law, and merit the Kingdome of Heaven, not for himſelfe
onely, but for others too. But for thee (beloved Chriſtian)
if thou be wiſe, confeſſe with the faithfull in the Prophet, <hi>Iſa.
64. That all thy righteouſneſſe is as filthy clouts:</hi> with <hi>Peter,
That the Law is a yoake, which neither thou nor thy Fathers were
ever able to beare, Acts</hi> 10. With <hi>Paul, That it is impoſſible, in
as much as it is made weak becauſe of the fleſh, Rom.</hi> 8. Say with
<hi>John, If we have no ſin,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. And with an ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>Multum in hac vita ille profecit qui quam longe ſit a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectione
juſtitiae proficiendo cognovit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Its an eaſie matter I confeſſe for an idle Fryar, who with the
Spider ſpins his Web out of his owne bowels, and ſpends his
whole time in making of Sophiſmes againſt the truth, as <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſippus</hi>
did in making of Fallacies, and meaſures God by himſelf;
as <hi>Praxiteles</hi> painted <hi>Venus</hi> like his owne Wiſe, to ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
for ſalvation by works: but he that will look upward to
Heaven, and conſider the Almighty as he is deſcribed in his
word, at whoſe brightneſſe the Starrs of Heaven are darkned,
by whoſe power the earth is ſhaken, at whoſe anger the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
are melted, at the preſence of whoſe purity all things
ſeem impure, who maketh not the wicked innocent, who is a
burning and a conſuming fire; let him ſit on the bench of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and ſift and boult our works in the Sieve of his juſtice,
let him try them who looks not on the outward appearance of
man, but enters into his heart, and ſearcheth every corner
thereof, and like a curious Critick ſpells every ſyllable of our
thoughts long before they be conceived, and who can abide
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:57497:139"/>
his judgment. Who then dare to boaſt of his owne righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,
or challenge the Kingdome of Heaven by his good
deeds? <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job) he found no ſtedfaſtneſſe in his Saints,
and layd folly upon his Angels; how much more on them which
dwell in houſes of clay, whoſe foundation is in the dust,</hi> Job 4. 18.
And againe, <hi>Behold he found no stedfaſtneſſe in his Saints, and
the Heavens are impure in his ſight: How much more is man
abominable and filthy, which drinketh iniquity like water,</hi> Job 15.
15, 16. Hither, hither let us lift up our eyes, and all boaſting
of our owne righteouſneſſe will vaniſh away, as the morning
dew at the heat of the Sun; it will make us ſay with <hi>Auſtin,
God brings us to eternall life, not for our owne merits, but for
his mercy:</hi> With <hi>Bernard, Meritum noſtrum miſeratio Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni:</hi>
VVith <hi>Job, We are not able to anſwer him one for a thouſand:</hi>
And with <hi>David, Enter not into Judgement with thy ſervant, O
Lord, for in thy ſight ſhall no man living be juſtified.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, But <hi>Dato, &amp; non conceſſo,</hi> ſuppoſe that which ſhall
never be granted, that thou couldſt ſay truly with <hi>Saul,</hi> and
the Phariſee, <hi>I have fulfilled the Commandements of God;</hi> yet
wanteſt thou one thing; for that work which muſt merit, muſt
be <hi>Opus indebitum.</hi> Now obedience to every branch of Gods
law, is a debt which we are owing to God by the law of creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and God may ſay to every one of us, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid to <hi>Phile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
Thou oweſt to mee even thine owne ſelfe.</hi> Doth a Maſter
thank that ſervant which did that which he was commanded to
do? I trow not: ſo likewiſe, <hi>When yee have done all things which
were commanded you, ſay, we are unprofitable ſervants,</hi> we have
but done that which was our duty to do. <hi>Inutilis ſervus voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur</hi>
(ſaith <hi>Austin) qui omnia fecit, quia nihil fecit ultra id quod
debuit:</hi> And <hi>Theophylact</hi> upon that place; The ſervant if he
work not, is worthy of many ſtripes: and when he has wrought,
let him be contented with this, that he hath eſcaped ſtripes.</p>
                  <p>3. That work by which thou muſt merit, muſt be thine own,
but thy good works, if thou look to the firſt cauſe, are not ſo:
<hi>Quid habes, quod non accipiſti,</hi> 1 Cor. 4. <hi>Its God that worketh
both the will and the deed,</hi> Phil. 2. 13. <hi>Not I, but the grace of God
in me,</hi> 1 Cor. 13. So then, put caſe thou couldſt fulfill the
law, and it were not a payment of debt, yet is no merit due to
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:57497:139"/>
thee, but to him whoſe they are. <hi>Dei dona ſunt, quaecun<expan>
                           <am>
                              <g ref="char:abque"/>
                           </am>
                           <ex>que</ex>
                        </expan> bona
ſunt, Every good and perfect gift comes from above, even from the
father of lights.</hi> And <hi>Deus ſua dona, non noſtra merita coronat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. Admit it were in thy power to fulfill the law, that it were
no debt, that thy works were wholly thine, and God had no part
in them; this is not enough, there muſt be ſome proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the work and the reward, or no proper merit. Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
thy beſt works, and the Kingdome of heaven promiſed to
Chriſts little flock, there is not that proportion, that is <hi>Inter
ſtillam muriae &amp; mare Aegeum,</hi> as <hi>Tullie</hi> ſpeaks, between the
light of a candle, and the light of the Sunne, between the leaſt
grane of ſand that lies on the Sea-ſhore, and the higheſt heaven,
as ſhall preſently appear.</p>
                  <p>5. <hi>Laſt of all, that thy work may merit at Gods hands, ſome
profit or honour muſt thereby accrue to him:</hi> But my goodneſſe,
ſaith David, O Lord, reacheth not unto thee, but to the ſaints that
are on the earth. If thou be righteous (<hi>ſaith</hi> Elihu) what giveſt
thou to God, or what receiveth he at thine hand? <hi>Job</hi> 35. Who hath
given unto him firſt? <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 35.</p>
                  <p>All theſe five things are requiſite for the merit of works, but
not onely ſome, but all of them are wanting to our beſt works:
and therefore we muſt, with the Scriptures, aſcribe our whole
ſalvation to the grace of God, and acknowledge nothing inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
in us to be the prime cauſe of all his graces, but his owne
good will and pleaſure. <hi>I count the afflictions of this world not
worthy the glory that ſhall be revealed,</hi> Rom. 8. And in another
place he tells us, <hi>That wee deſerve hell for our evill workes. The
wages of ſinne is death,</hi> but not heaven for our good deeds and
ſufferings, but of Gods bounty and mercie. <hi>Eternall life is the
gift of God,</hi> Rom. 6. <hi>Not by the works of righteouſneſſe which wee
had done, but according to his mercie he ſaved us,</hi> Tit. 3. <hi>And ye
are ſaved by grace through faith, not of your ſelves, it is the gift of
God,</hi> Eph. 2. And how doth he prove that <hi>Abraham</hi> was juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by faith, and not by works? becauſe <hi>Ei qui operatur merces
non imputatur ſecundu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> gratiam, ſed ſecundum debitum.</hi> And if <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
had been juſtified by works, he had wherein to rejoyce,
but not with God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. Theſe are places of Scripture, and
let me build upon this occaſion, to produce an aſſertion which
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:57497:140"/>
once I brought upon another point, which ſome that I ſee here
preſent were pleaſed to except againſt, as ſavouring of blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;
though the words excepted againſt were none of mine, but
of <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> who lived above 1400. years agoe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently
brought by him in his diſcourſe with <hi>Tryphon</hi> a Jew; if
any, I will not ſay <hi>Pelagian,</hi> or <hi>Arminian,</hi> or <hi>Papiſt;</hi> but if all
the Fathers of the Primitive Church, if all the ancient Councels,
if <hi>Moſes</hi> and all the Prophets, if <hi>Paul</hi> and all the Apoſtles; if
an Angel from heaven; nay if God himſelf (theſe are the words
of <hi>Juſtin</hi> the Martyr) ſhould deliver any doctrine repugnant to
that which is contained in this booke, I would not believe him.
Agreeable unto theſe places of Scripture was the doctrine of the
ancient Church; <hi>Gratia evacuatur, ſi non gratis donatur, ſed me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritis
redditur.</hi> Aug. Epiſt. 105. <hi>Non dei gratia erit ullo modo, niſi
gratuita fuerit omni modo.</hi> And in a third place, <hi>Non pro merito
quidem accipimus vitam aeternam, ſed tantum pro gratia,</hi> Tract. 3.
in <hi>Ioh.</hi> And thus have I confirmed my propoſition by reaſon,

you, the whole Bible failes me in this point. <hi>Paul</hi> was taken up

and yet I have not told you what is there; that which eye hath

how can I ſpeak? that which never came into the heart of man,
how can it come into my heart to declare? and indeed to make
a long diſcourſe about this ſubject, were but with the blinde
man to diſcourſe about colours. He may talk long about them
but with eyes he cannot know them; and we may talke much of
Heavens joyes, but till we come there and ſee God we cannot
ſee them: Our knowledge is no more able to reach to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency

Citie of Kings, as well as in other places. But it may be truly
ſaid of this, that it is not <hi>Vrbs regum,</hi> but <hi>regnum regum,</hi> a
Kingdome of Kings; not the meaneſt doore-keeper there, but

we think not upon, peradventure we believe not the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of the other. Like bruit Beaſts, the moſt are carried with
carnall ſenſuality, and regard the preſent, they conſider not that
which is to come. If a Beaſt could ſpeak, he would ſay that hee
is in a more happy eſtate then men; the reaſon is, becauſe he fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
his owne pleaſures, but he hath not the wit to conſider the
felicity of man: Man can ſpeak, and he ſaith at leaſt in his heart,
he thinketh that he is in a more happy eſtate then the Angels in
heaven; he feels his owne felicity (which indeed is a miſery and
no felicity) he wants a ſpiritual underſtanding to judg of theirs.

amazed at the curiouſneſſe of the work-manſhip: An ignorant

asked him the reaſon why he did ſo much admire that image;
Oh, quoth <hi>Nicoſtratus,</hi> if thou hadſt mine eyes thou wouldſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

that is, either foretold things to come (that's the proper ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the word) or elſe explained and expounded the word.
The Prophets in the time of the Law did both, and in the New
Teſtament it is uſed both wayes. <hi>In thoſe days there came certain
Prophets from Jeruſalem to Antiochia,</hi> Act. 11. 27. That is, ſuch
as by revelation of the Spirit did foretell things to come, ſuch
was <hi>Agabus,</hi> and the daughters of <hi>Philip,</hi> Acts 21. There you
have it in the former ſignification, <hi>Deſpiſe not propheſie,</hi> 1 Theſ.
5. 20. <hi>Covet ſpiritual gifts, but rather that ye may propheſie,</hi> 1 Cor.
14. 1. And in the next verſe Propheſie is defined, <hi>A ſpeaking un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
men to edification, and to exhortation, and to comfort:</hi> there you
have it in the letter; here it's taken generally, as infolding both
theſe particulars: So that from hence may be gathered theſe
two propoſitions, which ſhall be the ſubject of my ſpeech at this
time.</p>
                  <p>1. A man may be a Prophet (that is, a foreteller of things to
come) and be a reprobate.</p>
                  <p>2. A man may be a learned Preacher, and a meanes of ſaving
others, and for all that be damned himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>To foretell future contingents (as they are conſidered in
themſelves,<note place="margin">Propoſitions.</note> and not in their cauſes (for ſo they are in ſome ſort

                     <hi>Who calleth things that are not as though they were, and
underſtandeth the thoughts of our hearts</hi> (things of all other moſt

this as an argument againſt the Idols of the Heathen, to prove

ſlips and fals of other men. The Sun when he ſhines the brighteſt
is not much looked upon; but when he is eclipſed, then one calls
another out of the doors to ſee him, and all gaze upon it, and
the greater the Eclipſe is, the more talk they of it: So is it with
them whom Chriſt ſtiles Lights of the world; their ſhining ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,

and to have our part with Chriſt in his glorious King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;
let us as the Apoſtle exhorts, take heed not only to
Doctrine, but to our ſelves firſt, not only to our preaching, that
it be ſound, but to our lives alſo, that they be unblameable;
let us not only be vigilant that the Bell ſtrike right above, but
that the wheels of the Clock go right below: let us not only
ſo ſpeake, but ſo do, as they that ſhall be judged by the Law
of liberty, leaſt after we have preached to others, and been a
meanes of their Salvation, <hi>ipſi reprobi fiamus,</hi> we our ſelves be

                  <p>I know well we are men while we are in this World, and not
Angels in reſpect of purity of nature, and therefore cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
unto our ſelves an immunity from falling. Let the old
<hi>Cathariſts,</hi> the <hi>Novatians, Donatiſts,</hi> and <hi>Pelagians,</hi> and the
new Puritanes of <hi>Rome,</hi> who hold an abſolute perfection in this
life, make Ladders for themſelves to climbe into Heaven (as
<hi>Conſtantine</hi> bad <hi>Aceſius</hi> a Novatian Biſhop) here is no room
for them in this World. For as in the moſt beautifull face that
ever was, there hath been ſome blemiſh, (<hi>Venus</hi> her ſelfe was
not without a Wart) which though every man do not note,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:57497:152"/>
yet by a skilfull Painter it may be obſerved (which made
<hi>Zeuxis,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cicero de in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent. lib. 2.</note> when at the requeſt of the <hi>Crotonians,</hi> he was to draw

for five of the moſt beautifull Virgins that could be found, and
from them all to frame a Picture, by reducing the quinteſſence of
all their beauties into one Modell) So in the moſt mortifyed
man that ever lived, there are ſome dregs of ſin; which though
the bleared eies of mans underſtanding cannot ſee them, yet the
al-ſeeing eies of God can eaſily diſcerne them. But what then;
becauſe we cannot be perfect Saints, muſt we therefore be right
Devils? becauſe the perfection of the Law is ſo high above our
reach, and ſo far beyond our Horizon, that we cannot chuſe
but ſay, its too wonderfull and excellent for us, we cannot at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
unto it: ſhall we therefore neglect it, or not take it for a
Lanterne unto our Feet, and a Light unto our Paths? Becauſe
we cannot be without ſin, ſhall we therefore be Servants and
Bond-ſlaves to ſin, and ſerve it in our mortall Bodies, and obey
it in the luſts thereof, and (as I feare ſome do) as if out-law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by God and man, ſay with them in the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Come and
let us breake their Bonds in ſunder, and caſt away their Cords

Its one thing with <hi>Paul</hi> to walke in the fleſh, and another to

another thing to fall in the high-way, another to fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
and walke or run in a bie way: we cannot promiſe to
our ſelves a priviledge from ſliding and ſtumbling, no nor from
falling in the way; with <hi>Eutychus</hi> we may get a dead fall, a
fall from the third Loft; from deſire to conſent, and then to
act. Here are three Lofts, and the leaſt, in the rigour of Juſtice,
is death; leaſt it prove a breake-neck fall (in caſe we ſhall ſo
fall) with <hi>Eli</hi> and <hi>Jezabell,</hi> we are not to lie on the Ground,
but ariſe betime and redeem the fall by running the faſter. Let
us keep diligent watch over our thoughts, words, and actions,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:57497:152"/>
that we do not only abſtaine from evill, but as much as humane
frailty will permit, from all appearance of evill; and even in
things lawfull, oftentimes for avoiding of ſcandall, reſtraine our
liberty (after the example of the Apoſtle, in eating of fleſh,
and refuſing wages for preaching the Goſpell) that we may
take away occaſion from them that deſire occaſion, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.
that we may ſtop the mouths of mad Dogs, and that they which
ſpeake evill of us as of evill Doers, and blame our good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
in Chriſt, may not only be aſhamed, but by our good
workes which they ſhall ſee, be occaſioned to glorify God in
the day of the viſitation, 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 12. 1 Pet.</hi> 3. 16.</p>
                  <p>The better that any Profeſſion is, the worſe is the man that
doth abuſe it. There is no Profeſſion but may give wall to the
calling of a Miniſter (though many in contempt of it, with
thoſe fooliſh Suitors in the Poet, <hi>Penelopen relinquunt, &amp; ad
ancillas confugiunt</hi>) So then a lewd and unworthy Miniſter is
one of the worſt Creatures under Heaven. I remember a Story
in the golden Legend in the life of <hi>Macarins:</hi> This Saint tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling
in a deſart found the Skull of a man, and asked whoſe it
was; the Skull made anſwer, that it was a relique of a Pagan
that was ſlaine in that place: and where is thy Soule, ſaid
<hi>Macarius?</hi> in Hell, ſaid the Skull, but it ſuffers the leaſt degree
of Hels puniſhments, for in Hell there be three Roomes; in
the higheſt, where are the leaſt torments, are the Pagans that
never heard of Chriſt; in the middle where the paine is dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
are the Jewes who crucified Chriſt, and perſecuted the
Preachers of the Goſpell; in the bottome of Hell, where the
Torments are trebled, lies the falſe Chriſtian, which outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
makes a ſhew of Religion, and in his heart denies the power
thereof. For the truth of this Story, <hi>credat Judaeus apella,</hi> he
that beleives that every word is Goſpel, that comes out of a
Friers mouth, may give credit to it if it pleaſe him. But for
that which the Skull is feigned to report, I can eaſily aſſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it, becauſe it is agreeable to Divinity: <hi>The Servant that
knowes not his Maſters will, and doth it not, ſhall be beaten with
fewer ſtripes; but the Servant that knoweth his Maſters will,
and doth it not, ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes.</hi> If a falſe Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
then ſurely a wicked Miniſter, who by his profeſſion
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:57497:153"/>
ſhould be a Guide of the Blind,<note place="margin">Rom. 2.</note> a Light of them that ſit in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,

they may procure a cap or a knee to our perſons, but very
little or no reputation to our Calling. If we would keep it from

for them that neglect the works of their particular calling,
I have reaſon to doubt: <hi>Pietas, honeſtas, probitas, privata bon a

which is not <hi>bonus vir;</hi> and yet it is not ſufficient for a man
that would beare Office in a Corporation, that he is <hi>bonus vir,</hi>
unleſſe he be alſo <hi>bonus civis,</hi> qualified with ſuch particular ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
as are requiſite to that Place. I commend <hi>Gregory Nazian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens</hi>
reſolution, who when they would needs chuſe him Biſhop,
fled into <hi>Pontus,</hi> and having afterward accepted the Dignity,
and from that tranſlated to another, and then to one of the
greateſt Biſhopricks in the World (inſomuch that ſome of
his Succeſſors contended with the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> for primacy)
did afterward voluntarily relinquiſh it. For indeed though he
was a fluent Oratour and a great Divine (which got him the
ſur-name of <hi>Theologus</hi>) and ſo acute a Diſputant, that the
<hi>Arians</hi> counted great <hi>Athanaſius</hi> a Childe in reſpect of him;
yet was he not fit (eſpecially in thoſe turbulent times) for
Church Government.</p>
                  <p>If I be deſirous to be reſolved in ſome doubtfull points of
Law, concerning mine Inheritance, and a Friend adviſe me to go
to ſuch a man, telling me that he is a very honeſt man, what
better am I for that, unleſſe he be skilfull in the Lawes, and able
and willing to reſolve me in that where I am doubtfull. If I have
a Garment to be made, I will not go to this or that man, whom
I heare to beare the name of an honeſt man. I will ſuppoſe every
man to be ſuch, unleſſe I know the contrary, but to him that is a
profeſſed Taylor, and able to do the work. So for us (that I
may bring that which hath been ſpoken home to my purpoſe)
It is not ſufficient for us that the World carries an opinion of us,
that we are good men in reſpect of generall vertues, unleſſe we
be good Miniſters, and put in practiſe thoſe Gifts which are
proper to that ſtate of life, wherein our Maſter hath ſet us.
Now preaching is the beſt flower that growes in our Garden,
its the very grace and ornament, nay the very life and <hi>eſſe,</hi> and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:57497:156"/>
ſpecificall form of a Miniſter, being the only ordinary meanes,
for ought that I know, which God hath appointed for ſaving of
Soules. This was meant as ſome moralize it) by the Bell and
Pomegranet on <hi>Aarons</hi> Garment; The Bell ſignified the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Goſpell, and the Pomegranet, the merits of Chriſt;
implying thus much, that the merits of Chriſt are by no other
means ordinarly conveyed to the Sons of men, then by the
preaching of the Goſpell; this is agreeable to the Apoſtles
Doctrine: <hi>Seeing the World by wiſdome knew not God, in the
wiſdome of God, it pleaſed God by the fooliſhneſſe of Preaching,</hi>
(So the World of Jews and Gentiles counted it) <hi>to ſave them
that beleive, 1 Cor. 1. How ſhall they call on him of whom they
have not heard, how ſhall they heare without a Preacher, Rom.</hi>
10. Where Salvation, Faith, Hearing, Preaching are linked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
<hi>Christ ſent me not to baptize but to preach the Goſpell,
1 Cor.</hi> 1. 7. his Commiſſion was for both, <hi>Go and teach all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
baptizing them, Matth.</hi> 28. His meaning then was this,
that the latter was the principall, the other but an appendix
unto it. Like that <hi>Jer. 7. 22. I ſpake not unto your Fathers,
when I brought them out of the Land of Aegypt, concerning Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
but this is the thing which I commanded them, to obey my
voice:</hi> and Hoſ. 6. 6. <hi>I will have mercy and not ſacrifice: obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
and mercy rather then ſacrifice or burnt offering.</hi> So it
may be ſaid of us, we are by our places to baptize, to adminiſter
the Sacraments, but our chiefe Office is to preach: For a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
then to have the name of an honeſt man, a learned man,
and ſeldome or never to come into the Pulpit (as ſome do)
is as if I ſhould ſay, this man is an excellent Scrivener, but never
puts Pen to paper; an excellent Lawyer but never pleads nor
gives counſell; an excellent Artificer, but neglects his Trade,
this (but) takes more from him then my commendation gives
him.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, thoſe that can but will not preach. Of the firſt, we

to the <hi>Gallatians,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 4.</note> to change my voice as Nurſes do when they
ſpeak to young Children; thou canſt not preach. Yea but as I
have heard a Judge ſpeak to a convinced Malefactor, whoſe life
he was deſirous to ſave; I cannot read, yea but I know thou
canſt and muſt read, or elſe I muſt pronounce Sentence againſt
thee. Yea but thou canſt preach, and preach thou muſt, or elſe
I muſt ſay unto thee, friend how cameſt thou in hither? I add no
more, thou wanteſt Logick and knowledge in the Arts, which
are hand-maids to Divinity, and many other helps which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
to a Preacher; yet mayeſt thou teach: As an over-ween<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
conceit of a mans abilities, ſo too baſe an opinion of thy ſelf,
may be an hindrance to vertue. Many had proved great men,
if they had not thought themſelves on the Hils-top, before
they were at the middeſt of the way: and ſome of our not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preaching
Miniſters might prove better then they are, if the
weakneſs of their braines did not hinder them from climbing,
becauſe they deſpaire of being excellent Preachers, therefore
they will do no good at all in their Profeſſion, they ſeldome
look upon Book but when they are in the Church: <hi>poſſunt
qui poſſe videntur.</hi> A mans conceit that he can do, will make him
ſomewhat adventure. When <hi>John Bradford</hi> was unwilling to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into the Miniſtry, alledging his weakneſs and inabilities for
preaching, if thou canſt not (quoth <hi>Martin Bncer</hi>) feed
thy Flock with fine Manchet, feed them with brown Bread.
<hi>Non poſſumus omnes eſſe Scipiones, aut Maximi,</hi> ſaith the Orator,
if thou canſt not do as thou wouldſt, do as thou mayeſt; if
thou wanteſt ſtrong Meat, feed with Milk, catechiſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
thy hearers in the ground of Religion, pray, heare, read,
ſtudy, confer, meditate, ſtir up the Gift of God which is thee,
kindle and blow up this fire, deſire the beſt Gifts, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.
and in ſo doing, God giving a bleſſing to thine endeavours,
<hi>Si non evaſeris in ſummum, at certe multos infra te videbis:</hi> as
<hi>Quintilian</hi> ſpeaks, if thou prove not the beſt, thou ſhalt not be
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:57497:157"/>
the worſt of thy profeſſion. If thy learning be ſo ſlender, that
thou canſt not well underſtand a Latine Author, be not diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
for that. We have many excellent Books of morall Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
in our Engliſh Tongue, and of controverſial writers we have
no want, furniſh thy ſelfe not with all, but with the beſt. <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrahit

much then many books, ſo ſhalt thou make it thine owne which
thou haſt read, and be able to make uſe of it for the diſcharge of
thy duty, and benefit of the Flock committed to thy charge. And
if thy learning and judgment be ſo weak, as that thou canſt not
ſo skilfully extract the quinteſsence out of the flower, with the
Bee, then rather give it them in thy Authors words, then not
at all.</p>
                  <p>I confeſſe I could never approve of thoſe lapwings, which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

theſe, not out of any vain-glorious humour of being reputed that
they are not, but out of a deſire to benefit their Flocks, beſides
the inſtructions given them by way of catechiſing, they ſhal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit

judgement they are not to be diſallowed:<note place="margin">Aug. de doct. Chriſtiana. lib. 4. cap. 29.</note> Nor will I; for beſide
that it will keep them from idleneſs, and peradventure from
worſe exerciſe, they ſhall both benefit their hearers, and receive
at leaſt ſome tincture of Divinity: as he that tarries long in an
Apothecaries ſhop will carrie the ſmell of it about him, and hee
that walkes in the Sun will be coloured by the heat of it.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond ſort is of ſuch as will not: my cenſure muſt be
ſharper againſt theſe then againſt the former. Hee that hath his
Garners full of graine, and will not bring it out to the Market in
ſuch a yeare as this, but rather ſuffer the people to ſtarve, then
ſell a buſhell, unleſſe, he may have an exceſſive price for it, is
worſe in the judgment of all men, then a poore man that doth
not furniſh the Market becauſe he wants. The mother is worſe,
that hath breaſts full of milke, and will not give ſuck (which the
Dragons deny not the young ones, <hi>Lam.</hi> 4. 3.) then ſhee that
hath dry breaſts and cannot: and is not he worſe that hath a
candle and hides it under a buſhell, and will not give light, then
he that is dark and cannot? that hath eyes, and winks, and will
not ſee, then he that is blind and cannot? that hath a tongue,
and will not ſpeak, then he that cannot becauſe he is dumb? It's
true of a Lawyer, <hi>Scire tuum nihil, ſi te ſcire hoc ſciat alter:</hi> If
every man knew as much in the Laws as the Lawyer doth, none
would ſeek unto him for Counſell. But it befits a Miniſter better,
if a <hi>ni</hi> be put to it, as <hi>Perſius</hi> hath it,

                  <p>His knowledg muſt not be ſhut up in the Ventricles of his

that was poured on <hi>Aarons</hi> head, it muſt diſcend to the skirts of
his cloathing, the meaneſt of them that are committed to his

not his flock, ſhall prove a right idoll indeed; for as he hath a

                  <p>I am not credulous in believing ill reports of any man (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
of a Miniſter) but if it be true which I have heard (and by
reaſon of the late Viſitation, I have ſomewhat more then a bare
report) it is to be lamented even with teares of blood, that ſome
of extraordinary gifts (as they would be deemed; and the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
their gifts are, the greater ſhall their judgment be if they be
found negligent) do ſcarce once in 12. or 13. years viſite a great
part of their Flock. Their little ones cry for bread, and there is
none to give them any. And in the place where they reſide, like
Atheiſts very often mew themſelves up in their private houſes,
when they ſhould be in the houſe of God feeding their Flocks:
and when they go to the Church, ordinarily continue there like
images without a word ſpeaking, and ſo fruſtrate their poor
hunger-ſtarv'd ſheep of their hopes. Like as when a barren cloud
hangs in the aire in time of a drought, and yeelding no drops to
water the dry and gaſping Earth, the expectation of the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman
is made fruſtrate: If they afford them once in the year,
or at moſt once in the quarter a diſh of Strawberries (as <hi>Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>
ſpake in the ſame caſe) it's a dainty, they muſt hold them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
contented. I wiſh it were as good as a diſh of Strawber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and not rather like <hi>Caligula's</hi> banquet, where all the ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetting
ſtuffe was made of gold, which did only feed the eye,
but not the bellie; this banquet is not of gold, but for the moſt
part of a worſe mettall (Latin) which with a tinkling noiſe may
tickle the eare, but never fill the ſtomack. <hi>Plinie</hi> writes of ſome

as a meanes to perpetuate and eternize the felicity of that State.
The Jewes likewiſe had three things, which they ſaid (and
ſaid truly) they had from God. The Temple, and the Ark, and
the Law; which becauſe they looked no further into, then the
out-ſide and externall Superficies of them (as if a man ſhould
buſie himſelfe with picking and licking the Shell of a Nut, and
neglect the Kernell; or reſt ſatisfied with keeping a true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
and ballance in his houſe, and never uſe them; or as if a
Scholler ſhould content himſelfe with looking on the Cover and
Strings of his Book, and never open it, nor learn the Contents
thereof) brought many Calamities upon them, and at length
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:57497:160"/>
proved their deſtruction; as long as the Temple was in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and the Ark in the Temple, and the Law in the Ark, they
thought all ſure; they themſelves were called, the people of
God, their City, the City of God; in it they had the Temple of
God, and the Ark of God, and the Law of God. What was
wanting? verily as much as is wanting to a good Souldier, when
he hath his Sword hanging by his ſide, and never offers to draw
it, when the Enemy aſſaults him; or to the Office of a Judge
when he ſits on the Bench, having the Scales painted over his
head, but ſpeaks not a word. Againſt this remiſneſſe (not to
give it a worſe name) the Prophet exclaimes the Law is diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
then the Letters remain in the Book, the practiſe is periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
Judgment never goes forth. <hi>Defluxit lex, Hab</hi> 14. its a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor
borrowed from the Pulſe; a mans bodily conſtitution
may be known by his Pulſe, if it be fallen down and give over
beating, the man is in the pangs of Death, or dead already; if ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement,
he is in a hot Feaver; if temperate, he is in good health.
The Law is the Pulſe of the Common-Wealth, if it move not,
the Body Politick is dead, if its motion be violent, its ſick of a
hot Ague, if moderate and equall, its well affected. In the
dayes of our Prophet, the Pulſes of the Law were quiet, no more
motion in them, then in the dead Sea, which neither ebbs nor
flowes. <hi>Judgment was fallen, and Justice could not enter, the
faithfull City was become an Harlot, her Princes Rebells and
Companions of Theeves, every one loved Gifts and followed after
Rewards, they judged not the Fatherleſſe, neither did the cauſe of
the Widow come before them,</hi> Iſa. 1. <hi>They had altogether broken
the Yoke, and burſt the Bonds, Jer.</hi> 5. 5. Whereupon the Lord
ſends his Prophet to the King of <hi>Judah,</hi> and his Servants, that is,
his chiefe Officers and Magiſtrates, with this Charge, that if
they deſired to continue their Poſſeſſions in that good Land
which he had given them, and to eſcape a miſerable ſlavery and
captivity under cruell Tyrants, in a ſtrange and Idolatrous
Country, into which for their ſinnes he was ready to bring
them, they ſhould put life into the Law, that the Pulſes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
might be perceived to move. <hi>Execute Judgment:</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the corruption of mans nature commonly runs from one
extream to another, <hi>in vitium ducit culpae fuga,</hi> here quires that
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:57497:160"/>
this Judgment be not too violent, but moderate and equitable.
<hi>Execute Judgment and righteouſneſſe,</hi> that is, righteous Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
For the Law, like a mans ſhooe, <hi>Si pede major erit ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertit,
ſi minor urit,</hi> if it be too wide it will give Liberty to the
Foot to tread awry, if too ſtrait<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it will pinch it. But what hath
a private man to do in matters of State? what Commiſſion
hath <hi>Jeremy</hi> a Prieſt, to come to the Court of a mighty King,
and to tell him and his Nobles of their duties? Surely a very
ſtrange one: He who is King of Kings and Lord of Lords had
ſet him over Nations and over Kingdomes, to pluck up and to
root out, <hi>Jer.</hi> 1. ſends him now as his Embaſſadour into the
Kings houſe, and gives him inſtruction what he ſhall ſpeak;
<hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God, eſteem not my Meſſage according to the
quality of my perſon, for though I be meane in place and of ſmall
reputation, yet my Errant is of another nature: I am</hi> vox cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantis,
<hi>a Cryer or Summoner ſent unto you from the great God of
Heaven &amp; Earth, who with a mighty hand and out-ſtretched Arme
brought your Fore-Fathers out of the Land of</hi> Aegypt, <hi>and gave
them this fruitfull Land which you now poſſeſſe, who being almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is able to defend you if you ſhall cleave unto him, and to puniſh
you, if you ſhall neglect his word, whoſe name is</hi> JEHOVAH, <hi>I am
yesterday and to day, and the ſame for ever, which was, and which
is, and which is to come, without change or ſhadow of change, that
which I have received from him, I deliver unto you: Thus ſaith
the Lord, Execute Judgement and Righteouſneſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As then Judges in their Circuite, in the ſeverall Counties
where they ſit, to heare and determine Cauſes, firſt cauſe
their Commiſſion to be read, then give the charge to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt;
So our Prophet firſt ſhewes his Commiſſion, <hi>Thus ſaith
the Lord,</hi> and then gives his Charge, <hi>Execute Judgment:</hi> And
theſe be the two Branches into which my Text divideth it
ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>In the Commiſſion I note, that a Prophet, and conſequently
a Miniſter, who in the new Teſtament is alſo called a Prophet,
is an Embaſſadour ſent from God unto the Sonnes of men: So
ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Wee are Embaſſadours from Christ, as though
God did beſeech you through us, we pray you in Chriſts ſtead, that
yee be reconciled unto God,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 20. <hi>Let a man ſo think of
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:57497:161"/>
us; as of the Miniſters of Chriſt, and diſpoſes of the ſecrets of
God, 1 Cor.</hi> 4. 1. This ſhewes the Dignity of this Calling, a
Calling whether you reſpect the Author, or the Subject, or the
end, as far exceeding all others, as <hi>Saul</hi> in length of body, did
the reſt of the <hi>Iſraelites:</hi> And ſurely if the Philoſopher could
call the Stones happy of which the Altar was builded, becauſe
they were had in honour when others were troden under feet,
then much more may they be termed happy,<note place="margin">Protarchus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pud Ariſt. phyſ. lib. 2.</note> whom the Lord
hath ſeparated from their Brethren, and taken neer unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,<note place="margin">Nomb. 16.</note>
to miniſter unto him, if they ſhall be found faithfull and
diligent in ſo high a calling.</p>
                  <p>But here I may juſtly take up the Prophets Complaint; <hi>Who
will beleive our report?</hi> If I ſhould dilate on this Subject, my
words would ſeem to many, as <hi>Lots</hi> did to his Sonnes in Law,
when he ſpoke of the deſtruction of <hi>Sodome,</hi> who ſeemed to
ſpeake as if he had mocked. I appeale to your conſciences, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Vocation of a Prieſt (ſo the prophane Gulls of this
World call it in diſgrace) be not by many reputed the moſt baſe
and contemptible Calling in the Land; that which the Apoſtle
ſpeakes of our generall calling to Chriſtianity, is at this day ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified;
of this particular Vocation; not many mighty, not many
noble are called, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. The poor, and the halt, and the lame,
and ſuch as are good for nothing elſe, are thought ſufficient for
theſe things; though the Apoſtle could ask <gap reason="foreign">

and weighty buſineſſe, of being an Embaſſadour from God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Sonnes of men? But its no matter, Philoſophy ſuffers no
great diſgrace, becauſe <hi>Agrippina</hi> will not have her Son, young
<hi>Nero,</hi> to ſtudy it; and a Pearle is not a ſtraw the worſe, becauſe

had the name of <hi>Triſmegiſtus,</hi> thrice greateſt, the greateſt Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher,

                  <p>Such an one was <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Prince and chiefe of all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
who did not preach to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> till
firſt inſtructed by the Lord what he ſhould ſay. Such were the
Prieſts of the Law (or at leaſt ſuch they ſhould have been) and
therefore the Lord ſaith, <hi>That the Prieſts lips ſhould preſerve
knowledge;</hi> and, <hi>That they ſhould ſeeke the law at his mouth.</hi> The
reaſon is added, becauſe he is the Angel, or Embaſſadour of the
Lord of Hoſts. Such was <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> whom the Lord tells, that he
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:57497:162"/>
had made a watch-man over the houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ezek. 3. 17.</note> and that hee
ſhould heare the word at his mouth, and give the people warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from him.<note place="margin">Jer. 1. 9.</note> Such was <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> who propheſied not to the
<hi>Jewes</hi> till the Lord had touched his tongue, and put words in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his mouth. Finally, ſuch were all the Prophets before the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> who had this law giuen them, that they
ſhould teach no more then he had given them in charge. Hence
be theſe and the like ſpeeches: <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord. The word
of the Lord. The burden of the Lord. The mouth of the Lord hath
ſpoken it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Come to the New Teſtament, and look upon the Apoſtles and
Evangeliſts, ſurely very excellent things were ſpoken of them;
they were called the ſalt of the Earth, the light of the World,
the friends of Chriſt; they had the keyes of Heaven gates given
unto them, <hi>That whatſoever they bound on earth ſhould be bound
in heaven; and whatſoever they looſed on earth, ſhould be looſed in
heaven.</hi> They were ſent to preach to all Nations, but not what
they would, but what they had in commiſſion from Chriſt,
<hi>Teach to obſerve all things which I have commanded,</hi> Mat. 28. 20.
Nay, Chriſt Jeſus the Son of God, the Privy Counſellor of the
Father, the only Maſter and Teacher of his Church, did impoſe
this law upon himſelfe, telling the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> that his <hi>Doctrine
was not his owne, but the Fathers that had ſent him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now then if the Prieſts of the Law, if the Prophets, if the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
if Chriſt Jeſus himſelfe did not preach any Doctrine but
what they received from God, if they were tyed to the word,
and might not decline to the right hand, nor to the left: Much
more are the Lords Miniſters at this day tied not to deliver any
Doctrine to their Hearers, but what is evidently grounded upon
the ſacred Oracles of Truth. They are to build the Kingdom of
Chriſt, to ſubvert the kingdome of Antichriſt; to feed the
Lords Sheep, to drive away the Wolves; to comfort the weake
and feeble knees, to break the brazen and iron ſinews of impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
ſinners; to ſing a ſong of mercie to penitent and humble
ſoules,<note place="margin">Jerem. 1.</note> to thunder judgments to forlorn miſcreants: <hi>To binde,
and to looſe, to plucke up, and to roote out; to deſtroy, and to cast
downe; to build and to plant,</hi> but all by the word of God.</p>
                  <p>The writings of Heathen men contain in them many excellent
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:57497:162"/>
precepts of Morality, but they are mingled with a number of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths
and vanities. The writings of the ancient Fathers are of
eſpeciall uſe in the Church of God, but they are not ſufficient
groun is for me to build my Faith upon them. I may no more in
all things follow their ſteps, then I may be drunk with <hi>Noah,</hi>
or commit inceſt with <hi>Lot,</hi> or be an Adulterer with <hi>David,</hi> or an
Idolater with <hi>Solomon,</hi> or with <hi>Peter</hi> deny and forſwear Chriſt.
I ſay of them all in reſpect of the Scriptures, as <hi>Stankarus</hi> a <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonian</hi>
Heretick ſpake of our Proteſtant Writers, in reſpect of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Lombard: Plus valet Petrus Lombardus quam Centum Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theri,</hi>
&amp;c. One <hi>Peter Lombard</hi> is of more worth then 100. <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
200. Melanctons, 300. Bullingers, 400. Peter Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,</hi>
and 500. <hi>Calvins.</hi> But one plaine ſentence of Scripture is
more worth then 100. <hi>Auſtins, 200. Cyprians, 300. Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
400. Ambroſes, 500. Gregories,</hi> where their Doctrines
are not warrantable by the word of God. I ſay of them as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle</hi>
did of <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Plato; Socrates</hi> is my Friend, and
<hi>Plato</hi> my Friend, but Truth is my greateſt Friend. And as <hi>Auſtin</hi>

as if that were dry which is like the Raine that comes down

<hi>Tullie;</hi> which although he (writing to a certain Lady, who was
too much addicted to reading of ſecular Authors) he relates as
a ſtory: Yet when the ſame was objected againſt him by <hi>Ruffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
and without queſtion <hi>Lactantius,</hi> and <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin,</hi>
and ſome others of the Fathers deſerved to lick of the whip
for this as well as <hi>Hierome,</hi> who were ſo throughly acquainted
with all ſecular Writers, that (as he himſelfe ſpeaks of ſome of
them) a man cannot tell whether he ſhall more admire them for
their ſecular learning, or their knowledg in the Scriptures; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that (as <hi>Julian</hi> complained of ſome of them) <hi>De aquila

                     <note place="margin">1 Sam. 15.</note>
It's true in the generall, eſpecially in this particular: <hi>To
do juſtice and judgement is more acceptable to God then ſacrifice,</hi>
Prov. 21. 3. It is a proper work of the Magiſtrates calling, and
he is a ſloathfull perſon that goes careleſly and negligently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the works of his vocation, it is a worke of God. <hi>Ye judge
not for men but for God,</hi> 2 Chron. 19. 6. <hi>And curſed is hee that
doth the worke of the Lord negligently,</hi> Jer. 48. The Law of it
ſelfe is a dead letter, execution is the ſoule of it. As the body
without the ſoule is dead, ſo is it without execution of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
It's not materiall how good a mans Will be, if the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors
who are put in truſt doe not perform it. The laws I may
call Gods Will, and the Will of the King: its no matter how
good they be, if thoſe who are appointed Executors neglect to
put them in execution. In this caſe they are no better then
Scar-crows, which being ſet up in the Fields by Husband-men
to keep away Birds, at the firſt becauſe they ſeem to be fenced
with bows, and Bills, and other weapons, are terrible to the
Fowles; but at length, ſeeing them ſtill in the ſame place, and
doing nothing, they make bold with them, and ſit on their
heads, and worſe too. Or like the Stock in the Fable, which
<hi>Jupiter</hi> caſt into a poole amongſt the Frogs, deſiring a King: At
the firſt by it's fall it ſo troubled the water, that they were all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
of it, and hid themſelves; but afterwards obſerving it to
be ſtill, they came croaking about it, and skipt over it, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it (as it was) a dead block. So the Lawes, though never ſo
dreadfull at the firſt; if they be not duly executed by them that
are in place, grow in contempt, and give occaſion to the bad,
to go on with boldneſſe in their lewd courſes, as <hi>Solomon</hi> hath
well obſerved, <hi>Eccleſ. 8. 11. Where ſentence is not executed
ſpeedily againſt an evill worke, the hearts of the ſonnes of men are

                  </p>
                  <p>So they are now,<note place="margin">Vſe.</note> and they are therefore ſo now, becauſe Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:57497:164"/>
is great (too true I doubt) that there is too great remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in executing Judgment, and that firſt in matters criminall;
Secondly, in civill controverſies between party and party.</p>
                  <p>The firſt of theſe doth not ſo much touch (or rather ſcarce
at all) the reverend Judges of this Circuit, as thoſe that are
of the Commiſſion of Peace, and other Officers in the County;
whereof ſome becauſe they would not be holden buſie bodies,
others becauſe they would not be counted raſh and indiſcreet
perſons, others becauſe they would be reputed gentle and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
men, content themſelves with the honour of their Office, and
neglect the duty and burden, and ſuffer many good Lawes to
faint and languiſh for want of Execution. Like <hi>Gallio</hi> Deputy
of <hi>Achaia,</hi> who when an open Out-rage was committed before
his face when he ſate on the Bench, paſt it by, and took no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of it; the <hi>Graecians</hi> took <hi>Soſthenes</hi> and beat him before the

18. In ſome particulars conducing to the publick good we
ſee ſome hope of Reformation, and if the old Proverbe be true,
according to the ſound of the Letters, <hi>Principium dimidium

that's all will be done. I am better perſwaded of you, I would be
loth to place any of you amongſt thoſe improvident Builders,
who having not counted the loſſe before hand, after they have
ſaid a good Foundation, give over, and are not able to bring it
to perfection. But there be many other things of a civill nature,
the redreſſe whereof would prove much beneficiall to the whole
Publick, which <hi>Gallio</hi> is pleaſed to wink at; and thoſe things
which are of a ſpirituall nature, which every Magiſtrate above
all other things ſhould take to heart, and ſo far as the Sphere
of his Authority will extend, procure Judgment to be executed
upon the Offenders; true Religion and the Service of God,
<hi>Gallio</hi> cares for none of theſe things: if popiſh Recuſants grow
more and more inſolent, if their number increaſe, if Prieſts and
Jeſuites run up and down the Country at their pleaſure, if
Gods name be horribly blaſphemed, if his Sabboths prophaned,
<hi>Gallio</hi> cares for none of theſe things; are your mindes ſet on
Righteouſneſſe,<note place="margin">Pſal. 81. 1.</note> O yee Congregation, and do yee judge the

Alas what skilleth it, how great, or how powerfull, or how
good a man be in reſpect of generall vertues, or how able and
ſufficient for his particular place, if he ſhall be deficient in the
practiſe of thoſe duties, which are proper to that State and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of life, wherein God hath placed him? Now a feareleſſe
and juſt, and impartiall executing of Judgment upon Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors,
is the beſt flower that growes in a Magiſtrates Garden,
its the grace and ornament, nay the very life and <hi>eſſe</hi> and ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
form of a good Governour, and the main end for which
God Almighty puts the Sword into his hand;<note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note> and herein he
ſhall not only cleare, his own conſcience, in diſcharging his duty,
and credite his calling, and do good Service to his Prince and
Country, and incourage the good, and diſhearten the bad, but
(which is more) he ſhall make peace between God and his
Country, and ſend a prohibition to the Court of Heaven, and
ſtop the mouth of the Judge of all the World, from giving Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
or if Sentence be given, from executing of Judgment, or
if Judgment be already begun, from further proceeding. Take
one or two examples, <hi>Pſal. 106. They joyned themſelves to Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alpeor,
and ate the Offerings of the dead, they provoked him to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
with their own inventions, and the Plague brake in amongſt
them: but when Phineas ſtood up &amp; executed Judgment, the Plague
was ſtaied, and the Lord ſaid unto Moſes, Phineas the Son of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liazer,
the Son of Aaron the Prieſt, hath turned away mine anger,
becauſe he was jealous for his God, and hath made an Attonement
for the Children of Iſrael, Numb.</hi> 25. For <hi>Achans</hi> ſin, God ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracteth
his helping hand from the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> they flee at the
ſound of Leafe ſhaken, and turn their backs upon their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
the ſinner is put to death, and the Lord turneth from his
fierce wrath, See <hi>Joſ.</hi> 7. for <hi>Sauls</hi> bloody houſe and cruelty
againſt the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> God ſends cleanneſs of teeth in all the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and ſcarcity of Bread in all the Villages of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> when
Judgment is executed God is appeaſed with the Land: See 2
<hi>Sam.</hi> 21. But till judgement be executed upon <hi>Sauls</hi> bloody
Family, let <hi>David</hi> do what he can, the Lord will not be appeaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
toward the Land. Till <hi>Achan</hi> be ſtoned, let <hi>Joſhuah</hi> and all
the Elders of <hi>Iſrael</hi> rent their Clothes, and put duſt upon their
heads, and fall down and pray before the Ark, the Lord will not
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:57497:165"/>
turn from his fierce wrath. Till <hi>Phineas</hi> execute Judgment,
thongh <hi>Moſes</hi> and all the Congregation of <hi>Iſrael</hi> weep before
the Door of the Tabernacle, the Plague ſhall continue. If a
Land be defiled with blood, do what otherwiſe may be done, it
will not be cleanſed but by the blood of him that ſhed it,
<hi>Numb.</hi> 25. 23. Thus then when the Gods of the Earth exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
Judgment upon the tranſgreſſours of the Law, they give
an inhibition to the God of Heaven from further proceeding:
Hence be theſe and the like ſpeeches ſo frequent in Charges gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

thou take evill away forth of the mids of thee, <hi>Deut. 13.
Deut</hi> 19. and in other places, what evill? not only <hi>malum cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pae,</hi>
but that which is a conſequent and fruit of it, <hi>malum paenae</hi>
too, as is plain, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. 17. that the Lord may turn from his
fierce wrath, and ſhew compaſſion upon thee.</p>
                  <p>On the other ſide, where they ſuffer the ſword of Juſtice to
ruſt and canker in the Scabberd, and ſuffer their Inferiours, as
if they lived in an <hi>Anarchie</hi> to do what they luſt, and let the
Reines looſe to all licentiouſneſſe, <hi>ut cum carceribus ſeſe effudêre
quadrigae, fertur equis auriga,</hi> as if there were no providence in
the Almighty. Then the Lord who is jealous of his honour, and
abhors all irregular motions, awakes as one out of ſleep, and
as a Giant refreſhed with wine, he unſheatheth his glittering
Sword, and executes vengeance both upon Prince and People,
and (unleſſe repentance follow) turnes them to a perpetuall
ſhame; whereof you have many examples in the Book of <hi>Judges,</hi>
to which <hi>David</hi> alludeth, <hi>Pſal. 106. The wrath of the Lord
was kindled againſt his people, inſomuch that he abhorred his owne
Inheritance, and gave them over into the hands of the Heathen,
and they that hated them were Lords over them.</hi> And what a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Judgment did <hi>Lot</hi> his neglect of executing Judgment bring
upon himſelfe and Family, and upon all <hi>Iſrael?</hi> of <hi>Iſrael</hi> there
fell by the hands of the <hi>Philistims</hi> at two Battels 3400. <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phni</hi>

the newes broke his neck, his Daughter in Law, <hi>Phineas</hi> his
Wife, at the hearing thereof was brought to Bed before her time,
and died, and which had never before happened, as ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
at her Death, the glory departed from <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:57497:166"/>

upon ſuch, as by their ſinnes had kindled Gods wrath;
and through the whole Book of Judges, how many Plagues are

which is ſo often repeated in that Book, <hi>In thoſe daies there was

                  <p>As there is a neglect in executing Judgment in matters cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minall:
So (I feare in adminiſtration of Juſtice in matters

beares the colour of the beſt, and many baſe mettals make as
faire a ſhew as the gold Ore, till the Fire diſcover them. The

they will invent for his and their own advantage <hi>mille nocendi

and Writs of Errour, and appeals, and I wot not what to make
the Suit endleſſe. Souldiers live better by war then by peace,
and theſe gain as much by contention, as they would looſe by
quietneſſe. Maggots and fleſh-flies feed on galled Horſe-backs,
and putrified ſoares, which if the skin were whole and ſound,
would quickly periſh for want of food. Theſe Vermin know
no better meanes to preſerve their own lives, then to keep the
ſoare raw and open: And many Empiricks that want meanes
and have little practiſe, when they meet with a Patient that is
for their purpoſe, will impoyſon the wound that it may be long
in healing, and ſpend as much time in curing a rue-rub, or a
blind blayne, then an honeſt and skilfull Phyſician will do in
healing a Gangraena, or a fiſtula. I will not, I need not apply.
When the Cauſe is ripened for hearing, and like to go againſt
them in the ſame Court, then if all other tricks and advantages
faile, an appeale muſt be made to another, and thence perhaps
after much time and mony ſpent, diſmiſſed and returned to the
place whence the appeale was made: as Chriſt was firſt brought
before <hi>Pilate</hi> as a computent Judge, before whom he was to be
tried, thence upon better adviſe was ſent to <hi>Herod,</hi> where after
he had been falſely accuſed, and ſhamefully abuſed, a Conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

Methinks thoſe Verſes which were made of <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Bibulus,</hi>
when they were Conſuls, the one being little better then a

Plutarch) ſaid of two Brethren, whereof one was called <hi>alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uter,</hi>
and the other <hi>uterque;</hi> having heard them both ſpeak,
out of a diſlike he had of the one, and approbation of the other:
<hi>alteruter</hi> (quoth he) ſhall be <hi>uterque,</hi> and <hi>uterque</hi> ſhall be <hi>neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
In our Fore-Fathers daies, the Eccleſiaſticall power did not
only ſtretch over Eccleſiaſticall perſons, but like the Tree which
<hi>Cambyſes</hi> ſaw in his Dream, it over ſhadowed and over topped
the temporall power too, and like <hi>Noahs</hi> Floud, it overflowed
the higheſt Mountaines as well as the loweſt Vallies. Then he
might well have been tearmed (and ſo he was by ſome) <hi>uter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que,</hi>

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:57497:168"/>
it makes me call to minde the Story of a <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monian,</hi>
who hearing a Nightingale ſinging in a Hedge,
ſuppoſed ſhe had been ſome great Bird, but having afterwards
catched her, and found her almoſt nothing but a few feathers,
he ſaid, <hi>vox es, praeterque nihil,</hi> and I cannot better reſemble them
then unto the counterfeit ſhewes of <hi>Semiramis,</hi> when ſhe fought
againſt the King of <hi>India,</hi> which a far off ſeemed to be Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants
and dromedaries, but when they were throughly tried,
proved nothing but Oxen-Hides, ſtuffed and bomebaſted with
ſtraw. Or to thoſe Enemies of <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> which ſeemed as they
had been Giants, but one of them being gotten, it was found
that they had ſtuffed their Dabblets and Breeches only to this
end, that they might appeare terrible to their Enemies.</p>
                  <p>I diſallow not Prohibitions where the Law allows them; where
there is (as ſometimes there may be) juſt cauſe for them:
a River if it keep its ſelfe within its bounds, is as good a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
as a man can have; but when it ſwels above its compaſſe,
and overflowes the Banks, <hi>Sternit agros, ſternit ſata laeta boum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
labores,</hi> it ſweeps away and makes havock of all things that
comes in its way. My wiſh is, that every river were confined with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
its own bank, that for the more ſpeedy diſpatch of Law-Suits,
every Court were bounded within its own limits, that neither
Eccleſiaſticall would incroach upon Civill, nor Civill upon Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall,
that when Prohibitions are granted, and the ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion
not ſufficiently proved, the party wronged may be ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
diſpatched by conſultation, or otherwiſe convenient expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition

                  <p>I am no Proctor for Eccleſiaſticall Courts, in which I heare
there be as many rubs, and lingring delaies, as in any other.
Its piety and commiſeration of the Clergy, that moves me thus
to ſpeak, who between theſe are toſſed up and down like Balls
in a Teneſ-Court, having no ſooner ended in one, they muſt begin
a freſh in the other; So that in this caſe it falls out with a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter,
as with a ſilly fly, which with much labour and trouble
having got out of a Spiders webb, preſently falls into another
that holds her faſt, and the faſter for this, that having ſpent her
ſtrength in the former, ſhe hath no power to reſiſt in the latter.
Or as it is with <hi>Syſiphus,</hi> whom Poets faine to be continually

<hi>Aut petis, aut urges rediturum Syſiphe ſaxum. Syſiphus,</hi> tumbling
a ſtone may be a fit emblem of a Miniſter ſuing for his Tithes,

my former Propoſition (its the duty of a Magiſtrate to ſee
that the good and wholeſome Lawes of his Country be duly
and ſpeedily executed) together with a touch by way of uſe

to give to the mighty his due titles and honour, nor ſo opinative
and ſelfe-conceited, as never to be led by a multitude, nor ſo
preciſe and ſcrupulous, as for feare of temptation, to debar a
rich man from his preſence; but neither pity of the poor, nor
honour of the mighty, nor conſent of the multitude, nor reward

but as the Sun keeps a ſtreight courſe under the Ecliptick
line, without declining to either ſide of the Zodiack, ſo muſt
he keep a ſtrict courſe under the line and rule of the law, and not
decline to either party further then equity and a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
will warrant him; he muſt not like Marriners and Saylers,

                  <p>In a word, he muſt lay judgment to the rule, and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

gold and lead, not giving a greater weight to gold becauſe

weigh every mans cauſe alike, not reſpective to one more then
another. This the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> figured by the hieroglyfical from
of a man without eyes or hands, intimating thereby that he
should neither have hands to receive bribes, nor eyes to behold
and reſpect the perſons of men. The ſame did the Greeks ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie,

                  <p>Now to make the Laws like Cobwebs, to hold Flesh flies, and
ſuch little Vermin, and for fear of diſpleaſure or hope of gain, to
let great ones eſcape, is as if a Shepheard should kill the Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots
in his Sheep, but withall give liberty to Foxes to worry them

Hath not God ſtyled the Magiſtrate with his owne

                  <p>The third and laſt Rock is Kindred and Friends: and ſurely if

<hi>Abſolon,</hi> an inceſtuous perſon, a murtherer, a Rebell againſt

                  <p>But this, how potent ſoever to fleſh and blood, muſt not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail

<hi>Cranmer,</hi> and <hi>Ridley</hi> then Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> to intreat for the
ſame, who coming before him alleadged the beſt reaſons they
could to accompliſh it; which reaſons he ſo pithily anſwered
and confuted out of Scripture, that they were forced to confeſs
his Replication to be true. Then they ſet on him another way,
alleadging Civill and Politick reaſons, her neerneſs unto him in

the breach of Amity on the Emperours part, the troubles and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions

Goods, and Kingdome, and life, and whatſoever he had, rather
then to yeild to that which he knew certainly to be againſt the
Truth: When all this would not move him, but they ſet on
him a fresh, and would have no deniall, he burſt into ſobs and
teares, and deſired to deſiſt from further moleſting him in that
matter; which made the Arch-Biſhop, when they were gone,
to ſay to the other Biſhop, that the King had more Religion in

of your learning and abilities, for thoſe high places where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
God hath ſet you; ſo have you alſo of your care and zeale,
for executing of righteous Judgment. Now as <hi>Plutarch</hi> writes
of <hi>Rue</hi> and <hi>Garlick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> that being planted beſide Roſes, they make
them ſmell the ſweeter; So the corruption of evill Magiſtrates,
ſet by the vertues of the good, make them more pleaſant in the
noſtrils of all good men. I doubt not but you may ſay with <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,</hi>
whoſe Oxe have we taken, or to whom have we willingly
done wrong, or at whoſe hand have we received any Bribe, to
blinde our Eies therewith?</p>
                  <p>Onely for concluſion, becauſe you are men, and therefore
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:57497:172"/>
cannot challenge unto your ſelves any immunity or priviledge
from falling, let me beſeech you, that the Doctrines already
propoſed and proved, may ſerve as Rules to keep you in an even
courſe; let the feare of God be upon you, take heed and do it.
To this purpoſe, firſt remember, that God hath ſet you in his
own room, and ſtiled you with his own name: its the chiefe
ſtudy of a Poet, that every ſpeech, and action, and geſture, be
ſutable to the perſon he brings upon the Stage.</p>

                  <p>You are upon the Stage, and you act Gods part, with whom
there is no iniquity, nor reſpect of perſons, nor receiving of
reward, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19. 2. think that God is preſent with you.
<hi>God ſtandeth in the Congregation of Gods, he is a Judge among
Gods;</hi> he notes your Actions, he heares your words, he pries
into your hearts, and ſpels every ſyllable of your conceits: the
Almighty cannot be more fully expreſſed to the eye then by
that old Hieroglyphick of an eye upon the top of a Staff, an eye
upon the top of a Staff looks every way, a Staff is not onely a
prop to ſupport him that leanes upon it, but it is a weapon both
of defence and offence: God is an Eye, do what yee will, he ſees
you; he is a ſure ſtaff, if yee lean unto him, he will ſupport you;
if yee do well he will defend you, if amiſſe he will beat you.
Wherefore now let the feare of God be upon you, take heed
what yee doe, for yee execute not the judgments of man but of
the Lord; let not reward blind you, nor friends ſway you, nor
intreaty move you, nor might terrifie you, nor one thing nor
other draw you aſide from that which is right; honour the
mighty, pitty the poore, reſpect friends and favourites, love
kindred, but ſtill, <hi>Salva pietate &amp; juſtitia</hi> preferr truth and a
good conſcience before them all: Theſe God and the King, and
the Laws, and the Countrey, and all good men, expect at your
hands; and if yee doe them, the evill ſhall dread you, the good
ſhall pray for you, the Heavens ſhall applaud you, the Angels
ſhall rejoyce at you, God ſhall bleſſe you with his beſt bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:57497:172"/>
and yee ſhall not need to be aſhamed, when you ſhall
ſpeak with your enemies in the Gate.</p>
                  <p>For the better effecting of that which hath been ſpoken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
righteous judgment, ſome things are required of others
who come hither to act their parts in ſuch buſineſſes as are to be
handled at theſe Aſſizes: Judges, though they be ſtyled Gods,
yet are they not omniſcient, but muſt heare many things with
other mens eares, and ſee with other mens eyes; and as the
Philoſopher ſaith, that <hi>Quicquid eſt in intellectu, prius fuit in
ſenſu:</hi> ſo whatſoever comes to the Judge to be determined ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Law, muſt firſt paſſe through the hands of witneſſes
and Jurors, and Pleaders, and others; theſe are to the Judge as
the externall ſenſes, and memory, and phantaſie, are to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
now if theſe faile in performing their ſeverall du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
the beſt Judge may err in Judgement, as doth the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
in apprehending of objects, when the ſenſes being ill
affected, doe not rightly informe. It is in matters of Judicature
as in a Clock, if all the Wheels and Wyers be in tune below, the
fault is in the Hammer or Bell, if it keep not time above; but
the Bell may miſſe the hour, and no fault in it, but in ſome
Wheele or Pinn or Wyer, that is out of order; ſo if any infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
parts of this Engine be out of courſe; if the witneſſe come
hither to ſell or lend his freind a falſe oath, in hope of a like
courteſie from him at another time: if the Jury agree upon a
Verdict contrary to the evidence, or if the Lawyer reſpect his
Clyent more then the truth,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>A</hi> Gellius. lib. 7. cap. 3.</note> and ſtudy rather to ſhew himſelfe
<hi>Dicendi peritum,</hi> then <hi>Virum bonum,</hi> as if he were one of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoras</hi>
his Schollers, whoſe profeſſion (as <hi>Gellius</hi> tells us) was to
teach <hi>Quanam verborum induſtria cauſa infirmior fieret fortior,</hi>
how to make the worſe Cauſe ſeem the better: How can the
Judge, who (unleſſe the contrary be privately knowne unto
him) is to proceed, <hi>Secundum allegata &amp; probata,</hi> but faile in
executing of Judgment and righteouſneſſe?</p>
                  <p>To theſe I ſhould now have directed my ſpeech, but being
prevented by the time, I onely begg at Gods hands, that hee
would work in the heart of every man who is to be imployed in
any of theſe buſineſſes, an holy deſire and conſcionable endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to diſcharge his duty. Lord thou haſt commanded that
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:57497:173"/>
Judgment and Righteouſneſſe be executed: <hi>Da quod jubes, &amp;
jube quod vis:</hi> thou O God of truth, let no man open his mouth
againſt the truth; let Witneſſes ſweare truth, and Jurors ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
truth, and Pleaders lay open the truth, and Judges give
ſentence and judgment according to truth; that equity and
truth may meet together, that righteouſneſſe and peace may
kiſſe and imbrace each other, even for <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> his ſake, who
is the way and the life, and the truth; to whom with thee and
the holy Spirit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
