            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

were knowen to reason, and done by the body and outward action of men: And the same knowledge had he, and no more of the remedye againste the syckenes of synne. And as his fathers and the world thoughte (so dyd hee) that the merites of their sacrifices and the well doing of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues, was a sufficient remedye to heale them both in body &amp; in soule. Where vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Christ most mercifully pitieth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poore man, &amp; wyth contrarye knowledge both of sicknes, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> remedy therof, sheweth that the desease man is infected wyth, goeth farther then reason and the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter action of the bodye, and occupyeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> soule of man with concupiscence, rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, frowardnes &amp; contumacie againste god: Wherefore he calleth all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> man hath of him self but fleshe.<note place="margin">

And
<pb facs="tcp:19493:14"/>
argueth thys waye, as the people that were stronge wyth the Serpentes in the wildernes were not made whole by their owne workes, or for the dignitye or ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyce of anye sacryfyce that they offred, but by the syghte of the Serpente that represented Christe too come: Euen soo Nicodemus nor anye other that is stong wyth the Serpentes of synne, be made whole by theyr owne woorkes or anye sacrifyce they can offre, but onely by the merites of Christe. And euyn as the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple could not come too the knowledge of this remedy by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> serpent, thorough their fathers, or theyr owne wysedome: noo more can Nicodemus or any man liuing come too the knowledge of the remedye, for syckenes and synne, in oure sauyoure Christe,<note place="margin">

For in the firste parte of hys wordes he
<pb facs="tcp:19493:15"/>
declareth how that men should knowe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> causes of sicknes, and in the second parte the remedy &amp; help for the same. The cause of sicknes (as it appeareth by this worde repente) is that men haue by their owne folly turned them selues from the truth of God, to the erroure and fonde opinion of man: from true faythe too vncertaine fables: from verteous &amp; godlye workes, to vncleanlynes and corruption of lyfe. Christe therfore seyng the worlde howe it is in daunger by reason it hath forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the wisedome &amp; rule of goodes word, calleth it home agayne too a better way, byddynge it repente: As though he had sayed, tourne too a better mynde, and leaue the wayes accustomed, and learne to be wyse, and walke in the wayes and wysedome appoyncted by God. Here ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth alsoo, that the causes of all the daungers that Christe wylled hys au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyence too repente for, was their synne and iniquytye. The cause of synne, was infydelytye and accustomed doing of euill: The cause of infidelitie and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed doing of yuel, was ignorau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie or misunderstandynge of goodes woorde.
<pb facs="tcp:19493:15"/>
The cause of ignoraunce or mysunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standinge of goddes word was Sathan goddes and mannes enemie, and mans willing consent to the diuelish sophistry and false construinge of goddes woorde. And from these causes springeth all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases and sicknes,<note place="margin">

               <p>The sicke man muste remembre what the first word repente meaneth, and how he maye come by it. Repentaunce that God requireth, is the retourne of the synner from synne, intoo a newe lyfe in Christe. Whiche retourne is an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uacyon and renouacyon of the mynde of manne by Goddes spiryte in Christe, wyth denyall of the former lyfe, too begynne a newe and better lyfe. And thys repentaunce spryngeth from the knowledge of sinne by the lawe of God. From the knowledge of sinne, commeth the hatred of synne: from the hatred of synne, proceadeth the leauynge and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from synne. From y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> departure from synne, commeth by faythe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough Christes bloud, remissio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of sinne.

Wherefore it is euery ministers office of the churche diligently (and especially in the tyme of pestylence and plages) to call vpon the people for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendmente of lyfe. And too shewe them truely, diligently and plainly this medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine of repentaunce. Whiche consisteth of these partes. First, in knowledge of sinne, then in hatred of synne.
