            <title>A relation of a terrible monster taken by a fisherman neere Wollage, July the 15. 1642. and is now to be seen in Kings street, Westminster. The shape whereof is like a toad, and may be called a toad-fish, but that which makes it a monster, is, that it hath hands with fingers like a man, and is chested like a man. Being neere five foot long, and three foot over, the thicknesse of an ordinary man. The following discourse will describe him more particularly. Whereunto is added, a relation of a bloudy encounter betwixt the Lord Faulconbridge and Sir John Hotham, wherein the Duke of Richmond is hurt, and the Lord Faulconbridge taken prisoner.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Relation of a terrible Monſter
called a Toad-fiſh, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>GOD ſheweth his wonders in the deep,</hi> (ſaith the
royall Prophet) but thoſe wonders are never
with our wonder, when once they leave their
wonted ſtations, and come (upon what meſſage God
knows) to viſit us in an unknowne world: their ſhapes
being as miraculous to us, as our element unnaturall
unto them. But to the purpoſe. <hi>Friday</hi> morning, <hi>July</hi>
15. between 4. and 5. of the clock in the morning, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
above <hi>Wollage,</hi> one <hi>Thomas Weſt,</hi> caſting his net upon
the comming in of the tide, for Salmon; upon the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in of the net, (whoſe weight and difficulty in drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
portended to him good tidings) on a ſudden he
found a ſtrange alteration: he ſees in the net a Fiend,
not a Fiſh; at the leaſt a Monſter, not an ordinary crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Had not his companion had a better reſolution, he
would rather have been rid of his net, then troubled
with his gueſt, ſo deeply was he ſtruck with the odious
ſhape of it. I now proceed to its ſhape and dimenſions.
It is by the vote of divers Gentlemen of great quality
that went to ſee it, ſuch a monſtrous creature as ſcarce
can be beleeved ever to have been ſeen: this morning
brought alive into Glove-Alley in Kings ſtreet. It is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a Toad-fiſh, and with good reaſon; for the head and
eyes, when it lyes upon its belly, doe perfectly reſemble
a Toad. But here lyes the wonder, turne him up, or but
a little raiſe his head, and you ſhall behold the perfect
breaſt and cheſt of a man: nay you may evidently tell
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:123974:3"/>
as many ribs, both ſhort and long, as are in a man, and of
the ſame joynture and feature; and two as perfect hands
as any man whatſoever. By which it is evident that he
ſwims upright, beating the water with his hands, as we
all know how the Toad marcheth with his ſnowt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.
His mouth very broad, with three ranks of ſharp
teeth; whereby it is probable that it is a devouring, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venous,
and prey-booting fiſh; yet is its mouth the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
embleme of a Toad, as likewiſe its eyes. A Butchers
wife comming in haſtily to ſee it, and hearing at the firſt
that there was a ſtrange fiſh to be ſeene, and being upon
it in the ſtable where it lay before ſhe was aware, thruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in among others, ſtarted from it with a ſhreek, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Oh the devill in the ſhape of a great fiſh,</hi> ſwounded, and
was faine to be carryed out. The dimenſions of the
fiſh are theſe: He is in length well-nigh five foot, in
breadth a yard over, having on each ſide two huge fins,
in likeneſſe much like a Thornback, his taile a foot in
length, as it were all of Whale-bone.</p>
            <p>Now the comming up of this monſter into the freſh
river, and ſo nigh the ſhore, is more then remarkable,
(never any of this ſtrange kinde ever having beene
ſeene by any age before:) For <hi>Plinie,</hi> the Naturalliſt,
although he confeſſeth that there is no creature or ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
upon the earth, but hath its like in the ſeas, and
that there is a Toad-fiſh, yet this Author averreth, that
that fiſh never commeth neare the ſhore, but is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
in the depth of the Ocean, as is the Sharke, the
Flaile-fiſh, and others of that noxious kinde, and that
he never ſaw or heard of any taken upon any Coaſt
ſave one, which was in the yeare that <hi>Nero</hi> (that never-ſufficiently
deteſted Tyrant) was borne in, of which he
hath this note, that <hi>Monſtrum praeceſsit monſtro:</hi> and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:123974:3"/>
divined that its arrivall was ominous, as indeed all
Hiſtories doe with conſtant conſent maintain &amp; write,
that all unuſuall births either in men or bruit creatures,
in ſea or upon land, eſpecially out of their ſeaſons, have
ever been the fore-runners and ſad harbingers of great
commotions and tumults in States and Kingdomes, if
not mournfull Heraulds of utter deſolation: Witneſſe
the Heifer calving of a Lambe upon the Altar in Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,
(mentioned by <hi>Joſephus</hi>) ſome halfe a yeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the diſmall ſacking, firing, and finall ſubverſion of
that beautifull &amp; renowned City by <hi>Veſpaſian.</hi> A mares
foling of a colt with two heads at <hi>Vitellius</hi> (that beaſt)

of <hi>Germanie,</hi> and King of <hi>Spaine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe unnaturall accidentss though dumbe, do not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
ſpeake the ſupernaturall intentions and
purpoſes of the Divine powers, chiefely when they
meete juſt at that time when diſtractions, jars, and
diſtempers are a foote in a Common-weale or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come:
Meſſengers of Juſtice they were ever accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
nay, they have without miſſing ever proved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to be the ſame. God in his mercie grant that this
ugly monſter may not for our ſins prove the like to us,
ſeeing the divers ſins which are by divers Divines
compriſed in the nature of a toade, raigne, and have
their ſwinge in our Nation. It is further obſerved by
thoſe that profeſſe ſkill in Prognoſtication, that of
how much the monſter is of feature or faſhion, hatefull
and odious, ſo much it portends danger the more
dreadfull and univerſall; God defend their obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:123974:4"/>
may not hold in us, but ſurely a creature (if a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
we may call it, though truly it goeth ſomething
againſt the haire, conſidering its deteſtible ugly ſhape)
I ſay a creature more diſpleaſing, and at which hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
blood may riſe, I never ſaw with my eye, nor
deſire to ſee againe.</p>
            <p>LORD we beſeech thee turne thy back upon our ſinnes,
and thy favourable aſpect upon our miſeries, very likely
with more haſte then good ſpeede to light upon us. Unite (good
God) Head and Members, King and Parliament, encreaſe
their loyall affections to him, his royall approbation to them
and their proceedings, whence may proceede in our time His
Majeſties content and all our ſecurities, and let all true-hearted,
