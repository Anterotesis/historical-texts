            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE</head>
            <p>THe following Answer to that Treatise, entituled, <hi>Interest of Money mistaken,</hi> I wrote long before the last Session of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, that began the 19th of <hi>October,</hi> 1669. but fore-seeing that that Session might be engaged in greater Debates of another Nature, and in consequence not have leisure to consider this subject, I deferred the Printing of it, since which I have seen another Treatise, wrote by <hi>Thomas Manly,</hi> Gentleman, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to prove, That it will be for the advantage of this Kingdom, to continue the Interst of <hi>Money</hi> at 6 <hi>per Cent,</hi> but after several perusals of his Treatise, I must needs say, that either
<pb facs="tcp:51653:4"/>
I understand nothing of this subject, or else this Gentleman is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ranger to it that ever under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to discourse it, he having writ much, but in my Opinion nothing to the purpose, more than was much better (though brieflier) said by the Author of the fore-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Treatise, out of which most of his seems to be borrowed, though the Words be varied, with some additions of Interrogations, Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stulations, Similes and Circumlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions.</p>
            <p>Besides, the Gentleman taking up things at random, and for want of a due understanding of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is very unfortunate in his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of Fact, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In his Preface, about the middle, his Words are, <hi>Has Abatement of Vsury, or some other sublime Policy, obliged the</hi> French <hi>of late to set upon Trade and Manufactures</hi>? And then he affirms, that I dare not touch
<pb facs="tcp:51653:4"/>
on that String, in regard that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath not for many Years alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Interest from 7 <hi>per Cent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To his Interrogation, I answer positively, that the Abatement of Usury hath done it; and if you will not believe me, read the <hi>French</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts themselves, and they will tell you so (an Abstract of one whereof I have recited in the following Treatise.)</p>
            <p>To his Affirmation, that I dare not touch upon this String, I say, I dare do it, and put the whole issue upon this, for the <hi>French</hi> in fact have brought down the Use of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney under 6 <hi>per Cent,</hi> and that to 5 <hi>per Cent</hi> lately; as I have been credibly informed, and do believe; and if they had omitted this, all their bussling in other things would signifie <hi>very little</hi> in <hi>conclusion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Sweeds</hi> likewise since they established their <hi>Council of Trade,</hi> and set themselves to the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb facs="tcp:51653:5"/>
of making themselves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable by Trade, have reduced their Interest from 10 to 6 <hi>per Cent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His following Words are, <hi>Do</hi> Italy <hi>and</hi> Holland <hi>owe their Trade and Riches to the lowness of Vsury, or to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ir innate Frugality, wonderful Industry, and admirable Arts,</hi> &amp;c?</p>
            <p>I answer; <hi>low Interest</hi> is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Mother of Frugality, Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry and Arts, which I hope the <hi>Gentleman's</hi> Eyes will be open e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to see by that time he hath read a little further, and considered two or three Years longer.</p>
            <p>But it may be said, How can a low Interest be the natural Mother of Frugality, when, if this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man be to be believed <hi>Abatement of our Vse-Money brought in our Drinking</hi>? which he does not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly say, but prove, as he thinks, by an instance of Fact; for he says, we now spend usually twenty thousand Tuns of <hi>French</hi> Wine, (and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
<pb facs="tcp:51653:5"/>
that a far greater quantity is yearly Imported) and that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of <hi>Spanish, Rhenish</hi> and <hi>Levant</hi> Wines far exceeds the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, so that by his calculate, &amp; as he says, grounded upon a v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ry good authority, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>Report</hi> to the House of <hi>Commons,</hi> it should seem that there is about the quantity of forty five thousand Tuns of Wine of all sorts Imported annually into <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if it shall appear in Fact, that before the last abatement of Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest from 8 to 6 <hi>per Cent,</hi> we did usually import near twice the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Wines annually we now do, and that now in all sorts of Wines we do not import above the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of twenty thousand Tuns year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; then what will become of his large Structure, built upon a Sandy Foundation?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reader!</hi> this is the Case, and the matter of Fact truly recited by me,
<pb facs="tcp:51653:6"/>
(which many of the honourable <hi>Members</hi> of the House of <hi>Commons</hi> well know) and mistaken by him; from whence I might with much more reason infer, that the abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Interest drove out our Drinking (so <hi>pro tanto</hi> it did) but I know there were likewise other Causes for it, especially the additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Duties that from time to time have been laid upon Wines.</p>
            <p>But before I part with the <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> on this point, I must note to him another monstrous mistake in Fact, or at least in his Inference, <hi>viz.</hi> he says, that twenty thousand Tuns of <hi>French</hi> Wines at 2 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d. per</hi> Gallon, amounts to 640000 <hi>l.</hi> and concludes (if I understand him) that so much is lost to <hi>England</hi>; whereas, were the matter of Fact as he supposeth, which it is not so in any measure, this inference would be strangely erroneous; for by the expence of such a quantity we can ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally
<pb facs="tcp:51653:6"/>
lose only the first cost, which is but about 6 or 7 <hi>l. per</hi> Tun, and that amounts to but 120000 <hi>l.</hi> or 140000 <hi>l.</hi> at the utmost, all the rest being Freight, Custom and Charges paid to the <hi>King,</hi> and our own Country-men, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not lost to <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude this Head, I do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree fully with the <hi>Gentleman,</hi> that <hi>Luxury</hi> and <hi>Prodigality</hi> are as well prejudicial to <hi>Kingdoms</hi> as to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate <hi>Families</hi>; and that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of foreign Commodities, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially foreign Manufactures, is the worst expence a Nation can be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable to, and ought to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented as much as possible, but that nothing hath or will incline this or any other Nation more to Thrifti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and good Husbandry, then abatement of Interest, I think I have proved in the following Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, and that therefore all that this Gentleman hath said about
<pb facs="tcp:51653:7"/>
Luxury, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is against himself, and for lessening of Interest.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Gentleman</hi> at the beginning of his Preface saith, <hi>He will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the lawfulness of Interest, but leave the scrupulous to the several Discourses made publick on that sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</hi> For my part I shall agree with him in that likewise; And to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that what hath been made publick formerly may the better be known, I would entreat those that would be throughly satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied therein, diligently to peruse an excellent Treatise, entituled, <hi>The Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Vsurer, or Vsury condemned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Collection of the Opinions of many of the learned Fathers of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>and other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,</hi> Printed at <hi>London, Anno</hi> 1634<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; now about to be Reprinted.</p>
            <p>But upon this occasion I shall humbly presume to say, that if by the following Discourses it shall appear, that the Interest of <hi>England</hi> being higher then that of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<pb facs="tcp:51653:7"/>
Country, it doth render our Lands (our common Mother) of vile and base esteem; doth prevent the cultivation and improvement of our Country, as otherwise it might and would be improved; doth hinder the growth of Trade and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment and encrease of the Hands of our Country; doth encourage Idleness and Luxury, and discourage Navigation, Industry, Arts and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention; then I make no question but the taking of such an Interest as exceeds the measure of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, is <hi>Malum in se,</hi> by the light of Nature, and consequently a Sin, although God had never expresly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid it.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Vsurer</hi> may say, suppose the <hi>Borrower</hi> makes 12 <hi>per cent</hi> of my Money, is it a Sin in me to take 6 <hi>per cent</hi> of him? I answer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them two there may be no commutative Injustice, according to my weak Judgment, while each re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a mutual Benefit, the <hi>Vsurer</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:51653:8"/>
for his Money, the <hi>Borrower</hi> for his Industry; but in the mean time if the Rate given and taken exceed the Rate of our neighbour Nations, these fatal National evil Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences will ensue to our common Country by such a practice, which therefore I conclude to be <hi>Malum in se</hi>: And peradventure therefore the Wisdom of God Almighty did prohibit the <hi>Iews</hi> from lending upon Use one to another, but allowed them to lend to Strangers for the Enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their own Nation, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of their own Teritory, and for the Impoverishing of others, those to whom they were permitted to lend, being such only whom they were commanded to Destroy, or at least to keep Poor and Miserable, as the <hi>Gibeonites, &amp;c.</hi> hewers of Wood, and drawers of Water.</p>
            <p>I purpose to do the Gentleman that right as not to omit taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of any thing he hath of novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

in relation to the present Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie, whether it be material or no; and in order thereunto, the next thing I observe new in his Treatise, is, Page 9. It is, saith he, <hi>Dearness of Wages that spoils the</hi> English <hi>Trade, and abases our Lands, not Vsury</hi>; and therefore he propounds the making a <hi>Law</hi> to retrench the Hire of <hi>Poor mens</hi> Labour, (<hi>an honest charitable Project, and well becoming a</hi> Usurer) the Answer to this is easie.</p>
            <p n="1">1st, I affirm, and can prove he is mistaken in fact, for the <hi>Dutch</hi> with whom we principally contend in Trade, give generally more Wages to all their <hi>Manufacturers</hi> by at least two Pence in the Shilling, then the <hi>English.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> Where-ever Wages are high universally throughout the whole World, it is an infallible evidence of the Riches of that Country; and where-ever Wages for Labour runs
<pb facs="tcp:51653:9"/>
low, it is a proof of the Poverty of that place.</p>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>abour of our People, we drive them from us to other Countries that give better Rates, and so the <hi>Dutch</hi> have drain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us of our <hi>Sea-men</hi> and <hi>woollen Manufacturers</hi>; and <hi>We,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> of their <hi>Artificers</hi> and <hi>Silk-Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facturers,</hi> and of many more we should, if our Laws otherwise gave them fitting encouragement, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of more in due place.</p>
            <p n="4">4<hi>thly,</hi> If any particular Trades exact more here then in <hi>Holland,</hi> they are only such as do it by vertue of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporations, Priviledges and Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, whereof the cure is easie by an Act of <hi>Naturalization,</hi> and without Compulsitory Laws.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:51653:9"/>It is true our great Great-<hi>Grand-Fathers</hi> did exercise such a Policy of endeavouring to retrench the price of Labour by a Law (although they could never effect it) but that was before Trade was introduced into this Kingdom; we are since, with the rest of the Trading World, grown Wiser in this matter, and I hope shall so continue.</p>
            <p>The next new Objection the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman</hi> hath, is Page 13. <hi>If we abate Interest</hi> (said he) <hi>will not the</hi> Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander <hi>take the same course, while we like Children wink, and think no body sees us?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yes, certainly the <hi>Dutch</hi> will take the same course, except they leave their old wont, for we never yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated our Interest, but they soon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated theirs; but what if they do? We having brought our Interest to 4 <hi>per cent,</hi> shall have them against a Wall, we know the length of their Tedder, they cannot run much far<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:51653:10"/>
from us, so that if we wink, it is not like Children as the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man supposeth, but if we take his Advice, we shall wink like Children, while other Nations strike us by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating their Interest.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If we cannot gain all we would of them presently, we shall gain the more from other Parts of the World, that cannot suddenly abate their Interest to any proportion with ours.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Why shall we absolutely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that other Nations will do it? May we not think that some Parts or People in the World, may be as un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fore-seeing as this Gentleman pretends to be, and not know it is for their Advantage to lower their Interest, though we know it to be ours?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Why may we not think that Corruption, Avarice and Usurers, may be so prevalent in some parts of
<pb facs="tcp:51653:10"/>
the World, as to obstruct so good and National a Work as this?</p>
            <p>I omit several other Errors in fact that the Gentleman is guilty of in the course of his Writing, and must needs be so, having taken up his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (for want of Experience) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on trust from others, who perhaps understand as little as himself, <hi>viz.</hi> Page 16. he saith, <hi>Our vent into</hi> Spain <hi>and</hi> Portugal <hi>is greatly lessened,</hi> and consequently he reckons them two Trades, among others lost in whole or in part, so great a mistake, that I dare affirm, and appeal to the Record of the <hi>Custom-House</hi> Books, for a judgment in this case, that those two Trades, as to our native Expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations are more then treebled within less then 30. years.</p>
            <p>Page 21. he saith, that, <hi>If Wages,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>were as cheap, and Vsury as low with us as in</hi> Holland, <hi>yet if our</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants <hi>live at so great a rate as now they do, how is it possible we should
<pb facs="tcp:51653:11"/>
thrive on as easie Gains as those who spend so much less, and Trade so much more?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I answer, there is nothing in the World will engage our <hi>Merchants</hi> to spend less and Trade more, than the Abatement of Interest, for the subduing of Interest will bring in multitudes of Traders, as it hath in <hi>Holland,</hi> to such a degree that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all their People of both Sexes are Traders, and the many Traders will necessitate <hi>Merchants</hi> to Trade for less Profit, and consequently be more frugal in their Expences, which is the true reason why many conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Merchants</hi> are against the lessening of <hi>Interest,</hi> whereof I have said somewhat more in the following Treatise.</p>
            <p>Page 43. he propounds another remedy f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r the advance of our Trade, and the keeping our Coin at Home, and enlargeth much upon it in his Appendix, which is <hi>To
<pb facs="tcp:51653:11"/>
diminish the intrinsick value of our Coin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the <hi>Gentleman</hi> had understood <hi>Trade</hi> half so well, as he is said to do <hi>Mortgages, Bonds</hi> and <hi>Bills</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he would not have mentioned this old thred-bare and exploded Project, which is a trick hath been tried so often in <hi>Spain,</hi> till it hath left them more black Money (as they call it) then white or yellow, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing their Silver Mines in <hi>Peru</hi> and <hi>Mexico,</hi> and that their Laws make it Death to export Gold or Silver.</p>
            <p>This Conceit I have known three times experienced likewise in <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi> within this 24 or 25 years, at first the piece of 8 Rials went at 400 Ries, after that was brought to 480, after that to 520, and now to 600 Ries, and yet still we bring their Money from them as heretofore, and sell our Commodities to them for as much Silver as ever.</p>
            <p>The reason is evident; suppose
<pb facs="tcp:51653:12"/>
for example, a Hat that was usually sold to them for 4 peices of 8, when the peice of 8 was at 400 Ries, we then sold such a Hat for 1600 Ries, when they raised the peice of eight, 80 Reis <hi>per</hi> peice more, we sold the same Hat at 2000 Ries, and so rising in proportion as they raised their Coin, the <hi>Merchant</hi> still observing what the intrinsick value of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is, not the name it is called by, and so it would be in <hi>England,</hi> or any part of the World.</p>
            <p>I have now done with all I can find of novelty in this Gentlemans Treatise, to meddle with old and stale matter, which in other words hath been often said, and as often answered, would be but to trouble the <hi>Reader</hi> with Impertinencies; so would it likewise to use opprobrious, calumniating Reflections, as he doth covertly in a business of that serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, weight and publick concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as this is; I understand not
<pb facs="tcp:51653:12"/>
the World so little as not to know, that he that will faithfully serve his Country, must be content to pass through good Report and evil Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, neither regard I which I meet with, <hi>a Truth I am sure at last will vindicate it self,</hi> and be found by my Country-men.</p>
            <p>Yet before I conclude this <hi>Preface,</hi> I must needs take notice of one thing to be wondred at, <hi>viz.</hi> That some had the Confidence publickly to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert before the <hi>Lords,</hi> when this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie was debated before their <hi>Lordships</hi>; that when Interest was at 10 <hi>per cen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> Land was sold at 20 years Purchase; a strange, presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and incredible Assertion against Records, against Experience, and against Reason; to which I doubt not but their <hi>Lordships</hi> will be able to give a full confutation out of their own Memorials, before this be made publick.</p>
            <p>And for the Reason of it, will any
<pb facs="tcp:51653:13"/>
Man believe that our Fathers were so stupid, as to lay out their Money in Land, not to see it again in twenty years, when at single Interest at ten <hi>per cent</hi> they might double their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in 10 years, at Interest upon In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in seven years?</p>
            <p>I have been told by a person of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great Honour, that this <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> himself in his private discourse, confesseth, that the Abatement of Interest will advance the value of Land; but he questions whether it will encrease Trade; certainly a needless scruple to any Man that shall deliberately consider the insepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable affinity that is in all Nations, and at all times between Land and Trade, which are Twins, and have always, and ever will wax and wane together, <hi>It cannot be ill with Trade, but Land will fall, nor ill with Lands, but Trade will feel it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in regard this <hi>Gentleman</hi> is so miserably mistaken in the Trades
<pb facs="tcp:51653:13"/>
of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> which he reckons as lost; I think it may be useful to inform him, and others bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, what Trades are really lost, and enquire how we came to loose them? and what Trades we still retain, and why, and of both as briefly as I can? because I have said something of them in the following Treatise.</p>

A great part of the <hi>Plate-Trade from Cadiz</hi> is lost to the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who by reason of the lowness of their Interest, can afford to let their Stocks lie before-hand at <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Cadiz,</hi> against the arrival of the <hi>Spanish Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> who sometimes are expected 3, 6, 9, and 12 Months before they come, especially since the late inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions that our <hi>Iamaica Capers</hi> have given them; by which means they engross the greatest part of the Silver, whereas we, in regard our Stocks run at a higher Interest, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not so well afford to keep them so long dead. It is true, the <hi>English</hi> have yet a share in this Trade, by reason of some after recited natural advantages, <hi>viz.

<pb facs="tcp:51653:15"/>
but as true it is, that their lower In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest hath enabled them to make a much greater improvement and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in Trade by that Peace, then ever they could otherwise have done.</p>
               <p n="13">13. The Trade of <hi>Surranham,</hi> since the <hi>Dutch</hi> got possession of that Country in the late War, is so to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally lost to the <hi>English,</hi> that we have now no more Commerce with that Country, then we should have if it were sunk in the Sea; so severe and exact are the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Trades of their own Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions intirely to their own People</p>
               <p n="14">14.

besides, they bring with them a great access of Power (Hands as well as Money) <hi>many Ships and Sea-men being justly the reputed Strength and Safety of</hi> England.</p>

               <p>The Trades we yet retain are;</p>

               <p>Our Trades to and from our own <hi>Plantations,</hi> viz. <hi>Virginia, Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does, New-England, Iamaica,</hi> and the Leward Islands.</p>
               <p>If any shall here ask me, How it comes to pass that the <hi>Dutch</hi> low Interest hath not cashered u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of
<pb facs="tcp:51653:17"/>
these Trades, as well as the former? I shall answer, first generally, and then particularly.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Generally I say, the <hi>Dutch low Interest hath miserably lessend us in all Trades of the World, not se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured to us by Laws, or by some natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral advantage which over-ballanceth the disproportion of our Interest of Money,</hi> which disproportion I take to be 3 <hi>per cent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Particularly the <hi>Red-Herring Trade</hi> we retain, by reason of two natural Advantages, one is, the Fish for that purpose must be brought fresh on Shore, and that the <hi>Dutch</hi> cannot do with theirs, because the <hi>Herrings</hi> swim on our Coast, and consequently at too great a distance from theirs.</p>
               <p>The other is, those <hi>Herrings</hi> must be smoked with Wood, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be done on any reasonable terms, but in a woody Country, such as <hi>England</hi> is, and <hi>Holland</hi> is not.
<pb facs="tcp:51653:17"/>
These advantages that God hath given our Land do counterpoize, and overpoize the disproportion of Interest, <hi>viz.</hi> 3 <hi>per Cent,</hi> otherwise we might say, Farewel <hi>Red-Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi> as well as <hi>White.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Pilchards</hi> on the West-Coast likewise come to our Shores, and must be cured and pressed upon the Land, which is impossible for the <hi>Dutch</hi> to do.</p>
               <p>The <hi>New-found-land Fishing</hi> is managed by West-Country-men, whose Ports are properly scituated for that Country, <hi>and the Country it self is his Majesty's; so the</hi> Dutch <hi>can have no footing there, if they could,</hi> 3 per Cent <hi>would soon send us home to keep Sheep.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Turkey, Italian, Spanish</hi> and <hi>Portugal Trades,</hi> though our vent for fine Cloth, and some sorts of Stuffs be declined, yet we retain a very considerable part of those Trades, by reason of some Natural,
<pb facs="tcp:51653:18"/>
and some Artificial or Legal Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, which preponderates 3 <hi>per cent,</hi> such as these:</p>

               <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> Our <hi>Fewel</hi> and <hi>Victual</hi> is <hi>cheaper</hi> in remote parts from <hi>London,</hi> and consequently our Manufactu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers can and do work cheaper then the <hi>Dutch,</hi> whatever Mr <hi>Manley</hi> erroneously affirms.</p>
               <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> The <hi>Red-Herring, Pilchard, New-found-land</hi> and <hi>New-England Fishery,</hi> by which we carry on much of those Trades, are insepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly annexed to this Kingdom, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is demonstrated, and by the bounty of <hi>God</hi> Almighty, not by our own Wisdom or Industry.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb facs="tcp:51653:18"/>4<hi>thly,</hi> Our <hi>Lead</hi> and <hi>Tin</hi> by which we carry on much of those Trades, are Natives with us.</p>
               <p n="5">5<hi>thly,</hi> Our <hi>Country</hi> consumes within it self more of <hi>Spanish Wines and Fruit,</hi> Zant <hi>Currans and</hi> Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant <hi>Oyls,</hi> then any Country in <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6<hi>thly,</hi> Which is an artificial advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage (and due to the wisdom of the Contrivers) our <hi>Act of Navigation</hi> compels us, or at least would do, if it were justly administred, to import none of those Goods but from the proper Ports of their Imbarkation, and by <hi>English</hi> Shiping only.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Trades</hi> to and from all our own <hi>Plantations,</hi> are likewise secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to us by the <hi>Act of Navigation,</hi> or would be, if that Act were truly executed, and if it were not for that, you should see forty <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships at our own <hi>Plantations</hi> for one <hi>English.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude this paragraph, the
<pb facs="tcp:51653:19"/>
                  <hi>Dutch low Interest, through our own supineness, hath robbed us totally of all Trade, not inseperably annexed to this Kingdom by the benevolence of divine Providence, and our Act of Navigation,</hi> which, though it have some things in it wanting amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, deserves to be called our <hi>(Charta Maritima)</hi> insomuch as with shame to our selves, it may be truly said of us, as we Proverbially say to careless Persons, <hi>They have lost all that is loose.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When I think of these things, I cannot but wonder that there should be found <hi>English men</hi> who want not Bread to eat, or Clothes to wear, should be yet so unkind and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted to their Country, as stre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuously to endeavour (for private Ends) the depriving her of so great a good, as would be the abatement of our Interest to 4 <hi>per Cent,</hi> by a Law. I have lately seen a Treatise writ about thirty Years since, by
<pb facs="tcp:51653:19"/>
                  <hi>Lewis Roberts, Merchant,</hi> wherein he highly exaggerates (and with great Reason) the wonderful ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage the <hi>Dutch</hi> have by the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their <hi>Customs,</hi> but seeing an exact imitation in that respect is not consistant with our Affairs at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, though much to be desired in due time. I insist not thereupon, but think it necessary by the way, to make this true Animadversion, <hi>viz.</hi> That 2 <hi>per Cent. extraordinary in Interest is worse then</hi> 4 per Cent. <hi>extraordinary in Customs,</hi> because <hi>Customs</hi> run only upon our Goods imported or exported, and that but once for all; whereas Interest runs as well upon our Ships, as Goods, and must be yearly paid on both so long as they are in being, and the Ships in many bulkey Trades, and such as are Nationally most profitable, are of four times the value of the Goods.</p>
               <p>That old Objection about <hi>Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:51653:20"/>
and <hi>Orphans,</hi> I have I think fully answered in my former Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, but because I yet sometimes meet with it, I shall say a Word more to it here, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Widows and Orphans are not one to twenty of the whole People; and its the Wisdom of Law-makers to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the good of the Majority of People, though a Minor part should a little suffer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Of <hi>Widows and Orphans, not one in forty will suffer by the abatement of Interest</hi> for these Reasons, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1<hi>st,</hi> Of <hi>Widows</hi> and <hi>Orphans</hi> nine of ten in this Kingdom have very little or nothing at all left them by their deceased Relations, and all such will have an advantage by the abatement of Interest, because such abatement will encrease Trade, and in consequence occasion more em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment for such necessitous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>
               <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> Many <hi>Widows and Orphans</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:51653:20"/>
have <hi>Ioyntures, Annuities, Coppy-Holds, and other Lands</hi> left them, as well as Money; and all such will be gainers by the abatement of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest.</p>
               <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> For all <hi>London Orphans</hi> the City gives not now above 5, and to some 4 <hi>per cent.</hi> Interest, so the loss to such is not worth speaking of.</p>
               <p n="4">4<hi>thly,</hi> Many <hi>Executors</hi> are so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy as to allow <hi>Orphans</hi> no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, and yet justifie themselves by Law; to such Orphans it will be all one what the legal rate of Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest be.</p>
               <p n="5">5<hi>thly,</hi> When the Law for abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Interest is past, many more Parents will leave their Children Annuities and Estates running in Trade, as they do in <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> whereby the abatement of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest will become profitable, not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to them.</p>
               <p>And for the few that at first may
<pb facs="tcp:51653:21"/>
happen to suffer, whereof the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber will be very small (and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not to be named in competition with the common good of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom) they have an easie means within their own Power, to prevent their being one Farthing the worse for the abatement of Interest; it is but wearing a Lawn-Whisk instead of a <hi>Point de Venice</hi>; and for the meaner sort a Searge Petty-Coat, instead of a Silk one, and a plain pair of Shoes instead of laced ones. And that the Ladies may not be offended with me, I dare undertake that this will never spoil, but mend their Marriages; besides the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter good it will bring to their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and to their Posterities after them, whether they prove to be Noblemen, Gentlemen or Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have in several places of my ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Treatise, referred to some Tracts I formerly published upon this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
<pb facs="tcp:51653:21"/>
which being now wholly out of Print, I thought fit to Re-print and annex unto this, which at first I intended not.</p>
               <p>Some there are who would grant that <hi>abatement of Interest,</hi> if it could be effected, would procure to the Nation all the good that I alledge it will bring with it, but say it is <hi>not practicable, or at least not now.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. A needless scruple, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory to experience, for first, <hi>a Law hath abated Interest in</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>three times within these few Years already; and what should hinder its effect now more then formerly</hi>?</p>
               <p n="2">2. If a Law will not do it, why do the <hi>Vsurers</hi> raise such a dust, and engage so many Friends to oppose the passing of an Act to this purpose?</p>
               <p>The true reason is, because they are wise enough to know that a Law will certainly do it, as it hath done already, though they would perswade others the contrary. And
<pb facs="tcp:51653:22"/>
if it be doubted we have not Money enough in <hi>England.</hi> Besides what I have said in my former Treatise as to the encrease of our Riches in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, I shall here give some further Reasons of probability, which are the best that can be expected in this case, to prove that <hi>we have now much more Money in</hi> England <hi>then we had twenty Years past.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Notwithstanding the seeming scarcity at present, if I should look further back then twenty years, the argument would be stronger on my side, and the proportion of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of Money greater, and more perspicuous; but I shall confine my self to that time which is within most mens Memories.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We give generally now one third more Money with Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices then we did twenty years past.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Notwithstanding the decay and loss of sundry Trades and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures, yet in the gross we Ship off now one third part more of the
<pb facs="tcp:51653:22"/>
Manufactures, as also Lead and Tin, then we did twenty years past, which is a cause, as well as a proof of our increase of Money.</p>
               <p>If any doubt this, if they please to consult Mr <hi>Dickins,</hi> Surveyor of his Majesties <hi>Customs,</hi> who is the best able I know living, and hath taken the most pains in these Calculations, he may be satisfactorily resolved.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Houses new built in <hi>London</hi> yield twice the Rent they did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Fire; and Houses generally immediately before the Fire yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about one fourth part more Rent then they did twenty years past.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The speedy and costly build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of <hi>London</hi> is a convincing (and to Strangers an amazing) Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the plenty, and late encrease of Money in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. We have now more then double the quantity of <hi>Merchants Shiping</hi> we had twenty years past.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The course of our Trade from the increase of our Money is strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:51653:23"/>
altered within these twenty years, most Payments from <hi>Merchants</hi> and <hi>Shop-keepers</hi> being now made with ready Money, whereas formerly the course of our general Trade run at three, six, nine, twelve and eighteen Months time.</p>
               <p>But if this case be so clear, some may ask me, <hi>How comes it to pass that all sorts of men complain so much of the scarcity of Money, especially in the Country</hi>?</p>
               <p>My answers to this Query are, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. This proceeds from the Frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Corruption of humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it being natural for men to complain of the present, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the times past; so said they of Old, <hi>The former days were better then these</hi>; and I can say in truth, upon my own Memory, that men did complain as much of the scarcity of Money, ever since I knew the world as they do now; nay, the very same Persons that now complain of this, and commend that time.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb facs="tcp:51653:23"/>2. And more particularly, <hi>This complaint proceeds from many mens finding themselves uneasie in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of their Religion,</hi> it being na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural for men, when they are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented at one thing, to complain of all, and principally to utter their discontents and complaints in those things which are most popular. Those that hate a man for some one cause, will seldom allow of any thing that is good in him; and some that are angry with one person, or thing, will find fault with others that gave them no offence; like peevish Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that meeting discontent abroad, coming home, quarrel with their Wifes, Children, Servants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. And more especially this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint in the Country, proceeds from the late practice of bringing up the Tax-Money in Wagons to <hi>London,</hi> which did doubtless cause a scarcity of Money in the Country.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And principally <hi>this seeming
<pb facs="tcp:51653:24"/>
scarcity of Money proceeds from the Trade of Bankering,</hi> which obstructs circulation, advanceth Usury, and renders it so easie, that most Men as soon as they can make up a Sum of 50 <hi>l.</hi> or a 100 <hi>l.</hi> send it into the Gold-Smith; <hi>Which doth, and will occasion while it lasts, that fatal pressing necessity for Money, so visible through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Kingdom, both to Prince and People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From what hath been last said, it appears the matter in <hi>England</hi> is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the abatement of Interest which as Sr <hi>Henry Blunt,</hi> (an hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourable <hi>Member</hi> of his Majesties Council of Trade) well said before the Lords at the debate, is the <hi>Unum Magnum</hi> towards the pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of this Kingdom: It is a generative good, and will bring ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other good things with it.</p>
               <p>I shall conclude with two or three Requests to the <hi>Reader.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That he would Read, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
<pb facs="tcp:51653:24"/>
what he Reads, with an entire Love to his Country, void of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate interests, and former ill ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed impressions received into his mind, to the prejudice of this princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That he would Read all (mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the matter, not the stile) before he make a judgment.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That in all his meditations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on these Principles, he would wari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly distinguish between the Profit of the <hi>Merchant</hi> and the Gain of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> which are so far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing always parallels, that frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they run counter one to the other, although most Men by their Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Business, having fixed their eye and aim wholly upon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, do usually confound these two in their Thoughts and Discourses of Trade, or else mistake the former for the latter; from which false mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures have proceeded, many vulgar errors in Trade, some whereof by
<pb facs="tcp:51653:25"/>
reason of Mens frequent mistakings, as afore-said, are become almost Proverbial, and often heard out of the Mouths, not only of the common People, but of Men that might know better, if they would duly consider the afore-said distinction.</p>
               <p>Some of the said common Prover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bial errors are, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Vulgar Error; <hi>We have too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> Merchants <hi>already.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Stock of</hi> England <hi>is too big for the Trade of</hi> England.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>No Man should exercise two Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Especially no</hi> Shop-keeper <hi>ought to be a</hi> Merchant.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Luxury and some Excess may be profitable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>We have people enough, and more then we can employ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>To suffer Artificers to have as many Apprentices as they will, is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy Trade.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>The admission of Strangers is to
<pb facs="tcp:51653:25"/>
call in others to eat the Bread out of our own Mouthes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>No man ought to Live and Trade in a Corporation, that is not a Free-man of the place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. <hi>Nor should any be Free-men, that are not the sons of Free-men, or have served seven years Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiship.</hi>

               <p>By what hath been said, and what follows, as well as by what most Men observe; <hi>It is evident that this Kingdom is wonderfully <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Neither are the <hi>Dutch</hi> the only Neighbours we have at this time for corrivals in Trade, but the <hi>French King and King of Sweeden</hi> are now as active, circumspect, industrious and prospective too in this Affair; and have, and are ordering things as pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently for promoting thereof, as the <hi>Dutch</hi> themselves.</p>
               <p>When I began to Write this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, I intended not to enlarge upon so many particulars, and the rather because nothing can be said for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick good, but will cross the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ends, as well as the opinions of
<pb facs="tcp:51653:27"/>
many private persons, and still the more is said, the more are disobliged, but my Duty to my Country over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming those doubtful Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I have adventured this second time to expose my Conceptions to publick censure, with this confidence, that after these Principles have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the accustomary Persecution of Tongues and Pens, naturally and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly accompanying all new Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posals for a while, they will at length the most, if not all of them, or some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing very like them, come to be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally received and honoured with the publick Sanction, by being pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed into Laws (gradually not at once) concerning the time whereof I am not careful, but for my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries sake, <hi>I could wish it might be shortened.</hi>

            <head>A DISCOURSE Concerning Trade, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE Prodigious increase of the <hi>Netherlanders</hi> in their Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick and Foreign Trade, Riches, and multitude of Shipping, is the Envy of the present, and may be the wonder of all future Generations: And yet the means whereby they have thus advanced themselves, are sufficiently obvious, and in a great measure imitable by most other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but more easily by us of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>England,</hi> which I shall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to demonstrate in the following Discourse.</p>
            <p>Some of the said means by which
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51653:29"/>
they have advanced their Trade, and thereby improved their Estates are these following.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> They have in their greatest <hi>Councils of State and War,</hi> Trading-Merchants that have lived abroad in most parts of the World; who have not only the Theoretical Knowledge, but the practical Experience of Trade, by whom Laws and Orders are contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and Peaces with foreign Princes projected, to the great Advantage of their Trade.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Their Law of <hi>Gavel-kind,</hi> whereby all their Children possess an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual share of their Fathers Estates after their decease, and so are not left to wrastle with the World in their youth, with inconsiderable assistance of Fortune, as most of our youngest Sons of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen in <hi>England</hi> are, who are bound Apprentices to Merchants.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Their exact making of all their Native Commodities, and pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their <hi>Herrings, Codfish,</hi> and all other Commodities, which they send a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in great quantities; the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence whereof is, That the repute of their said Commodities abroad, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51653:29"/>
always good, and the Buyers will accept of them by the Marks, without opening; whereas the Fish which our <hi>English</hi> make in <hi>New-found-Land</hi> and <hi>New-England,</hi> and <hi>Herrings</hi> at <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> often prove false and deceitfully made; and our <hi>Pilchards</hi> from the <hi>West-Country</hi> false packed, seldom containing the quantity for which the Hogsheads are marked in which they are packed.</p>
            <p>And in <hi>England</hi> the attempts which our Fore-fathers made for Regulating of Manufactures, when left to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of some particular person, in a short time resolved but into a Tax up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Commodity, without respect to the goodness thereof; as most notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously appears in the business of the AULNAGE, which doubtless our Predecessors intended for a scrutiny in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the goodness of the Commodity; and to that purpose a Seal was invented, as a signal that the Commodity was made according to the <hi>Statutes,</hi> which <hi>Seals</hi> it is said, may now be bought by Thousands, and put upon what the Buyers please.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Their giving great incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement and immunities to the Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51653:30"/>
of New-Manufactures, and the Discoverers of any New Mysteries in Trade, and to those that shall bring the Commodities of other Nations first in use and practice amongst them; for which the Author never goes without his due Reward allowed him at the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Charge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Their Contriving and Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of great Ships to sail with small charge, not above one third of what we are at, for Ships of the same Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then in <hi>England</hi>; and compelling their said Ships (being of small Force) to sail always in Fleets, to which in all time of danger they allow <hi>Convoy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Their parcimonious and thrif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y Living, which is so extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that a Merchant of One hundred thousand Pound Estate with them, will scarce spend so much <hi>per annum,</hi> as one of Fifteen hundred Pounds Estate in <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> The Education of their Children, as well Daughters as Sons; all which, be they of never so great Quality or Estate, they always take care to bring up to write perfect good
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51653:30"/>
Hands, and to have the full knowledge and use of <hi>Arithemetick</hi> and <hi>Merchants-Accounts</hi>; the well understanding and practice whereof, doth strangely infuse into most that are the owners of that Quality, of either Sex, not only an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility for Commerce of all kinds, but a strong aptitude, love and delight in it; and in regard the Women are as knowing therein as the Men, it doth incourage their Husbands to hold on in their Trades to their dying days, knowing the capacity of their Wives to get in their Estates, and carry on their Trades after their Deaths: Whereas if a Merchant in <hi>England</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at any considerable Estate, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly with-draws his Estate from Trade, before he comes near the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of old Age; reckoning that if God should call him out of the World, while the main of his Estate is engaged abroad in Trade, he must lose one third of it, through the unexperience and unaptness of his Wife to such Affairs, and so it usually falls out.</p>
            <p>Besides, it hath been observed in the nature of <hi>Arithmetick,</hi> that like other parts of the <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> it doth not
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51653:31"/>
only improve the <hi>Rational Faculties,</hi> but inclines those that are expert in it to Thriftiness and good-Husbandry, and prevents both Husbands and Wives in some measure from running out of their Estates, when they have it always rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in their Heads what their Expences do amount to, and how soon by that course their Ruin must overtake them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eightly,</hi> The lowness of their <hi>Customs,</hi> and the height of their <hi>Excise,</hi> which is certainly the most equal and indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent <hi>Tax</hi> in the World, and least pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judical to any people, as might be made appear, were it the subject of this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ninthly,</hi> The careful providing for, and employment of their Poor, which it is easie to demonstrate can never be done in <hi>England</hi> comparatively to what it is with them, while it's left to the care of every Parish to look after their own only.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tenthly,</hi> Their use of BANKS, which are of so immence advantage to them, that some not without good grounds have estimated the Profit of them to the Publick, to amount to at
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51653:31"/>
least one Million of Pounds <hi>sterling per annum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eleventhly,</hi> Their <hi>Toleration of diffe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ent Opinions in matters of Religion</hi>: by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son whereof many <hi>industrious People</hi> of other Countries, <hi>that dissent from the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished Government of their own Churches, resort to them with thetr Families and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states, and after a few years co-habitation with them; become of the same Common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Twelfthly,</hi> Their <hi>Law-Merchant,</hi> By which all Controversies between <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants</hi> and <hi>Tradesmen</hi> are decided in three or four days time, and that not at the fortieth part <hi>(I might say in many cases not the hundredth part)</hi> of the charge they are with us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirteenthly,</hi> The Law that is in use among them for <hi>Transferrence of Bills for D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>bt</hi> from one Man to another: This is of extraordinary advantage to them in their Commerce; by means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, they can turn their Stocks twice or thrice in Trade, for once that we can in <hi>England</hi>; for that having sold our Foreign Goods here, we cannot buy again to advantage, till we are possest of our Money; which it may
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:51653:32"/>
be we shall be six, nine, or twelve Months in recovering: And if what we sell be considerable, it is a good Man's work all the Year to be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Vintners and Shop-keepers for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. Whereas, were the Law for Transferring Bills in practice with us, we could presently after sale of our Goods, dispose of our Bills, and close up our Accounts. To do which, the Advantage, ease, and Accommodations it would be to Trade, is so great, that none but <hi>Merchants</hi> that have lived where that custom is in use, can value to its due proportion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourteenthly,</hi> Their keeping up PUB<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LICK REGISTERS of all Lands and Houses, Sold or Mortgaged, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by many chargable <hi>Law-Suits</hi> are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, and the securities of Lands and Houses rendred indeed, such as we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly call them, REAL SECU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RITIES.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> The <hi>lowness of Interest of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney with them,</hi> which in peaceable times exceeds not three <hi>per cent per annum</hi>; and is now during this War with <hi>England,</hi> not above four <hi>per cent</hi> at most.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:51653:32"/>Some more Particulars might be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and those aforesaid further im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, were it my purpose to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course at large of Trade. But seeing most of the former Particulars are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served and granted by all men that make it any part of their business, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect the true <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>Principles of Trade</hi>; but the last is not so much as taken notice of by the most Ingenious, to be any Cause of the great encrease of the Riches and Commerce of that people.</p>
            <p>I shall therefore in this Paper confine my self to write principally my Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations touching that, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Profit <hi>That People</hi> have received, and any other may receive, by reducing the Interest of Money to a very low rate.</p>
            <p>This in my poor opinion, is the <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa Causans</hi> of all the other causes of the Riches of that People; and that if Interest of Money were with us reduced to the same rate it is with them, it would in a short time render us as rich and considerable in Trade as they now are, and consequently be of greater damage to them, and advantage to us, then can happen by the Issue of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51653:33"/>
War, though the success of it should be as good as we can wish, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it end in the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r total Ruin and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation.</p>
            <p>To illustrate this, let us Impartial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly search our Books, and enquire what the state and condition of this Kingdom was, as to Trade and Riches, before any Law concerning Interest of Money was made: The first whereof that I can find, was <hi>Anno</hi> 1545. and we shall be informed that the Trade of <hi>England</hi> then was Inconsiderable, and the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants very mean and few: And that afterwards, <hi>viz. Anno</hi> 1635. within ten Years after Interest was brought down to eight <hi>per Cent,</hi> there was more Merchants to be found upon the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change</hi> worth each One Thousand Pounds and upwards, then were in the former dayes, <hi>viz.</hi> before the Year 1600. to be found worth One Hundred Pounds each.</p>
            <p>And now since Interest hath been for about twenty Years at six <hi>per Cent,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding our long civil Wars, and the great complaints of the deadness of Trade, there are more men to be found upon the <hi>Exchange</hi> now worth Ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51653:33"/>
Pounds Estates, then were then of One thousand Pounds.</p>
            <p>And if this be doubted, let us ask the aged, whether five hundred pounds Portion with a Daughter sixty Years ago, were not esteemed a larger pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion then Two thousand pounds is now: And whether Gentlewomen in those dayes would not esteem themselves well cloathed in a Searge Gown, which a Chamber-Maid now will be ashamed to be se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n in: Whether our Citizens and middle sort of Gentry now are not more rich in Cloaths, Plate, Jewels, and Houshold-Goods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then the best sort of Knights and Gentry were in those days. And whether our best sort of Knights and Gentry now do not exceed by much in those things the Nobility of <hi>England</hi> sixty Years past: Many of whom then would not go to the price of a whole Sattin-Doublet; the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broiderer</hi> being yet living, who hath as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured me he hath made many hundreds of them for the Nobility with Canvas backs</p>
            <p>Which way ever we take our mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, to me it seems evident, that since our first abatement of Interest, the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51653:34"/>
Riches and Splendor of this Kingdom is increased to above four (I might say above six) times so much as it was.</p>
            <p>We have now almost One hundred Coaches for one we had formerly. We with ease can pay a greater <hi>Tax</hi> now in one Year, then our Fore fathers could in twenty.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Customs</hi> are very much improved, I believe above the proportion afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, of six to one, which is not so much in advance of the Rates of Goods, as by encrease of the bulk of Trade; for though some Foreign Commodities are advanced, others of our Native Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities and Manufactures are conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably abated, by the last Book of Rates.</p>
            <p>I can my self remember since there were not in <hi>London</hi> used so many Wharfs or Keys for the Landing of Merchants Goods, by at least one third part as now there are; and those that were then, could scarce have Imployment for half what they could do; and now notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one third more used to the same purpose, they are all too little in a time of Peace, to land the Goods at, that come to <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we look into the Country, we shall
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51653:34"/>
find <hi>Lands</hi> as much Improved since the abatement of Interest, as Trade, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in Cities; that now yielding twenty Years purchase, which then would not have sold for above eight or ten at most</p>
            <p>Besides, the Rent of Farms have been for these last thirty Years much advanced; and although they have for these th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ee or four last years fallen, that hath no respect at all to the lowness of Interest at present, nor to the other mistaken Reasons which are commonly assigned for it.</p>
            <p>But principally to the vast Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

               </gap>d by the Industrous <hi>English,</hi> who were Soldiers in the late <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>More might be said, but the Premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses being considered, I judge will suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently demonstrate how greatly this Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> hath been advanc'd in all respects for these last fifty Years: And that the abatement of Interest hath been the cause thereof, to me seems most probable; because as it appears, it hath been in <hi>England,</hi> so I find it is at this day in all <hi>Europe,</hi> and other parts of the World: Insomuch that to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51653:35"/>
any Country be rich or poor, or in what proportion it is so, no other Question n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eds to be resolved, but this, <hi>viz. What Interest do they pay for Money?</hi> Near home we see it evidently, in <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> where ten and twelve <hi>per Cent</hi> is paid for Interest, the People are poor and despicable, their Persons ill cloathed, their Houses worse provided, and Money intollerably scarce, notw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>thstanding they have great plenty of all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rovisions, nor will their Land yield above eight or ten Years purchase at most.</p>
            <p>In <hi>France</hi> where Money is at seven <hi>per Cent,</hi> their Lands will yield about eighteen Years purchase; and the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try who may possess Lands, live in good condition, though the <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>easants</hi> are little better then Slaves, because they can possess nothing but at the will of others.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Italy</hi> Money will not yield above three <hi>per Cent,</hi> to be let out upon real Security, there the People are rich, full of Trade, well attired, and their Lands will sell at thirty five to forty Years purchase; and that it is so, or better with them in <hi>Holland,</hi> is too manifest.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Spain</hi> the usual Interest is ten and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:51653:35"/>
twelve <hi>per Cent,</hi> and there, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing they have the only Trade in the World for Gold and Silver, Money is no where more scarce; the people poor, despicable, and void of Commerce, other then such as <hi>English, Dutch, Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians, Iews,</hi> and other Foreigners bring to them; who are to them in effect, but as Leeches, who suck their Blood and vital Spirits from them.</p>
            <p>I might urge many other Inst<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nces of this nature, not only out of <hi>Christendom,</hi> but from under the <hi>Turks</hi> Dominions, <hi>East-Ind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now if upon what hath been said, it be granted that <hi>defacto,</hi> this Kingdom be richer at least four-fold, (I might say eight-fold) then it was before any Law for Interest was made, and that <hi>all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries

            <p>To satisfie my self wherein, I have taken all opportunities to discourse this point, with the most ingenious men I had the Honour to be known to, and have searcht for, and read all the Books that I could ever hear were printed against the Abatement of Interest, and seriously considered all the Arguments and Objections used by them against it: All which have tended to confirm me in this opinion, which I bumbly offer to the consideration of wiser Heads, <hi>viz. That the Abatement of Interest is the Cause of the Prosperity &amp; Riches of any Nation, and that the bringing down of Inte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>To this I answer, That i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t</hi> of it upon Interest at home. But if they should call home all the Money they have with us at Interest, it would be better for us than if they did it not; for <hi>the Borrower is alwayes a slave to the Lender,</hi> and shall be sure to be always kept poor, while the other is fat and full: HE THAT USETH A STOCK THAT IS NONE OF HIS OWN, BEING FORCED FOR THE UPHOLDING HIS REPUTATION TO LIVE TO THE FULL, IF NOT ABOVE THE PROPORTION OF WHAT HE DOTH SO USE, WHILE THE LEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DER POSSESING MUCH, AND

USING LITTLE OR NONE, LIVE ONLY AT THE CHARGE OF WHAT HE USETH, AND NOT OF WHAT HE HATH</p>
            <p>Besides, if with this Law for abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Interest, a Law for <hi>Transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Bills of Debt</hi> should pass, we should not miss the <hi>Dutch</hi> Money, were it ten times as much as it is amongst us; for that such a Law will certainly supply the the defect of at least one half of all the ready Money we have in use in the Nation.</p>

               </gap>e of such a Law for abatement of Interest, grow generally dear, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t is an evident demonstration that our People grow richer; for generally, <hi>where-ever Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions are for continuance of Years dear in any Country, the People are rich; and where they are most cheap throughout the World, for the most part the People are very poor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:51653:37"/>And for our own Poor in <hi>England,</hi> it is observed, <hi>That they live better in the dearest Countries for Provisions, than in the cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, and better in a dear year than in a cheap,</hi> (especially in relation to the publick good) for that in a cheap Year they will not work above two dayes in a Week; their humour being such, that they will not provide for a hard time; but just work so much and no more, as may maintain them in that mean condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to which they have been accustomed.</p>
            <p>Object. 3 <hi>If Interest be abated, Vsurers will call in their Money; so what shall Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men do, whose Estates are Mortgaged?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I answer, That when they know they can make no more of their Money by taking out of one, and putting it in another hand, they will not be so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward as they th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eaten, to alter that Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity they know is good, for another that may be bad: Or if they should do it, our Laws are not so severe, but that Gentlemen may take time to dispose of part of their Land, which immediately after such a Law will yield them thirty years purchase at least, and much better it is for them so to do, than to abide
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:51653:38"/>
longer under that consuming Plague of Usury, which hath insensibly destroyed very many of the best Families in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as well of our Nobility as Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
            <p>Object. 4. <hi>As Interest is now at six</hi> per cent, <hi>the Kings Majesty upon any emergency can hardly be supplied; and if it should be reduced to four</hi> per cent, <hi>how shall the King find a considerable sum of Money to be lent him by his People</hi>?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I answer, The abatement of Interest to the People, is the abatement of Interest to the King, when he hath occasion to take up Money: For what is borrowed of the <hi>City of London,</hi> or other <hi>Bodies Politick,</hi> nothing can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded but the legal Interest; and if the King have occasion to take up Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney of private Persons, being his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, according to good right, is above the common course of Law, the King must, and always hath given more then the legal Rate. As for instance: The legal Rate is now six <hi>per cent,</hi> but his Majesty, or such as have disposed of his Majesties <hi>Exchequer-Tallies,</hi> have been said to give ten and twelve in some cases;
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:51653:38"/>
and if the legal Rate were ten, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty might probably give thirteen or fourteen: So if Interest be brought to four <hi>per cent,</hi> his Majesty in such cases as he now gives ten, must give six or seven; by which his Majesty would have a clear advantage.</p>
            <p>Object. 5. <hi>If Interest be abated, it will be a great prejudice to Widows and Orphans, who have not Knowledge and Abilities to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove their Estates otherwise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I answer, That by our Law now, <hi>Heirs</hi> and <hi>Orphans</hi> can recover no Interest from their Parents <hi>Executors,</hi> except it be left fully and absolutely to the Executors to dispose and put out Money at the discretion of the <hi>Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,</hi> for the profit and loss of the <hi>Heirs</hi> and <hi>Orphans</hi>: And if it be so left to the <hi>Exccutors</hi> discretion, they may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the Monies left them in Trade, or purchase of Lands and Leases, as well as by interest: Or when not, the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage such <hi>Heirs</hi> and <hi>Orphans</hi> will sustain in their minority, (being but two <hi>per cent</hi>) is inconsiderable, in respect of the great advantage will accrew to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in generel, by such abatement of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nterest.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:51653:39"/>Besides, when such a Law is made and in use, all Men will so take care in their Life to provide for, and educate their <hi>Children,</hi> and instruct their <hi>Wives,</hi> as that no prejudice can happen thereby; as we see there doth not in <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> and other places where Interest is so low.</p>
            <p>Having now offered my thoughts in answer to the aforesaid Objections, it will not be amiss, that we enquire who will be advantaged, and who will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive prejudice, in case such a Law be made.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> His Majesty, as hath been said in answer to that Objection, will, when he hath occasion, take up Money on better terms: Besides which, He will receive a great Augmentation to his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue</hi> thereby, all his <hi>Lands</hi> being imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately worth, after the making such a Law, double to what they were before; his <hi>Customs</hi> will be much increas'd by the increase of Trade, which must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily insue upon the making such a Law.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gentry,</hi> whose Estates lie mostly in Land, may presently upon
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51653:39"/>
all they have, <hi>instead of Fifty, write one Hundred.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Merchants</hi> and <hi>Tradesmen, who bear the Heat and Burthen of the Day,</hi> (most of our Trade being carried on by young Men that take up Money at In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest) will find their <hi>Yoak</hi> sit lighter upon their <hi>Shouldiers,</hi> and be incouraged to go on with greater alacrity in their Business.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Marriners, Shipwrights, Porters, Cloathiers, Packers,</hi> and all sorts of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring People</hi> that depend on Trade, will be more constantly and fully employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Farmers</hi> sell the product of their Lands at better rates. And whereas our Neighbours the <hi>Netherlanders</hi> (who in regard of the largeness of their Stocks, and Experiences, the Sons continually succeeding the Fathers in Trade to many Generations, we may not unfitly in this case term <hi>Sons of Anach, and Men of renown</hi>) against whom we sight <hi>Dwarfs</hi> and <hi>Pigmies</hi> in <hi>Stocks and Experience,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>younger Brothers of Gentlemen</hi> that sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom have above one Thousand <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ounds, sometimes not two Hundred to begin the World with: Instead I say of such
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:51653:40"/>
young Men and small Stocks (if this Law pass) we shall bring forth out <hi>Sampsons</hi> and <hi>Goliahs</hi> in Stocks, subtilty, and experience in Trade to coap with our potent Adversaries on the other side; there being to every Mans knowledge that understands the <hi>Exchange of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> divers <hi>English Merchants</hi> of large Estates, which have not much past their middle-Age, and yet have wholly left off their Trades, having found the sweetness of Interest, which if that should abate, must again <hi>set their Hands to the Plough,</hi> (which they are as able to hold and govern now as ever) and also will engage them to train up their Sons in the same way, because it will not be so easie to make them <hi>Country-Gentlemen</hi> as now it is, when Lands sell at thirty or fourty years Purchase.</p>
            <p>For the Sufferers by such a Law, I know none but idle Persons that lives at as little Expence as Labour, <hi>Neither scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering by their Expences, so as the Poor may Glean any thing after them, nor Working with their Hands or Heads to bring either Wax or Honey to the common Hive of the Kingdom; but swelling their own Purses by the sweat of other Mens Brows, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:51653:40"/>
of other Mens Brains: And how unprofitable it is for any Nation, to suffer Idleness to suck the Breasts of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry</hi>; needs no Demonstration. And if it be granted me, that these will be the effects of an Abatement of Interest, then I think it is out of doubt, <hi>that the Abatement of Interest doth tend to the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching of a Nation, and consequently, hath been one great cause of the Riches of the</hi> Dutch <hi>and</hi> Italians, <hi>and the encrease of the Riches of our own Kingdom in these last fifty years.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another Argument to prove which, we may draw from the nature of <hi>Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest</hi> it self, which is of so prodigious a Multiplying nature, that it must of necessity make the Lenders monstrous Rich, (if they live at any moderate Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence) and the Borrowers extream Poor: A memorial instance whereof, we have in <hi>Old Audley</hi> deceased, who did wisely observe, <hi>That one Hundred Pounds only, put out at Interest at ten</hi> per cent, <hi>doth in seventy years (which is but the Age of a Man) increase to above one Hundred Thousand Pounds:</hi> And if the Advantage be so great to the Lender, the Loss must be greater to the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51653:41"/>
who (as hath been said) lives at a much larger Expence. And as it is between private Persons, so between Nation and Nation, that have Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication one with another. For whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Subjects of one Nation lend Money to Subjects of another, or Trade with them for Goods, the effect is the same. As for example, A <hi>Dutch Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant</hi> that hath but four or five Thousand Pounds clear Stock of his own, can easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly borrow and have credit for fifteen Thousand Pounds more at three <hi>per cent</hi> at Home; with which, whether he Trade or put it to Use in <hi>England,</hi> or any Country where Interest of Money is high, he must necessarily (without very evil Accidents attend him) in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few years, treble his own Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal.</p>
            <p>This discovers the true cause, why the <hi>Sugar-Bakers</hi> of <hi>Holland</hi> can afford to give a greater price for <hi>Barbadoes Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> besides the second Freight and Charges upon them between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> and yet grow exceeding Rich upon their Trade: Whereas our <hi>Sugar-Bakers</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> that buy Sugars here at their own Doors, before
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:51653:41"/>
such additional Freight and Charges come upon them, can scarce live upon their Callings, ours here paying for a good share of their Stocks six <hi>per cent,</hi> and few of them employ in their Sugar-works, above six to ten Thousand Pounds at most: Whereas in <hi>Holland</hi> they employ twenty, thirty, to fourty Thousand Pounds Stock in a <hi>Sugar-House,</hi> paying but three <hi>per cent</hi> at most for what they take up at Interest, to fill up their said Stocks, which is sometimes half, sometimes three quarters of their whole Stocks. And as it is with this Trade, the same Rules holds throughout all other Trades whatsoever. And for us to say, if the <hi>Dutch</hi> put their Money to Interest among us, we shall have the advantage by being full and flush of Coin at Home; it is a mear <hi>Chymera,</hi> and so far from an Advantage, that it is an extream Loss, rendring us only in the condition of a young Gallant, that hath newly Mortgaged his Land, and with the Money thereby raised, stuffes his Pockets, and looks big for a time, not considering that the draught of Cordial he hath received, though it be at present grateful to his Pallat, doth
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:51653:42"/>
indeed prey upon his vital Spirits; and will in a short time render the whole body of his Estate in a deep Consumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if not wholly consumed: Besides, whatever Money the <hi>Dutch</hi> lends us, they always keep one end of the Chain at home in their own Hands; by which they can pull back when they please their <hi>Lean Kine</hi> which they send hither to be fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>This makes me conclude that <hi>Moses</hi> (that Wise Legislator) in his forbidding the <hi>Iews</hi> to lend Money at use one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and permitting them to lend their Money to <hi>Strangers,</hi> ordained that Law as much to a <hi>Political</hi> as a <hi>Religious intent</hi>; knowing that by the latter they should Enrich their own Nation, and by the former no publick Goods could insue; the consequence being only to Impove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish one <hi>Iew</hi> to make another Rich.</p>
            <p>This likewise takes off the wonder how the People of <hi>Israel,</hi> out of so small a Territory as they possessed, could up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all occasions set forth such vast and numerous Armies (almost incredible) as all Histories, sacred and prophane, report they did; which is neither im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible nor strange to any that have well
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:51653:42"/>
considered the effects of their Laws con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crning <hi>Vsury,</hi> which were sufficient <hi>to make any barren Land fruitful, and a fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Land an entire Garden,</hi> which by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence would maintain ten times the number of Inhabitants that the same Tract of Land would do where no such Laws were.</p>
            <p>To conclude, it is, (I think) agreed on by all, That <hi>Merchants, Artificers, Farmers of Land,</hi> and such as depend on them, (which for brevity-sake we may here include under one of these general terms) <hi>viz. Sea-men, Fisher-men, Bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Cattel, Gardners,</hi> &amp;c. are the three sorts of People which by their Study and Labour do principally, if not only, bring in Wealth to a Nation from abroad; other kinds of People, <hi>viz. Nobility, Gentry, Lawyers, Physicians, Scholars</hi> of all sorts, and <hi>Shop-keepers,</hi> do only hand it from one to another at Home. And if abatement of Interest (besides the general Benefit it brings to all, except the <hi>Griping Dronish Vsurer</hi>) will add new Life and Motion to those most profitable Engine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:51653:43"/>
hath been said; then I think it will be out of doubt, that Abatement of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest is the Cause of increase of the Trade and Riches of any Kingdom.</p>

               <p>His Majesty was graciously pleased at the opening of the last Session of this <hi>Parliament,</hi> to propose to the Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of both Houses, the Ballancing of the Trade of the Nation; to effect which, in my opinion, the Abatement of Interest is the first and principal <hi>Engine</hi> which ought to be set on work, which notwithstanding, I should not have presumed to expose it to publick censure, on my own single Opinion, if I had not had the concurrance of much better Judgments then my own;
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:51653:44"/>
having never seen any thing in Print for it (though much against it) until the latter end of <hi>Ianuary</hi> last; at which time, a Friend whom I had often dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed with upon this subject, met with by accident a small Tract to the same purpose, Wrote near fifty years ago, which he gave me, and I have, for publick Good, thought fit to annex it hereunto, <hi>verbatim.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Author</hi> of the said Tract, by the stile thereof, seems to have been a <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Gentleman,</hi> and my Education hath mostly been that of a <hi>Merchant,</hi> so I hope that going together, they may in some measure, supply the defects of each other.</p>
               <p>Another Reason that induced me to to the Printing of them together, is, because what he Wrote then, would be the consequences of the Abatement of Interest from ten to six <hi>per cent.</hi> I have, I think, fully proved to the Conviction of all Men not wilfully blind, have been the real effects thereof, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>What I have aimed at in the whole, is the good of my Native Country, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise I had not busied my self about it, for I want not employment sufficient of my own, nor have reason to be out of love with that I have.</p>
               <p>The several Particulars in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this Treatise, relating to Trade, I have only hinted in general terms; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping that some abler Pen, will hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be incited for the service of his <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Country,</hi> to enlarge more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon them.</p>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I answer, that it may be true, that in <hi>Holland</hi> there hath not lately been any Law, to limit Usury to the present rate it is now at, <hi>i. e.</hi> three or four <hi>per cent</hi>; although most certain it is, that many years since, there was a Law that did limit it to five or six at most: And by consequence, there would be a renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that Law to a lesser rate, were it necessary at this time; <hi>It having always been the Policy of that People to keep down the Interest of their Money, three or four</hi> per cent, <hi>under the rate of what is usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paid in their Neighbouring Countries,</hi> which (being now naturally done) it is needless to use the <hi>Artificial Stratagem of a Law to Establish.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 2. Although they have no Law expresly, limitting Interest at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, yet they have other Laws which we cannot yet arrive to, which do effect the same thing among them, and would do the like among us, if we could have them: One whereof,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:51653:45"/>
is, their ascertaining REAL SE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CURITIES by their PUBLICK REGISTERS: For we see evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, Money is not so much want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>England</hi> as Securities, which Men account Infallible; a remarkable Instance whereof is, the <hi>East-India-Company,</hi> who can and do take up what Money they please, for four <hi>per cent</hi> at any time.</p>
               <p>Another Law is, Their constitution of BANKS and LUMBARDS, whereby private Persons that have but tollerable credit may be supplied at easie rates from the State.</p>
               <p>A third, and very considerable one, is, Their <hi>Law for Transferring Bills of Debt,</hi> mentioned in the beginning of this Discourse.</p>
               <p>A fourth, which is a Custom, and in effect may be here to our Purpose ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted as a Law, is the extraordinary Frugality used in all their <hi>Publick Affairs,</hi> which in their greatest Extreamities have been such, as not to compel them
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:51653:46"/>
to give above four <hi>per cent</hi> for the loan of Money. Whereas it is said, <hi>His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty in some Cases of exigency, when the National Supplies have not come in to answer the present Emergencies of Affairs, hath been inforced to give above the usual Rates to Gold-Smiths</hi>; and that encouraged them to take up great Sums from pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Persons at the full rate of six <hi>per cent,</hi> whereas formerly they usully gave but four <hi>per cent</hi> otherwise, in humane probability, Money would have fallen of it self to four <hi>per cent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But again, to conclude, <hi>Every Nation does proceed according to peculiar Methods of their own in the Transactions of their publick Affairs and Law-maki<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>g</hi>: And in this Kingdom it hath always been the Custom <hi>to reduce the Rate of Interest by a Law, when Nature had prepared the matter fit for such an alteration as now I say it hath.</hi> By a Law it was reduced from an unlimitted rate, to ten; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards from ten to eight; after that from eight to six. And through the Blessing of Almighty God, this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom hath found, as I think I have ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:51653:46"/>
proved, and every Mans Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will witness, prodigious success and advantage thereby. And I doubt not, through the like Blessing of God Almighty, but this Generation will find the like great and good effects, by the reduction of it from six to four, which is now at the Birth. And that the next Generation will yet see far greater Advantage by bringing it from four to three <hi>per cent.</hi>

               <p>THere was never any thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded for Publick Good, that did not meet with Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, arising sometimes from the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent apprehensions of men, in regard of the way, who yet have the same design as to the end; sometimes from a dislike of the Person propounding, or the humor
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51653:48"/>
of such as would have nothing brought into the World but by their own Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wifery; and are therefore only displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with a thing, because they were not the first Proposers of it themselves; sometimes from a more inveterate and corrupt Principle of wishing things worse, because they are not well, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that any thing should be reformed, because they cannot bring all things to the Figure of their own Fancies, and sometimes from other by Respects and private Interests.</p>
               <p>Whether any, or which of these hath moved my Opposer, I will not here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, because I know him not, but leaving that to the Judgment of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Reader, if the Gentleman's love to his Country be such as he professeth, and equal with mine, I shall not doubt but after a more serious Examination of the Matter, he will agree with me in the thing desired.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of his <hi>Treatise</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites nineteen <hi>Obversations</hi> of mine, as mean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> whereby the <hi>Dutch</hi> have encreased their Trade and Riches; And page 9. seems to approve of all them, saying as
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51653:48"/>
I told him, as also he doth, page 22. <hi>That more might be added,</hi> but is not so kind to his Country to let us know what they are; which if he had done, would have been more agreeable to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Candor, and as well of Use to his Country, as an Evidence of his own Sufficiency; it being a much easier thing to cavel at what other men have done, than to present the World with any thing new and material of our own.</p>
               <p>Page 10. (passing over many others) he quarrels at that facetious Instance of <hi>Noble-Mens wearing in former times Sattin-Doublets, with Canvas backs,</hi> which is the most inconsiderable instance of many, yet, upon the whole he concludes with me, <hi>That we are much Richer now than we were before any Law for Interest was made, and that we have grown Richer since the abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Interest from</hi> 10 <hi>to</hi> 8 per Cent, <hi>and yet more Rich since it was abated from</hi> 8 <hi>to</hi> 6 per Cent; which pag. 10. he confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, and pag. 11. he implicitly confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, and pag. 14. expresly, <hi>That accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the more or less Interest any Country pays for Money, the richer or poorer it is.</hi> I am glad we are thus far agreed, and that my Opposer is so well instructed,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51653:49"/>
hoping I shall with the less difficulty persw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>de him to a perfect understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Principle in Controversie, wherein as yet I think it will appear he is no great Master.</p>
               <p>But before I enter upon the matter, I must tell the Gentleman, he hath no cause to boast as to that particular Instance concerning Noble Men's former meaner Cloathing; for what I thence inferred was certainly true, as to the time I spoke of, which was of a time within the memory of a man then living, since Trade was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced into this Kingdom, which he endeavours to overthrow by an instance out of those times, when Noble men kept multitudes of Retainers about 200 Years past, <hi>viz.</hi> before <hi>Henry</hi> the 7th's time, and before Trade was understood in <hi>England,</hi> which I think is nothing to this purpose. Pag. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. the Gentleman reciting my Answer to that Objection, <hi>That if Interest be abated, the</hi> Dutch <hi>will call home their Money</hi>; to which I repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that if they should, it would be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for us, <hi>The Borrower being always a Slave to the Lender</hi>; which he saith, <hi>Is no more in the case of</hi> English <hi>and</hi> Dutch, <hi>then in that of</hi> English <hi>and</hi> English. And <hi>pag.</hi>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:51653:49"/>
12. at the beginning, he saith, <hi>That I have discovered my design of engrossing all Trade into the Hands of a few rich Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, who have Money enough of their own to trade with, to the excluding all young men that want it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In which two Assertions I appeal to all rational men, whether the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man be not in a very great Error, as to the very nature of the Principle he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courseth? For if one <hi>English</hi>-man lend to another, be the Interest high or low, between them two nothing is got or lost to the Nation; whereas if a <hi>Dutch</hi> man lend Money to an <hi>English</hi>-man, he at length carries home both Principal and Interest, which Interest, be it more or less, is a c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ear loss to the Nation, which is so evident, that I hope my Opposer, when he hath thought upon it again, will not upbraid me for begging the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, because I trouble not the Reader with the particular Proof of those things which I hear no man deny, and therefore conclude every man will grant: For whether <hi>Snow be white is not to be disputed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In his second Assertion likewise, that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51653:50"/>
the abatement of Interest tends to the engrossing of Trade into a few rich mens hands, to the excluding of young men, I appeal to the judgment of all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing Merchants and rational men, whether the Gentleman be not misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly mistaken? And whether the never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>failing effect of a high Interest all the World over, be not to enrich a few greatly, and impoverish the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Traders? So it is in <hi>Turkey,</hi> where Interest is at 20 <hi>per Cent,</hi> and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, if we may believe those honest and worthy <hi>Turkey</hi> Merchants, who are now upon the Exchange, and have lived long in that Country; and so it was with us here, when Interest was at 10 <hi>per Cent,</hi> and upwards, as I have already demonstrated by the instances of <hi>Sutton, Gresliam, Craven</hi> and <hi>Spencer</hi>; so that he must be naturally blind, or put out his Eyes, who doth not see that the <hi>Abatement of Interest is a diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Principle</hi>: Hence it follows, that as few great and rich Merchants, whose Estates are Personal, (except they have also great Souls) can bear the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of abating Interest with more
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51653:50"/>
patience than Usurers, well knowing that it must necessarily retrench their present Profits by encreasing the number of Traders; which though it be a small loss to Individuals, will be a vast gain to the generality of the Nation. At the lower end of pag. 12. his Words are, that in my instance of old <hi>Audley</hi>'s ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving that 100 <hi>l.</hi> at 10 <hi>per Cent,</hi> would in 70 Years amount to 100000 <hi>l.</hi> he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, <hi>I am no less mistaken than in other things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Truly, if I have mistook no more in other things than in that, in such an untrodden Path as this, I have failed much less then I could hope for; to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate which I have here inserted a short Table, shewing that 100 <hi>l.</hi> at that rate, riseth (within a trifle) to 200 <hi>l.</hi> in seven Years, Interest upon In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, so that the usual accompt is and was formerly, that Money doubles once in seven Years, at 10 <hi>per Cent,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to which rule 100<hi>l.</hi> in seventy Years, amounts to 102400 <hi>l.</hi>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Discourse was of my mind, whereas it may be supposed the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of that Book was contented with</hi> 8 per

Cent, <hi>because within four Years after it was brought down to that Rate, and that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise he would have writ further, it being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that he might live till after four Years.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I answer; That through the Mercies of Almighty God, and for the good of this Kingdom, that Patriot of his Country, Old Sr <hi>Thomas Culpepper,</hi> who I have since been assured was the Author of that Treatise, did live above twenty Years after the writing thereof, and then published a second Treatise, which was lately Re-printed by his worthy Son, which second Treatise is now to be had at Mr <hi>Wilkinson</hi>'s, over against St <hi>Dunstan's</hi> Church in <hi>Fleet-street,</hi> which I would advise my Opposer to read, and then I hope he will be more modest here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, then to mis-call the most Natural and Rational Conclusions, <hi>IMPO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SINGS.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But lest he should not meet with the said Treatise, I shall here insert a few Lines out of it to the present purpose, <hi>viz.</hi>

doth call upon us not to rest here, but that we bring the use for Money to a lower rate, which now I suppose will find no Opposition, for all Objections which before the Statute were made against it, are now answered by the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, &amp; most certainly the benefit will be much greater to the Common wealth, by calling the Vse for Money down from</hi> 8 <hi>to</hi> 5 <hi>or</hi> 6 per Cent, <hi>then it was from calling it down from</hi> 10 <hi>to</hi> 8 <hi>per Cent.</hi> I shall not Comment upon his Words, but only declare that in truth, I never heard of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, nor of any other to the like effect, when I write mine.</p>

And he positively denies that the lowness of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest is the Cause, &amp; affirms it to be only the Effect thereof, which he endeavours to prove by four Arguments, which I shall particularly answer in a due place, in the mean time use my own Method to prove, <hi>That the Abatement of

                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:51653:53"/>Now that the abatement of Interest, will advance the value of Land, I prove first by Experience, for certainly <hi>Anno</hi> 1621. the currant price of our Lands in <hi>England</hi> was twelve Years purchase; and so I have been assured by many antient Men whom I have queried par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly as to this Matter; and I find it so by purchases made about that time by my own Relations and Acquaintance, and I presume that any Nobleman or Gentleman of <hi>England,</hi> by only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the Stewards of their Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors to give them Lists out of the Records of any Mannors or Farms that their Grand-Fathers, or Fathers bought or sold fifty Years past, will find that the same Farms to be now sold, would yield (one with another) at least treble the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and in some cases six times the Mony they were then bought and sold for; which I submit still to the single and joynt Judgments of the honourable Members of both Houses of Parliament, who being the greatest Owners of our Territory, are in their private, as well as in their politick Capacities, the most proper and experimental Judges of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Case; if the Antient of them will please to recollect their Memories, and the Younger will please to be informed by their Elder Servants; and if this be so, it cannot be denied, but the abatement of Interest by a Law, hath greatly advanced Lands in purchase as well as improved Rents, by meliorating the Lands themselves, those improvements by marling, lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, draining, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> having been made since Money was at 8 and 6 <hi>per cent,</hi> which 10 <hi>per cent</hi> could not bear.</p>
               <p>And to prove that Lands were then at twelve Years purchase, I have the written Testimony of that incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble worthy Person Sr <hi>Thomas Culpepper</hi> Senior, who, page 11. of his first Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, expresly affirms, <hi>That Land was then at twelve Yea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s Purchase</hi>; who being himself a grave and antient Parliament Man, and dedicating his Book to the then Parliament, whereof he was then a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, cannot without horrible unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableness, be presumed to impose upon his Country.</p>
               <p>And now that our Interest is at 6 <hi>per cent,</hi> as the same worthy Author did wisely fore-see, I appeal to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:51653:54"/>
and Experience of my Country Men, whether the genuine price of our Lands in <hi>England</hi> now would not be 20 Years Purchase, were it not for acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental Pressures, under which it labours at present, such as these;</p>
               <p n="1">1. Our late great Land Taxes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And principally the late great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of <hi>Ireland,</hi> mentioned in my former Treatise, the consequence whereof is, that that Country now sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth Foreign Markets, as well as our own Plantations in <hi>America,</hi> with Beef, Pork, Hides, Tallow, Bread, Beer, Wool and Corn, at cheaper Rates then we can afford, to the beating us out of those Trades, whereas formerly, <hi>viz.</hi> presently after the late <hi>Irish</hi> War, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Men got good Estates by Transport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>English</hi> Cattle thither.</p>
               <p>And that the Improvement of <hi>Ireland,</hi> is the principal cause why our Lands in purchase rise not as naturally they should, with the fall of our Interest, appears evidently from the effect the fall of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest hath had upon Houses in <hi>London</hi>; where the growth of <hi>Ireland</hi> could have no such destructive influence, which hath been so considerable, that whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:51653:55"/>
will please to inform themselves by old Scriveners, or antient Deeds, shall find, that a House in <hi>London,</hi> about fifty Years past, that would sell but for 300<hi>l.</hi> at most, would readily sell within a short time after Interest was brought to 8 <hi>per cent,</hi> at 5 or 600 <hi>l.</hi> and the same Houses to be sold sometime after Interest was brought to 6 <hi>per cent, viz.</hi> before and after the late <hi>Dutch</hi> War, would have yielded without scruple 1000 or 1200<hi>l.</hi> The abatement of Interest having had a double effect upon Houses, by encreasing Trade, and consequently raising Rents, as well as encreasing the number of Years purchase.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third reason why Land doth not at present bear an exact proportion to 6 <hi>per cent,</hi> which should naturally be twenty Years, is the late Plague, which did much depopulate this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The late Fire in <hi>London,</hi> which hath engaged Men in Building in the City, who otherwise would have been pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chasing in the Country.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The unusal plenty of Corn, which hath been for these three or four Years past in most parts of Christendom, the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:51653:55"/>
like whereof hath been seldom known, it happening most commonly that when one Country hath had great plenty, others have had great scarcity.</p>

               <p>A seventh accidental Reason why Land doth not sell at present, at the rate it naturally should, in proportion to the legal Interest, is, <hi>that innovated practice of Bankers in London,</hi> which hath more effects attending it then most I converse with have yet observed; but I shall here take notice of that only which is to my present purpose, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Gentlemen</hi> that are <hi>Bankers,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a large Interest from his <hi>Majesty,</hi> for what they advance upon his <hi>Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Revenue</hi>; can afford to give the full legal Interest to all Persons that put Money into their hands, though for never so short or long a time, which makes the trade of Usury so easie, and hitherto safe, that few, after having found the sweetness of this lasie way of emprovement (being by continuance and success grown to fancy themselves secure in it) can be lead (there being
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:51653:56"/>
neither ease nor profit to invite them) to lay out their Money in Land, though at 15 Years purchase; whereas before this way of private Bankering came up, men that had Money were forced oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to let it lie dead by them, until they could meet with Securities to their minds; and if the like necessity were now of Money lying dead, the loss of use for the dead time being deducted from the profit of 6 <hi>l. per Cent, (commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus annis)</hi> would in effect take off 1 <hi>l. per Cent per Annum</hi> of the profit of Usury, and consequently incline men more to purchase Lands, in regard the difference between Usury and Purchasing would not in point of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit be so great as now it is; this new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of Cashe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ing, having in my opinion clearly bettered the <hi>Vsurers</hi> trade 1 or 2 <hi>per Cent per Annum.</hi> And that this way of leaving Money with <hi>Gold-Smiths</hi> hath had the aforesaid effect, seems evident to me from the scarcity it makes of Money in the Country; for the Trade of <hi>Bankers</hi> being only in <hi>London,</hi> doth very much drain the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Money from all other parts of the <hi>Kingdom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:51653:56"/>The second point I am to prove, is, That it will advance the Rent of Farms.</p>
               <p>To prove that it did so in fact, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on memory; and for my own part, I and most others I converse with, do perfectly remember that Rents did generally rise after the late abatement of Interest, <hi>(viz.)</hi> in the year 1651. and 1652.</p>
               <p>The reason why they did so, was from the encouragement which that abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Interest gave to <hi>Landlords</hi> and <hi>Tenants,</hi> to improve by <hi>Draining, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, Limeing,</hi> &amp;c. excellently made out by the aforesaid two worthy Authors, so that I do (I think with good Reason) conclude that the present fall of Rents is not natural, but accidental, and to be ascribed principally to the fore-going Reasons, given for the present abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Land in purchase, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to the late Improvement of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third thing I am to prove, is, That the abatement of Interest will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease the bulk of foreign Trade, which I do thus.</p>
               <p>By evidence of fact, it hath been so in <hi>England, the encrease of our Trade hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways

followed the abatement of our Interest by Law,</hi> I say, not preceded, but fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed it, and the Cause doth always go before the Effect, which I think I have evidently demonstrated in my former Treatise.</p>
               <p>If any doubt of this, and will be at the pains to examin the <hi>Custom-house</hi> Books, they may soon be resolved.</p>

Interest paid for Money; As for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, when Money was at 10 <hi>per Cent</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> no man in his wits would follow any Trade whereby he did not promise himself 14 or 12 <hi>per Cent</hi> gain at least, when Interest was at 8, the hopes of 12 or 10 at least was necessary, as 8 or 9 <hi>per Cent</hi> is, now Interest goes at 6 <hi>per Cent,</hi> the Infallible Consequence whereof is, that the Trades before recited, as well as those of <hi>Muscovy</hi> and <hi>Greenland,</hi> and so much at least of all others, that will not afford us a clear profit of 8 or 9 <hi>per Cent,</hi> we carelesly give away to the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and must do so forever, unless we bring our Interest nearer to a <hi>Par</hi> with theirs; and hence in my poor Opinion it follows very clearly, that if our Interest were aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted one third part, it would occasion the employment of one third part more of Men, Shpping and Stock, in foreign and domestick Trades.</p>
               <p>This discovers the vanity of all our Attempts for gaining of the <hi>White-Herring Fishing-Trade,</hi> of which the <hi>Dutch,</hi> as every body observes, make wonderful great advantage, though the Fish be taken upon our own <hi>Coasts</hi>;

I wish as many did take notice of the reason of it, which theref<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re I shall say something of now, though I have touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it in my former Treatise.</p>
               <p>The plain case is this, <hi>A Dutch-man</hi> will be content to employ a Stock of 5 or 10000 <hi>l.</hi> in <hi>Burses, materials for Fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Victuals,</hi> &amp;c. for the carrying on of this Trade, and if at the winding up of his Accounts, he finds he hath got clear <hi>communibus annis,</hi> for his Stock and Adventure 5 <hi>per Cent per Annum,</hi> he thanks <hi>God,</hi> and tells his Neighbours he hath had a thriving Trade: Now while every sloathful ignorant man with us, that hath but wit enough to tell out his Money to a <hi>Gold Smith,</hi> can get 6 <hi>per Cent</hi> without pains or care; Is it not monstrous absurd to imagine that ever the <hi>English</hi> will do any good upon this Trade, till they begin at the right end, which must be to reduce the Interest of Money?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The depraved nature of man affecting ease and pleasure, while use of Money runs at 6 <hi>per Cent,</hi> hath always at hand an easie expedient to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge that humor, and reconcile it to another as considerable, <hi>viz.</hi> his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:51653:59"/>
by putting his Money to use; and if a <hi>Merchant</hi> through his youthful care and industry, arrive to an Estate of 20000 <hi>l.</hi> in twenty Years trading, whilst Money is so high, and Land so low, he can easily turn Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try <hi>Gentleman</hi> or Usurer, which were Interest of Money at 4 <hi>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> From this necessity of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants</hi> keeping to their Trade, and <hi>Childrens</hi> succeeding their Fathers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, would ensue to <hi>Merchants</hi> greater skill in Trade, more exact and certain cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondency, surer &amp; more trusty <hi>Factors</hi> abroad, &amp; those better acquainted &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catinated together by the experimental links of each others Humors, Stile, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state and Business. And whereas it is as much as a prudent man can do in ten Years time, after his settling in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:51653:59"/>
to be exactly well fitted with <hi>Factors</hi> in all parts, and those by Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency brought into a mutual Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance of each other, and honest <hi>Work-men</hi> and <hi>Masters</hi> of Ships, &amp;c. And by that time he hath traded ten Years longer, if he succeed well, it is six to one but he leaves Trade, and turns <hi>Country Gentleman,</hi> or <hi>Vsurer,</hi> and so that profitable Engine, (the Wheels whereof by Correspondency move one another in many parts of the World) which he hath been so long a framing, within a few Years after it is brought to work well, is broken to pieces, and the benefit thereof to the Kingdom (which is ten times more then to him that made it) is lost, whereas in <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> where Money is at 3 and 4. <hi>per Cent,</hi> and consequently <hi>Merchants</hi> forc'd to keep and trust to their Trades only, their Businesses are, and must be so ordered and carried on from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, that when a <hi>Man</hi> dies, the Trade is no more disturbed then when the <hi>Wife</hi> dies in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I am ashamed of the odious Prolixity and Repetition I am (contrary to my Nature) forced to use; but my <hi>Opposer</hi>

               <p>The frugal <hi>Italians</hi> of Old, and the provident <hi>Dutch</hi> of latter times I think have given the World a sufficient proof of this <hi>Theorim</hi>; and if any shall tell me, it is the nature of those People to be thrifty; I answer, all men by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are alike; it is only Laws, Custom, and Education that differ men; <hi>their Nature and Disposition, and the disposition of all Peopl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:51653:61"/>The <hi>sixth</hi> proof of the <hi>Proposition,</hi> is, that <hi>It employes the Poor</hi>; which is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary Consequence likewise of the encrease of Trade in <hi>Cities,</hi> and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of Land in the <hi>Country,</hi> which is well and truly demonstrated from Experience, by the Elder and Younger Sr <hi>Thomas Culpepper,</hi> to whom to avoid Prolixity, I must refer the Reader.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly, It encreaseth the People of a Nation</hi>; this also necessarily followeth the encrease of Trade and Emprove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Lands, not that it causeth mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried men to get more Children.</p>
               <p>But 1<hi>st,</hi> a trading Country affording comfortable Subsistances to more Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies then a Country destitute of Trade, is the reason that many do marry, who otherwise must be forc'd to live sin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>And if these will be the effects of aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Interest, then I think it is out of doubt that the Abatement of Interest is the cause of the encrease of the Riches of any Kingdom, for <hi>quicquid efficit tale est magis tale.</hi> Now to answer his four recited Reasons, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, he saith, <hi>If a low stated Interest by Law be the cause of Riches, no Country would be poor,</hi> all desiring Riches rather then Poverty, and all having it in their power to state their Interest as low as they please by Law.</p>
               <p>I answer, <hi>first, Whatever Nation doth it gradually,</hi> for so it must be done; as it hath been hitherto in <hi>England</hi> (2 <hi>per Cent</hi> being enough to abate at one time) <hi>will find those effects I have mentioned</hi>; but
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:51653:62"/>
it is a work of Ages, and cannot be done at once; For <hi>Nec natura aut lex operantur per saltum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is great Imprudence to imagine that any Country understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their true Interest so well, as by degrees to abate Use-Money, will not likewise by the same Wisdom be led to the instituting of many other good Laws for the encouragement of Trade, as our <hi>Parliaments</hi> have still proceeded to do, as Interest hath been abated.</p>
               <p>His <hi>second</hi> Reason is, <hi>That if the lowness of Interest were not the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ffect of Riches in</hi> Holland, <hi>they might take as much Vse-Money as they could get, there being no Law against it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I answer, There were formerly Laws in <hi>Holland</hi> that reduced Interest to 8 and 6, and afterwards to 5 <hi>per Cent, Anno</hi> 1640. and since in the Year 1655. to 4 <hi>per Cent,</hi> the <hi>Placart</hi> for which I have seen, and have been told, and do believe they have since reduced it by <hi>Placart</hi> to 3 <hi>per Cent,</hi> as to their <hi>Cantors,</hi> and all publick Receipts, which in <hi>Holland</hi> is as much in effect as if they had made a general Law for it, because the most of their Receipts and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:51653:63"/>
Payments are made in and out of the aforesaid publick Offices, or else into and out of their Banks, for which no Use-Money is allowed; which several gradual and succesful Abatements of Interest did occasion their Riches at first, and brought their People to that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistency of Wealth, that they have since wrought themselves into such an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, that <hi>there are more Lenders now than Borrowers,</hi> and so I doubt not but it will be with us in a few Years, after the next Abatement of Interest is made by Law; which I have good reason to conclude, not only from the visible o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations of nature in all other things and places, but from Fact and Experience in this very case; being certain that the <hi>Gold-Smiths</hi> in <hi>London</hi> could have what Money they would upon their Servants Notes only, at 4 <hi>l.</hi> and 4 <hi>l.</hi> 10 <hi>s. per Cent,</hi> before the late Emergencies of State, which I could demonstrate, have very much obstructed the natural fall of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest with us; something more I have said in answer to this in the addition to my former Treatise; and this may serve likewise for an answer to his third Reason.</p>

               <p>The Reasons he gives for our present greatness of Trade are;</p>
               <p>First, <hi>Our casting off the Church of</hi> Rome.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>The Statutes in</hi> Henry <hi>the</hi> 7<hi>th's time, prohibiting Noble mens Retainers, and making their Lands liable to the pay<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>The discovery of the</hi> East <hi>and</hi> West-India <hi>Trade,</hi> pag. 19, 20.</p>
               <p>To his first and second Reasons, I answer, that <hi>Those Statutes of</hi> Henry <hi>the</hi> 7<hi>th, and our casting off the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>did long precede our being any thing in Trade</hi>; which began not until the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end of Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>een <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign, and afterwards encreased in the time of King <hi>Iames</hi> and King <hi>Charles</hi> the first,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:51653:67"/>
as we abated our Interest, and not otherwise; <hi>there being a Person yet living,</hi> and but 77 Years of Age, viz. Captain <hi>Russel</hi> of <hi>Wapping, who assures me he can remember since we had not above three Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants Ships of</hi> 300 <hi>Tuns, and upwards, belonging to</hi> England.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That in <hi>Italy</hi> where there are no such Statutes for abridgement of <hi>Noble men's</hi> Retainers, nor casting off the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> there is notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing a very great Trade, and Land at from 35 to 40 Years purchase, which sufficiently shews that a low Interest is absolutely and principally necessary, and that the other particulars alone will not do, to the procuring of those ends, although a low Interest singly doth it in <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To his third Reason, I answer, that <hi>There are some men yet living who do remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber a greater Trade to</hi> East-India, <hi>and a far greater Stock employed therein, then we have now</hi>; and yet we were so far from thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving upon it, that we lost by it, and could never see our principal Money again; Nor ever did we greatly pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per upon it, till our Interest was much abated by Laws; <hi>nor ever shall mate the</hi>

Dutch <hi>in it, till our Interest be as low as theirs.</hi> The like, in a great measure, is true in our <hi>West-India</hi> Trades, we never got considerable by them till our last Abatement of Interest from 8 to 6 <hi>per Cent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Pag. 21, 22. he labours to prove, that <hi>If we would have Trade to flourish, and Lands high, we must imitate the</hi> Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders <hi>in their Practices</hi>; which in matter of Trade I know is most certain, so far as they are consistent with the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our own Country: And the first and readiest thing wherein we can imitate them, is to reduce our Interest of Money to a lower rate, after the manner of our Fathers, and they did it before us, which will naturally lead us to all the other advantages in Trade which they now use.</p>

               <p>In this tenth particular, at the latter end of page 24. he saith, I am mistaken in my Assertion of the Interest of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which upon further enquiry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the <hi>Scotch Merchants</hi> upon the <hi>Exchange,</hi> I am told is his own mistake; So I must leave that, being matter of fact, to those that know that Country and its Laws, more and better then either of us: Lastly, he concludes, that whilst I say the matter in <hi>England</hi> is so naturally prepared for an Abatement of Interest, that it cannot be long ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed:

I propound a Law to antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate Nature, which is against Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
               <p>I answer, it was the Wisdom of our <hi>Grand-fathers</hi> to bring it to what it would bear in their time; and our <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> found the good effects of that, and brought it lower, and the benefit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is since manifested to us by the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess; and therefore, seeing the matter will now bear further Abatement, it is reasonable for us to follow that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Example of our <hi>Ancestors; Laws against Nature I grant would be ineffectual; but I never heard before, that Laws to help Nature, were against Reason.</hi>

and that then Land and Houses must rise; and I doubt it will appear, when this <hi>Gentleman</hi> is as well known as I am, that he is more an <hi>Vsurer,</hi> then an Owner of Land or Manager of Trade at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent; my ends have only been to serve my <hi>Country,</hi> which I can with a sincere Heart declare, in the Presence of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Men</hi>: And that nothing else could have engaged me into this unpleasing Controversie, wherein I have given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing offence to all my nearest Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and knew at first that I must needs do so, most of them being such as Age and Wisdom hath instructed rather to be <hi>Box-keepers</hi> then <hi>Gamesters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have before-mentioned the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>French King</hi> and <hi>Court,</hi> but intended not to recite the <hi>Edict,</hi> being it is at large in Sr <hi>Thomas Culpeppers</hi> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior his last Treatise, yet on second thoughts, considering all Men perhaps, may not come to a sight of that, and finding the said <hi>Edict</hi> so comprehensive of the whole matter of this Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, I have here recited it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The King by these Edicts had nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the necessities of the Nobility, if he had not provided for Vsuries, which have
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:51653:72"/>
ruined many good and antient Houses; filled Towns with unprofitable Servants, and the Countries with Miseries and Inhumanities; he found the Rents</hi> viz. <hi>Vsuries consti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Edict</hi> was verified in the Court of <hi>Parliament, which considered that it was always prejudicial to the</hi> Commonwealth, <hi>to give Money to Vsury</hi>; for it is a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent whose biteing is not apparent, and yet it is so sensible, that it peirceth the very Hearts of the best Families.</p>
               <p>The whole of this Controversie lies narrowly in these two short Questions,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:51653:73"/>
viz. <hi>Will abatement of Interest improve Trade?</hi> Secondly, <hi>Will it advance the price of Land? The collective united Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the Government of our own and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Kingdoms, expresly say it will do both, and Experience cries aloud that so it will do, and hath done in all Ages and in all Places</hi>; and I never yet met with any private person, how much soever concerned in Interest, that had the ignorance or confidence to deny both.</p>
               <p>For discourse with a <hi>Country Vsurer,</hi> he will affirm, and perhaps be ready to swear to it, that this abatement of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest is a <hi>Knavish</hi> design of the <hi>Citizens</hi> to advance themselves, who are too proud already; and that if it go forward it will undo all the Country <hi>Gentlemen</hi> in <hi>England</hi>: And if one speak with the <hi>City Vsurers,</hi> they will be as ready to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that this is a plot carried on only by <hi>Noblemen</hi> and <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> whose Estates are all in Land, for their own advantage, and that it will spoil all the Trade of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> being a project at one instant to take off just one third of all Mens Estates that are personal, and add the same proportion to all such whose Estates are real; which in effect is to Impover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:51653:73"/>
all the <hi>Younger,</hi> and Enrich all <hi>Elder</hi> Brothers in <hi>England</hi>: So that out of the Mouthes of the greatest and wisest Adversaries to this principle, it may be justly concluded, that though single<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they deny the truth of it, yet joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they confess it.</p>
               <p>To conclude, there is nothing that I have said, or that I think any other can say upon this occasion, but was said in substance before by old Sr <hi>Thomas Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pepper (tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>gh unknown to me)</hi> who had an ampel and clear sight into the whole na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this Principle, and the true ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and consequences of it, <hi>Truth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing always the same, though Illustrations may vary</hi>; nor can any thing now be objected against the making a Law for a further abatement of Interest, but the same that was objected in those times wherein the former <hi>Statutes</hi> past; so <hi>that</hi> why my <hi>Opposer</hi> should cavil at the doing of that by a Law in <hi>England,</hi> now (which he seems to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ike well, if it could be done) I know no real cause, except it be that in truth he is wise enough to know that a Law in <hi>England</hi> will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do the Work, as it hath done former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:51653:74"/>
and in consequence his own private Gain will be retrenched.</p>
               <p>Before I concluded I think it necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, for caution to my <hi>Country-men,</hi> to let them know what effects these discourses have had on others; when I wrote my first Treatise, Interest was in the <hi>Island</hi> of <hi>Barbadoes</hi> at 15 <hi>per centum,</hi> where it is since by an Act of the Country brought down to 10 <hi>per cent</hi> (a great fall at once) and our weekly <hi>Gazets</hi> did some Months past inform us, that the <hi>Sweeds</hi> by a Law had brought down their Interest to 6 <hi>per cent</hi>; neither of which can have any good effects upon us, but certainly the contrary, except by way of emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they quicken us to provide in time for our own Good and Prosperity.</p>
               <p>I have now done with this Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, and therein discharge my Duty to my native Country, and though Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, Malice, or private Interest may yet for some time oppose it; <hi>I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent the Wisdom of my Country-men, will at length find their true and general Interest, in the Establishment of such a Law,</hi> which as to my own particular concernments, sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies not two Farthings whether they do or not.</p>

               <p>THis is a calm Subject, and thwarts no common or private Interest amongst us, except that of the common Enemy of Mankind <hi>(the Devil)</hi> so I hope that what shall be offered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the effecting of so universally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable a Work as this, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of the innumerable Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences that do now and have in all Ages at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended this Kingdom, through defect of such provision for the Poor, will not be ill taken, although the Plaister at first essay do not exactly fit the Sore.</p>
               <p>In the Discourse of this subject, I shall first assert some particulars, which I think are agreed by common Consent, and from thence take occasion to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to what is more doubtful.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That our Poor in</hi> England <hi>have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been in a most sad and wretched condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>

some Famished for want of Bread, others starved with Cold and Naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and many whole Families in all the out Parts of Cities and great Towns, commonly remain in a languishing, nasty and useless Condition, Uncomfortable to themselves, and Unprofitable to the Kingdom, this is confessed and lamented by all Men.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the <hi>Children</hi> of our <hi>Poor</hi> bred up in <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>That our fore-Fathers had pious Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions towards this good Work, as appears by the many Statutes made by them to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>That there are places in the VVorld<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherein the Poor are so provided for, and employed, as in</hi> Holland, Hambrough, New-England <hi>and others, and as I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed now in the</hi> City <hi>of</hi> Paris.</p>
               <p>Thus far we all agree: The first Question then that naturally occurs, is,</p>
               <p>Question, <hi>How comes it to pass that in</hi> England <hi>we do not, nor ever did comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly Maintain and Employ our Poor</hi>?</p>
               <p>The common Answers to this Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are, two.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That our Laws to this purpose are as good as any in the World, but we fail in the execution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That formerly in the days of our pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Ancestors the work was done, but now Charity is deceased,</hi> and that is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son we see the Poor so neglected as now they are.</p>
               <p>In both which Answers (I humbly
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:51653:76"/>
conceive) the Effect is mistaken for the Cause: For though it cannot be denied, but there hath been, and is a great failure in the Execution of those <hi>Statutes</hi> which relate to the <hi>Poor</hi>; yet I say, the <hi>cause of that failure, hath been occasioned by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the Laws themselves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For otherwise, what is the reason that in our late times of Confusion and Alteration, wherein almost every Party in the Nation, at one time or other, took their turn at the Helm, and all had that Compass (those Laws) to Stear by, and yet none of them could, or ever did, conduct the Poor into a Harbour of secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to them, and profit to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, i. e. <hi>none sufficiently maintained the Impotent, and employed the Indigent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us</hi>: And if this was never done in any Age, nor by any sort of Men whatsoever in this Kingdom, who had the use of those Laws now in force, it seems to me a very strong Argument that it never could, nor ever will be done by those Laws, and that consequently the defect lies in the Laws themselves, not in the Men, <hi>i. e.</hi> those that should put them in Execution.</p>
               <p>As to the second Answer to the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:51653:76"/>
Question, wherein <hi>want of Charity</hi> is assigned for another cause why the <hi>Poor</hi> are now so much neglected, I think it is a <hi>scandalous ungrounded Accusation</hi> of our <hi>Contemporaries</hi> (except in relation to Building of <hi>Churches,</hi> which I confess this Generation is not so prophense to as former have been) for most that I converss with, are not so much troubled to part with their Money, as how to place it, that it may do good, and not hurt to the Kingdom: For, <hi>if they give to the Beggars in the Streets, or at their Doors, they fear they may do hurt by</hi> encouraging that Lazy Unprofitable kind of Life; and <hi>if they give more th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And for what was given in <hi>Churches</hi> to the <hi>visited Poor,</hi> and to such as were <hi>impoverished by the Fire</hi>; we have heard of so many and great Abuses of that kind of <hi>Charity,</hi> that most Men are under sad discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in relation thereunto.</p>
               <p>I write not this to divert any Man from Works of Charity of any kind:

                  <hi>He that gives to any in Want does well; but he that gives to Employ and Educate the Poor, so as to render them useful to the Kingdom, in my judgment does better.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The second Question then is,</p>
               <p>Question 2. <hi>Wherein lies the defect of our present Laws relati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>g to the Poor?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I answer, that there may be many, but I shall here take notice of one only, which I think to be Fundamental, and which until altered, the Poor in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> can never be well Provided for, or Employed; and that when the said fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Error is well amended, it is almost impossible they should lack either Work or Maintenance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The said radical Error I esteem to be the leaving it to the care of every Parish to Maintain their own Poor only</hi>; upon which follows the shifting off, sending or whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back the poor Wanderers to the Place of their Birth, or last Abode; the practice whereof I have seen many years in <hi>London,</hi> to signifie as much as ever it will, which is just nothing of good to the Kingdom in general, or the Poor thereof, though it be sometimes by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to some of them a Punishment without effect; I say without effect, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:51653:78"/>
it reforms not the Party, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposeth the minds of others to Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which are the true ends of all Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishment.</p>
               <p>As for instance, <hi>a poor idle Person,</hi> that will not Work, or that no Body will Employ in the Country, <hi>comes up to</hi> Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don <hi>to set up the Trade of Begging,</hi> such a person probably may Begg up and down the Streets seven years, it may be seven and twenty, before any Body asketh why she doth so, and if at length she hath the ill hap in some Parish, to meet with a more vigilant <hi>Beadle</hi> then one of twenty of them are, all he does is but to lead her the length of five or six Houses into another Parish, and then concludes, as his <hi>Masters</hi> the <hi>Parishioners</hi> do, that he hath done the part of a most diligent Officer: But suppose he should yet go further to the end of his Line, which is the end of the Law; and the perfect Execution of his Off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ice; that is, suppose he should carry this poor wretch to a <hi>Iustice</hi> of the Peace, and he should order the <hi>Delinquent</hi> to be Whipt and sent from <hi>Parish</hi> to <hi>Parish,</hi> to the place of her <hi>Birth</hi> or last <hi>Abode,</hi> which not one <hi>Iustice</hi> of twenty (through pitty or other
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:51653:78"/>
cause) will do; even this is a great charge upon the Country, and yet the business of the Nation it self wholly undone: for no sooner doth the <hi>Delinquent</hi> arrive at the place assigne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, but for Shame or Idleness she presently deserts it, and wanders directly back, or some other way, hoping for better Fortune, whilst the <hi>Parish</hi> to which she is sent, knowing her a Lazy and perhaps a worse qualited person, is as willing to be rid of her, as she is to be gone from thence.</p>
               <p>If it be here retorted upon me, that by my own confession, much of this mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief happens by the non, or ill Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Laws, I say, better Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then you have seen you must not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect; and <hi>there was never a good Law made that was not well executed, the fault of the Law causing a failure of execution,</hi> it being natural to all Men to use the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy next at hand, and rest satisfied with shifting the Evil from their own Doors; which in regard they can so easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do, by threatning or thrusting a poor Body out of the verge of their own <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,</hi> it is unreasonable and vain to hope that ever it will be otherwise.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:51653:79"/>This I confess is a hard and difficult ques<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ion, it is one of the <hi>Ardua Regni,</hi> and may very well deserve the most deliberate consideration of our wisest <hi>Counsellors.</hi> And if a whole Session of <hi>Parliament</hi> were employed on this singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar concern, I think it would be time spent as much to the glory of <hi>God</hi> and good of this <hi>Nation,</hi> as in any thing that noble and worthy <hi>Patriots</hi> of their Country can be engaged in: But seeing I have adventured thus far, I shall hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly proceed to offer some general pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posals that have a tendency towards the effecting this great Work, which being seriously thought of and debated by wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser men, may be capable of such melio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration as may render them in a great measure effectual to the <hi>Kingdom</hi> in general, although at present, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent that common Objection, that great Mutations are dangerous; I shall only propose them to be experimented in these parts of the Kingdom, which are the Vitals of our body politick, which being once made sound, the care of the rest will not be difficult.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Proposition,</hi> 1. First then I propose, <hi>That the City of</hi> London <hi>and</hi> Westminster,

               <p>This is a Question likewise of some difficulty, and the more in regard of our present Differences in <hi>Religion,</hi> but I shall answer it as well as I can.</p>
               <p>In general I say, <hi>They must be such as the People must have ample satisfaction in, or else the whole Design will be lost</hi>: For if the universality of the People be not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with the Persons, they will never part with their Money; but if they be well satisfied therein, they will be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculously charitable.</p>

               <p>If it be here objected to the whole purpose of this Treatise, that this work may as well be done in distinct <hi>Parishes,</hi> if all <hi>Parishes</hi> were obliged to Build <hi>Work-Houses,</hi> and Employ their <hi>Poor</hi> therein; as <hi>Dorchester</hi> and some others have done with good success.</p>
               <p>I answer, that such attempts have been made in many places to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, with very good intents and stre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous endeavours, but all that ever I heard of, proved vain and ineffectual, as I fear will that of <hi>Clerken-Well,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that single instance of the Town of <hi>Dorchester,</hi> which yet signifies no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in relation to the Kingdom in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, because all other places cannot do the like, nor doth the Town of <hi>Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester</hi> entertain any but their own <hi>Poor</hi> only, and Whip away all others; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as that which I design is to propose such a Foundation, as shall be large, wise, honest and rich enough to maintain and

employ all <hi>Poor</hi> that come within the Pale of their Communication, without enquiring where they were Born, or last Inhabited: Which I dare affirm with Humility, that nothing but a <hi>National,</hi> or at least such a <hi>Provincial</hi> Purse can so well do, nor any persons in this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> but such only as shall be pickt out by po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Election for the reason before al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, <hi>viz.</hi> That in my opinion, <hi>three fourths</hi> at least of the <hi>Stock</hi> must issue from the <hi>Charity</hi> of the <hi>people</hi>; as I doubt not but it will to a greater proportion, if they be satisfied in the <hi>Managers</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; But if otherwise, not the fortieth; I might say not the hundredth part.</p>
               <p>I propose the Majority of the said <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Poor</hi> to be <hi>Citizens (though I am none my self)</hi> because I think a great share of the Money to be employed, must and will come from them, if ever the Work be well done, as also, because their Habitations are nearest the C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now I have adventured thus far, I shall proceed to publish my Thoughts and Observations concerning some other things that have relation to Trade, which I do without any purpose or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, save only to give occasion to my <hi>Country-men,</hi> to be Discoursing and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating upon those things which have a tendancy to publick Good, from whence (though my Suggestions should be mistakes) probably some good effect may ensue, and therefore the Ingenuous, I know, though they may differ from me, will not blame me for the attempt.</p>

               <head>CHAP. III. Concerning Companies of Merchants.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>COmpanies of Merchants</hi> are of two sorts, <hi>viz. Companies in joynt Stock,</hi> such as the <hi>East-India-Company,</hi> the <hi>Morea-Company</hi> (which is a Branch of the <hi>Turkey-Company</hi>) and the <hi>Greenland-Company,</hi> which is a Branch of the <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covia Company</hi>; the other sort are <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies</hi> who trade not by a <hi>joynt Stock,</hi> but only are under a Government and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation, such are the <hi>Hambrough-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,</hi> the <hi>Turkey-Company,</hi> the <hi>Eastland-Company,</hi> the <hi>Muscovia-Company.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It hath for many Years been a moote case, whether any Encorporating of <hi>Merchants,</hi> be for publik Good or not.</p>
               <p>For my own part I am of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>That for <hi>Countries</hi> with which his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty</hi>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:51653:87"/>
hath no <hi>Allieance,</hi> nor can have any by reason of their distance, or Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or non-Communication with the <hi>Princes</hi> of <hi>Christendom,</hi> &amp;c. where there is a necessity of Maintaining Forces and Forts, (such as <hi>East-India</hi> and <hi>Guinia) Companies</hi> of <hi>Merchants</hi> are absolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>It seems evident to me, that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est part of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>se two Trades ought for publick Good, to be managed by joynt Stock.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>It's questionable to me, whether any other Company of Merchants are for publick good or hurt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. I conclude however, <hi>that all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strictions of Trade are naught,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently that no <hi>Company</hi> whatsoever, whether they Trade in a <hi>joynt Stock</hi> or under <hi>Regulation,</hi> can be for publick Good, except it may be easie for all, or any of his <hi>Majesty</hi>'s <hi>Subjects</hi> to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into all, or any of the said <hi>Companies,</hi> at any time for a very inconsiderable Fine, and that if the Fine exceed 20 <hi>l.</hi> including all Charges of admission, it is too much, and that for these Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Because the <hi>Dutch</hi> who thrive best by Trade, and have the surest rules to
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:51653:88"/>
thrive by, <hi>admit not only any of their own</hi> People, <hi>but even</hi> Jews <hi>and all kind of</hi> Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens, <hi>to be Free of any of their Societies of</hi> Merchants, <hi>or any of their Cities or Towns Corporate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Nothing in the World can enable us to coape with the</hi> Dutch <hi>in any Trade, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of Hands and Stock, which a general admission will do</hi>; many Hands and much Stock being as necessary to the Prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of any Trade, as Men and Money to warfare.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is no pretence of any good to the <hi>Nation</hi> by <hi>Companies,</hi> but only <hi>O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>der and Regulation</hi> of Trade; and if that be preserved (which the admission of all that will come in and submit to the <hi>Regulation,</hi> will not prejudice) all the good to the <hi>Nation</hi> that can be hoped for by <hi>Companies,</hi> is obtained.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The <hi>Eastland,</hi> besides our <hi>Native Commodities</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> spend great quantities of <hi>Italian, Spanish, Portugal</hi> and <hi>French Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities,</hi> viz. <hi>Oyle, Wine, Fruit, Sugar, Succads, Shoomack,</hi> &amp;c. Now, in regard our <hi>East-Country Merchants</hi> of <hi>England</hi> are few, compared with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and intend principally that one Trade out and home, and consequently are not so
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:51653:88"/>
conversant in the aforesaid <hi>Commodities,</hi> nor forward to adventure upon them, and seeing that by the <hi>Companies Charter</hi> our <hi>Italian, Spanish, Portugal</hi> and <hi>French Merchants,</hi> who understand those <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities</hi> perfectly well, are excluded those Trades, or at least, if the <hi>Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> will give them leave to send out those Goods, are not permitted to bring in the Returns; it follows, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> must supply <hi>Denmark, Sweeden,</hi> and all parts of the <hi>Baltique,</hi> with most of those <hi>Commodities,</hi> and so it is in fact.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The <hi>Dutch</hi> who have no <hi>Eastland-Companies,</hi> yet have ten times the Trade to the <hi>Eastern parts</hi> as we have; and for <hi>Italy, Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> where we have no <hi>Companies,</hi> we have yet left full as much, if not more Trade, then the <hi>Dutch.</hi> And for <hi>Russia</hi> and <hi>Greenland</hi> where we have <hi>Companies</hi> (and I think Establisht by <hi>Act</hi> or <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi>) our Trade is in effect wholly lost, while the <hi>Dutch,</hi> have, without <hi>Companies,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased theirs to above <hi>forty</hi> times the the Bulk of what the residue of ours now is.</p>
               <p>From whence may be inferred.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That restrained limitted Companies
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:51653:89"/>

               <p>It is the care of <hi>Law-makers</hi> first and principally, to provide for the <hi>People</hi> in gross, not particulars, and if the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of so easie an admission, should be to make our <hi>Manufactures</hi> cheap abroad, and <hi>Foreign Commodities</hi> cheap here, (as is alledged) our <hi>Nation</hi> in general would have the advantage both ways.</p>

               <p>I answer, <hi>The end of Service and giving of Money with Apprentices, I have always understood to be the Learning of the Art or Science of Merchandizing, not the purchasing of an Immunity or Monopoly to the prejudice of our Country</hi>; and that it is so, is evident from the practice, there being many ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Merchants</hi> that are free of no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>Company,</hi> who can have as large Sums of Money with <hi>Apprentices,</hi> as any other that are free of one or more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>Companies of Merchants</hi>; and many <hi>Merchants</hi> that are free of particular <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies,</hi> unto whom few will give any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable sums of Money with <hi>Apprentices</hi>; the proportion of Money given with <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices</hi> not following the <hi>Company</hi> a <hi>Merchant</hi> is free of, but the condition the <hi>Master,</hi> as to his more or less reputed skill in his Calling, Thriving or going back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, greater or lesser Trade, well or ill Government of himself and Family, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>I answer, That I am yet to learn that

any Company of Merchants not trading with a joynt Stock, such as the <hi>Turkey, Hambrough<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Muscovia</hi> and <hi>Eastland</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies ever purchased their Priviledges, or built and maintained Forts, Castles or Factories, or made any Wars at their own charge; but I know the <hi>Turkey</hi> Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny do maintain an Embassador and two Consuls, and are sometimes necessitated to make Presents to the <hi>Grand Senior,</hi> or his great Officers; and the <hi>Hambrough</hi> Company are at some charge to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their Deputy, and Minister at <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brough</hi>; and I think it would be great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice that any should trade to the places within their Charters, without paying the same Duties or Leviations towards the Companies charge as the present Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers do pay, but I know not why any should be barred from trading to those places, or forced to pay a great Fine for admition, that are willing to pay the Companies Duties, and submit to the Companies regulation and orders in other respects.</p>
               <p>Obj. 6. <hi>If all may be admitted as aforesaid, then such numbers of Shop-keepers and others would come into the Society of</hi> Merchants, <hi>as would by the Majority of Votes so much alter the Governours, Deputy and Assistants of the respective Companies, that Ignorant Persons would come into those ruling places, to the general prejudice of those Trades.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>For my own part, I am of Opinion that in relation to <hi>Trade, Shiping, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> it is one of the choicest and most prudent <hi>Acts</hi> that ever was made in <hi>England,</hi> and without which we had not now been <hi>Owners</hi> of one half of the <hi>Shiping,</hi> nor Trade, nor employed one half of the <hi>Sea-men</hi> which we do at present; but seeing time hath disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered some <hi>Inconveniencies</hi> in it, if not <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,</hi> which in my poor opinion do admit of an easie Amendment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and seeing that the whole <hi>Act</hi> is not approved by una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous consent, I thought fit to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course a little concerning it, wherein, after my plain method I shall lay down such Objections as I have met with, and subjoyn my Answers, with such Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons as occur to my memory in confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of my own Opinion.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Objections</hi> against the whole <hi>Act</hi> are such as these,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 1. Some have told me, That I on all occasions magnifie the <hi>Dutch
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:51653:93"/>
policy</hi> in relation to their Trade, and the <hi>Dutch</hi> have no <hi>Act of Navigation,</hi> and therefore they are certainly not always in the right, as to the understanding of their true Interest in Trade, or else we are in the wrong in this.</p>
               <p>I answer, I am yet to be informed where the <hi>Dutch</hi> have missed their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Interest in Trade, but that which is fit for one Nation to do in relation to their Trade, is not fit for all, no more then the same Policy is necessary to a prevailing Army that are Masters of the Field, to an Army of less force, then to be able to encounter their Enemy at all times and places: The <hi>Dutch by reason of their great Stocks, low Interest, multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Merchants and Shiping, are Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the Field in Trade, and therefore have no need to build Castles, Fortresses and places of Retreat</hi>; such I account Laws of limitation, and securing of particular Trades to the <hi>Natives</hi> of any Kingdom; because they, viz. the <hi>Dutch,</hi> may be well assured, <hi>That no Nation can enter in common with them in any Trade, to gain Bread by it, while their own use of Money is at</hi> 3 per Cent, <hi>and others at</hi> 6 per Cent <hi>and upwards,</hi> &amp;c. Whereas if we should
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:51653:93"/>
suffer their Shiping in common with ours in those Trades, which are secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the <hi>English</hi> by <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Navigation,</hi> they must necessarily in a few Years, for the Reasons above-said, eat us quite out of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 2. The second <hi>Objection</hi> to the whole <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t</hi> is; Some will confess that as to <hi>Merchants</hi> and <hi>Owners of Ships the A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t of Navigation is eminently benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial,</hi> but say, that <hi>Merchants</hi> and <hi>Owners</hi> are but an inconsiderable number of men in respect of the whole <hi>Nation,</hi> and that Interest of the greater number, that our <hi>Native Commodities</hi> and <hi>Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures</hi> should be taken from us at the best rates, and foreign Commodities sold us at the cheapest, with admission of <hi>Dutch Merchants</hi> and <hi>Shiping in common with the English,</hi> by my own implication would effect.</p>
               <p>My answer is, That I cannot deny but this may be true, if the present profit of the generality be barely and singly considered; but this <hi>Kingdom</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an <hi>Island,</hi> the defence whereof hath alwayes been our <hi>Shiping</hi> and <hi>Sea-men,</hi> it seems to me <hi>absolutely necessary that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and Power ought joyntly to be considered,</hi>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:51653:94"/>
and if so, I think none can deny but the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Navigation</hi> hath and doth occasion building and employing of three times the number of <hi>Ships</hi> and <hi>Sea-men,</hi> that otherwise we should or would do, and that consequently, <hi>If our Force at Sea were so greatly impared, it would expose us to the receiving of all kind of Injuries and Affronts f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 1. <hi>The Inhabitants and Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of our Plantations in</hi> America, <hi>say, This Act will in time ruin their Plantations, if they may not be permitted, at least to carry their Sugars to the best Markets, and not be compell'd to send all to, and receive all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities from</hi> England.</p>
                  <p>I answer, <hi>If they were not kept to the Rules of the Act of Navigation, the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence would be, that in a few Years the benefit of them would be wholly lost to the Nation</hi>; it being agreeable to the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:51653:94"/>
of the <hi>Dutch, Danes, French, Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards, Portugals,</hi> and <hi>all Nations in the World,</hi> to keep their external <hi>Provinces</hi> and <hi>Colonies</hi> in a subjection unto, and dependency upon their Mother-King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and if they should not do so, the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who as I have said, are <hi>Masters</hi> of the Field in Trade, would carry away the greatest of advantage by the Plantations, of all the <hi>Princes</hi> in <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom,</hi> leaving us and others only the trouble of breeding men, and sending them abroad to cultivate the Ground, and have Bread for their Industry.</p>
                  <p>Here by the way, with entire sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to the greater Wisdom of those whom it much more concerns, give me leave to Query, <hi>Whether, instead of the late prohibition of</hi> Irish <hi>Cattle, it would not have been more for the benefit of this Kingdom of</hi> England, <hi>to suffer the</hi> Irish <hi>to bring into</hi> England <hi>not only their live Cattle, but also all other Commodities of the Growth or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture of that Kingdom, Custom free, or on easie Customs, and to prohibit them from Trading homeward or outward with the</hi> Dutch, <hi>or our own Plantations, or any other places, except the Kingdom of</hi> England? <hi>Most certainly such a Law would in a few

Years wonderfully encrease the Trade, Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Riches of this Nation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Query 2. <hi>Would not this be a good additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Act of Navigation, and much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease the employment of</hi> English <hi>Shiping and Sea-men, as well in bringing from thence all the Commodities of that Country, as sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying that Country with Deals, Salt, and all other foreign Commodities which now they have from the</hi> Dutch?</p>
                  <p>Que. 3. <hi>Would not this be a means effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to prevent the Exportation of</hi> Irish <hi>Wool, which now goes frequently into</hi> France <hi>and</hi> Holland, <hi>to the manifest and great damage both of</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Ireland?</p>
                  <p>Que. 4 <hi>Would not this be a Fortress or Law to secure to us the whole Trade of</hi> Ireland?</p>
                  <p>Que. 5. <hi>Would not this render that which now diminisheth, and seems dangerous to the value of Lands in</hi> England, <hi>viz. the growth of</hi> Ireland <hi>advantagious, by encrease of Trade and Shiping, and consequently the power of this Kingdom</hi>?</p>

The second <hi>Ojection</hi> to part of the <hi>Act of Navigation,</hi> is usually made by the <hi>Eastland</hi> and <hi>Norway Merchants,</hi> who affirm, that in effect their Trade is much declined since the passing the <hi>Act of Navigation</hi>; and the <hi>Danes, Sweeds, Holsteners,</hi> and all <hi>Easterlings,</hi> who by

                  <p>I answer, If the <hi>Commodity</hi> should be somewhat dearer for the present, it would be no loss to the <hi>Nation</hi> in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, because all <hi>Freight</hi> would be paid to <hi>English men</hi>; whereas the <hi>freight</hi> paid to <hi>Strangers</hi> (which upon those Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities is commonly as much or more then the value of Goods) is all clear loss to the <hi>Nation.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. V. Concerning Transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Debts.</head>
               <p>THE great Advantage that would accrue to this <hi>Kingdom by a Law for Transferring Bills of Debt,</hi> from one person to another, is sufficiently under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood by most Men, especially by <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The difficulty seems not to be so much in making of a Law to this purpose, as reducing it to practice, because we have been so long accustomed to buy and sell Goods by verbal Contracts only, that Rich and Great Men for some time will be apt to think it a Diminution of their Reputation, to have Bills under their Hands and Seals demanded of them for Goods bought; and meaner Men will fear the loosing of their Customers, by insisting upon having such Bills for what they sell, which Inconveniency proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly

               <p>The <hi>Objections</hi> I have met with to the making such a Law are, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Object. 1. <hi>This would be repugnant to our common Law, and some Statutes,</hi> viz. <hi>Maintenance, Champarty, Bankrupt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I answer, not so repugnant as at first view it seems to be, for though by our Laws at present, <hi>Bonds and Bills</hi> cannot be <hi>Assigned, Mortgages</hi> (which are but another kind of Security for Money lent) may be Assigned.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If any Laws at present are repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the common good of the Nation, and if the making of such a new Law
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:51653:102"/>
will effectually encrease the useful Stock of the Nation, at least one third part, and greatly ease the course of Trade, as I humbly conceive this will do, I hope none will deny but it may consist with the Wisdom of <hi>Parliament</hi> to create new Laws.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Most of our Statutes were made in times before we understood Trade in <hi>England,</hi> and the same Policy and Laws that were good then, and may yet be good for a Country destitute of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, may not be so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>it for us now, nor for any Nation so abounding with Trade as <hi>England</hi> doth at present.</p>
               <p>Object. 2. <hi>May not this occasion many Cheats and Law Suites?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. I answer no, Experience ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifests the contrary, not only in other Kingdoms and Countries abroad where Transferrance of Bills of Debt is in use, but even in our own where we have for many Ages had the Experience of <hi>Indorsment on Bills of Exchange,</hi> and in this present Age of the <hi>passing of Gold-Smiths Notes</hi> from one Man to another, which two practices are very like to the designed way of Transferring Bills of
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:51653:102"/>
Debt, and yet no considerable Cheats or Inconveniencies have arisen thereby.</p>

               <p>Object. 3. <hi>Will not such a Law as this be very troubl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I answer, this Law will not at all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comode Gentlemen as to what they Buy in Shops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> neither those that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse in Fairs and Markets; for that which Gentlemen Buy in Shops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and others in Fairs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they either pay or promise ready Money, or else say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the time or payment, which the Law understands to be the same with
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:51653:103"/>
a promise of present pay; so that if they give no Bills, there is no penalty at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends the neglect or refusal, but only that the contract between the Buyer and Seller shall be presumed in the Law to be as if it were made for ready Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</p>

               <p>THat an <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Naturalization</hi> of Strangers would tend to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of Trade, and encrease of the value of the Lands of this Kingdom, is now so generally owned and assented to, by all degrees of men amongst us, that I doubt not but a short time will produce some <hi>Act</hi> or <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> to that purpose.</p>
               <p>I have therefore thought it not imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to note some few Particulars, which if not warily prevented, may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive us of the greatest part of the Fruit hoped for by so good a design, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1st, <hi>The Priviledges of encorporated Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Towns.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2dly, <hi>More especially the Societies of Artificers and Trades-men belonging to some
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:51653:108"/>
Cities and Towns Corporate, such as Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, Coopers, and many others, who by vertue of their Charters, pretend to Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Iurisdiction, not only to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most extent of the Liberties of their respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Cities and Towns, but to the distance of ten Miles about them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>That branch of the Statute of</hi> 5<hi>th of</hi> Elizabeth, <hi>which enacts, That none shall use any manual Occupation that hath not served an Apprenticeship thereunto, upon which Statute it hath been usual to indict Strangers, work-men that have exercised their Callings in the out-parts of</hi> London.</p>
               <p>Upon this point of <hi>Naturalization,</hi> many men make a great doubt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be for publick good to permit the <hi>Iews</hi> to be Naturalized in common with other Strangers.</p>
               <p>Those that are against their admission, who for the most part are <hi>Merchants,</hi> urge these Reasons;</p>
               <p n="1">1. They say the <hi>Iews</hi> are a subtil People, prying into all kind of Trades, and thereby depriving the English <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant</hi> of that Profit he would otherwise gain.</p>
               <p n="2">2 They are a penurious People, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving miserably, and therefore can, and
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:51653:109"/>
do afford to trade for less profit then the <hi>English,</hi> to the prejudice of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Merchant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. They bring no Estates with them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but set up with their Pens and Ink on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and if after some few Years they thrive and grow rich, they carry away their Riches with them to some other Country (being a People that cannot mix with us) which Riches being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away) is a publick loss to this Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Those that are for the admission of the <hi>Iews,</hi> say in answer to the aforesaid Reasons, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1<hi>st,</hi> The subtiller the <hi>Iews</hi> are, and the more Trades they pry into while they live here, the more they are like to encrease <hi>Trade,</hi> and the more they do that, the better it is for the <hi>Kingdom</hi> in general, though the worse for the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Merchant,</hi> who comparitively to the rest of the People of <hi>England</hi> is not one of a thousand.</p>
               <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> The thriftier they live, the better Example to our people; <hi>there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing in the World more conducing to enrich a Kingdom then thriftiness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:51653:109"/>3<hi>dly,</hi> It is denyed that they bring over nothing with them; for many have brought hither very good Estates, and hundreds more would do the like, and settle here for their Lives, and their Posterities after them, if they had the same Freedom and Security here as they have in <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> where the <hi>grand Duke of Tuscaney,</hi> and other <hi>Princes</hi> allow them not only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Liberty and Security, but give them the priviledge of making Laws a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themselves; and that they would reside with us, is proved from the known Principles of Nature, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Principle 1. <hi>All men by Nature are alike, as I have before demonstrated, and Mr</hi> Hobbs <hi>hath truly asserted, how Erroneous soever he may be in other things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Princip. 2. <hi>Fear is the cause of Hatred and hatred of separation from, as well as evil Deeds to the Parties or Government hated, when opportunity is offered: This by the way shews the difference between a bare connivence at Dissenters in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and a toleration by Law; the former keeps them continually in Fear, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently apt to Sedition and Rebellion, when any probable occasion of success presents:
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:51653:110"/>
The latter disarms cunning, ambitious mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, who wanting a popular discontented Party to work upon, can effect little or nothing to the prejudice of the Government. And this methinks discovers clearly the Cause why the</hi> Lutherans <hi>in</hi> Germany, Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants <hi>in</hi> France, Greeks <hi>in</hi> Turkey, <hi>and</hi> Sectaries <hi>in</hi> Holland <hi>are such quiet peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able-minded-men, while our</hi> Non-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists <hi>in</hi> England <hi>are said to be encli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to Strife, War and Bloodshed; Take away the Cause, and the Effect will cease.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>While the Laws are in Force against men, they think the Sword hangs over their Heads, and are always in fear</hi> (though the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be suspended) <hi>not knowing how soon Councils, or Counsellors, Times or Persons may change,</hi> it is only <hi>Perfect Love that casts out Fear</hi>; and all men are in love with <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Security</hi>: It cannot be denyed that the industrious <hi>Bees</hi> have Stings, (though Drones have not) yet <hi>Bees sting not, except those that hurt them, or disturb their Hives.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is said, the <hi>Iews</hi> cannot Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marry with us, and therefore it cannot be supposed they will reside long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us, although they were treated
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:51653:110"/>
never so kindly; why not reside here as well as in <hi>Italy, Poland</hi> or <hi>Holland</hi>; they have now no Country of their own to go to, and therefore that is their Country, and must needs be so esteemed by them, where they are best used, and have the greatest Security.</p>

               <p>THat <hi>Wool</hi> is eminently the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>English</hi> Riches, I have not heard denyed by any, and that therefore all possible means ought to be used to keep it within our own <hi>Kingdom,</hi> is generally confessed, and to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose most of our modern <hi>Parliaments</hi> have strenuously endeavoured the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving of severe Laws to prevent its Exportation, and the last <hi>Act</hi> made it <hi>Felony</hi> to Ship out <hi>Wool, Woolfels,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding which, we see that
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:51653:111"/>
                  <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Irish Wool</hi> goes over so plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully, that it is within a very small mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as cheap in <hi>Holland</hi> as in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The means to prevent this Evil, by additional Penal Laws, and alterations of some of those now in being, were long under debate, by his <hi>Majesties</hi> command in the <hi>Cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cil of Trade,</hi> who according to their duty, took great pains therein; and since, I have been informed the same things were under consideration in <hi>Parliament,</hi> so that I doubt not, but in due time we shall see some more effectual Laws enacted to this purpose, as well in relation to <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> (from whence the greatest of this mischief proceeds) as in <hi>England,</hi> then ever yet have been; yet I do utterly despair of ever seeing this Disease per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly cured till the Causes thereof be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, which I take to be;</p>
               <p n="1">1st, <hi>He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ghth of Interest in England,</hi> which an Abatement by Law to 4 <hi>per Cent</hi> would cure.</p>
               <p n="2">2dly, <hi>Want of Hands,</hi> which an Act of Naturalization would cure.</p>
               <p n="3">3dly, <hi>Compulsion in matters of Religion,</hi> which some relaxation of the <hi>Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Laws, I hope would effectually cure.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:51653:111"/>For while our Neighbours, through the cheap valuation of their Stocks, can afford to trade, and disburse their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies for less profit then we, as hath been I think sufficiently demonstrated by the fore-going Discourse, and have more Hands to employ then we, by reason of the large Immunities and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges they give both to Natives and Foreigners, there is no question but they will be able to give a better Price for our <hi>Wool,</hi> than we can afford our selves; and they that can give the best price for a Commodity shall never fail to have it, by one means or other, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the opposition of any Laws, or interposition of any Power by Sea or Land; of such force, subtilty and violence is the general course of Trade.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But some may say, and take it as well from what I have writ else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, as from their own Observations, Will not the well-making of our <hi>Woollen-Manufactures,</hi> contribute much to the keeping of our <hi>Wool</hi> naturally within our own Kingdom.</p>
               <p>I answer; Doubtless it will have a great tendency thereunto, but can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver effect it, till the aforesaid Radical
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:51653:112"/>
Causes of this Disease be removed, which brings me to the next Question, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What will improve our Woollen-Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures in quality and quantity?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a very great Question, and requires very deliberate and serious Consideration, but I shall write my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Thoughts concerning it, desiring those <hi>Gentlemen's</hi> pardon, from whom I may differ in Opinion, having this to say for my self, that I do it not rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this being a business that I have many Years considered of, and that not solitari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but upon converse with the most skilful men in our several <hi>English Woollen</hi> Manufactures</p>
               <p n="1">1. Then I say, <hi>Those three fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Particulars which will naturally keep our Wool at home, will as naturally encrease our Woollen-Manufactures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Negatively, <hi>I think that very few of our Laws now in force to this purpose</hi> (though our Statute-Books are replenished with many) <hi>have any tendency thereunto, nor any thing I have yet seen in Print</hi>; For,</p>
               <p n="1">1<hi>st,</hi> All our Laws relating to the <hi>Aulnegeors</hi> duty, every body knows sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie nothing to the encrease, or well-making our <hi>Manufactures,</hi> but are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chargeable and prejudicial.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:51653:112"/>2<hi>dly,</hi> All our Laws that oblige our People to the making of strong, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial (and as we call it, Loyal) Cloth of a certain length, breadth and weight, if they were duly put in Execution, would in my opinion do more hurt than good, because the Humors and Fashions of the World change, and at sometimes in some places (as now in most) slight cheap light Cloth will sell more plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and better, than that which is hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier, stronger and truer wrought; and <hi>If we intend to have the Trade of the World, we must imitate the</hi> Dutch, <hi>who make the worst as well as the best of all Manufactures, that we may be in a capacity of serving all Markets, and all Humors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> I conclude all our Laws limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the number of <hi>Loomes</hi> numbered, or kind of Servants, and Times of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to be certainly prejudicial to the cloathing of the Kingdom in general, though they be advantagious to some particular Men or Places, who first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured those Laws of Restriction and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation.</p>
               <p n="4">4<hi>thly,</hi> I think all those Laws are Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial, that prohibit a <hi>Weaver</hi> from being a Fuller, Tucker or Dyar, or a Fuller or Tucker from keeping a Loome.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:51653:113"/>5<hi>thly,</hi> I conculde that stretching of <hi>Cloth</hi> by <hi>Tentors,</hi> though it be sometimes prejudicial to the Cloth, is yet absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly necessary to the Trade of <hi>England,</hi> and that the excess of straining cannot be certainly limitted by any Law, but must be left to the Sellers or Exporters discretion, who best knows what will please his Customers beyond the Seas; besides, if we should wholly prohibit <hi>straining of Cloth,</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi> (as they have often done) would buy our unstrained <hi>Cloth,</hi> and carry it into <hi>Holland,</hi> and there strain it to six or seven Yards <hi>per</hi> piece more in length, and make it look a little better to the Eye, and after that carry it abroad to <hi>Turkey,</hi> and other Markets, and there beat us out of Trade with our own Weapons.</p>
               <p>But some may then ask me, Whether I think it would be for the advantage of the Trade of <hi>England,</hi> to leave all men at liberty to make what <hi>Cloth</hi> and <hi>Stuffs</hi> they please, how they will, where and when they will, of any lengths or sizes?</p>
               <p>I answer; Yes, certainly in my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it would be so, except such Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies only as his <hi>Majesty</hi> &amp; the <hi>Parliament</hi>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:51653:113"/>
shall think fit to make <hi>Staples,</hi> as suppose <hi>Colchester Baye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, Perpetuanoes, Cheanyes,</hi> and some other sorts of <hi>Norwich Stuffs</hi> to be allowed the honour of a <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Seal,</hi> by which to be bought and sold here, and beyond Seas, as if it were upon the publick Faith of <hi>England</hi>; and where-ever such Seal is allowed, or shall be thought fit to be affixed to any Commodity, I would desire the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity should be exactly made accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Institution, and always kept to its certain length, breadth and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
               <p>But in case any shall make of the said Commodities worse then the Institution, I think it would be most for the publick advantage to impose no Penalty upon them, but only deny them the benefit and reputation of the publick Seal, to such <hi>Bayes</hi> or <hi>Stuffs</hi> as shall be so insuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient; which in my opinion would be punishment enough to those that should make worse than the Standard, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage enough to those that should keep to it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For all <hi>Cloth</hi> and <hi>Stuffs</hi> not being made <hi>Staples,</hi> I think it would be of very great use that the Makers did weave
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:51653:114"/>
in their Marks, and affix their own Seals, containing the length and breadth of the Pieces (as hath been provided in some Statutes) and that no Maker un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der severe Penalties shall use another Mark or Seal, with such Penalty to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>marker</hi> or <hi>seller,</hi> whose <hi>Cloth</hi> or <hi>Stuffs</hi> shall not contain the length and breadth set upon the Seal, as his <hi>Majesty</hi> and the <hi>Parliament</hi> shall think fit.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If the <hi>makers</hi> of all <hi>Stuffs</hi> whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever for Exportation, whether <hi>Staples</hi> or not (which are commonly sold by the Piece, and not by the Yard or Ell) were obliged to make them no shorter than antiently they have been made; the particular lengths of each sort whereof might be provided for, and expressed in the <hi>Act,</hi> this good effect would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low upon it, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At all <hi>foreign Markets,</hi> where we pay a great <hi>Custom</hi> by the Piece, according to the Books of Rates, currant in the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Countries, we should pay but the same <hi>Custom</hi> abroad for a piece of full length, which now we do for one that is shorter: Notwithstanding, I conceive it would be expedient to leave it to the makers discretion, to make their pieces as much longer as they please.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IX. Concerning the Ballance of Trade.</head>
               <p>THat the Greatness of this <hi>Kingdom</hi> depends upon Foreign Trade, is acknowledged, and therefore the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest of Trade not unbecoming Persons of the highest Rank; and of this Study, as well as others, it may be said, there's an infinite in it, none, though of the largest Intelects and Experience, being able to fathom its utmost depth.</p>
               <p>Among other things relating to Trade, their hath been much discourse of the <hi>Ballance</hi> of <hi>Trade</hi>; the right understanding whereof may be of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular use and serve as a Compass to Stear by, in the Contemplations and Propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Trade for publick Advantage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Ballance of Trade is commonly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood two ways.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Generally, <hi>something whereby it may
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:51653:115"/>
be known whether this Kingdom gaineth or loseth by Foreign Trade.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Particularly, <hi>something whereby we may know by what Trades this Kingdom gaines, and by what Trades it loseth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the first of these.</p>
               <p>It is the most general received opinion, and that not ill grounded, that this <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance</hi> is to be taken by a strict Scrutiny of what proportion the value of the Commodities exported out of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom bear, to those Imported; <hi>and if the Exports exceeds the Imports,</hi> it is conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the <hi>Nation</hi> gets by the general course of its <hi>Trade,</hi> it being supposed that the over-plush is Imported in <hi>Bulloin,</hi> and so adds to the Treasure of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; <hi>Gold and Silver being taken for the measure and standard of Riches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. This Rule is not only commonly applyed to the general course of Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Trade, but to particular Trades to and from this Nation to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Now although this notion have much of truth in it, was ingeniously and worthily started by him that first pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished it; and much good hath accrued to the Kingdom by our Law-makers
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:51653:115"/>
(<hi>Noble men and Gentlemen</hi>) resenting it, yet if the difficulty of the Scrutiny whereby to reduce it into practice, and the many Accidents that may accrue, be seriously weighed, it will appear too doubtful and uncertain as to our general Trade, and in reference to particular Trades fallible and erroneous.</p>
               <p>That it will not hold as to Foreign Trade in general appears;</p>
               <p n="1">1. From the difficulty and impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of taking a true account, as well of the quantity, as of the value of Commodities Exported and Imported.</p>
               <p>The general rule for this hath been the <hi>Custom-House-Books,</hi> but that they cannot be in any measure certain will easily be granted, for,</p>
               <p n="1">1. As to the quantity, if it be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that many fine Commodities of small bulk and great value, as <hi>Points, Laces, Ribands, fine Lennen, Silks, Iewels,</hi> &amp;c. are Im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ported by stealth; &amp; that also in many <hi>out-Ports</hi> and <hi>Creeks</hi> of <hi>England</hi> &amp; <hi>Wales,</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of bulk are both Imported and Exported often-times by indirect means, that never are Registred, besides also of what is entered, there may be (though not considerable in <hi>London</hi>) yet in other parts
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:51653:116"/>
much difference in the quantities and qualities.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As to the value, how shall the compute be made, seeing the rates of the <hi>Customs</hi> are in no kind proportina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, our own Commodities being some rated very low, as <hi>Drapery, Silk-Wares, Haberdashery,</hi> and all <hi>Manufactures</hi> of <hi>Iron:</hi> Others high, as <hi>Lead</hi> and <hi>Tin</hi>; and <hi>Fish in</hi> English <hi>Shiping nothing</hi>; and for <hi>Foreign Commodities</hi> Imported, the rates are yet more unequal, so that the value rated for the <hi>Customs</hi> cannot be a due measure.</p>
               <p>Besides, <hi>Foreign Commodities</hi> Imported by <hi>English Shiping,</hi> should be valued only at their first Cost and Charges aboard, and those by <hi>Foreign Shiping,</hi> with the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of the home-ward Freight.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From the many Accidents that fall out in Trade, without the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge whereof a right <hi>Ballance</hi> cannot be made, as,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Accidents that diminish the Stock sent out, as losses at Sea, bad Markets, Bankrupt, also Consiscations, Seisures and Arrests, which fall out often on se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral occasions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:51653:116"/>Now if by any of these or such like the original Stock comes to be impai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and lessened, the value of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities</hi> Imported in return, may be far less then the value of the <hi>Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> Exported, and yet may be the full product, and so the <hi>Nation</hi> no Gainer, though the Exports were more in value then the Imports.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Accidents whereby the Stock sent out, comes to be extraordinarily advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in Sale abroad, from whence it may fall out, that the Commodities Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in return, may appear to be of a much greater value then the Commodities Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, and yet be no more then the real produce of them, and so the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on no loser, but a Gainer thereby, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Imports exceeds the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports.</p>
               <p>And if the afore-cited Instances suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice not to prove the uncertainty (in some cases) of this Notion of <hi>the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of Trade,</hi> the following Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of <hi>Ireland, Virginia</hi> and <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> are so pregnant to this case, as I think will convince any Man: For those three Countries do without doubt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port Annually a far greater value of
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:51653:117"/>
the Commodities of their native growth and product, then is Imported to them from hence, or from any Foreign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and yet they are not such great Gainers, but continue Poor; the true reason whereof as to <hi>Ireland,</hi> is given by the most Ingenious <hi>Author</hi> of that <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise of Taxes and Contributions,</hi> Page 27. where he saith, <hi>That a great part of Estates both real and personal in</hi> Ireland, <hi>are owned by Absentees, and such as draw over the Profits raised out of</hi> Ireland, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>funding nothing</hi>; so as <hi>Ireland</hi> Exporting more then it Imports, doth yet grow Poorer to a Paradox.</p>
               <p>Here let me glaunce at my old Theme, and desire the <hi>Reader</hi> to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der seriously, whether it may not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly be said of all Kingdoms and Countries, where the <hi>Interest of Money</hi> runs higher then their Neighbours, that a part of their Estates are owned by <hi>Absentees,</hi> and consequently they shall be sure to be kept Poor, whether their Importations or their Exportations exceed.</p>
               <p>This likewise resolves a Question that was once put to me by an <hi>Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble person</hi> concerning the <hi>County of Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:51653:117"/>
which notwitstanding the great quantity of <hi>Tin</hi> and <hi>Pilchards,</hi> which Annually the <hi>Inhabitants</hi> are sending forth from their two Mines of Land and Sea, yet that <hi>Country</hi> still remains in a poor condition; <hi>The reason</hi> whereof to me seems clearly to be, <hi>because a great part of the Stock imployed in the aforesaid great Trade, is taken up at Interest, and consequently owned by</hi> Londoners, <hi>and other</hi> Absentees.</p>
               <p>And though it may be hoped that this is not yet the case of <hi>England,</hi> yet it is a demonstration that the notion of take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Ballance</hi> this way, is not abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, and in all places, and under all circumstances, without exception true &amp; good; for in case the Trade of <hi>England</hi> should be carried on by <hi>Absentees,</hi> then the supposi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ion upon which this Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is groun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed, (<hi>viz.</hi> that when the Exports over Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lance the Imports, the Surplusage is returned into <hi>England</hi> in <hi>Bulloin</hi>) will prove a mistake, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary will be true, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plusage will be conveighed into Foreign parts, to the places of the residence of such <hi>Absentees.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:51653:118"/>2. The second thing I am to Illustrate is, that this rule (barely considered) is fallible and erroneous, as to particular and distinct Trades.</p>
               <p>This will appear, if it be considered, that a true measure of any particular Trade, as to the profit or loss of the Nation thereby, cannot be taken by the consideration of such Trade in it self singlely, but as it stands in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and is subservient to the general Trade of the Kingdom; for it may so fall out that there may be some places to which little of our <hi>English Manufactures</hi> are Exported, and yet the Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties we have from thence, may be so necessary to the carrying on our Trade in general, or some other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Trades, that without them the Nation would greatly decline and decay in Trade.</p>
               <p>Now in this case, if we should mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure such a particular Trade by the aforesaid Notion of the Ballance, we should find the Imports abundantly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the Exports, and so be ready to conclude against such a Trade as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive, whereas (notwithstanding)
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:51653:118"/>
it may in truth, be a very necessary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial Trade, and to the very great advantage of the Nation; as for instance,</p>
               <p>The Trade of <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Norway,</hi> the <hi>Imports</hi> from whence are certainly many times the value of our Native Commodities exported thither, and yet it cannot be denied but that Trade is advantagious to the Kingdom, not only because it gives, or would give employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to two Hundred, or three Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Sail of <hi>English Shiping (if we did a little mend our Act of Navigation)</hi> but principally because the Commodities imported from thence, as Timber, Pitch, Deals and Tar, are of such ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary use, in order to the building and supplying our Shiping, that without them other Trades could not be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on.</p>
               <p>It will not be denied by the honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>East-India Company,</hi> but they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port much more Goods into <hi>England,</hi> than they export, &amp; that to purchase the same, they carry out quantities of Gold &amp; Silver annually; yet no man that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands any thing of the Trade of the World, will affirm, that <hi>England</hi> loseth

by that Trade. The <hi>Dutch</hi> with good reason esteem the trade of the <hi>East-Indies</hi> more profitable to them than are the Mines of Gold and Silver in <hi>America</hi> to the <hi>King of Spain</hi>; and if the <hi>English Companies</hi> were vested by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament with so much Authority as the <hi>Dutch</hi> have, and thereby encouraged to drive as full a Trade thither, as the <hi>Dutch</hi> do, I doubt not but it would be so (not so much to the private gain of the Members of that Company) as the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick profit of this Kingdom in general; however as it is, it will not be difficult to prove that it is the most beneficial Trade this Nation drives at present; For,</p>
               <p n="1">1<hi>st,</hi> That trade constantly employes twenty five to thirty Sail of the most War-like Ships in <hi>England,</hi> with Sixty to a Hundred Men in each Ship, and may in two or three Years more employ a greater Number; and in order to the carrying on that Trade, that <hi>Company</hi> hath lately (unconstrained) given con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Encouragements for the building of great Ships, which hath had good effect.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:51653:119"/>2<hi>dly,</hi> It supplies the Nation constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and fully, with that (in this Age) necessary material of <hi>Salt-Petre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> It employs the Nation for its Consumption, with <hi>Pepper, Indico, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licoes,</hi> and <hi>several useful Drugs,</hi> near the value of 150000 <hi>l.</hi> to 180000 <hi>l. per An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4<hi>thly,</hi> It furnished us with <hi>Pepper, Cowryes, Long-Cloth, and other Callicoes</hi> and <hi>painted Stuffs,</hi> proper for the Trade of <hi>Turkey, Italy, Spain, France</hi> and <hi>Guiny,</hi> to the amount of 2 or 300000 <hi>l. per Annum</hi>; most of which Trades we could not carry on with any conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable advantage; but for those supplies, and <hi>these Goods exported do produce in fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign parts, to be returned to</hi> England, <hi>six times the Treasure in Specie, that the Company exports from hence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, if not only the aforesaid ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages be seriously considered, but also what detriment the <hi>Nation</hi> would sustain, if we were deprived of those supplies, both in point of Strength and War-like Provisions, in regard of Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and <hi>Salt-Petre,</hi> but also in respect of the furtherance it gives to many other Trades before-mentioned, it will easily
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:51653:120"/>
appear that this Trade, though its Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports exceeds its Exports, is the most advantagious Trade to <hi>England,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves all encouragement; for were we to buy all our <hi>Pepper</hi> and <hi>Callicoes,</hi> &amp;c. of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> they would raise our <hi>Pepper (which now stands the Nation but about</hi> 3 <hi>d. per pound in India</hi>) to, or near the proportion which they have advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced on <hi>Nutmegs, Cloves</hi> and <hi>Mace,</hi> (which cost the <hi>Dutch</hi> not much more <hi>per pound</hi> in <hi>India</hi> than <hi>Pepper</hi>) since they engrossed the Trade for those Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities; and the use of <hi>Callico</hi> in <hi>England</hi> would be supplied by foreign Linnen at greater Prices; so that what may be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured from this Nation's consumption, would in probability cost them above 400000 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> more then now it doth; and our foreign Trades for <hi>Italy, Guiny,</hi> &amp;c. would in part decay for want of the afore-said supplies.</p>
               <p>There is another Notion concerning the <hi>Ballance of Trade,</hi> which I think not impertinent here to take notice of, <hi>viz.</hi> Some are of opinion, that the way to know whether the <hi>Nation</hi> gets or loseth in the general by its fore-going Trade, is to take an inspection into the course
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:51653:120"/>
of the <hi>Exchange,</hi> is generally above the intrinsick value or <hi>Par</hi> of the <hi>Coins</hi> of foreign Countries, we not only lose by such <hi>Exchanges,</hi> but the same is a demonstration that we lose by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral course of our foreign Trade; and that we require more supply of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities from abroad, than our exports in Goods do serve to purchase: And certain it is, that when once the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change</hi> comes to be 5 or 6 <hi>per Cent</hi> above the true value of foreign Monies, our Treasure would be carried out, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Laws should be made to prevent it; and on the contrary, when the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change</hi> is generally below the true value of the foreign <hi>Coins,</hi> it is an evidence that our Exports do in value exceed what we require from abroad: And so if the <hi>Exchange</hi> comes to be 5 or 6 <hi>per Cent</hi> below the true value of the foreign Coins, returns will be made for <hi>England</hi> in the Coins of foreign Countries.</p>
               <p>Now, that there is also a great deal of truth in this Notion, is not to be denied, and that the diligent observance and consideration of the course of the <hi>Exchange,</hi> may be of use, and very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary in many respects, and is a very

               <p>Thus having demonstrated that these Notions, touching the Ballance of Trad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I answer; <hi>fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>st,</hi> The best and most certain discovery, to my apprehension, is to be made from the encrease or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution of our <hi>Trade</hi> and <hi>Shiping</hi> in general; for if our Trade and Shiping diminish, whatever profit particular men may make, the <hi>Nation</hi> undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loseth; and on the contrary, <hi>if our Trade and Shiping encrease,</hi> how small or low soever the profits are to private
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:51653:121"/>
men, it is an infallible Indication that the <hi>Nation</hi> in general thrives; for I dare affirm, and that Catagorically in all parts of the whole World, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Trade is great, and continues so, and grows daily more great, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth in Shiping, and that for a suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession not of a few Years, but of Ages, that Trade must be Nationally profitable.</p>
               <p>As a Town where only a Fair is kept, if every Year the number of People and Commodities do augment, that Town, however the Markets are, will gain; whereas, if there comes still fewer and fewer People and Commodities, that place will decline and decay. Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing once with a <hi>Noble Lord</hi> concerning this measure or method of knowing the <hi>Ballance</hi> of our Trade, or more plainly our general <hi>National</hi> gain or loss by <hi>Trade,</hi> his <hi>Lordship</hi> was pleased to oppose, by asking two very proper Questions, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> 1. Is there not a great simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude between the Affairs of a private Person, and of a Nation, the former being but a little Family, and the latter a great Family?</p>
               <p>I answer; Yes, certainly there is.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> 2. His <hi>Lordships</hi> second que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:51653:122"/>
was, May not a private <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant</hi> be, or seem to be owner of much Shiping, drive a great Trade, receive and send out many Goods, and yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline and grow poorer, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all his tumbling and busseling?</p>
               <p>I answer; Yes, certainly he may, but this will soon appear, either while he lives, or at his Death; and his great Trade will come to be but a sm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll one, or none at all: But that man who drives a great Trade, and is owner or employer of much Shiping, and doth all his dayes continue and encrease in Trade and Shiping, and his Son, or Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor after him, and after him his Grand Son, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this would be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disputable Evidence that that Person or Family did thrive by their Trade; for if they had not thriven, their Trade would not have long continued, much<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less encreased: This is the case of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and this through God's goodness is the case of <hi>England</hi> (as bad as we are at present.)</p>
               <p>The reason of this is as evident as the first, for <hi>where a great Trade is driven,</hi> especially where much Shiping is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, whatever becomes of the poor <hi>Merchant,</hi> that drives the Trade, <hi>Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:51653:122"/>
of People will be certain gainers,</hi> as his <hi>Majesty</hi> and his <hi>Officers of Custom,</hi> besides <hi>Shipwrights, Butchers, Brewers, Bakers, Rope-makers, Porters, Sea-men, Manufacturers, Car-men, Lighter-men, and all other Artificers, and People that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on Trade and Shiping,</hi> which indeed more or less the whole Kingdom doth.</p>
               <p>But it may be said again, <hi>If this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of Trade depend upon, and proceed from our ordinary Importations, for which our ready Money goes out, it will impoverish us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I answer, In some cases it may be so, and in some cases (as I have already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated) it may be otherwise, but that will best be known by the effects; for if we are impoverished, our general Trade and our Shiping will necessarily and visibly grow less and less, and must rationally and unavoidably do so; for that being impoverished, we shall lose our Tools (our Stock) to drive a great Trade with; whereas on the contrary, if our Trade in the gross bulk of it (though we may decline in some) do still encrease, especially our Shiping for a long tract of Years, it is infallible proof of our thriving by our Trade, and that we are still getting more Tools (more Stock) to trade with.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:51653:123"/>Some there are would limit this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery to the encrease and dimunition of our Coin and Bulloin, but because that is more secret and indiscernable, it cannot, I conceive, afford so clear a demonstration as the other, if any at all, for that Money seems to vulgar Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers most plentiful when there is least occasion for it; and on the contrary, more scarce, as the occasions for the employment thereof are more numerous and advantagious, according to which we should seem to have most Money when we have the least Trade, and yet then certainly the Nation gets least; this is apparent to those that will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve that when the <hi>East-India-Company</hi> have a great sale to make, then Money is generally found to be scarce in <hi>London,</hi> not that is so in reality more then at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times, but because that <hi>extraordinary</hi> occasion engageth men to employ quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities, which they provide and lay aside for that purpose; from the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son it is, that a high rate of Usury makes Money seems scarce, because eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man then, as soon as he can make up a small sum sends it into the <hi>Goldsmiths,</hi> whereof more is said before in the Preface to this discourse.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:51653:123"/>I answer, that though the Study of the <hi>Ballance</hi> of Trade in this last menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned respect be a Study very Ingenious and Commendable, yet in my poor opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, the enquiry, whether we get or lose, doth not so much deserve our greatest pains and care, as how we may be sure to get, the former being of no use but in order to the latter, and this therefore leads to the Consideration of the <hi>other Ballance</hi> of Trade, as most use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and necessary, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is to be done in</hi> England <hi>to improve the Trade thereof to such a degree as to equalize or over-ballance our Neighbours in our National Profit by our Foreign Trade</hi>?</p>
               <p>I answer, this is a large and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensive Question, and requires to resolve it, the greatest Skill and Experience both in affairs of State and Trade, and therefore I have only made an Essay to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it, which the whole Discourse fore-going is, (and therefore I hope the Reader will accept of my good Affection to my Country herein, though he meet not with that full satisfaction he might expect and wish for.)</p>
               <p>The method I propose for the further answering of this great Question, is,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:51653:124"/>
(following my own principle) that if Trade be great, and much <hi>English Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> employed, it will be good for the <hi>Nation</hi> in general, whatever it may be for private <hi>Merchants</hi>) First to lay down some general Rules for the enlargement of <hi>Trade</hi> in <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. To make it the Interest of others to Trade with us, we must be sure to furnish them at as cheap or cheaper Rates then any other Nation can or doth, and this I affirm can never be done without subdueing <hi>Vsury</hi> especially, and doing those other things before-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, that will conduce to the encrease of our Hands and Stock, for our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a condition to sell our Neighbours
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:51653:127"/>
cheaper then others, must be when it is principally an effect of many Hands and much Stock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But it may be said how shall we profit by this Rule of selling cheap to Foreigners, whereas the contrary is said to be the way to Riches, <hi>viz.</hi> to sell dear and buy cheap.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I answer, in a strict sence it may be so, for the private <hi>Merchant</hi>; but in this discourse I am designing how our publick National Trade may be so managed, that other Nations who are in Competition with us for the same, may not wrest it from us, but that ours may continue and encrease, to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution of theirs; if there were no others to wage with us, we might as the Proverb saith, make our own Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets; but as the case now stands, that all the World are striving to engross all the Trade they can, that other Proverb is very true and applicable, <hi>all covet, all lose.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The well contrivement and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement of Foreign Treaties, may very much contribute to the making it the Interest of other Nations to Trade with us, at least to the convincing of
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:51653:127"/>
Foreign <hi>Princes</hi> wherein, and how it is their Interest to Trade with us.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Publick Iustice and Honesty</hi> will make it the Interest of other Nations to Trade with us, that is, that when any Commodities pass under a publick com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Seal (which is in a kind the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Faith of the Nation) they may be exact in length, breadth and nature, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what they ought to be by their Seals.</p>
               <p>The like care ought to be taken for the true packing of our <hi>Herrings</hi> and <hi>Pilchards,</hi> (formerly mentioned.)</p>
               <p n="5">5. If we would engage other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to Trade with us, we must receive from them the Fruits and Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of their Countries, as well as send them ours, but <hi>its our Interest by Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and other means</hi> (not distastful) <hi>above all kinds of Commodities to prevent as much as may be, the Importation of Foreign Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. The <hi>Venetians</hi> being a People that take from us very little of our Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, have prohibited our <hi>English Cloth,</hi> and from whose Territories we receive great quantities of Currance, purchased with our ready Money; It

               </p>
               <p>The Trade for <hi>Cannary</hi>-Wines, I take to be a most pernitious Trade to <hi>England,</hi> because those <hi>Island</hi>

               </p>
               <p>I have in this last Discourse of the <hi>Ballance of Trade,</hi> as well as in my former, confined my self to write only general Heads and Principles that relate unto Trade in general, not this
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:51653:128"/>
or that particular Trade; because the several Trades, to several Countries, may require distinct and particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations, respecting the time, place, competitors with us and other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances to find out, wherein our advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages or disadvantages lie, and how to improve the former, and prevent the latter; but as this would be too great a Work for one Man, so I fear it would make this too great a Book to be well read and considered.</p>
               <p>But in the <hi>Preface</hi> to this Treatise, I have briefly mentioned many particular Trades that we have lost, and are loosing, and by what means, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Trades that we yet retain and are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing, and how it happens to be so, which may give some Light to a clearer Discovery and Inspection into particular Trades, unto which Ingenious Men that have Hearts to serve their <hi>Country</hi> in this (so necessary Work at this time) may add, and further improve, by the advantage of Abilities to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press their Sentiments in a more In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible and Pausible Stile; but when I and others have said all we can,

               <head>CHAP. X. Concerning PLANTATIONS.</head>
               <p>THE <hi>Trade</hi> of our <hi>English</hi> Plantations in <hi>America,</hi> being now of as great Bulk and Employing, as much Shiping as most of the Trades of this Kingdom, it seems not unnecessary to Discourse more at large concerning the Nature of <hi>Plantations,</hi> and the good or evil consequences of them in relation to this and other Kingdoms; and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther because some <hi>Gentlemen</hi> of no mean Capacities, are of Opinion that his <hi>Majestie's Plantations</hi> abroad, have very much prejudiced this <hi>Kingdom</hi> by drain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p n="1">1. First I agree, <hi>That Lands</hi> (though excellent) <hi>without Hands proportionable will not enrich any Kingdom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That whatever tends to the Depopu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating of a Kingdom, tends to the Impove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>That most Nations in the civilized Parts of the World, are more or less Rich or Poor proportionably to the Paucity or Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their People, and not to the Sterility or Fruitfulness of their Lands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>I do not agree that our People in</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>are in any considerable measure aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by reason of our Foreign Plantations; but propose to prove the contrary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>I am of Opinion, that we had imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately before the late Plague, many more
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:51653:130"/>
People in</hi> England <hi>then we had before the Inhabiting of</hi> Virginia, New-England, Barbadoes, <hi>and the rest of our</hi> American <hi>Plantations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>That all Colonies or Plantations do endamage their Mother-Kingdoms, whereof the Trades of such Plantations are not confined by severe Laws, and good executions of those Laws, to the Mother-Kingdom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>That the</hi> Dutch <hi>will reap the greatest advantage by all Colonies issuing from any Kingdom of</hi> Europe, <hi>whereof the Trades are not so strictly confined to the proper Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-Kingdoms.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>That the</hi> Dutch (though they thrive so exceedingly in Trade) <hi>will in probability never endamage this Kingdom by the growth of their Plantations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>That neither the</hi> French, Spaniard <hi>nor</hi> Portugeez <hi>are much to be feared on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,</hi> not for the same, <hi>but for other causes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. <hi>That it is more for the advantage of</hi> England, <hi>that</hi> New-found-Land <hi>should remain Vnplanted, then that Colonies should be sent or permitted to go thither to Inhabit, with a Governour, Laws,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="11">11. <hi>That</hi> New-England <hi>is the most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial Plantation to the Kingdom of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</p>

               <p>A Hundred other Instances of Fact might be given to the like purpose.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>II. Whatever tends to the populating of a Kingdom, tends to the emprovement of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The former <hi>Proposition</hi> being granted, I suppose this will not be denyed, and of the means (<hi>viz.</hi> good Laws) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:51653:131"/>
any Kingdom, may be populated, and consequently enriched, is in effect the substance and design of all my fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Discourse, to which, for avoiding repitition I must pray the Reader's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trospection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>III. That most Nations in the civilized parts of the World, are more or less Rich or Poor, propo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tionable to the paucity or plenty of their People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This third is a consequent of the two former Propositions; and the whole World is a witness to the Truth of it: <hi>The seven united Provinces are certainly the most populous tract of Land in</hi> Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, <hi>and for their bigness, undoubtedly the richest. England</hi> for its bigness, except our <hi>Forrests, Wastes</hi> and <hi>Commons,</hi> which by our own Laws and Customs are bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Improvement, I hope is yet a more populous Country than <hi>France,</hi> and consequently richer; I say, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to its bigness: <hi>Italy</hi> in like pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion more populous than <hi>France,</hi> and richer; and <hi>France</hi> more populous and rich than <hi>Spain,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <pb n="169" facs="tcp:51653:131"/>IV. I do not agree that our People in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> are in any considerable measure abated, by reason of our foreign Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, but propose to prove the contrary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This I know is a controverted Point, &amp; do believe that where there is one man of my mind, there may be a thousand of the contrary; but I hope when the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Grounds of my Opinion have been throughly examined, there will not be so many Dissenters.</p>
               <p>That very many People now go, and have gone from this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> almost every Year for these sixty Years past, and have and do settle in our <hi>foreign Plantations</hi> is most certain. But the first Question will be, <hi>Whether if</hi> England, <hi>had no foreign Plantations for those People to be transported unto, they could or would have stayed and lived at home with us?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I am of Opinion they neither would nor could.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To resolve this Question, we must consider what kind of <hi>People</hi> they were, and are, that have and do transport themselves to our foreign <hi>Plantations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>New-England</hi> (as every one knows) <hi>was originally inhabitated, and hath since suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:51653:132"/>
been replenisht by a sort of People called Puritans,</hi> which could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to the <hi>Ecclesiastical Laws of England,</hi> but being wearied with <hi>Church Censures and Persecutions,</hi> were forced to quit their Fathers Land, to find out new Habitations, as many of them did in <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> as well as at <hi>New-England</hi>; and had there not been a <hi>New-England</hi> found for some of them, <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> probably had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the rest: But <hi>Old</hi> England <hi>to be sure had lost them all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Virginia <hi>and</hi> Barbadoes <hi>were first peopled by a sort of loose vagrant People,</hi> vicious and destitute of means to live at home, (being either unfit for labour, or such as could find none to employ themselves about, or had so mis-behaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by Whoreing, Thieving, or other Debauchery, that none would set them on work) which <hi>Merchants</hi> and <hi>Masters</hi> of Ships by their Agents (<hi>or Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, as they were called</hi>) gathered up about the Streets of <hi>London,</hi> and other places, cloathed and transported, to be employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon <hi>Plantations</hi>; and these I say were such, as had there been no <hi>English</hi> foreign Plantation in the World, could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:51653:132"/>
never have lived at home to do Service for their Country, but must have come to be hanged or starved, or dyed untimely of some of those mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Diseases, that proceed from want and Vice; or else have sold themselves for Soldiers, to be knockt on the Head or starved in the Quarrels of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, as many thousands of brave <hi>English men</hi> were in the low Countries, as also in the Wars of <hi>Germany, France,</hi> and <hi>Sweeden,</hi> &amp;c. or else if they could, by begging, or otherwise, arrive to the Stock of 2 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> to waft them over to <hi>Holland,</hi> become Servants to the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who refuse none.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>principal growth</hi> and encrease of the afore-said <hi>Plantations</hi> of <hi>Virginia</hi> and <hi>Barbadoes</hi> happened in, or immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after our late Civil Wars, when the worsted party, by the fate of War, being deprived of their Estates, and having some of them never been bred to labour, and other made unfit for it by the lazy habit of a Soldiers life, there wanting Means to maintain them all abroad with his <hi>Majesty,</hi> many of them betook themselves to the afore-said <hi>Plantations,</hi> and great numbers of <hi>Scotch
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:51653:133"/>
Soldiers</hi> of his <hi>Majesty</hi>'s Army, after <hi>Worcester Fight,</hi> were by the then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Powers voluntarily sent in thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Another great <hi>swarm,</hi> or accession of new Inhabitants to the afore-said <hi>Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,</hi> as also to <hi>New-England, Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica,</hi> and all other his <hi>Majesties Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations in the West-Indies,</hi> ensued upon his <hi>Majesties</hi> Restauration, when the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer prevailing party being by a divine Hand of Providence brought under, the <hi>Army</hi> disbanded, many <hi>Officers</hi> dis-placed, and all the <hi>new purcharsers</hi> of publick Titles, dispossest of their pretended Lands, Estates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> many became im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poverished, destitute of employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and therefore such as could find no way of living at home, <hi>and some which feared the re-establishment of the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Laws, under which they could not live,</hi> were forced to transport them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, or sell themselves for a few Years, to be transported by others to the foreign <hi>English Plantations:</hi> The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant supply that the said <hi>Plantations</hi> have since had, hath by such vagrant loose People, as I before-mentioned, picked up, especially about the Streets
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:51653:133"/>
and <hi>Suburbs of London,</hi> and <hi>Westminster,</hi> and <hi>by Malefactors</hi> condemned for Crimes, for which by the Law they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served to dye; <hi>and some of those People called</hi> Quakers, <hi>banished for Meeting on pretence of Religious Worship.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, if from the Premises, it be duly considered what kind of Persons those have been, by which our <hi>Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> have at all times been replenished, I suppose it will appear that such they have been, and under such Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, that if his <hi>Majesty</hi> had had no foreign Plantations, to which they might have resorted, <hi>England</hi> however must have lost them.</p>
               <p>To illustrate the truth whereof a little further, let us consider what Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Graunt</hi> the ingenious <hi>Author of the Observations upon the Bills of Mortality,</hi> saith, pag. 76. and in other places of his Book, concerning the City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>; and it is not only said, but undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably proved, viz. <hi>That the City of</hi> London, <hi>let the Mortality be what it will, by Plague, or otherwise, repairs its Inhabitants once in two Years.</hi> And pag. 101. again, If there be encouragement for a hundred Persons in <hi>London</hi> (that is, a way how

a hundred may live better then in the Country) the evacuating of a fourth or third part of that number must soon be supplied out of the Country, who in a short time remove themselves from thence hither, so long until the City for want of receipt and encouragement, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurgitates and sends them back.</p>
               <p n="1">1. What he hath proved concerning <hi>London,</hi> I say of <hi>England</hi> in general, and the same may be said of any Kingdom or Country in the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Such as our employment is for People, so many will our People be</hi>; and if we should imagin we have in <hi>England</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment but for one hundred People, and we have born and bred amongst us one hundred and fifty People; I say, the fifty must away from us, or starve, or be hanged to prevent it, whether we had any foreign <hi>Plantations</hi> or not.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If by reason of the accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of living in our foreign <hi>Plantations</hi>; we have evacuated more of our People then we should have done, if we had no such <hi>Plantations,</hi> I say, with the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said <hi>Author</hi> in the case of <hi>London</hi>; and if that Evacuation be grown to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess (which I believe it never did barely
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:51653:134"/>
on the account of the Plantations) that decrease would procure its own Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; for much want of People would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure greater Wages; and greater Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, if our Laws gave encouragement, would procure us a supply of People without the charge of breeding them, as the <hi>Dutch</hi> are, and always have been supplied in their greatest Extremities.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But it may be said, Is not the Facility of being transported into the Plantations, together with the enticing Methods customarily used to perswade People to go thither, and the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of living there with a People that speak our own Language, strong Motives to draw our People from us; and do they not draw more from us, then otherwise would leave us, to go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to foreign Countries, where they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand not the Language?</p>
               <p>I Answer; 1<hi>st,</hi> It is not much more difficult to get a passage to <hi>Holland,</hi> than it is to our Plantations.</p>
               <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> Many of those that go to our <hi>Plantations,</hi> if they could not go thither, would and must go into foreign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, though it were ten times more difficult to get thither then it is; or else, which is worse (as hath been said)
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:51653:135"/>
would adventure to be hanged, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent begging or starving, as too many have done.</p>

                     </gap>ions,</hi> may cause some more to leave us, than would do if they had none but foreign Countries for refuge: But then if it be considered that our <hi>Plantations</hi> spending mostly our <hi>English</hi> Manufactures, and those of all sorts almost imaginable, in egregious quantities, and employing near two thirds of all our <hi>English Shiping, do therein give a constant Sustenance to it, may be two hundred thousand Persons here at home</hi>; then I must needs conclude upon the whole matter, that <hi>we have not the fewer, but the more People in</hi> England, <hi>by reason of our</hi> English <hi>Plantations in</hi> America.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:51653:135"/>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. I answer, With submission to better Judgments, that in my opinion, <hi>contending for Vniformity in Religion hath contributed ten times more to the depopula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of</hi> Spain, <hi>then all the</hi> American <hi>Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations</hi>: What was it but that which caused the expulsion of so many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand <hi>Moores</hi> who had built and inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted most of the chief Cities and Towns in <hi>Andaluzia, Granada, Aragon,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other parts? What was it but that, and the <hi>Inquisition</hi> that hath and doth daily expel such vast numbers of rich <hi>Iews</hi> with their Families and Estates into <hi>Germany, Italy, Turkey, Holland</hi> and <hi>England</hi>? What was it but that which caused those vast and long Wars be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween that <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>low Countries,</hi> and the effusion of so much <hi>Spanish Blood</hi> and Treasure, and the final loss of the <hi>seven Provinces,</hi> which we now see so prodigious, rich and full of People, while <hi>Spain</hi> is empty and poor, and <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> thin and weak, in continual fear of being made a prey to their Neighbours.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I answer; We must warily distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish between Country &amp; Country; for though <hi>Plantations</hi> may have drained <hi>Spain</hi> of People, it does not follow that they
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:51653:136"/>
have or will drain <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Holland,</hi> because where Liberty and Property are not so well preserved, and where Interest of Money is permitted to go at 12 <hi>per Cent,</hi> there can be no consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Manufacturing, and no more of Tillage and Grazing, than as we Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbially say, will keep Life and Soul together; and where there is little Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacturing, and as little Husbandry of Lands, the profit of <hi>Plantations,</hi> viz. the greatest part thereof will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to the Mother-Kingdom, but to other Countries wherein, there are more Manufactures and more Producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from the Earth; from hence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, <hi>Plantations</hi> thus managed prove drains of the People from their Mother-Kingdom; whereas <hi>Plantations</hi> belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Mother-Kingdoms or Countries, where Liberty and Property is better preserved, and Interest of Money re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to a low rate, the consequence is, that every person sent abroad with the <hi>Negroes</hi> and Utensils, he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to employ, or that are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed with him; it being customary in most of our <hi>Islands</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> upon every Plantation, to employ eight or
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:51653:136"/>
ten Blacks for one White Servant; I say, in this case we may reckon, that for Provisions, Clothes and Houshold-Goods, Sea-men, and all others em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed about Materials for build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, fitting and victualling of Ships, <hi>Every</hi> English <hi>man in</hi> Barbadoes <hi>or</hi> Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica <hi>creates employment for four men at home.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> I answer, That <hi>Holland</hi> now sends as many, and more people yearly to reside in their Plantations, Fortresses and Ships in the <hi>East-Indies</hi> (besides many into the <hi>West-Indies</hi>) than <hi>Spain,</hi> and yet is so far from declining in the Number of their people at home, that it is evident they do monstruously en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease; and so I hope under the next Head, to prove that <hi>England</hi> hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly encreased in People at home, since our settlement upon <hi>Plantations</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> although not in so great a proportion as the <hi>Dutch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>V. I am of Opinion that we had immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, before the late Plague, more Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in <hi>England,</hi> than we had before the inhabiting of <hi>New-England, Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, Barbadoes,</hi> &amp;c?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The proof of this at best I know can
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:51653:137"/>
but be conjectural; but in confirmation of my Opinion, I have, I think, of my mind the most industrious <hi>English Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culator</hi> this Age hath produced in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, viz. Captain <hi>Graunt</hi> in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Treatise, pag. 88. his words are,
<q>Vpon the whole matter we may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conclude, that the people of the whole Nation do encrease, and consequently the decrease of <hi>Winchester, Lincoln,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like places, must be attributed to other Reasons then that of refurnishing <hi>London</hi> only.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It is manifest by the afore-said worthy <hi>Author's</hi> Calculations, that the Inhabitants of <hi>London,</hi> and parts ajacent have encreased to almost double within this sixty Years, and that City hath u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually been taken for an Index of the whole.</p>
               <p>I know it will be said, that although <hi>London</hi> have so encreased, other parts have as much diminished, whereof some are named before; but if to answer the diminution of Inhabitants in some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular places, it be considered how others are encreased, viz, <hi>Yarmouth, Hull, Scarbrough,</hi> and other Ports in the <hi>North</hi>; as also <hi>Liverpoole, Westchester</hi>
                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:51653:137"/>
and <hi>Bristol; Portsmouth, Lime</hi> and <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi>; and withal, if it be considered what great Improvements have been made these last sixty Years upon break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up and enclosing of Wastes, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests and Parks, and draining of the <hi>Fenns,</hi> and all those places inhabited and furnished with Husbandry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then I think it will appear probable that we have in <hi>England</hi> now, at least had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the late <hi>Plague,</hi> more People then we had before we first entred upon fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign <hi>Plantations,</hi> notwithstanding like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the great Numbers of men which have issued from us into <hi>Ireland</hi>; which Country, as our Laws now are, I reckon not among the number of Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations profitable to <hi>England,</hi> nor with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the limits of this discourse, although peradventure something may be pickt out of these Papers, which may deserve consideration in relation to that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
               <p>But it may be said, If we have more People now then in former Ages, how came it to pass that in the times of King <hi>Henry the fourth and fifth,</hi> and other times formerly, we could raise such great Armies, and employ them in fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:51653:138"/>
Wars, and yet retain a sufficient number to defend the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and cultivate our Lands at home?</p>
               <p>I answer; <hi>first,</hi> The bigness of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies is not alwayes a certain Indication of the numerousness of a Nation, but sometimes rather of the nature of the Government and Distrubation of the Lands; as for instance, Where the <hi>Prince and Lords</hi> are owners of the whole Territory, although the People be thin, the Armies upon occasion may be very great, as in <hi>East-India, Turkey,</hi> and the Kingdoms of <hi>Fesse</hi> and <hi>Morocco,</hi> where <hi>Taffelet</hi> was lately said to have an <hi>Army</hi> of one hundred and fifty, or two hundred thousand men, although every body knows that Country hath as great a scarcety of people as any in the World: But since <hi>Free-holders</hi> are so much encreased in <hi>England,</hi> &amp; the servile <hi>Tenures</hi> altered, doubtless it is more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, as well as more chargeable to draw great <hi>numbers</hi> of men into foreign Wars.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Since the Introduction of the new <hi>Artillery of Powder,</hi> Shot and Fire-Arms in the World, all War is become as much rather an expence of Money as Men, and success attends those that can
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:51653:138"/>
most &amp; longest spend Money, rather than men; and consequently <hi>Princes Armies in</hi> Europe <hi>are become more proportionable to their Purses then to the Numbers of their People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>VI. That all Colonies and foreign Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions do endamage their Mother-King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, whereof the Trades of such Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations are not confined to their said Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Kingdoms, by good Laws and severe Execution of those Laws.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The practice of all the Governments of</hi> Europe <hi>witness to the truth of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.</hi> The <hi>Danes</hi> keep the Trade of <hi>Izland</hi> to themselves: The <hi>Dutch, Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renham,</hi> and all their Settlements in <hi>East-India</hi>: The <hi>French</hi> St <hi>Christophers,</hi> and their other Plantations in the <hi>West-Indies</hi>: The <hi>Portugeeze, Brazil,</hi> and all the Coasts thereof: The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> all their vast Terriories upon the Main in the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> and many Islands there; and our own Laws seem to design the like, as to all our Plantations in <hi>New-England, Virginia, Barbadoes,</hi> &amp;c. al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we have not yet arrived to a compleat and effectual Execution of those Laws.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:51653:139"/>2. <hi>Plantations</hi> being at first furnished, and afterwards successively supplied with People from their Mother King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and people being Riches, that loss of people to the Mother Kingdoms be it more or less, is certainly a da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, except the employment of those People abroad, do cause the employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of so many more at home in their Mother Kingdoms, and that can never be, except the Trade be restrained to their Mother Kingdom, which will not be doubted by any that understands the next Proposition, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>VII. That the <hi>Dutch</hi> will reap the greatest advantage by all Colonies, issuing from any Kingdom in <hi>Europe,</hi> whereof the Trades are not so strictly confined to their proper Mother Kingdoms.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Proposition</hi> will readily be assen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto by any that understand the nature of <hi>low Interest</hi> and <hi>low Customs,</hi> where the Market is free, they shall be sure to have the Trade that can sell the best penny-worths, that buy dearest and sell cheapest, (which Nationally speaking) none can do but those that Money at the lowest rate of <hi>Interest,</hi>
                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:51653:139"/>
and pay the least <hi>Customs,</hi> which are the <hi>Dutch</hi>; and this is the true cause why, before the <hi>Act of Navigation,</hi> there went ten <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships to <hi>Barbadoes</hi> for one <hi>English.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>VIII. That the Dutch <hi>(though they thrive so exceedingly in Trade)</hi> will in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability never endamage this Kingdom by the growth of their Plantations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. In fact the <hi>Dutch</hi> never did much thrive in planting, for I do remember they had about twenty Years past, <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bago,</hi> a most fruitful <hi>Island</hi> in the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> apt for the production of <hi>Sugars,</hi> and all other Commodities that are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated in <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> and as I have heard Planters affirm, better accomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated with Rivers for Water Mills, which are of great use for grinding of the Canes; this <hi>Island</hi> is still in their pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session, and <hi>Corasoa,</hi> and some others, and about sixteen or seventeen Years past they were so eager upon the <hi>Improvement</hi> of it, that besides what they did in <hi>Holland</hi> they set up Bills upon the <hi>Exchange</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> proffering great Priveledges to any that would Transport themselves thither. Notwithstanding all which to
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:51653:140"/>
this day, that <hi>Island</hi> is not the tenth part so well improved as <hi>Iamaica</hi> hath been by the <hi>English</hi> within these five Years; neither have the <hi>Dutch</hi> at any other time, or in any other parts of the World, made any emprovement by Planting; what they do in the <hi>East-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> being only by War, Trade and Building of Fortified Towns and Castles upon the Sea-Coasts, to secure the sole Commerce of the Places, and with the people, which they Conquer not, by clearing, breaking up of the Ground, and Planting as the <hi>English</hi> have done.</p>
               <p>This I take to be a strong Argument of Fact to my present purpose.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The second Argument to prove this Proposition is from Reason: I have before-mentioned the several Accidents and Methods by which our Foreign Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations have from time to time come to be peopled and emproved.</p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Dutch</hi> being void of those Accidents, are destitute of the occasions to emprove Foreign Plantations by dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and delving as the <hi>English</hi> have done.</p>
               <p>For 1<hi>st.</hi> In <hi>Holland</hi> their <hi>Interest</hi> and <hi>Cus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom</hi> being low, together with their other
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:51653:140"/>
Encouragements to Trade, mentioned in the former part of this Treatise, gives Employment to all their people born and bred amongst them, and also to multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of Foreigners.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Their giving Liberty, or at least Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivance to all Religions, as well</hi> Jews <hi>and</hi> Roman-Catholicks, <hi>or</hi> Sectaries, gives security to all their Inhabitants at home, and expels none, nor puts a necessity upon any to Banish themselves upon that account.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Their careful and wonderful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding for and employing their <hi>Poor</hi> at home, puts all their People utterly out of danger of Starving, or necessity of Stealing, and consequently out of fear of Hanging; I might add to this, that they have not for a long time had any Civil War among them, and from the whole conclude, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> as they did never, so they never can or will thrive by planting; and that our <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Plantations abroad are a good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, proceeding from many evil causes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <pb n="188" facs="tcp:51653:141"/>IX. That neither the <hi>French, Spaniards</hi> or <hi>Portugeeze</hi> are much to be feared on the account of Planting, not for the same, but for other Reasons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the <hi>French</hi> have had footing in the <hi>West-Indies</hi> almost as long as the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> is certain, and that they have made no considerable Progress in Planting is as certain; and finding it so in fact, I have been often exercising my thoughts about enquiry into the reason thereof, which I attribute especially to two.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> because <hi>France</hi> being an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Government, hath not until very lately, given any countenance or encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to <hi>Navigation</hi> and <hi>Trade.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly</hi> and principally, because the <hi>French</hi> Settlements in the <hi>West-Indies</hi> have not been upon <hi>Free-Holders</hi> as the <hi>English</hi> are, but in subjection to the <hi>French West-India Company,</hi> which <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany</hi> being under the <hi>French King,</hi> as <hi>Lord Proprietor</hi> of the places they settle upon, and taxing the <hi>Inhabitants</hi> at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure as the <hi>King</hi> doth them, it is not probable they should make that succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Progress in Planting; <hi>Propriety, Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:51653:141"/>
and Inheritance being the most effectual Spurs to Industry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Though some (who have not looked far into this matter) may think the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have made great Progress in Planting, I am of opinion, that the <hi>English</hi> since the time they set upon this Work, have cleared and emproved fifty Plantations for one, and Built as many Houses for one the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have Built; this will not be very difficult to imagine, if it be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>
               <p>First, that it is not above fifty or sixty Years since the <hi>English</hi> intended the Propagating Foreign Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were Possessed of the <hi>West-Indies</hi> about our <hi>King Henry</hi> the 7<hi>th</hi>'s time, which is near two Hundred Years past.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that what the <hi>Spaniard</hi> hath done in the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> hath been ten times more by Conquest then by Plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>Fourtly, That the <hi>Spaniards</hi> found in the <hi>West-Indies</hi> most of the Cities and Towns ready Built and Inhabited, and
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:51653:142"/>
much of the Ground emproved and cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated before their coming thither.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, That the <hi>Inhabitants</hi> which they found there, and subdued, were such a People with whom some of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> could and have mixed, from whence hath proceeded a Generation of People which they call <hi>Mestises</hi>; whereas the <hi>English,</hi> where they have set down and Planted, either found none, or such as were meer wild <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,</hi> with whom they could not, nor ever have been known to mix.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, That now after such a long series of time, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are scarce so Populous in any Part of the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> as to be able to bring an Army of <hi>Ten Thousand</hi> Men together in a Months time.</p>
               <p>From all which I conjecture;</p>
               <p n="1">1st. <hi>That his Majesty hath now more</hi> English Subjects <hi>in all his Foreign Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in sixty Years, than the King of</hi> Spain <hi>hath</hi> Spaniards <hi>in all his, in two Hundred Years.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2d. <hi>That the</hi> Spaniards <hi>Progress in Planting bears <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p n="3">3<hi>d.</hi> That seeing the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> in
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:51653:142"/>
the time of their greatest Prosperity, and under so many Advantages, have been such indifferent Planters, and have made such slow progress in Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleing those parts of the <hi>West-Indies</hi> which they possess, <hi>It is not much to be feared that ever the</hi> English <hi>will be mated by the</hi> Spaniards <hi>in their Foreign Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or Production of the Native Commodities of those Parts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the reasons why the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are so thin of people in the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> I take to be such as these following, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First and principally, <hi>because they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise the same Policy and Governments, Civil and Ecclesiastical in their Plantations, as they do in their Mother-Kingdom</hi>; from whence it follows that their People are few and thin abroad, from the same causes as they are empty and void of people at home; whereas although <hi>we in</hi> England <hi>vainely endeavour to arrive at a Vniformity of Religion at home, yet we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low an</hi> Amsterdam <hi>Liberty in our Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is true, <hi>New-England</hi> being a more independant Government from this Kingdom then any other of our Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:51653:143"/>
and the People that went thither more one peculiar Sort of Sect, then those that went to the rest of our Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, they did for some Years past, exercise some Severities against the <hi>Quakers,</hi> but of late they have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood their true Interest better, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as I have not heard of any Act of that kind for these five or six Years last, notwithstanding I am well informed, that there are now amongst them many more <hi>Quakers</hi> and other <hi>Dissenters</hi> from their Forms of Religious Worship, then were at the time of their greatest Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity, which Severity had no other ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect but to encrease the <hi>New-English Non-conformists.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2<hi>d.</hi> A second reason why the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of the <hi>Spanish West-India</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities are so inconsiderable in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the <hi>English,</hi> and consequently why their Progress in Planting, hath been, and is like to be much less then the <hi>English,</hi> as also the encrease of their People, I take to be the dearness of the Freight of their Ships, which is four times more then our <hi>English</hi> Freight, and if you would know how that comes to be so, twelve <hi>per cent</hi> Interest will go
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:51653:143"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> great way towards the satisfying you, although there are other concomitant lesser causes, which whosoever under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands <hi>Spain,</hi> or shall carefully read this Treatise, may find out them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
               <p n="3">3<hi>d.</hi> A third reason I take to be the greatness of the <hi>Customs</hi> in <hi>Old-Spain,</hi> for undoubtedly <hi>high Customs do as well dwarf Plantations as Trade.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4<hi>th.</hi> The <hi>Spaniards</hi> Intense and singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Industry in their Mines for Gold and Silver, the working wherein de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroys abundance of their people, at least of their Slaves, doth cause them to neglect in great measure Cultivating of the Earth, and producing Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities from the growth thereof, which might give employment to a greater Navy, as well as sustenance to a far greater number of people by Sea and Land.</p>
               <p n="5">5<hi>th.</hi> Their multitude of <hi>Fryers, Nuns and other reclust and Ecclesiastical Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> which are prohibited from <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The third sort of People I am to Discourse of, are the <hi>Portugeeze,</hi> and and them I must acknowledge to have
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:51653:144"/>
been great Planters in the <hi>Brazeils</hi> and other Places; but yet if we preserve our People and Plantations by good Laws, I have reason to believe, that the <hi>Portugeeze</hi> (except they alter their Politicks, which is almost impossible for them to do) can never bear up with us, muchless prejudice our <hi>Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That hitherto they have not hurt us, but we them, is most apparent, for in my time we have beat their <hi>Muscovado</hi> and <hi>Paneal Sugars</hi> quite out of use in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and their <hi>Whites</hi> we have brought down in all these Parts of <hi>Europe</hi> in price, from seven and eight pounds <hi>per l.</hi> to fifty Shillings and three Pounds <hi>per. l.</hi> and in quantity; whereas formerly their <hi>Brazeil-Fleets</hi> consisted of One hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, to One hundred and twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand <hi>Chests of Sugar,</hi> they are now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to about Thirty thousand Chests, since the great encrease of <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The reason of this decay of the</hi> Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geeze <hi>Productions in Brazeils, is certainly the better Policy that our</hi> English <hi>Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are founded upon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which principally dwarfs the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:51653:144"/>
                  <hi>Portugeeze Plantations</hi> is the same before-mentioned, which hinders the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> viz. <hi>extraordinary high Customs at home, high Freights, high Interest of Money, Ecclesiastical persons,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>From all that hath been said concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Plantations in general, I draw these two principal Conclusions.</p>
               <p n="1">1<hi>st. That our</hi> English Plantations <hi>may thrive beyond any other Plantations in the World, though the Trades of all of them were more severely limitted by Laws and good Execution of those Laws to their Mother-Kingdom of</hi> England, <hi>exclusive to</hi> Ireland <hi>and</hi> New-England.</p>
               <p n="2">2dly. <hi>That it is in his</hi> Majesties <hi>power, and the</hi> Parliaments, <hi>if they please, by taking off all Charges from Sugar, to make it more intirely an</hi> English Commodity, <hi>then white-Herrings are a</hi> Dutch Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, <hi>and to draw more profit to this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom thereby, then the</hi> Dutch <hi>do by that: And that in consequence thereof, all Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of other Nations must in a few Years sink to little or nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>X. That it is more for the Advantage of <hi>England</hi> that <hi>New found Lands</hi> should remain unplanted, then that Colonies
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:51653:145"/>
should be sent or permitted to go thither to Inhabit under a Governour, Laws, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have before discoursed of <hi>Plantations</hi> in general, most of the <hi>English</hi> being in their nature much a like, except this of <hi>New-found-Land,</hi> and that of <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which I intend next to speak of.</p>
               <p>The advantage <hi>New-found-Land</hi> hath brought to this Kingdom, is only by the Fishery there, and of what vast con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment that is, is well known to most <hi>Gentlemen and Merchants,</hi> especially those of the <hi>West</hi> parts of <hi>England,</hi> from whence especially this Trade is driven.</p>
               <p>It is well known, upon undeniable poof, tbat in the Year, 1605. the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> employed 250. Sail of Ships small and great, in Fishin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> upon that Coast; and it is now too apparent, that we do not so employ from all Parts, above Eighty Sail of Ships.</p>
               <p>It is likewise generally known and confessed, that when we employed so many Ships in that Trade, the current price of our Fish in that Country, was (<hi>Communibus annis</hi>) seventeen Rials, which is eight Shillings six Pence <hi>per</hi> Quintal, and that since, as we have lessened in that Trade, the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:51653:145"/>
                  <hi>French</hi> have encreased in it, and that we have annually proceeded to raise our Fish from seventeen Rials to twenty four Rials, or twelve Shillings, <hi>(Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munibus annis)</hi> as it now sells in the Country:</p>
               <p>This being the Case of <hi>England</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to this Trade, it is certainly worth the enquiery.</p>
               <p n="1">1st. <hi>How we came to decay in that Trade.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2dly, <hi>What means may be used to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver our antient Greatness in that Trade, or at least to prevent our further diminution there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The decay of that Trade I attribute.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First and principally, to the growing Liberty which is every Year more and more used in <hi>Romish Countries,</hi> as well as others, of eating Flesh in <hi>Lent</hi> and on Fish-days.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To a late abuse crept into that Trade, (which hath much abated the expence within these twenty Years of that Commodity) of sending over pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate <hi>Boat-keepers,</hi> which hath much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minished the number of the <hi>Fishing-Ships.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. To the great encrease of the <hi>French Fishery of Placentia</hi> and other Ports on the back-side of <hi>New-found-Land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:51653:146"/>4. To the several <hi>Wars</hi> we have had at Sea within these twenty Years, which have much empoverished the <hi>Merchants</hi> of our <hi>Western</hi> Parts, and reduced them to carry on a great part of that Trade at <hi>Bottumry, viz.</hi> Money taken upon Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture of the Ship at twenty <hi>per cent per Annum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>What means may be used to recover our antient greatness in that Trade, or at least to prevent our farther diminution therein.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For this, two contrary ways have been propounded,</p>
               <p n="1">1. To send a <hi>Governour</hi> to reside there, and to encourage people to Inhabit there, as well for Defence of the Country against Invasion, as to manage the <hi>Fishe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> there by Inhabitants upon the Pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ce, this hath often been propounded by the <hi>Planters</hi> and some <hi>Merchants</hi> of <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The second way propounded, and which is directly contrary to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is, by the <hi>West-Country Merchants</hi> and Owners of the <hi>Fishing-Ships,</hi> and that is to have no <hi>Governour</hi> nor <hi>Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants</hi> permitted to reside at <hi>New-found-Land,</hi> nor any <hi>Passengers,</hi> or private <hi>Boat-keepers</hi> suffered to Fish at <hi>New-found-Land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="199" facs="tcp:51653:146"/>This latter way propounded is most agreeable to my Proposition, and if it could be effected, I am perswaded would revive the decaied <hi>English-Fishing-Trade at New-found-Land,</hi> and be otherwise great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the advantage of this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and that for these following reasons,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Because <hi>most of the Provision the</hi> Planters <hi>which are settled at</hi> New-found-Land, <hi>do make use of viz.</hi> Bread, Beef, Pork, Butter, Cheese, Clothes, and <hi>Irish</hi>-Bengal Cloth, Linnen <hi>and</hi> Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len; <hi>Ireish</hi>-Stockings, <hi>as also</hi> Nets, Hooks <hi>and</hi> Lines, <hi>&amp;c. they are supplied with from</hi> New-England <hi>and</hi> Ireland; <hi>and with</hi> Wine, Oyl <hi>and</hi> Linnen <hi>by the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lt Ships from</hi> France <hi>and</hi> Spain, <hi>in consequence whereof the Labour, as well as the Feeding and Clothing of so many Men is lost to</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Planters</hi> settled there, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mostly loose vagrant People, and without Order and Government, do keep dissolute Houses, which have De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baucht Sea-Men, and diverted them from their laborious and industrious Calling; whereas before there were settlements there, the Sea-Men had no other resort during the Fishing Season (being the
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:51653:147"/>
time of their abode in that Country) but to their Ships, which afforded them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Food and Repose, without the Inconveniencies of Excess.</p>
               <p n="3">3 If it be the Interest of all Trading Nations principally to encourage Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and to promote especially those Trades which employ most Shiping: then which nothing is more true, nor more regarded by the wife <hi>Dutch,</hi> then certainly it is the Interest of <hi>England</hi> to discountenance and abate the number of Planters at <hi>New-found-Land,</hi> for if they should encrease, it would in a few Years happen to us, in relation to that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as it hath to the <hi>Fishery</hi> at <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which many Years since was man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged by <hi>English Ships</hi> from the Western Ports; but as Plantations there encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, fell to be the sole Employment of People settled there, and nothing of that Trade left the poor old <hi>English-Men,</hi> but the liberty of carrying now and then by courtesie or purchase, a Ship loading of Fish to <hi>Bilvoa,</hi> when their own <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>w-English Shiping</hi> are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Employed, or not at leisure to do it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>It is manifest that before ther were
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:51653:147"/>
Boat-keepers or Planters at</hi> New-found-land <hi>Fish was sold cheaper than now it is, by about</hi> 40 <hi>per Cent,</hi> and consequently more vent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the reason whereof I take to be this; The <hi>Boat-keepers</hi> and <hi>Planters,</hi> being ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally at first able <hi>Fisher-men,</hi> and being upon the place, can doubtless afford their Fish cheaper then the Fishing Ships from <hi>Old England,</hi> so doubtless they did at first as well at <hi>New-England</hi> as at <hi>New-found-land,</hi> until they had beat the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Ships out of the Trade; after which being freed from that competition, they became Lazy as to that laborious em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, having means otherwise to live and employ themselves, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon enhaunced the price of their Fish to such an excess, as in effect proves the giving away of that Trade to the <hi>French,</hi> who by our aforesaid impolitick management of that Trade, have of late Years been able to under-sell us at all Markets abroad; and most certain it is, that those that can sell cheapest will have the Trade.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>This Kingdom being an Island, it is our Interest, as well for our preservation as our profit, not only to have many Sea-men, but to have them as much as may be within call in a time of danger.</hi> Now the Fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:51653:148"/>
Ships going out in <hi>March,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning home for <hi>England</hi> in the Month of <hi>September</hi> yearly, and there being em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in that Trade two hundred and fifty Ships, which might carry about <hi>ten thousand Sea-men,</hi> Fisher-men and Shore men, as they usually call the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Persons, which were never before at Sea: I appeal to the Reader, whether such a yearly return of <hi>Sea-men,</hi> abiding at home with us all the Winter, and spending their Money here which they got in their Summer-Fishery, were not a great access of Wealth and Power to this Kingdom, and a ready supply for his <hi>Majesty's</hi> Navy upon all Emergencies.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>The Fishing Ships yet are, and always have been the breeders of Sea-men</hi>; the Planters and Boat-keepers are generally such as were bred, and became expert at the cost of the Owners of Fishing Ships, which Planters and Boat-keepers enter very few new or green men.</p>
               <p n="7">7. By the building, fitting, victualling and repairing of Fishing-Ships, multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of <hi>English</hi> Trades-men and Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers (besides the Owners and Sea-men) gain their subsistance; whereas by the Boats, which the <hi>Planters and Boat-keepers</hi> build or use at <hi>New-found-Land, England</hi> gets nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="203" facs="tcp:51653:148"/>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But against all that I have said, those that contend for a <hi>Governour at New-found-Land,</hi> object;</p>
               <p n="1">1. That without a <hi>Governour</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> there, that Country will be alwayes exposed to the surprizal of the <hi>French,</hi> or any <hi>Foreigners</hi> that shall please to attacque it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the disorders of the <hi>Planters,</hi> which I complain of (and some others, which for brevities sake, I have not mentioned) cannot be remedied with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a <hi>Governour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which I answer, <hi>first,</hi> That when we cannot preserve our <hi>Colonies</hi> by our Shiping, or so awe our Neighbours by our <hi>Fleets</hi> and Ships of War, that they dare not attempt them, our case will be sad, and our Propriety will be lost, or in eminent danger, not only abroad, but at home likewise.</p>
               <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> All the <hi>Fish</hi> that is killed at <hi>New-found-Land</hi> in a Summer, is not sufficient to maintain strength enough on Shore to defend two Fishing Harbours against ten men of War, whereas that Country hath more Harbours to defend, than are to be found in <hi>Old England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> If a <hi>Governour</hi> be established; the next consequence will be a <hi>Tax</hi> upon
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:51653:149"/>
the Fishing, and the least Tax will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease the price of Fish, and that una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably will give the Trade away wholly into the <hi>French</hi> Hands.</p>
               <p n="4">4<hi>thly,</hi> A <hi>Government</hi> there is already of antient Custom among the <hi>Masters</hi> of the Fishing-Ships, to which the Fisher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are inured, and that free from Oppression, and adapted to the Trade, insomuch that although a better might be wished, I never hope to see it.</p>

                  <hi>XI That <hi>New-England</hi> is the most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judical Plantation to this Kingdom.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>I am now to write of a People, whose Fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality, Industry and Temperance, and the happiness of whose Laws and Institution, do promise to themselves long Life, with a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful encrease of People, Riches and Power:</hi> And although no men ought to envy that Vertue and Wisdom in others, which themselves either can or will not pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, but rather to commend and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire it; yet I think it is the duty of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good man primarily to respect the well-fare of his Native Country; and therefore though I may offend some, whom I would not willingly displease, I cannot omit in the progress of this discourse, to take notice of some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, wherein <hi>Old</hi> England <hi>suffers di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:51653:149"/>
by the growth of those Colonies settled in New-England,</hi> and how that <hi>Plantation</hi> differs from those more Southerly, with respect to the gain or loss of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. All our <hi>American Plantations,</hi> except that of <hi>New-England,</hi> produce Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities of different Natures from those of this Kingdom, as <hi>Sugar, Tobacco, Cocoa, Wool, Ginger, sundry sorts of dying Woods,</hi> &amp;c. Whereas <hi>New-England</hi> produces generally the same we have here, <hi>viz.

               <p>The other Commodities we have from them, are some few <hi>great Masts, Furs,</hi> and <hi>Train-Oyl,</hi> whereof the Yearly value amounts to very little, the much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter value of returns from thence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made in <hi>Sugar, Cotten, Wool, Tobacco, and such like Commodities,</hi> which they first receive from some other of his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's Plantations,</hi> in Barter for dry <hi>Cod-Fish, salt Mackerel, Beef, Pork, Bread,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:51653:150"/>
Beer, Flower, Pease,</hi> &amp;c. which they sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply <hi>Barbadoes, Iamaica,</hi> &amp;c. with, to the diminution of the vent of those Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities from this Kingdom; the great Experience whereof in our own <hi>West-India Plantations,</hi> would soon be found in the advantage of the value of our Lands in <hi>England,</hi> were it not for the vast and almost incredible supplies those <hi>Colonies</hi> have from <hi>New-England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The People of <hi>New-England,</hi> by vertue of their Primitive <hi>Charters</hi> being not so strictly tied to the observation of the Laws of this Kingdom, do some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times assume a liberty of Trading, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the <hi>Act of Navigation,</hi> by reason whereof many of our <hi>American</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, especially <hi>Tobacco</hi> and <hi>Sugar,</hi> are transported in <hi>New-English Shiping,</hi> directly into <hi>Spain,</hi> and other foreign Countries, without being Landed in <hi>England,</hi> or paying any Duty to his <hi>Majesty,</hi> which is not only loss to the <hi>King,</hi> and a prejudice to the <hi>Navigation of Old England</hi>; but also a total exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the old <hi>English Merchant</hi> from the vent of those Commodities in those Ports, where the <hi>New-English</hi> Vessels trade; because, there being no <hi>Custom</hi> paid on those Commodities in <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
                  <pb n="207" facs="tcp:51653:150"/>
and a great <hi>Custom</hi> paid upon them in <hi>Old England,</hi> it must necessarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that the <hi>New-English</hi> Merchant will be able to afford his Commodity much cheaper at the Market, than the Old <hi>English Merchant:</hi> And those that can sell cheapest, will infallibly engross the whole Trade sooner or later.</p>

Of all the <hi>American Plntations,</hi> his <hi>Majesty</hi> hath none so apt for the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Shiping as <hi>New-England,</hi> nor none comparably so qualified for the breeding of Sea-men, not only by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the natural industry of that people but principally by reason of their <hi>Cod</hi> and <hi>Mackerel Fisheries:</hi> And in my poor opinion, there is nothing more preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial, and in prospect more dangerous to any Mother <hi>Kingdom,</hi> then the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of Shiping in their <hi>Colonies, Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations</hi> or <hi>Provinces.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The People that evacuate from us to <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> and the other <hi>West-India Plantations,</hi> as was before hinted, do commonly work one <hi>English man</hi> to ten or eight <hi>Blacks</hi>; and if we kept the trade of our said <hi>Plantations</hi> intirely to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, England</hi> would have no less Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, but rather an encrease of people by such evacuation, because that one

                  <hi>English man,</hi> with the ten <hi>Blacks</hi> that work with him, accounting what they eat, use and wear, would make employment for four men in <hi>England,</hi> as was said before; whereas, peradventure of ten men that issue from us to <hi>New-England</hi> &amp; <hi>Ireland,</hi> what we send to, or receive from them, doth not employ one man in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude this Chapter, and to do right to that most Industirous <hi>English Colony,</hi> I must confess that though we loose by their unlimitted Trade with our Foreign Plantations, yet we are very great Gainers, by their direct Trade to and from <hi>Old-England.</hi> Our Yearly Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portations of <hi>English</hi> Manufactures, Mault and other Goods from hence thither, amounting in my opinion to ten times the value of what is Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from thence, which Calculation I do not make at randum, but upon mature Consideration, and peradventure upon as much Experience in this very Trade, as any other person will pretend to; and therefore, when ever a Reformation of our Correspondency in Trade with that people shall be thought on, it will in my poor Judgment require great Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness &amp; very serious Circumspection.</p>

            <head>A Small TREATISE Against USURY.</head>
            <p>TO leave the proofs of the unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of Usury to Divines, wherein a number, as well <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants</hi> as <hi>Papists,</hi> have learnedly Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; here is only set down some Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to shew how great the hurt is it doth to this Kingdom, which hath no Gold nor Silver Mines, but plenty of Commodities, and many and great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of Trade; to which the high rate of Usury is a great prejudice and decay.</p>
            <p>For proof how much the high rate of Usury decays Trade; we see that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally all Merchants when they have got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten any great Wealth, leave Trading, and fall to Usury, the gain thereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:51653:152"/>
so easie, certain, and great; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in other Countries, where Usury is at a lower rate, and thereby Lands dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to purchase, they continue Merchants from Generation to Generation, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich themselves and the State.</p>
            <p>Neither are they rich Trades-Men only, that give over Trading, but a number of Beginners are undone or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by the high rate of Usury, their Industry serving but to Enrich o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and Begger themselves.</p>
            <p>We also see many Trades themselves much decayed, because they will not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford so great a gain as Ten in the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred; whereas, if the rate of Usury were not higher here then in other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, they had still subsisted and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished, and perhaps with as much Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to the Publick, as those that do bring more to the private Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers.</p>
            <p>Yet are not those the greatest hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances the high rate of Money brings to Trade; our greatest disadvantage is, that other Nations, especially our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious Neighbours the <hi>Dutch,</hi> are therein Wiser then we: For with them, and so in most Countries with whom
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:51653:152"/>
we hold Commerce, there is not any Use for Money tollerated, above the rate of Six in the Hundred: Whereby it must of necessity come to pass, though they have no other Advantages of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry and Frugality, that they must out-Trade us; for if they make return of ten <hi>per Cent,</hi> they almost double the Use allowed, and so make a very gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Trade. But with us, where ten in the Hundred is so currant, it is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise; for if we make not above ten, we are loosers, and consequently the same Trade being with them and us equally good for the Publick, is to the private Adventurers lossful with us, with them very gainful. And where the good of Publick and private Mens go not together, the Publick is seldom greatly advanced.</p>
            <p>And as they out-Trade, so they may afford to under-sell us in the Fruits of the Earth, which are equally natural to our and their Lands, as to our great shame we see our Neighbours the <hi>Dutch</hi> do, even in our own Country: For in most Commodities the Earth brings forth, the Stock imployed in Planting and managing of them, makes a great
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:51653:153"/>
(in many the greatest) part of their Price; and consequently, their Stock with them, being rated at six in the Hundred, they may with great Gain under-sell us, our Stock with us being rated at ten.</p>
            <p>And as they may out-Trade us and under-sell us, so are all Contributions to the War, works of Piety and Glory of the State, cheaper to them then to us, For the Use for Money going with us near double the rate it doth in other Countries, the giving the same Sum must needs be double the charge to us it is to them.</p>
            <p>Amongst other things which the King, with so much Wisdom, delivered to the House of Parliament, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to their Considerat on the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancing of Trade and Commerce, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there is nothing of greater conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, then the rate of Usury, which holds no Proportion with us and other Nations, to our disadvantage, as by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience we see and feel.</p>
            <p>Neither is the high rate of Usury less hurtful to Commerce within the Land, the Gain by Usury being so easie, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and extream great, as they are
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:51653:153"/>
not only Merchants and Trades-men, but Landed-men, Farmers, and men of Profession that grow Lazy in their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions, and become Usurers; for the rate of Usury is the measure by which all men Trade, Purchase, Build, Plant, or any other ways bargain.</p>
            <p>It hath been the Wisdom and Care of former <hi>Parliaments</hi> to provide for the preservation of Wood and Timber; for which there is nothing more avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able then the calling down of the high rate of Usury; for as the rate of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney now goeth, no man can let his Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber stand, nor his Wood grow to such years growth as is best for the Common-Wealth, but it will be very lossfull to him; The stock of the Woods after they are worth forty or fifty Shillings the Acre, growing faster at ten in the Hundred, then the Woods themselves do.</p>
            <p>And for Shipping, which is the strength and safety of this Land; I have heard divers Merchants of good Credit say, that if they would Build a Ship, and let it to any other to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy, they cannot make of their Money that way, counting all charges, tear
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:51653:154"/>
and wear, above ten or twelve in the Hundred, which can be no gainful Trade, Money it self going at ten in the Hundred.</p>
            <p>But in the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> where Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney goeth at six, the Building of Ships, and Hiring them to others, is a gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Trade; and so the Stock of rich Men, and the Industry of Beginners, are well joyned for the Publick.</p>
            <p>And yet that which is above all the rest, the greatest Sin against the Land is, that it makes the Land it self of small value, nearer the rate of new-found Lands, than of any other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, where Laws, Government, and Peace, have so long flourished; for the high rate of Usury makes Land sell so cheap; and the cheap sale of Land is the cause Men seek no more by Industry and Cost to improve them.</p>
            <p>And this is plain both by Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and Demonstration: For we see in other Countries, where the Use of Money is of a low rate, Lands are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally sold for thirty, forty, in some for fifty Years Purchase.</p>
            <p>And we know by the rule of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaining, that if the rate of Use were
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:51653:154"/>
not greater here, then in other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; Lands were then as good a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny worth at twenty Years Purchase, as they are now at sixteen: For Lands being the best Assurance and securest Inheritance, will still b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ar a rate above Money.</p>
            <p>Now if Lands were at thirty Years Purchase, or near it, there were no so cheap Purchase as the Amendment of our own Lands; for it would be much cheaper to make one Acre of Land, now worth five Shillings by the Year, to be worth ten Shillings, or being worth ten to be worth twenty Shillings, and so in Proportion; then to purchase an other Acre worth five or ten Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings.</p>
            <p>And in every Acre thus purchased to the Owner, by the amendment of his own, there were another purchased to the Common-Wealth.</p>
            <p>And it is the Blessing of God to this Land, that there are few places of it to which he hath not given means, by reasonable Cost and. Industry, greatly to amend it, in many to double the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, so as in time, if for their own good, mens Industry were compelled
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:51653:155"/>
that way, the Riches and Commodities of this Land will near be doubled.</p>
            <p>Then would all the wet Lands in this Kingdom soon be drained, the barren Lands mended by Marle, Sleech, Lime, Chalk, Sea-sand, and other means, which for their profit, mens industry would find out.</p>
            <p>We see with how great industry and charge our Neighbours, the <hi>Dutch,</hi> do drain and maintain their Lands against the Sea, which floweth higher above them, then it doth above the lowest parts of our drown'd Lands.</p>
            <p>I will admit a great deal to their Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, but I should very unwillingly grant, that they are so much more ingenuous and industrious then we, as that all the odds were therein.</p>
            <p>Certainly, the main cause of it is, that with us Money is dear, and Land cheap; with them Land is dear, and Money cheap; and consequently the Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Lands at so great a charge with them, is gainful to the Owners, which with us would be lossful; for Usury going at ten in the Hundred, if a man borrow five Pounds, and bestow it on an Acre of Ground, the amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:51653:155"/>
stands him in ten Shillings the Year, and being amended, the Land is not worth above fifteen Years purchase.</p>
            <p>But if the Use of Money went at no more with us, then in other places, then five Pound bestowed upon an Acre of Gound, would stand a man but in five or six Shillings a Year, and the Acre of Land so amended, would be worth, as hath been shewed, six and twenty or thirty years purchase.</p>
            <p>Whereby it appeareth that as the rate of Use now goeth, no man (but where the Land lieth extraordinarily happily for it) can amend his Land, but to his own loss; whereas if Money were let as it is in other Countries, he might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow more then double so much as now he may, and yet be a great gainer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; and consequently, as was before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, should to his own bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit purchase Land to the Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>Neither would such purchase of Land to the Common-wealth, be the benefit to the Landed men only, the benefit would be as much to the poor Labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of the Land: For now when Corn and other Fruits of the Land, which
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:51653:156"/>
grow by labour, are cheap, the Plough and Mattock are cast into the Hedge, there is little work for poor men, and that at a low rate; whereas, if the mendment of their own Lands were the cheapest purchase to the Owners; if there were many more people then there are, they should more readily be set a work, at better rates then they now are, and none that had their Health and Limbs could be poor, but by their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamest laziness.</p>
            <p>And as the high rate of Usury doth imbase L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nds, so it is as great a hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance to Discoveries, Plantations, and all good undertakings, making it near double as chargeable to the Adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ers, (Money being at ten in the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred) as it is in other Countries, where the Use of Money is so much lower.</p>
            <p>Now let us see by the contrary, and conceive if Usury were tollerated at fifteen or twenty in the hundred (and I fear many Borrowers, all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, pay above ten) what the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of things would then be, and if it appear how desperate the hurt would be which that would bring; it may (at least upon good reason) perswade us
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:51653:156"/>
how great the good would he of calling it down.</p>
            <p>Certainly, it must of necessity come to pass, that all Trades would in a short time decay: For few or none (and rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon the hazard at nothing) yield so great a gain as twenty in the hundred; and all other Nations might with so great gain out-trade and under-sell us, that more than the Earth would of her self bring forth, we should scarce raise any thing from it, even for our own use within the Land; and Land would be so much imbased, as men might afford without loss to themselves, to carry the Compost out of their Closes, upon their next adjoyning Lands to mend them: so far should we be from Marling, Liming, Draining, Planting, and any other works of Cost or Industry, by which Lands are purchased to the Common-wealth. So far from building, making of Havens, Discoveries, new Plantations, or any other actions of Vertue and Glory to the State; for private gain is the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass men generally sail by.</p>
            <p>And since we cannot, without extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary diligence, Plant, Build, Drain, or any other way amend our Lands, but
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:51653:157"/>
it will be dearer to us, than the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase of others, Money being at ten in the Hundred; if Money then should go at twenty in the Hundred, the charge of mending our Land would be doubled, and the Land abased to seven or eight Years purchase; and consequently all works of Industry and Charge, for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving of Lands, would be quite neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected and given over: We should only eat upon one another with Usury, have our Commodities from other Nations, let the Land grow barren and unma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nured, and the whole State in short time come to beggary.</p>
            <p>Against this (perhaps) may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, <hi>That before the</hi> 37 <hi>of</hi> H. 8. <hi>there was no limitation of Vsury, and how did we then</hi>?</p>
            <p>To this may be answered, That in those times there was a stricter Band in that point upon Mens Consciences: So far forth as Usurers were in the same case as Excommunicate Persons, they could make no Wills, nor were allowed Christian Burial.</p>
            <p>Therefore let us, for our Fore-fathers sake, hope, that the tie upon their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences then was a greater Restraint of
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:51653:157"/>
Usury, than the Statute of ten in the Hundred is now. I fear Fornication is too frequent among us; yet, thanks be to God, not so much used as where there is allowance of Curtizans and Stews.</p>
            <div type="subpart">
               <head>The Objections likely to be made against the calling down of Money, are,</head>
               <p>First, That general Objection of Ignorance against all Changes, be they never so necessary and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently good, that it hath been so a long time, and been well enough; what will become of the alteration we cannot tell; why then should we make any change?</p>
               <p>Secondly, That as in Bodies Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, so in Politique, great and sudden Changes are most commonly dangerous.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That Money will be suddenly called in, and so all Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowers greatly preju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="218" facs="tcp:51653:158"/>Fourthly, That Money will be harder to come by, and thereby Commerce greatly hindred.</p>
               <p>Lastly, That much Money of Foreigners, by Reason of the high rate of Usury, is brought over here to be managed at Interest, which would be carried away again, if the Rate of Usury should be called down.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="subpart">
               <head>To the First. That Money hath long gone at Ten, and things been well enough.</head>
               <p>It is answered, That it is not long that the practice of Usury hath been so generally used, without any sence or scruple of the unlawfulness of it; for mens Consciences were hardened to it with example and custom, by degrees, and not upon the sudden.</p>
               <p>And as the beginning of many dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Diseases in healthful Bodies, so the beginning of many Inconveniencies in a State, are not presently felt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="219" facs="tcp:51653:158"/>With us, after that with long Civil Wars the Land was half unpeopled, so as till of late Years, it came not to his full stock of People again, there being the same quantity of Land to half the number of People, the surplusage of our In-land Commodities must needs be so great, that though Trade were not equally ballanced with us and other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, we could not but grow rich.</p>
               <p>Besides, <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>rance</hi> and the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> were for many Years half laid waste with Wars, and so did trade but little, nor manage their own Lands to their best advantage; whereby they did not only not take the Trade &amp; Market from us which now they do, but they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves were fed and cloathed by us, and took our Commodities from us at great high great Rates.</p>
               <p>Whereas now we see the <hi>Dutch</hi> do every where out trade us, and the <hi>French</hi> feed us with their Corn, even in plentiful Years.</p>
               <p>So as now our Land being full stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with People, our Neighbours indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious and subtle in Trade, if we do not more equally Ballance Trade, and bring to pass that we may afford the Fruits
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:51653:159"/>
of our Land, as cheap as other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries afford the same of the same kind; we must (though we leave a number of our superfluities, as God forbid but we should) in a short time grow Poor and Beggarly.</p>
               <p>And in this condition ten in the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, in a little more time, will as well serve to do it, as if Money were at twenty: For (as was before remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred) in most of the Commodities the Earth bringeth forth, the Stock em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in Planting and managing of of them, makes a great part of their Price; and consequently, they may, with great Gain to themselves, under-sell us; our Stock with us going at double the rate that theirs goes with them.</p>
               <p>And this we see and feel too well by Experience at this present; for having a great surplusage of Corn, we can find no vent for it; the <hi>French</hi> with their own, the <hi>Dutch</hi> with the Corn of <hi>Poland,</hi> every where supplying the Markets at cheaper rates than we can afford it.</p>
               <p>And even our Cloaths, which have hitherto been the Golden Mine in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> I have heard many Merchants say,

That (except it be in some few of the finest sort of them, which is a Riches peculiar to this Nation) other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries begin to make them of their own Wool, and by affording them cheaper then we may, so to take our Markets from us.</p>
               <p>And this I hope may in part serve for Answer to the next Objection; that all great and sudden Changes are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly dangerous; for that Rule holds true, where the Body Natural or Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick is in perfect state of Health, but where there is a declining, (as I have some cause to fear there is, or may soon be with us) there to make no alteration is a certain way to Ruin.</p>

            <div type="subpart">
               <head>To the Third. That Money will be suddenly called in, and so all Borrowers greatly prejudiced.</head>
               <p>For that there may be a clause in the end of the Statute whensoever it shall be made: That it shall be lawful for all that have lent Money at ten in the Hundred, which is now forborn, and owing, to take for such Money so lent,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:51653:160"/>
and owing, during two Years after this Session of Parliament, such Use as they might have done if this Act had not been made: Whereby Borrowers shall be in less danger of sudden calling in of their Money, then now they are; for where the Lenders upon continuance of their old Security, may take ten in the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred; upon new Security they may be content with less, so the calling in of their Money will be to their own prejudice.</p>
               <p>And if there be any Borrower to whom this giveth not sufficient Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, if such Borrower have Lands of value to pay his debt, the worst con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition he can fear, is to have at the least twenty Years Purchase for his Land, wherewith to clear his Debts; for as I said before, Land being the best Security, and securest Inheritance, will still bear a rate above Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</p>
               <p>And so there being no Use allowed for Money above the rate tollerated in other Countries, Land will as readily sell at twenty Years Purchase, as it doth now at twelve. And I think there is no Borrower that hath Land of value
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:51653:160"/>
to pay his Debts, doth doubt if he will now sell his Land at ten Years Purchase, he might soon be out of Debt.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="subpart">
               <head>To the fourth Objection. That Money will be hard to be borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and so Commerce hindred.</head>
               <p>I answer, That it were true, if the high rate of Usury did increase Money within this Land; but the high rate of Usury doth enrich only the Usurer, and impoverish the Kingdom, as hath been shewed; and it is the plenty of Money within the Land that maketh Money easie to be borrowed, as we see by the Examples of other Countries, where Money is easier to be borrowed then it is with us, and yet the rate tollerated for Use, is little more then half so much.</p>
               <p>It is the high rate of Use that undo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth so many of the Gentry of the Land, which maketh the number of Borrowers so great; and the number of Borrowers must of necessity make Money the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:51653:161"/>
to be borrowed, whereas if Use for Money were at a lower rate, Land as hath been shewed, would be much quicker to be sold, and at dearer rates, and so the Nobility and Gentry would soon be out of Debt, and consequently the fewer Borrowers, and so to Trades-men and Merchants Money easie to be had.</p>
               <p>Further, let us consider if Money were called down, what Usurers would do with their Money; they would not I suppose long be sullen, and keep it a dead stock by them; for that were not so much as the safest way of keeping it: They must then either imploy it in Trade, purchase Land, or lend for Use at such rate as the Law will tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate: If it quicken Trade, that is the thing to be desired; for that will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich the Kingdom, and so make Money plentiful.</p>
               <p>And yet need not any Borrower fear that Money will so be imployed in Trade, as that there will not be sufficient of Money to purchase Land; where the <hi>Purchaser</hi> may have as much, or near so much Rent by the purchase
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:51653:161"/>
of Land, as he can by putting his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to Use: For a great number of Gentlemen and other in the Country, know not how to imploy any stock in Trade, but with great uncertainty, and less satisfaction to themselves, then the letting of their Money at a lower rate, or purchasing Land at twenty Years pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase or upwards.</p>
               <p>No doubt for the present there would be great buying and selling of Land, till Men had cleared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and payed their Debts: But in short time Land, as it is shewed before, would sell at so dear a rate, as Money let at a lower rate of Use, would bring in proportion as great a rate above the Rent that would be made then by the purchase of Land, as the rate of Money now is above the Rent of Land, purchased at fourteen or fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Years purchase, and so by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence Money would then as easily be borrowed as it is now, and so much easier, as it would be more plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and fewer Borrowers.</p>

            <div type="subpart">
               <pb n="226" facs="tcp:51653:162"/>
               <head>To the last and weakest of Objections. That there is now much Money of <hi>Foreigners</hi> in the Land, to be managed at ten in the Hundred, which if Money should be called down, would be carried out of the Land.</head>
               <p>There is no doubt it is true: But I desire to know, whether any man think it better for the State, that they should now carry out one hundred Pounds, or seven years hence, two; or fourteen years hence four; or one and twenty years hence eight: For so in effect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the multiplying of Interest they do.</p>
               <p>It will seem incredible to such as have not considered it, but to any that will but cast it up, it is plainly manifest, that a hundred Pounds managed at ten
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:51653:162"/>
in the hundred, in seventy years, multiplies it self to a hundred thousand pounds. So if there should be an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand pounds of Foreigners Money now managed here at ten in the hundred, (and that doth seem no great matter) that an hundred thousand pound in threescore and ten years, which is but the age of a man, would carry out ten Millions, which I believe is more then all the Coin at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in the Land.</p>
               <p>I know we cannot conceive how any such sum should be managed at In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, yet this is sufficient to make us little to joy in Foreigners Money.</p>
               <p>Besides, we must not conceive that the Money of Foreigners which is here managed at Usury, is brought into the Land in ready Coin or Bullion: The course is, That Merchants send over Bills of Exchange to their Factors, for which they receive our Money here; and this is the Money they manage at Interest, and so they eat us out with our own Money.</p>
               <p>The old comparison, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares Usury to the Butlers Box, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:51653:163"/>
to be remembred; Whilst men are at play, they feel not what they give to the Box; but at the end of <hi>Christmass</hi> it makes all, or near all, Gamesters loosers: And I fear the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison hold thus much farther, That there is as few escape that continue in Usury, as that continue Gamesters; a man may play once or twice, and leave a Winner, but the use of it is seldom without ruin.</p>
               <p>Now because I know mens private Interests doth many times blind their Judgments, and lest any may be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for their own, against the publick Good; I will desire them to remember, that if they have Lands as well as Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, that what they lose in their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, they shall get it in their Land; for Land and Money are ever in Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance one against the other; and where Money is dear, Land is cheap; and where Money is cheap, Land is dear.</p>
               <p>And if there be any yet so hearty a well-wisher to ten in the hundred, as that he still thinks it fit to be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, my wish is, That he and his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity may have the priviledge to
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:51653:163"/>
borrow, but not to lend at that rate.</p>
               <p>In the baginning of this Treatise, I did disclaim the proofs of the unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of Usury, leaving them to Divines, this one only (rising from the Premises) which may serve for all, I think fit to set down:</p>
               <p>It is agreed by all the Divines that ever were, without exception of any; yea, and by the Usurers themselves, That biting Usury is unlawful: Now since it hath been proved that ten in the hundred doth bite the Landed men, doth bite the Poor, doth bite Trade, doth bite the King in his Customs, doth bite the Fruits of the Land, and most of all the Land it self; doth bite all works of Piety, of Vertue, and Glory to the State; no man can deny but ten in the hundred is absolutely unlawful, howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever happily a lesser rate may be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</p>
               <p>To the King, increase of his Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms.</p>
               <p>To the Kingdom, increase of Land, by inriching of this.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>SInce the fore-going Papers were delivered to the Press, Mr</hi> Henry Dakers <hi>Merchant, sent me a most rational and admirable Treatise concerning Trade, called ENGLAND's INTEREST AND IMPROVEMENT, writ by</hi> Samuel Fortrey, <abbr>
                  <hi>Esq</hi>
               </abbr> one of the Gentlemen of the Majesties Privy Chamber, <hi>in which he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions something concerning the Interest of Money, in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Words, pag. 42.</hi> Viz.</p>
            <p>In the last place, concerning the Vse of Money; which being the Life and Sinews of Trade, it hath been the Opinion of some, that the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Vse were allowed for Money, the more would be the profit of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick;
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:51653:165"/>
for that Strangers finding a greater benefit to be made of their Money here, than other where, would send it hither, whereby Money would be much more plentiful amongst us.</p>
            <p>Indeed I should be of their Opinion, if as soon as by this means great sums of Money were transported hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, all their Money should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiscate to the Publick: But if other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, sure it cannot be denied, but the greater the Vse, the more the Profit to the Vsurer, and loss to the Debtor, so as in a few Years we should find our selves so little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched thereby, that when the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal should be again recalled, we should find but little Money left; all our own being wasted in Vse. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore indeed the true benefit to the Publick, is, To set the Vse of Money as low, or rather lower than in our Neighbour Countries it is; for then they would make no Profit out of us
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:51653:165"/>
by that means, but rather we on them. And it is the clear profit that we get of our own, that will make this Nation rich, and not the great sums we are indebted to others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Which I have here inserted, for such like Reasons:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, <hi>That the World may see I am not singular in this Opinion, although I thought I had been so, when first I wrote the afore-said</hi> Observations.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>For Confirmation of the Truth, by the Authority of a Person of such known Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>To give the Author his due Honour of being the first Observer,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="234" facs="tcp:51653:166"/>
               <hi>And I am sorry I know not the ingenious Author of the former Tract, that I might do right to his Memory,</hi> Who hath done more for his Country than would have been the Gift of some Millions of Pounds Sterling, into the Publick Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer.</p>
