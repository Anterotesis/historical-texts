            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>MY LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Book lately published, under the Title of a <hi>Specimen of the Errors and Defects in my History of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> calls upon me to say somewhat in Justification of that Work: Which I intend to do in the same Method in which I composed that History; and address it first of all to you, and then to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:47950:3"/>
the Publick, after it has past under your Censure; in which I know you will use the same friendly and plain Freedom that you did in perusing the other; and let nothing pass, to which you find any just, or even plausible exception. And indeed, if there are such Errors in that Work, as this <hi>Specimen</hi> pretends to discover, and puts the world in expectation of more, this being offered but as a sampler, that does not amount to above a Third part of what may come af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards; your Lordship must submit to bear some part of the blame.</p>
            <p>You know well, that you were the Person that prest me most to undertake that work; and to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage me to it, you promised me two very valuable things; the one was, The Copying-out of all your <hi>Collections</hi> relating to that time: The Value of this can only be judged by those who have seen with what an amazing Diligence, and to how vast an Extent, and in how exact a Method, all those many Volumes, I had almost said, that Library of Collections, is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested. No part of this pleased me more, than that Criticalness which is so peculiar to your self, in mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Dates so punctually; this being one of the most necessary, but withal one of the most unaccepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble (to me at least) of all the Labours of a Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. All this, as far as concerned my Design, I had the free use of, and I found my Work much shortned by it. Your other Promise was no less exactly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by you, of revising my first Draughts with that Censorious Severity that became your Zeal for
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:47950:3"/>
Truth, and for that <hi>Great Work,</hi> and also that most obliging Friendship with which you had honoured my self. And you did acquit your self in all Points as became an Honest Man, and a Faithful Friend. You spared me in nothing; you made both Rasures, Additions, and Alterations, with so much Reason, and so true a Judgment, that I all along felt what I can never enough acknowledge, how happy I my self was, and how great Advantages that work received from the share that you were pleased to take in it. So that I hope you will suffer me to say, that you ought to take some share likewise in the Fault that is found with the History, and the Reproaches that are cast both on it and on my self. Your Friends have hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to often blamed you, for being so minutely Critical in all you do, which as they do rightly judge, has depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the world of a great deal that might have been otherwise expected from you; and no man has taken the liberty to complain more of this than my self, who have seen the almost incredible Compass and Fulness of your Collections, which indeed seems to be beyond what the longest life of any one man could lay together; and has made me often say, That if you could be but at half the pains to bring out your Learning, that you have been at to lay it up, never man should merit so much of the Learned World, as you might do. This I confess made me the more secure in Publishing my <hi>Work,</hi> when it was so strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sifted by you; for I do still preserve the Copy that was so carefully perused by you. The greatest part of it was examined by you when you were in the Countrey, out of the Town, and out of that vast
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47950:4"/>
Application in which you laid your self so intirely out upon the greatest Parochial Cure of <hi>England,</hi> that it took up the whole Day constantly; and tho you gave the best part of the Night to your Study, yet I could not have expected, that a <hi>Work,</hi> in which every thing was to have been weighed, could have had such a share in those hours as it requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: But you reserved it for your Retreats into the Countrey, and there you answered, and even ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded my Expectation.</p>
            <p>You saw there was need of more than ordinary care, since we could not but expect, that every thing of a work of this nature would be enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into. I confess we expected it from other hands. We thought they of that Church which was most concerned to blemish the Honour of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> would have taken some pains to have discredited its <hi>History,</hi> especially when they saw it had the Reception which this Author confesses the World gave it; he is pleased to add, <hi>justly;</hi> but it seems this was meant only to gild the Pill, for he has been at a great deal of pains to lessen the Credit of it; with what Success, let the world judge. I do not believe that he did this to ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate himself with them whom he chiefly grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies in this: But I do acknowledge, I looked for nothing of this strain, from one of our own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:47950:4"/>It was no small addition to the Credit of the Work, that in the late Reign, in which the Book and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor both were in such Publick Disgrace, yet nothing was then Published to lessen its Esteem, and that it was appealed to by our best Writers, as often as Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Fact were under Debate. But</p>
            <q>Quod non fecerunt Barbari, fecerunt Barberini.</q>
            <p>I may be pardoned to quote from <hi>Pasquin,</hi> since he that deals thus with me vouches <hi>Athenae Oxoniensis.</hi> I do not trouble my self to find out the Author. I am assured that the Name in the Title page of <hi>Anthony Harmer</hi> is a feigned one; nor, as I hear, does the Stationer for whom it is printed, know any thing concerning him.</p>
            <p>But this is a matter of no Consequence. I am on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerned to consider what is said, and not who says it. And what Reason soever I may have to lay my conjectures on the true Author, yet that is not to enter into the present discourse: only I must crave leave to say, That a Man who pretends to have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Papers in his Hands, and to affirm a great many things upon his <hi>Single Word,</hi> without saying upon what authority he grounds most of his Corrections, ought to have named himself <hi>True,</hi> and to have told how he came by his Informations: that if we must take his word for every thing that he says, without searching into the truth of it, yet at least we might have been able to quote our Author, in those things for which he is pleased to give us no other Author but himself.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:47950:5"/>
He treats me always with so much slighting and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, that if things of that kind could provoke me much, I should be obliged to watch over both my Thoughts and Pen for fear they should run too quick. He owns those low Thoughts of me, that do indeed very well become me to entertain of my self, but look not so decent in another, whom to my knowledge I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver injured; and whom, if I guess right, I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to serve. But it is of no great consequence how meanly soever, he or any others may think of my Judgment or Learning, so long as that work is like, for ought I see or can learn, to remain still as entire in its reputation as ever, after such a keen at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt as he has made upon it.</p>
            <p>The Scorn he lays upon me, and the injuries he does me, in charging me with <hi>falshood</hi> so often, give me very little disturbance: And the prejudices that arise from such a way of Writing, are likelier to turn upon himself, than to do me much hurt. Those things do very ill become Scholars and Christians, but worst of all Men of our Profession, who ought never to be <hi>overcome of Evil, but to overcome Evil with Good.</hi> And therefore tho' the <hi>station</hi> I am in, did not reach him the regards that he owed it, how little so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I may deserve them, yet it obliges me to write in a Stile that becomes it, rather than in that which he has deserved from me. Only in one particular I desire not to be mistaken, as if the softness with which I treat him, was intended to Manage and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jole him, and so to prevent his going on with those farther Discoveries with which he threatens me: For
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:47950:5"/>
he says this was <hi>but a Months work at a destance from</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag 161.</note> 
               <hi>his other helps, and that he has only Noted what his Memory and present Collections suggested to him:</hi> Tho' by the way, ones <hi>Memory</hi> is no very good Voucher, in things of this kind: I published that Work on de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to undeceive the World, and to give true rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of things; therefore I am very well pleased to be informed my self, and to have the World told, tho' at my cost, if I have been mistaken in any thing. Truth is great and must prevail: Therefore I do so earnestly desire to see all that he can say of this kind, that if he brings out no more, I shall be much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed of my hope, and shall complain more of that, than of all the ill usage he has given me.</p>
            <p>As to the charge of <hi>Falshood</hi> that comes over so often, that it is plain by his frequent repeating of it, that he intended it should stick. I can and do affirm it, that to my knowledge, I did not willingly mistake, or misrepresent, nor so much as suppress any one particular relating to that great Transpaction: If I were called on to say this, with the highest solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of Religion, upon <hi>Oath,</hi> or at the <hi>Sacrament;</hi> I am sure I can do it with a good Conscience. I have also sent for Mr. <hi>Angus</hi> of St. <hi>Dunstans,</hi> who was then my <hi>Amanuensis,</hi> not having leisure or other op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities at present to enter into the retail of smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler Matters; and have asked him if he can imagine, how there should be so many mistakes about Dates in the transcribing of the Records; for this Author scarce allows one of them to be true. And therefore he thinks <hi>little Credit is due to the History, and that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pa<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:47950:6"/>
               <hi>will be of little value if once there appears just reason to suspect the Care, or the Fidelity of the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriber. And assures he the Reader, That of those Dates which he has examined, he has found near as many to be false as true.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Angus</hi> was amazed at this, and said he was ready to take his Oath upon it, that tho' he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self used his utmost diligence, to examine every Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per that he copied out; yet I was never satisfied with that, but examined all over again my self: So that I may sincerely say, what I once writ on a very solemn occasion, at the making of my Will when I went out of <hi>England,</hi> that I writ that Work, with the same fidelity that I should have given an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon Oath in a Court of Judicature.</p>
            <p>All this I think necessary to be said upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion; for I do hereafter expect to see this <hi>Specimen</hi> often brought out by those of the <hi>Roman</hi> Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to overthrow the credit of that History, which no doubt they will urge with a sort of Triumph, since one who seems zealous for our Church, does charge it with so much <hi>falshood.</hi> For all this, I do not suspect this Writer of any leaning to <hi>Popery,</hi> his zeal for justifying the Marriage of the Clergy, upon which subject he seems to have taken some pains, is enough to cover him from all such suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But yet he seems so <hi>sharpned</hi> against me, that rather than not vent his spleen, he would furnish them with a Weapon that they will not fail to make use of on many occasions. He seems indeed to have
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:47950:6"/>
some zeal for one of the worst Bodies of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Communion, <hi>the Monks of the later Ages:</hi> and is concerned for the Reputation both of their <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals</hi> and of their <hi>Learning;</hi> tho' for their <hi>Morals,</hi> where he censures me most severely for charging them with <hi>Incontinence,</hi> he is pleased in the very next Leaf to brand them with such Crimes as are <hi>not to be named among Christians.</hi> For their Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, tho' he is pleased to enter the Lists against me, yet I have reason to believe that he is no admirer of it. His studies have been much that way, and it is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral for Men to value that much on which they have bestowed much of their time: and perhaps he has been Infected by the Rudeness and Maledicence that runs through their Writings, to imitate so bad a Patern.</p>
            <p>He prevents one Objection to which he saw how open he was, that he was sensible somewhat was to be said to it. I had invited all that could give me a further light into those Matters, to communicate their Remarks or Discoveries to me, and promised both to Retract my Mistakes, and acknowledge from whose hands I had received better Imformation. But in answer to this, he sends me to a passage in the Second Part of the <hi>Athenae Oxonienses.</hi> I confess I did not expect to see a Writer of his <hi>Rank,</hi> descend so low as to cite such a Scribler, especially upon such an occasion. That <hi>poor Writer</hi> has thrown to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether such a tumultuary mixture of Stuff and Tat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and has been so visibly a Tool of some of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to Reproach all the greatest Men

of our Church, that no Man who takes care of his own Reputation, will take any thing upon trust that is said by one that has no Reputation to lose: He who has laid together all that the malice of Missio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries could furnish him with, to blemish the <hi>Work</hi> of one of the greatest Men of our Church, who was the lasting Honour of that See which I do now so unworthily possess, I mean Bishop <hi>Jewell,</hi> does but follow his stroke when he Calumniates my History: and he who has so barbarously attackt the Memory of my immediate Predecessor Bishop <hi>Ward,</hi> who was in so many respects one of the greatest Men of his Age, but that had appeared with too much zeal against <hi>Popery,</hi> to be spared by one of their Faction: he, I say, does but like himself, when he endeavours to blacken me with his Calumnies. But what is it that this angry Correcter is pleased to take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the word of such an Author?</p>
            <p>He says Mr. <hi>Fulman complained much that I had not dealt faithfully with him in Publishing his Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of my first Volume.</hi> I have not that <hi>despica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Book</hi> now by me, so I cannot quote the words, but this is the sense of them: and upon this the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the <hi>Specimen</hi> depends so intirely, that he thinks he is by it excused from using me in that friendly way that I had proposed, or in that Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table method which the Gospel directs. It happens that I have in this Instance a great variety of proo<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to shew the falshood of this Calumny. You know, My Lord, in particular, that it was Bishop <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ell</hi> of <hi>pious and blessed Memory,</hi> that engaged Mr. <hi>Fulman</hi> to send
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:47950:7"/>
up his Corrections to me. You your self, and indeed every body else, thought they were not of that moment, that they deserved so publice a notice as I took of them: I confess I was of that mind my self, but I thought it was fit for me upon that occasion, to behave my self so as to encourage all others to set me right, if they found I was mistaken in any particular; and that I might make as much advantage from Mr. <hi>Fulman</hi> as was possible, I bore with an odd strain of sourness that run through all his Letters. Bishop <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ell</hi> had prepared me for that; and I took every thing well at his hands. I in conclusion drew a short Abstract of all his Corrections, and sent it down to him to have his approbation of it, before it should be Printed: for it would have been too tedious to have published them so largely as he had sent them to me. I staid long for his Answer, till the Carrier that brought his Letters to me, had come up a second time, from those parts where he lived. It happened to be in the Month of <hi>February,</hi> before the Sitting of the <hi>Oxford</hi> Parliament: and Mr. <hi>Chiswell</hi> thought it might be of some Consequence in the Sale of the Work, to have it ready to appear at that time: so he pressed a dispatch: for all stuck at the return which I expected from Mr. <hi>Fulman.</hi> But the second Carrier bringing me no Answer, I took it for granted, that he was satisfied with the Abstract that I had sent him; so I put it in the Press. But before it was Printed off, the third Carrier came, and brought me his Answer. He was satisfied with the main of what I had prepared, only he desired that some Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration might be made in four or five Articles: and so
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:47950:8"/>
careful was I to gratifie him in every thing, that tho' these things were of no Consequence, yet I would needs have all to be reprinted: his Corrections hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to be all in one Leaf, so that Leaf was only reprinted, and pasted to the other half of the Sheet: and this will be found in the greatest part of the Copies of the First Edition of my Work, not in them <hi>all,</hi> for I stopt the Press which was working, and reprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a Leaf for all that were wrought off; and the rest were Printed with those Amendations. So that both from Mr. <hi>Fulman</hi>'s own Letters, which I still do keep, and from this real Evidence, it appears how unjustly this is laid upon me; and how weak an excuse this will prove for the method in which this <hi>Author</hi> has thought fit to deal with me. Since I had in that very Instance which he gives, used that Person with a Candour, that gave me a right to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect fair dealing from all others.</p>
            <p>Yet after all this and a great deal more that I might well urge, if I intended to aggravate matters, I must say that I have not seen any one thing, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to my History, that has pleased me so much as this <hi>Specimen</hi> does. It is plain that here is a Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer who has considered those times and that matter with much application: And that he is a Master of this Subject; he has the Art of writing skilfully, and how much soever he may be wanting in a Christian Temper, and in the decency that one who owns himself of our <hi>Communion,</hi> owed to the Station I hold in it; yet in other respects he seems to be a very valuable Man, so valuable, that I cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:47950:8"/>
a very sensible regret, see such Parts, and such Industry, like to be soured and spoiled with so ill a Temper: All the Heresies and Schisms in the Church have been either started or carried on by Men who have been <hi>pussed up</hi> with their <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and have not temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it with that <hi>Charity which edifieth.</hi> As he is a Man capable of making the severest Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations that the subject will bear: so he shows that he is so much set on it, and so inclined to disparage both <hi>me</hi> and my <hi>work,</hi> that no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy who reads his <hi>Specimen,</hi> will believe that he is tender of me, or that he has spared me in any one thing. So many Remarks that are so very trifling, force a Reader to believe, that he had a mind to make a great Muster, and that it was meerly want of Matter that led him t<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> make so much of things, on which no body, as far as I can hear, besides himself, sets any value. I confess I my self value his Book much more than I find any of the more judicious Readers tell me they do. I value it so much, that I do earnestly desire that all those who have my Book, will likewise procure this, as the best Apology that I know can be made for it. Since in all this Collection, there is not any one material fault, relating to any of the Transactions of the Reformation; and among those that he pretends to find, there is not any one in which, even he himself<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who is liberal in accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing me of <hi>Falshood,</hi> yet can charge me with any <hi>Fraud</hi> or ill <hi>Design:</hi> So that how much soever<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:47950:9"/>
the reputation of my own <hi>Learning</hi> or <hi>Exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> may be lessened by this <hi>Specimen,</hi> there is nothing brought to overthrow the Truth of the History, in any important Matter: and if in things of no moment there was not all that exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness used that was possible, the fault is the more pardonable. And after all, so the Credit of that <hi>Work</hi> stands unshaken, let the Credit of the Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an take its venture, and stand or fall as men may be disposed to be kind to him, or severe upon him.</p>
            <p>But after all that has been said in general, it is time now, that I should come to speak more particularly to the things contained in his Book: I once intended to have examined every one of all his Remarks; but your Lordship, as well as the rest of my <hi>Reverend Brethren</hi> with whom I spoke upon this Subject, were of opinion that his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections on my History, were not such as could deserve, that either I my self should spend that time upon them which they will require, and that may be certainly much better improved; or that I should publish any thing of that kind, the reading of which must needs be both flat and tedious: Since in that great variety which he has affected to bring together, there is not any one Instance that seems to be of any Consequence. Thirteen Years are now past since I finished that Work, so that now many of the things that I writ are quite out of my Head: Yet I have taken care to preserve all the Notes I then made, so
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:47950:9"/>
carefully, that without seeking for it elsewhere, I am confident, I could say enough in my own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, if I should again open my Papers. But the things excepted to here are such trifles, that I had much rather that the world should believe all that he says is true, than engage into so fruitless a Controversie. Therefore in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with your Advice, and which my own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations too, I shall decline this ingrateful Work, and shall only offer somewhat on the several Heads on which he exercises his Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. Which may be reduced to these four.</p>
            <p>The First are the Recapitulations that I make of the State in which things were before the Reformation; in which he triumphs often over me, as <hi>Ignorant of the Antient English History:</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 9. 10, 1<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> and not <hi>having so much as a competent know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it,</hi> nor being conversant enough among the writings of the Monks and other Authors that lived in the dark Ages, which preceded the <hi>Light.</hi> Indeed I am not at all out of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance to own that I have not much studied those Authors: The little that I have studied, did not encourage me to go further, than to carry in my mind a true view of the state of the Church in those times, from which I might be able to judge of the Necessity of a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. The barbarous Stile, the mixture of so much Fable, the great want of Judgement, and the gross partiality that runs thro the Writings of the <hi>Monks,</hi> has so disgusted me
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:47950:10"/>
at their Works, that I confess I could never bring my self to read them with Pleasure. If any one that has more Patience than I, can think it worth the while to search into that <hi>Rubbish,</hi> let him write Volumes of <hi>Anglia Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cra,</hi> and have the Glory of it for his Pains: And even these two Pompous Volumes have not at all changed my Tast. To dig in Mines were not to me a more ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful imployment. I am contented to take these things from second hand, and am no more out of <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ountenance to own this, than to own that I have no <hi>Arabick,</hi> or that I have not read the <hi>Talmud:</hi> A study after all that I should vastly prefer to the other, i<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> my Genius and Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure should favour it. After all this, he that <hi>Recapitulates,</hi> as I do in the places for which I am censured, gives only general views of things, to furnish ordinary Readers with some general Notions; so that no man expects an accuracy in this. Nor does the Historian here, deliver any thing upon the credit of special Vouchers, but only draws from other Books a short state of past times, to give an Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction to what he himself is to open: He nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pretends to be exact nor particular: and so the view he gives is upon the main true; this is never to be <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>urther canvassed. This Author has very probably examined the <hi>M<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nastick Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> and especially in the point of the <hi>Celiba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Clergy,</hi> more minutely than I have done: and so he is very full of disdain, and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:47950:10"/>
comes over with it very often, that <hi>I am igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the Ancient English History:</hi> I own it, as to that part in which he charges me, and if I had not been engaged in that Work, I should have continued still much more igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant than I am; without either remorse or shame. I confess <hi>that</hi> made me go further than otherwise I should ever have done, and much further than ever I shall do again: but he is not satisfied with my proficiency, and I must bear his displeasure. But, after all this, I must now say somewhat to your Lordship, and by the good leave of my <hi>Most Learned brother,</hi> My Lord Bishop of <hi>Worcester,</hi> to him likewise, whom I take the liberty to call in here for my excuse, without asking his leave; he being now at such a distance. It was on you <hi>both,</hi> that I chiefly depended as to the Correction of my Work: and all the World knows how exact you <hi>both</hi> are in those matters. I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber well I desired you to look particularly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to those Recapitulations, that went into the dark Ages. I thought I had good Authority for all I said, but I left it to you to judge whether I had or not: I am sure I never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to justifie any thing after either of you found fault with it. I had all reason to believe that you had all possible zeal for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving our Reformation so opened, that its Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story should appear with credit, and be liable to few exceptions: you both had also given me good reason to believe that you had some
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:47950:11"/>
care of my part in it, so that I conclude that either this Critick is mistaken in some of his Remarks; or, that you did not think such a minuteness was necessary, when a short Abstract was only proposed. It seems by this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, that your Lordship, whom I have often thought too <hi>exact,</hi> and by Consequence too <hi>slow</hi> in all that passes through your hands, has been in this too hasty, and too superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial: and perhaps you will receive this as a sort of Reprimand, which may oblige you hereafter to be yet more <hi>exact</hi> and more <hi>slow</hi> than you have hitherto been. But there is no need of all this Caution, since I hope all the World will impute the looseness and omissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which are blamed by the <hi>Specimen,</hi> and that were let pass by you., rather to your true Judgment, that led you to conclude that too full an exactness in such a part of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story, is as vicious an Abundance, as the full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the account in what is to be related, is ncessary and indispensable. Yet it is no small comfort to my self, and no little honour to the <hi>Work,</hi> that in so vast a variety of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capitulations, as are made in both Volumes, he could find so little, and that too so inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, for an entertainment to his <hi>Ill Humour:</hi> but I must not build too much on this, till I see what the rest of his performances may produce, which I must again tell him, I expect from him; otherwise I shall not take him for a <hi>a man of his word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:47950:11"/>A second Head of Censures is the many <hi>Dates</hi> that he finds to be amiss, upon which he gives other <hi>dates,</hi> without descending so low as to tell from whence he had them: which is a way of writing that no man ought to assume, when he is censuring another, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially when he appears under a disguised name. As for the <hi>dates</hi> he questions, I confess I cannot tell what to say to them, unless I should enter a new upon that whole matter: Many of them I had from your Lordship, and I am sure yours are right, if the Authors from whom you took them, are not in the wrong. Others I took out of the several Offices, from which I gathered my Materials: I might have writ them <hi>wrong,</hi> or Collationed them too negligently; or perhaps he is in the <hi>wrong</hi> when he pretends to set me right. He says he has made his Observations upon the Second Edition, which in the Title page is said to be <hi>Corrected:</hi> Yet he who will teach us all exactness, should have held to the <hi>first,</hi> for it was that only that I took care of, and left all Editions since to the Booksellers care: So I am only answerable for the first. Probably the Errata I drew out in the first, were <hi>Corrected</hi> in the Second Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and upon that account it might be said to be <hi>Corrected:</hi> but more new ones might have crept into it, especially in Figures.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:47950:12"/>When any thing of moment seems to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon a Date, it is in that case necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to use great Caution for fixing it right: but in the Course of a History, where ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Transactions occurr, about which there has been no Controversie, one may safely take Dates from the common Writers. If then I have often followed either <hi>Fox</hi> or <hi>Goodwin,</hi> I do not think my self lyable to a just Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, tho' the Date should be found to be wrong. But there is one thing, that does very much offend this Author, that I have questioned the Exactness of the Clerks in the <hi>enrolling of Dates:</hi> for he thinks that the <hi>Honour of the whole Nation</hi> is much concerned in the <hi>Truth of Records.</hi> I confess, I thought the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 3.</note> 
               <hi>of Nations</hi> was not struck at as oft, as the Diligence of any <hi>Clerk</hi> was questioned. We know that notwithstanding the <hi>Religious</hi> Care of the Copiers of <hi>Bibles,</hi> many of whom have been <hi>Monks,</hi> and so they are more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly under this Author's Protection; yet the <hi>different Readings</hi> make a competent Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume; and tho' the Dates of the <hi>Roman Laws</hi> have been, and that justly too, esteemed one of the surest Helps of <hi>Chronology;</hi> yet the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Gothofred,</hi> and <hi>Baluze</hi> have undertaken to prove that very many of them are wrong, even in the correctest Copies. When these Matters were fresher with me,<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than they are now, I could have given him many Proofs of, that Assertion, which yet is no <hi>Asseveration,</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:47950:12"/>
as he is pleased to call it: nor do I assert any thing of the <hi>Record</hi> there in question, but say only in general, that the Enrolments are not always exact as to Dates; and he must love Contradiction for Contradiction's sake, that will quarrel with this. If one dictates to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it is easy to mistake <hi>thirty</hi> for <hi>thirteen,</hi> or to write <hi>eighteen</hi> for <hi>twenty eight,</hi> or <hi>thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 28, 121, 153.</note> for <hi>twenty three;</hi> or sometimes to omit the Decimal Figure. After all, no designed Mistake appears to be among all these that<note place="margin">P. 127.</note> he reckons up: so there is neither <hi>Fraud</hi> in all this, nor <hi>Falsity,</hi> a word that some of his Friends think it would have become him to use more sparingly.</p>
            <p>But to conclude this Head, I promise you, that as soon as he has gone through with his whole Undertaking, and that he gives me reason to believe that his Correction of Dates is well-grounded, I will take care that none of them shall be forgotten, but will correct all by them, if my History comes to be printed again; for I desire nothing so much as to find out the Truth, even in the smallest and the least important Matters: And I shall not decline to own my Mistakes, whensoever a full Conviction is offered me, though it be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with all the Rudeness, of which this <hi>Specimen</hi> has given so many blunt, but designed Stroaks.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:47950:13"/>The third Head to which these Censures do belong, is the <hi>Conjectures</hi> that I was put to make in some places, where my Materials were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective: Upon <hi>some</hi> of these he falls, and thinks that he has evinced that they are groundless. If he had overthrown what I had affirmed as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, there had been some cause of Triumph: But I cannot imagine what harm it can do, either to a Man or to his Work, that when he is put to <hi>guess,</hi> it is found that he <hi>guessed</hi> wrong in some few Particulars: Yet after all, if I had a mind to value my self upon my <hi>Conjectures,</hi> it is plain, that many of those I made in the first Volume, are justified in the Second; and many of the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects</hi> that he supplies by the Papers which he has found, and that I never saw, justify others of my <hi>Conjectures:</hi> So that if it appears from his <hi>Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> that I guessed sometimes <hi>wrong,</hi> it is no less evident that I was much oftner <hi>right</hi> in my <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures.</hi> Nor is it a fair way, when one studies to expose another, for guessing wrong, only to attack the Conjecture it self, without examining the Grounds on which it was made: for if the Grounds were but specious and plausible, they may serve to justify the Conjecture, even where there appears better reason to lay it aside. He is offended, because Judgments that I gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<note place="margin">Pag. 51.</note> in the first Part, happen to be contradicted by what is related in the Second. Now a more can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did Censurer would rather have made an Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence from that in favour of my Sincerity; and have gathered from it, that I was not biassed by
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:47950:13"/>
any partiality to my own <hi>prejudging,</hi> but that I tell Truth, even though it happens to disparage or detract from what I had formerly writ. In fine, he thinks I say many things as Embellish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to my History, that are not well-grounded. These are indeed small Matters, and they prove to be yet much smaller, when they are doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully proposed: and whatever the strict impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the words <hi>no doubt</hi> may be, which has drawn such an angry Remark from him, yet in<note place="margin">P. 140. 141.</note> common use, it signifies no more than a <hi>Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,</hi> of which one believes himself pretty well assured.</p>
            <p>But one Prejudice still remains against all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures in History, since it ought to be a severe recital of Matters of Fact, without the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture of <hi>Conjectures</hi> and Inferences: Which not being certain, as they ought not to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, so they ought not to be proposed neither, since they prepossess and often mislead the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. It were enough, in answer to this, to cite the Authority of the most esteemed Writers of <hi>History</hi> that have frequently practised it; in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular of <hi>Padre Paulo,</hi> whose <hi>History</hi> of the <hi>Council of Trent</hi> I acknowledg I made my Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern: And that I might copy after it with some Resemblance and Success, I read it over five or six times before I set about that Work. If a Man is to write <hi>Memoirs,</hi> he must keep close to his Vouchers; but when he writes a <hi>History,</hi> on a Subject of much Consequence, and that was transacted long before his own Time, and that it is
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:47950:14"/>
visible that many of the most valuable Papers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to it, are lost, but that enough remains to give him a right view of the whole, and a Thread to guide him in it, he may certainly find many Hints of Things, which since he cannot lay before his Reader as <hi>Historical Facts,</hi> he may and ought to suggest them as Probabilities. And he who forms a true Character of a Man, from some of his secretest Papers, can frame Judgments, and see Likelyhoods that could never come in the way of one who only reads his Work; but does not dwell so long upon it, nor turn it so much in his Thoughts as he himself has done: And yet the offering of these may be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, since they may be of use to let his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der see further than he would do without them. For instance, he is angry for my taking notice<note place="margin">Pag. 87.</note> of <hi>Bonner's</hi> writing to his Friends for <hi>Puddings and Pears.</hi> I must desire you to observe his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity in this, since my Reflection did not fall upon these words of <hi>Bonner,</hi> but on his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that if his Friends did not furnish him with them, he would give them to <hi>the Devil, to the Devil,</hi> and to <hi>all the Devils.</hi> Now this from a <hi>Bishop in Affliction,</hi> writing to his private Friends, shewed a strange kind of <hi>Brutish levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi> and the observing of that was not below the <hi>Majesty of History,</hi> since <hi>Bonner</hi> acted so great a Part, during the whole time that I write upon; so that such a Stroke as <hi>this,</hi> in my poor Opinion, ought not to have been suppressed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:47950:14"/>I come now to the fourth and last Head of the <hi>Specimen</hi> which relates to those additional Discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries that he has made. He calls them the <hi>Defects</hi> of my History; how justly I leave to you, who are a true Critick in the use of Words. According to my sense, a <hi>Defect</hi> is a <hi>vitious want</hi> of that with which one might have supplied himself, if he had not been too careless. I cannot see what I could have done more than I did, to be well In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. I put Advertisements in <hi>Gazettes,</hi> desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the assistance of all that could furnish me with Materials. I let two Years and a half pass be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the publishing my first, and second Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume. I did in the first desire the assistance of all the Learned and Curious Men of the Nation: I went through all the Offices and Records that were about <hi>London</hi> or <hi>Westminster:</hi> I went to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> when I understood that Arch-Bishop <hi>Parker's</hi> Manuscripts were there. I was upon going to <hi>Oxford,</hi> had not Bishop <hi>Fell</hi> let me know that he was informed, they had nothing worth my Journey, that was not already printed. I met with great Assistances from many Learned Men, all which I gratefully and publickly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, and made the best use of them that I could. I do not see what more I could do.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship and several others of my wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Friends, set all Persons that you thought ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of assisting me, on work for Materials. That <hi>Great</hi> and <hi>good</hi> Man who was then Lord
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:47950:15"/>
               <hi>Chancellour,</hi> the late Earl of <hi>Nottingham,</hi> did on many Occasions recommend the procuring Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials for me in the most effectual manner. Their Majesties most deserving <hi>Attorney Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> that now is, was pleased without my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming to give him the trouble, to visit and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine some Offices for me in the Countrey. If our Author has been an Inquisitive Man of so long a standing, (he pretends to be longer, for he tells us of what he observed 20 Years ago) he could not but hear of all this, so there was occasion offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and Time given for him to have contributed out of his store. If I had refused any help that had been offered me, or had not look'd out and got together all that could be had; If I had either cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for no Assistance, presuming on my own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry; or if I had made so much haste, that I had prevented even the diligence of Learned Men, here had been great occasion for <hi>Censare.</hi> But he has got a <hi>Council-Book</hi> of the last four Years of King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth's Reign, and this must be brought out with great Pomp to reproach the <hi>Defects</hi> of my Work. I had the Book of the first two Years of that Reign. But though it was freely given me, I thought it did of right belong to the Crown, and delivered it in to be kept a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Council-Books: if this Author does the same with his, then his Quotations out of it may be examined. They make indeed the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luablest part of his Book. But neither these, nor any thing else he says, can be of any value, till he gives himself his true Name, that <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> one may know how to look into, or examine those things
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:47950:15"/>
that he pretends to have in his Hands.</p>
            <p>I have now gone as far as I can in so general a way; when your Lordship or any other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son whose Judgment is of weight with me, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vises me to descend into further Specialties, I shall not decline it. Yet if I had any Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to it, I think still it is best to make one Work for all, and to stay till he brings forth that which he has in <hi>Reserve;</hi> for I will still hold him to it: he must either give the World a great deal more, or he must expect to be thought to have insinuated that which he cannot perform. Only when he writes next, I wish he may do it with a better Spirit, and in a decenter Stile. He who knows so much, cannot judg so ill, as not to see that the attacking a Man's Reputation, but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially a <hi>Bishop's,</hi> in so great a Point, as is that of his <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Fidelity,</hi> upon which the Success of all his Labours, and the Credit of his whole Life and Ministry does depend, is not a slight thing, and is not to be attempted, unless one is very well assured, that what he objects, is not only just in it self, but that it is incumbent on him to do it. The Fame of a Man is a most va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable thing; and the Rules of <hi>Charity,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Detraction</hi> and <hi>Slander,</hi> are delivered in such weighty Strains in the New Testament, that it is no small matter to make so bold with them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:47950:16"/>The Years I have spent in the Service of the Church, the Labours I have undergone, and the Station I am in, deserve at least a modest and decent treatment: and my Diligence in that <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,</hi> the Designs I pursue through it all, and that Sincerity and Candor that even Enemies do acknowledg, appears in its Contexture; the great Additions I had made to what was formerly known, and the general Acceptance with which it has been entertained, both at Home and Abroad, ought to have made a Man to have thought well of what he did, before he had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack'd it at all: but if he was so full of his Matter, that he was not to be restrained, at least he ought to have writ it in another manner, with another Air, and in a Strain of Civility (I had almost said <hi>Respect</hi>) sutable to the Subject, and such as my way of Writing had deserved.</p>
            <p>If this Author is so made, that nothing of all this touches him; I am sorry for it, I will not treat him more roughly; but must despair of working on him so as to do him good: I should think it a very particular Happiness, to be able to turn such a Man to a better Mind, from that Sour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness which prevails over him at present. He seems capable of better and greater things; but till his Capacity and his Industry are sanctified to him, at another rate than this <hi>Specimen</hi> shews, he is a much worse Man for them, and will have a much greater Account to make at the last Day.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:47950:16"/>I ask your Pardon for having given you so long a Trouble. I am, with all possible Esteem and Respect,</p>
