            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WIthin a while after this: <hi>Scoggin</hi> came into <hi>Pickardie</hi> where liued a Knight of great liuings and had many good offices in the houſe, of which <hi>Scoggin</hi> had
<pb facs="tcp:12507:4"/>
great deſire to haue one, whereby he might the better maintaine himſelfe: whereupon he oftentimes made great ſute to the Steward and other chiefe officers in the knights houſe, and withall giuing them ſtill ſome one preſent or other, deſiring him euermore to remember him and they did anſwere him alwayes with one voyce, ſaying, ſtay awhile and thou ſhalt haue the firſt place that is voye. But ſtil when it came to the pinch, there was alwaies ſome excuſe or other, either that the office was too great, or that it was too little, and he ſhould haue a better, or that they were conſtrained to giue it to ſome of their brethrens kinſmen and without faile he ſhould haue the next that did fall and with theſe words they kept Scog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin ſtill off, ſo that the time went away, and he ſerued in the Knights houſe without any reward: in the end Scoggin perceiued him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe neuer the nearer, nor one whit the better but that he loſt his time, his mony &amp; his paines determined to make no longer ſute but ſtudied how to flowt them for their vngratefulneſſe: whereupon after this when he eſpied conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent time, he came to the chiefeſt among them, and praied them one after another to dine with him the next Sunday following at a houſe of one of his friends, for he could doe no leſſe then
<pb facs="tcp:12507:5"/>
beſtow a banquet of them in regard of their good wills towards him: They promiſed him one after an other to come together but yet fearing to haue a ſlender dinner of Scoggins prouiſion, giuing better credit to his wordes then his kitchin, each of them ſent his ſeuerall diſh of meate afore hand, the which Scoggin tooke and put all together in a great pot, but God knoweth in what order, for one had ſent a Capon in ſtewd broth, another Chickens in white broth, another powdred Beefe and Lurnups, another a legge of Mutton and ſuch like ſome ſent their meate ſodden and ſome ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted: when the ſteward and his fellowes came to dinner and ſaw this kinde of ſeruice, they had no ſtomackes to eate, but carried each man to ſo when their owne meat ſhould come in. <hi>Scoggin</hi> went to and fro very buſie, as one that was carefull to ſee them all ſerued, but at laſt one of them ſaid, I pray thée Scoggin take away theſe porridge and giue vs the meat that we ſent hither, why theſe are yours (quoth hee) ours ſaid they? that they are not yes truly quoth he to one, here is your beefe &amp; turnups, to another hee is your ſtewd broth, to another here is your white broth &amp; ſo forth, now truly ſaid they we were neuer thus vſed, now the diuel take all, for I thought this foole would
