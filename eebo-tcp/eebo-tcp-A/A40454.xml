            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>My LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have in obedience to your Lordſhips Commands, ſet down
in brief, the ſad and deplorable ſtate of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Nation, and
the apparent injuſtice, and innequality uſed in the preſent
Settlement of that Kingdom; which, in my opinion, (as I
formerly told your Lordſhip) hath chiefly occaſioned the heavy
Judgements of God, which our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation hath ſenſibly felt
theſe many years laſt paſt, and is to be feared, our Sufferings are not
yet at an end, if we do not take a ſpeedy courſe to humble our
ſelves, and appeaſe the wrath of his Divine Majeſty, who may
puniſh us farther, with as much Juſtice, as we have (contrary to
all Juſtice) hitherto oppreſſed the <hi>Iriſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It cannot be denyed, but that the Roman Catholicks of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
have infinitely ſuffered, during the late Uſurped Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
But they have done it cheerfully, and perhaps not without
ſome comfort; having had all that time, as Companions in Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering,
not only ſome of the Nobility and Gentry of <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>Scotland,</hi> but the King himſelf, and all the Royal Family; <hi>Ferre
quam Sortem patiuntur omnes, Nemo recuſat.</hi> But now ſince His
Majeſties happy Reſtauration, and during the univerſal Jubilee of
Joy over all the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Monarchy, that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> alone ſhou'd be
forced to mourn, but condemued to a perpetual Sufferance, far
ſurpaſſing thoſe they formerly endured under the Government of
<hi>Cromwel;</hi> is a Calamity rather to be deplored then expreſt. And
yet I find very few of our Nation any way touched with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
of the Miſeries ſnſtained by thoſe their Neighbours, and
that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> are not only vigorouſly perſecuted by their Conſtant
Enemies, but that they are wholly abandoned by their former
Friends (I mean their fellow-ſufferers for the ſame Cauſe) who do
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49336:3"/>
not now concern themſelves in their ſufferings. This conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
alone, together with the zeal I have always had for Juſtice,
and the commiſeration which nature imprints in every Man, are the
motives (next to your Lordſhips commands) which induce me to
undertake this ſubject. I ſhall therefore, by ſetting down matter
of Fact, and by examining the title of the preſent Poſſeſſors, as alſo
of the antient proprietors, diſcovered the wicked Artifices hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
practiſed, to deprive the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Nation, not only of the benefit
of His Majeſties Mercies, but alſo of His Juſtice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Broghil</hi> and <hi>Coot</hi> having by ſeveral Emiſſaries ſent into <hi>England,</hi>
felt the Pulſe of the Engliſh Nation, and finding the People gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
inclined to concur with the Loyal and Succeſsful endeavours
of the Lord General <hi>Monk,</hi> in order to the Reſtauration of His
Sacred Majeſty, convoqued a Convention in <hi>Dublin,</hi> of Perſons
newly Intereſted in that Kingdom, to conſult upon the beſt and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
courſe that might be taken to prevent the reſtoring of the <hi>Iriſh</hi>
Cavallers to thoſe Eſtates which the Conventioniſts and their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizans
enjoyed by the Uſurpers bounty, and which they had great reaſon
to believe, would be immediately reſtored to the ancient Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors
upon his Majeſties Re-eſtabliſhment. In order to this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution,
it was agreed upon, that all the Gentlemen of <hi>Ireland</hi>
ſhould be committed to cloſe Priſon, to render them incapable of
contributing to His Majeſties Reſtauration, in caſe His Majeſty
would chooſe to purſue His Royal Right by dint of Sword, rather
then to condeſcend to ſuch diſadvantageous conditions, as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventioniſts
did hope, and were fully perſwaded would be impoſed
upon him by the Parliament of <hi>England.</hi> It was alſo concluded,
that a man of Parts and Faction among the Presbyterian Party,
ſhould be imployed into <hi>England,</hi> to prepoſſeſs the People there,
with the Dangers and inconveniences which the reſtoring of the
<hi>Iriſh</hi> Natives to their Antient Eſtates, would infallibly
bring upon the new Engliſh Intereſt in that Kingdom. In
purſuance to theſe reſolutions, all the Priſons in <hi>Ireland</hi> were filled
with the Nobility and Gentry of that Nation, whom no imbecility
of Age, nor indiſpoſition of body could excuſe, nor any offered Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
anſwer for: Sir <hi>John Clotworthy,</hi> (a man Famons for plunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Somerſet</hi> Houſe, Murdering the Kings Subjects, and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
many other Treaſons and horrid Crimes,) was diſpatched into
<hi>England.</hi> This Perſon, who was always accounted as violent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49336:3"/>
the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> as he was known to be Seditious, and ill-affected to
Monarchy; No ſooner arriv'd in <hi>London,</hi> than he fill'd the peoples
ears with ſuch dreadful ſtories of a new Inſurrection in <hi>Ireland,</hi>
(where counterfeited Letters were read on the Exchange and ſeveral
Copies diſperſed over all the corners of the City) that His Majeſty
was warm in his Fathers Throne, when both Houſes of Parliament
(grounding their belief on <hi>Clotworthy</hi>'s aſſertion) preſented unto
him a Proclamation, to be ſigned againſt the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts, who
were ſaid to be actually in Rebellion, murdering his Majeſties Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Subjects, violently intruding into other Mens poſſeſſions,
with many other Characters of Infamy, rendring them odious
to all Nations. This Proclamation was publiſhed in <hi>London</hi> on the
Third day of <hi>June 1660.</hi> notwithſtanding that it was very well
known at that time, that there was not an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Man in arms in
any part of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clotworthy,</hi> encouraged with the good ſucceſs of his firſt Eſſay,
and ſtrengthened by a new landed recruit of Convention Agents
(among whom <hi>Broghil</hi> himſelf made one) having obſerved that a
general Act of Indempnity was ready to be paſſed to all His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
Subjects, and fearing that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> (if concluded therein)
would be conſequently reſtorable to their Eſtates; preſented a
<hi>Proviſo</hi> againſt them, to be inſerted in that Act; But this <hi>Proviſo</hi>
ſeemed ſo unreaſonable to both Houſes (eſpecially after that His
Majeſty had made a Speech to them for comprehending the <hi>Iriſh</hi> in
his general and Gracious Pardon (that they were fully reſolved to
extend the Act of Oblivion to the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts, as well as to the reſt
of his Majeſties Subjects. But the Conventioniſts, after ſome confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
with the<note n="*" place="margin">The D—of O—hath added as much to his own ancient Eſtate, by the new ſettlement of <hi>Ireland,</hi> as would have ſatisfied all the Claims of the juſt Adventurers. And <hi>Angleſey</hi> and <hi>Kingſton</hi> little leſs.</note> D—of <hi>O</hi>—(to whom, as 'tis ſaid, (with
what truſt I know not) they offer'd that great Eſtate, and vaſt
ſumms of Money which wrought ſo much upon his Grace, that,
in the Houſe of Lords he made a Speech againſt comprehending the
<hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts in the Act of Oblivion, ſaying, that the King had taken
that matter into his own hands, notwithſtanding that His Majeſty
had but few days before clearly declared himſelf for their being
comprehended in his General Pardon: ſo that it was carryed a-againſt
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49336:4"/>
them, to the great aſtoniſhment of all perſons of Honour and
Conſcience, that were informed of the corrupt ways whereby they
were excluded.</p>
            <p>Neither, my Lord, was the excluſion of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> out of the
Act of Oblivion, ſo ſatisfactory to the Convention Agents, if all
other paſſages to his Majeſties further Graces and Favours were
not ſhut up againſt them: And in order thereunto, they prevailed
with the firſt Minſter of State (whom they had gained to their ſide,
by what coloured Arguments he knows beſt himſelf) to re-call the
Commiſſion of Lord Deputy, which was formerly given to the
Lord <hi>Roberts,</hi> a perſon of known Honour and Integrity; The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventioniſts
having, obſerved that his Lordſhip was not to be won,
upon any account to forward their Deſign. This grand obſtacle
being removed out of the way, <hi>Broghil, Angleſey, Clotworthy,</hi> and
<hi>Mervin,</hi> (with the aſſiſtance of <hi>Steel, Roberts</hi> and <hi>Petit)</hi> after three
Months labour, brought forth that monſtrous iſſue of their brain,
which was expoſed to the World under the Name and Title of <hi>His
Majeſties moſt Gracious Declaration for the Settlement of</hi> Ireland.
This was their Maſter-piece, and hath been ever ſince the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work
of all ſubſequent Acts which were eſtabliſhed for the farther
Settlement of that Nation.</p>
            <p>The firſt branch of the Declaration confirms the Adventurer in
his poſſeſſion; the Second ſecures the Soldier in his Debenture; the
Third ſatisfies the 49 Men; the Forth aſſures unto the Tranſplanted
<hi>Iriſh</hi> the Land Decreed unto them in the Province of <hi>Conaught,</hi> and
County of <hi>Clare;</hi> The Fifth makes mention of thoſe <hi>Iriſh</hi> Officers
who ſerved his Majeſty in <hi>Flanders,</hi> as alſo the Generality of the
Nation who pretend to Articles. My Lord, is not this a bleſſed
Declaration, which provides in ſo large a manner for ſo many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Intereſts? A Declaration that ſatisfies the Natives, and yet
diſpoſſeſſeth none of the <hi>Cromwelliſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To underſtand it well, we muſt mount a little higher, and call
to our remembrance how the Rump-Parliament divided the ſpoils
of that conquered Nation, in the Year 1653. Ten Counties were
allotted to the Adventurers, Twelve conferred on <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
and three of the Barren Counties given by way of charity to
the tranſplanted <hi>Iriſh;</hi> Theſe, by computation, make up 25
Counties, the remaining ſeven (for <hi>Ireland</hi> contains in all but 32
Counties) together with all the Cities and Corporations of that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49336:4"/>
Kingdom, were reſerved to the Common-wealth. Now this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
confirms the Adventurers, Souldiers, and tranſplanted
<hi>Iriſh</hi> in their preſent poſſeſſions; And moreover, it aſſigns to ſeveral
other uſes, the Seven remaining Counties, and all the great
Towns of <hi>Ireland,</hi> which were not diſpoſed of by the Common-wealth:
One of the Counties being deſigned to ſupply the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency
of the Adventurers Lots; another, to ſatisfie the Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances
on the Lands already laid out to Adventurers and Souldiers;
The third to reprize ſuch as were removed from the Lord Duke of
<hi>Ormond</hi>'s Eſtate; and the other Four Counties, with all the Cities
and Corporations of the whole Kingdom, (a pretty grant) being
aſſigned to the Proteſtant Officers who ſerv'd His Majeſty in <hi>Ireland</hi>
at any time before the year 1649. After this Solemn diviſion and
diſtribution made of every Houſe, and every Acre of Land, over
all the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland.</hi> Some 500 <hi>Iriſh</hi> Gentlemen (who
alſo ſerv'd his Majeſty in <hi>Flanders)</hi> are named in the Declaration,
to be forthwith reſtored to their ancient Eſtates; but not, until
Lands of equal value, worth and purchaſe, are firſt found out to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
the Adventurers, Souldiers, and the reſt now in poſſeſſion;
a work no more nor leſs feaſible, than the creation of another
<hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Lord, this Declaration was publiſhed on the <hi>30th.</hi> of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vomber
1660.</hi> and at the ſame time <hi>Broghil</hi> created Earl of <hi>Orery,</hi>
and Sir <hi>Charles Coot</hi> made Earl of <hi>Montrath;</hi> were joyned in
Commiſſion with the Lord Chancellor <hi>Euſtace,</hi> as his Majeſties
Lords Juſtices of that Kingdom; Sir <hi>John Clotworthy</hi> (who was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
created Lord Viſcount <hi>Maſſerene)</hi> Sir <hi>Audley Mervin,</hi> and ſome
others of the Convention-Agents, ſtaid at Court, to draw up pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vare
Inſtructions for the better executing his Majeſties Declaration:
And becauſe Innocents, <hi>viz.</hi> Such as never offended his Majeſty,
or His Royal Father, were the only people to be reſtored without
<hi>previous repriſals,</hi> the Conventioniſts made it their grand work
to qualifie an <hi>Innocent,</hi> that it ſhould be Morally impoſſible to find
any ſuch in <hi>rerum natura, virum, innocentum quis inveniet?</hi> Eleven
qualifications were ordered for their Tryal and thoſe ſo rigid and
ſevere, that <hi>Clotworthy</hi> and his Companions (who had the word<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of them) did verily believe there could not be a man found in
all <hi>Ireland</hi> that ſhould paſs untoucht through ſo many Pikes: For,
not only the inoffenſive perſons, who never took Arms, who never
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49336:5"/>
enter'd into the Confederacy with the reſt of their Countreymen,
if they did but pay them the leaſt Contribution out of their Eſtates,
if they did but reſide in the <hi>Iriſh</hi> quarters, although in their own
own houſes; not only theſe, I ſay, were declared to be no Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents,
but ſuch as lived all the War-time in <hi>England;</hi> ſuch as were
with Hi<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Majeſty at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and ſerved in his Army, if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
any Rent from their Tenants in <hi>Ireland,</hi> were by virtue of
one of the Eleven Qualifications, to be held for Nocents.</p>
            <p>But among all the other Qualifications, that of taking an <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement</hi>
(which was adminiſtred unto all his Majeſties Subjects
in the three Kingdoms) was a very notable one; This Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was forced upon the <hi>Iriſh</hi> in ſo high a nature, that thoſe who
would not take it, were debarred, not only from the benefit of
the Law, but alſo expoſed to an innevitable danger of death, the
Souldiers of <hi>Cromwels</hi> Army being commanded by publick Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
to kill all they met on the High-way, who carried not a Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate
about him, of having taken that Engagement: Commands
which were cruelly executed on ſilly Peaſants, who, out of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
or want of care, having left their Tickets at home, were bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barouſly
murdered by the mercileſs Souldiers: My Lord, it is very
remarkable, that they who deviſed this Engagement, who hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſubſcribed unto it, and forced others to take it, ſhall not be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned
or held criminal; and that thoſe who never ſaw it before
it was miniſtered unto them, who abhorred it in their hearts, and
were forced to ſign it, to avoid a bloody and violent death, ſhall
be declared <hi>Nocents,</hi> and an irrevocable ſentence of loſing their
Eſtates given againſt them; and the Eſtates ſo forfeited, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
on thoſe very Perſons who compelled the Proprietors to that
Forfeiture. By this Qualification alone, a Man may judge of the
reſt.</p>
            <p>To Crown this grand work of ſettling <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Conventioniſts
(having worded the Declaration and Inſtructions to their own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage)
prevailed with their great Patron, to have themſelves
named the only Commiſſioners to put in Execution his Majeſties
Declaration for the Settlement of <hi>Ireland,</hi> This un-uſual, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
never before heard of courſe of Juſtice, (one of the parties
being made Judge of the Caſe) appeared ſo ugly and terrible to the
<hi>Iriſh,</hi> that many of them could hardly be perſwaded to believe,
that his Sacred Majeſty was reſtored to the peaceable and free
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49336:5"/>
poſſeſſeſſion of his Crown and Kingdoms, ſeeing the very ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
who tyranized over them during <hi>Oliver</hi>'s Reign, were now
not only confirmed in their formed in their former charges, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
to places of greater Truſt; but alſo newly Commiſſioned
with an unlimited power, to give a final and deciſive Sentence of
all the Titles and pretentions of the unfortunate Natives. This
prepoſterous way of proceeding, having not only incenſed the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſed
<hi>Iriſh,</hi> but alſo ſcandalized all the moderate men of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
another courſe was judged fit to be taken, leſs ſhameful in
appearance, but in effect the very ſame: The new Court of Claims
was annulled, and the Lords Juſtices were ordered to call a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
which met on the <hi>8th.</hi> day of <hi>May 1661.</hi> The Lower
Houſe of this Parliament was all compoſed of <hi>Cromwelliſts,</hi> and
but very few of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Peers were admitted to ſit in the Houſe
of Lords, under the pretence of former Indictments. This Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
made the firſt Act of Settlement, which they entitled, <hi>an Act
for explaining His Majesties Declaration for the Settlement of</hi> Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.
This Act decides all the doubtful expreſſions of the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in favour of the <hi>Cromwelliſts,</hi> and to the diſadvantage of the
Natives, it allows only a Twelve-months time for the tryal of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocents;</hi>
But thoſe <hi>Iriſh</hi> Gentlemen who ſerved His Majeſty abroad,
together with the generality of the Nation pretending to Articles,
(half a ſcore perſons only excepted, who were particularly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
for) are for ever debarred by this Act, to recover their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates
without previous Reprizals, which is a thing not to be had in
nature.</p>
            <p>My Lord, I cannot omit minding your Lordſhip of a remarkable
expreſſion in the preface of this Act, <hi>that the</hi> Iriſh <hi>Rebels were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
by His Majeſties Proteſtant Subjects, in his Majeſties abſence.</hi>
Theſe <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebels when they were conquered, fought under the
command of the Lord Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> His Majeſties Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and after under the command of the Lord Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs
of <hi>Clanrickard,</hi> His Majeſties Lord Deputy for that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
and thoſe Proteſtant Subjects who conquered them, were
called <hi>Cromwel Ireton, Jones, Reynolds, Broghil, Coot, Venables,
Hewſon, Axtel,</hi> &amp;c. who vigorouſly purſued the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebels for
no other reaſon, but that they conſtantly denyed the Authority of
the pretended Commonwealth, and unalterably adhered to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
of <hi>Charles Stewart,</hi> (for his Majeſties now <hi>Proteſtant Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:49336:6"/>
were wont, in that time of conqueſt, to call Our Gracious
Soveraign;) but now adayes they ſing another note, and ſpeak
quite another language; having eſtabliſhed for a fundamental
Law, <hi>that the</hi> Iriſh <hi>Rebels were conquered by his Majesties Proteſtant
Subjects in his Majesties abſence.</hi> This being paſſed, and the Royal
aſſent given to it, Sir <hi>Richard Rainsford,</hi> and the reſt of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
appointed by his Majeſty to decide the claims of the
<hi>Iriſh,</hi> in purſuance of this Act, landed in <hi>Dublin,</hi> about the of 1662. And having ſome time to ſtudy
the Act, they plainly underſtood, that none of the unfortunate
Natives could be reſtored to their Eſtates, but the Ten perſons who
had particular proviſo's inſerted therein, and ſuch others as would
prove their Innocence in open Court. The Commiſſioners began
their firſt Seſſion on the day of <hi>February,</hi> and the
Court continued until the of <hi>Auguſt</hi> following. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
this time the Claims of near upon a thouſand <hi>Iriſh</hi> were heard,
whereof the one half were declared Innocents, notwithſtanding all
the rigid Qualifications againſt them.
The time limited for ajudging Innocents
being expired,<note place="margin">In the Province of <hi>Ulſter,</hi> but Three of the Natives re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored, <hi>viz.</hi> My Lord of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trim,</hi> Sir <hi>Henry O-Neil,</hi> and one more of an inconſiderable Eſtate. In the Province of <hi>Conaught,</hi> but Four <hi>viz.</hi> the Earl of <hi>Clanrickard,</hi> Lord of <hi>Mayo,</hi> Coll. <hi>John Kelley,</hi> and Coll. <hi>Moor.</hi>
               </note> Sir <hi>Richard Rainsford</hi> (a
moſt juſt and upright man) would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
no farther, expecting an enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of time to hear out the reſt, who
were 7000 in number, and who had as
much reaſon to pretend a title to their
Eſtates, (until they were heard, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned)
as thoſe who were already
judged; For every man is to be held Innocent until he be convict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and eſpecially thoſe who durſt venture upon ſo ſevere a tryal:
For, that part of the Nation (which was involved in the War)
did not pretend to Innocence, but claim the benefit of Articles.
But this enlargement of time being flatly denyed by the firſt Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
of State, the Court of Claims was at an end, the intereſſed
party made Judges by <hi>Clarendon,</hi> and indifferent men not admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and the Parliament prepared an aditional Bill
of Settlement,<note place="margin">Which the Natives call the black Bill,</note> which came into <hi>England</hi> in the
of <hi>May, 1664.</hi>
            </p>

               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:49336:6"/>
               <hi>By this additional Act, it is decreed, that no benefit of Innocency,
or Articles, ſhall be allowed from henceforth, to any of the</hi> Iriſh
<hi>Natives. The words of the Text,</hi> pag. 8. l. 22. <hi>are theſe;</hi> And
it is hereby declared, that no Perſon or Perſons, who by the qualifications
in the ſaid former Act, hath not been adjudged innoieut, ſhall at any
time hereafter be reputed Innocent, ſo as to claim any Lands or Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
hereby veſted; or be admitted to have any benefit or allowance
of any future adjudications of Innocence, or any benefit of Articles
whatſoever.</p>
            <p>To ſalve this grand breach of publick Faith, the Law of God,
and Nations, and to give ſome colour of Juſtice, to an action which
is evidently repugnant to <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and the Fundamental
Laws of <hi>England</hi> (to condemn ſo many thouſands before they are
heard) it is ordered by the ſame Act, that ſome Fifty four perſons
of the Nobility and Gentry of <hi>Ireland,</hi> (who likely deſerved his
Majeſties particular favour, and whoſe names are ſpecified in the
Act) ſhall be reſtored unto their ſeveral and reſpective principal
Seats, and unto 2000 Acres of Land thereto adjoyning; provided
always, that the Adventurers, Souldiers, and 49 men who are to
be removed, ſhall be firſt ſatisfied by ſome other forfeited Lands,
in equal value, worth, and purchaſe; The tranſplanted <hi>Iriſh</hi> are
purpoſely left by this Act upon very doubtful terms, that in caſe
of neceſſity (if the ſtock of Reprizals ſhould ſall ſhort) their preſent
poſſeſſions might ſerve to Reprize the Adventurers, Souldiers, 49
Men, and Grantees already removed by the reſtored Innocents,
and the Ten Proviſo-men in the former Act, or to be removed by
the <hi>nominees,</hi> and ſome three or four perſons more particularly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
for in this additional Act. The Forty Nine men are expreſly
forbidden by this Act, to ſet or Let by way of Leaſe, or otherwiſe
any part of their Lots within the walled Towns and Corporations,
or at a certain diſtance thereunto: to any <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts, under the
penalty of looſing what is Let, and forfeiting as much more,
there is a general Clauſe in the Act, that all Clauſes and proviſoes
therein contained, which admit any doubtful expreſſion, ſhall be
always conſtrued to the advantage and favour of the Engliſh Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,
and ſeveral other proviſons are made, all tending to the
deſigned extirpation of the Natives.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:49336:7"/>
This deſtructive Act, after many long conſultations, wherein the
firſt Miniſter of State did always imploy the utmoſt of his uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouled
power, to countenance the <hi>Cromwellian</hi> party, and the
Kings Solicitor General (who had the penning of the Act, made uſe
of his Rhetorick and Knowledge in the Law, to plead in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half,
(the favour of the one being eaſily gained, at the rate of
ſeveral vaſt ſums of ready money, and the promiſe of an Eſtate
of 6000 <hi>l.</hi> a year for his Son; and the pains of the other, being
modeſtly rewarded by a ſmall Fee of 8000 <hi>l. ſterl.)</hi> This Act, I

               </hi> (notwithſtanding all the oppoſition given

in the great Mortality, which then began to increaſe in the
City of <hi>London;</hi> and when I heard many moderate men ſay, <hi>we
are juſtly puniſhed by God, for the injuſtice done to the</hi> Iriſh. It is
now more than two years ſince the Act went over into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and
the 52 Nominees who were to be reſtored as they verily believed)
to their chief houſes, and 2000 Acres of Land, have not yet got
the poſſeſſion of a Cottage, or of one Acre of Ground; which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
very well with <hi>Ororye</hi>'s railery lately expreſſed, <hi>That it was
intended by the Act, that they ſhould be only Nominees,</hi> nomine <hi>reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
but not</hi> re, <hi>for that was never intended;</hi> and yet the ſame <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rory</hi>
aſſured to the King, that there was a ſufficient ſtock of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſals
to ſatisfie all Intereſts.</p>
            <p>My Lord, this is the true ſtate, in brief, of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Caſe, as to
matter of Fact, ſince the firſt day of his Majeſties moſt happy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration,
to this Inſtant. Let us now examine matter of Right,
and ſee what Title the ſeveral Intereſts obſtructing there eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> can juſtly pretend to the Eſtates of the diſtreſſed
Natives. Theſe different Intereſts can be reduced to four principal
ones; the firſt is, that of the Adventurers, the ſecond of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
the third of the Forty nine Men and the fourth of the <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees;</hi>
We will begin with the Adventurers.</p>
            <p>Theſe are certain Inhabitants of <hi>London,</hi> who in the year 1641.
pretended to venture their momes to reduce the Rebels in <hi>Ireland,</hi>
(but intended, as afterwards appeared, to deſtroy the King) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the aſſurance of getting ſuch a quantity of the Rebels Lands in
proportion to the ſums they laid out, and in purſuance of an
Act of our Engliſh Parliament, which then paſſed to that effect.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49336:7"/>
By which Act, it is ordered that the mony ſo laid out, ſhould be
employed in the Service of <hi>Ireland;</hi> and that, (after the Rebels
were declared by both houſes to be wholly conquered) a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
ſhould iſſue forth under the great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> to make
a ſtrict enquiry through all the Counties of <hi>Ireland,</hi> of Eſtates
forfeited by the Rebellion, to be diſpoſed of for the ſatisfaction of
the Adventurers. Neither of theſe conditions were hitherto ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
for the money laid out, was all, (or at leaſt, for the
greateſt part) imployed to buy arms and ammunition to fight
againſt his Majeſty in <hi>England.</hi> The Rebels were never yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
by both Houſes of Parliament to have been conquered, nor
any Commiſſion iſſued forth under the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> to
enquire after Forfeitures: It is true, that the remaining Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Houſe of Commons, made an Ordinance in the year
1652. (without the concurrence of the Houſe of Lords) that the
Rebels were wholly conquered; And that conſequently aſſigned
Ten Counties to the Adventurers, without iſſuing forth any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
under the great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> to examine whether the
Lands therein contained were forſeited or no. Of theſe ten Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
the Adventurers of the doubling Ordinance (who were to
have for their reſpective Sums laid out, double the quantity of
Land aſſigned to the firſt adventurers) have proportion, becauſe
their money was given to the long Parliament in the year 1644.
When they were in actual Rebellion againſt His Majeſty.</p>
            <p>The late King underſtood very well the nullity of this act hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
never made mention of the adventurers intereſt in all the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Peace which paſs'd between His Majeſty and the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
in <hi>Ireland;</hi> which certainly ſo juſt a Prince as <hi>Charles</hi> the
Firſt was known to be, would never have done, if he had concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
himſelf any way obliged by that act to provide for them. But
ſuppoſing that the act of <hi>decimo ſeptimo Caroli</hi> in the behalf of the
<hi>London</hi> adventurers, had not been defective; can thoſe of the
doubling Ordinance expect any benefit by that Law? Can the
firſt adventurers whoſe Moneys were diſpoſed to other uſes than
the relief of the Proteſtants in <hi>Ireland,</hi> pretend any advantage by
that act? nay, can thoſe few Perſons of the firſt Rank (whom
we call the juſt adventurers, and whoſe moneys were really im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in the <hi>Iriſh</hi> War) lawfully enjoy the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Land, until the
Rebels be declared by the two Houſes of Parliament to be wholly
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49336:8"/>
conquered; until a Commiſſion iſſues forth under the great Seal
of <hi>England</hi> to examine who are the Rebels, and who are Innocents;
and until, after the performing theſe eſſential Formalities re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
by the Act, they receive by a juſt and legal way of proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
their reſpective Proportions of the Forfeited Eſtates?</p>
            <p>The firſt Miniſter of State (a Lawyer by his firſt profeſſion)
cannot be ignorant of theſe varieties; eſpecially when he perſwades
his Royal Maſter to ſpeak after this manner, in his Declaration
for the Settlement of <hi>Ireland,</hi> pag. 7. <hi>Therefore in the firſt place,
in order to the ſettlement of that Intereſt claimed by the Adventurers,
alth<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ugh the preſent Eſtates and Poſſeſſions they enjoy, if they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined
by the strict Letter of the Law, would prove very defective
and invalid, as being no ways purſuant to thoſe Acts of Parliament up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which they pretend to be found, but rather ſeem to be a structure
upon their ſubſequent aſſent, both to the different</hi> Mediums <hi>and ends,
than the obſervance of thoſe; yet who being always more ready to conſult,</hi>
&amp;c. Can any thing be ſpoken more plain to prove the nullity of
the Adventurers Title by the Act of 17. <hi>Car. 1?</hi> And could the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Judge of the Court of Equity give a more unjuſt ſentence,
than to ſay, although this Party can pretend no right to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
in queſtion, yet I am pleaſed to adjudge it for him? The
matter in diſpute is no leſs than the land of ten Counties, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
pretending are the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Proprietors, and the <hi>London</hi> Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers:
The firſt enjoyed it for ſo many ages, they have their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
and Evidences to ſhew for it, and they loſt it at length upon
the account of Loyalty, fighing for the Kings Intereſt againſt the
Murderers of his Royal Father: the laſt (as 'tis acknowledged
by the words of the Text) have no other Title but what they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
from the Ordinance of an uſurped Government, for having
disburſed vaſt ſums of Money to countenance Rebellion, to pull
down Monarchy, and put up a pretended Common-wealth. And
yet the Land is adjudged for them, and confirmed to them and
their Heirs for ever:</p>
            <p>The Second main Intereſt obſtructing the Reſtoration of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi>
is that of <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Souldiers, who are not mentioned in the Act
of 17 <hi>Caroli;</hi> neither indeed do they pretend any other Title to
their Eſtates, but that of the Sword, which they have always im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
againſt the late King, and his preſent Majeſty, enjoying
as a Sallary for their ſervice, all the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Eſtates in twelve Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49336:8"/>
I do not think any man will be ſo impudent as to juſtifie this
prodigious Title; I am ſure their greateſt Patrons never durſt ſay
they were <hi>juſt,</hi> but they ſaid very often, it was convenient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
them in poſſeſſion of other Mens Land. And perhaps we ſhall
not find many other States-men (among the Followers of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel)
who will allow a <hi>conveniency</hi> ſo apparent againſt Juſtice: <hi>Ruat
Coelum &amp; fiat Justicia,</hi> is a <hi>Motto</hi> which better becomes a Lord
Chancellour; Then, let us not do what is juſt, but what is conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient.</p>
            <p>It is indeed a moſt wonderful conveniency to diſpoſſeſs the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Proprietor who Fought for the King, and give his Eſtate to
a Fanatick Souldier who Fought for <hi>Cromwel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To ſuppor this pretended Conveniency, the firſt Miniſter of
State made uſe of a ſtrong Argument, derived from the great pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the <hi>Cromwelliſts</hi> in <hi>Ireland;</hi> and thus he makes it out:</p>
            <p>The Engliſh Army is very conſiderable now in <hi>Ireland,</hi> they have
Swords in their hands, and they are in poſſeſſion of all the great
Towns, and ſtrong holds in that Kingdom, it is not therefore ſafe to
irritate them; Nay, there is an abſolute neceſſity (as the caſe ſtands)
to confirm them in their preſent poſſeſſions, For we muſt not do
what is juſt, but what is is convenient. Theſe words were often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
in Councel, as ſo many Oracles, and perhaps the greater
Stateſman did not ſeriouſly reflect, whether the ſame Argument
might not ſerve as well to confirm all the <hi>Cromwelliſts</hi> in <hi>England,</hi>
in their unlawful Acquiſitions of the Crown and Church-Lands, and
ſo many Cavaliers Eſtates, whereof they were diſpoſſeſſed upon
his Majeſties Reſtauration, without any great noiſe, and leſs dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
and yet they were then very conſiderable: They had Swords
in their hands, and they were in poſſeſſion of all the ſtrong holds of
the Kingdom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Lord, I have been all over the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and
aſſure your Lordſhip, that the old Inhabitants and Natives of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
are Ten for one, and far the more conſiderable Party; But
large Sums have made that corrupt Miniſter ſay any thing that
ſeemed advantagious to ſupport that other Intereſt: I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
My Lord, admitting them as inconſiderable as he would
have them, it cannot be half ſo formidable, as the power of that
party was in <hi>England</hi> when the King came in. Theſe were all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded
in leſs then Six Months time, and now 'tis more than Seven
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49336:9"/>
years, that the Fanatick Army is maintained in <hi>Ireland</hi> without
any neceſſity, which, occaſions that his Majeſty receives no Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
out of that vaſt and fertil Kingdom; Nay, he is obliged to
ſend yearly a conſiderable ſum of Money out of <hi>England,</hi> for the
maintenance of that Army: For my part I cannot nnderſtand how
the King might ſafely reduce the Engliſh Army, and that it ſhould
be dangerous for him to disband the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Forces, who were not
half ſo numerous, nor ſo much to be feared as thoſe in <hi>England.</hi> If
the want of Money hindred their disbanding at once with their
Brethren in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland;</hi> might not they reduce by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
and by Regiments, in eight years time? I think it is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
evidenced that the <hi>Cromwellian</hi> party in <hi>Ireland</hi> have no
more power than what his Majeſty hitherto is pleaſed to grant
them, by the advice of his firſt Miniſter, who upholds that Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Army for his own ſordid, if not wicked ends. Let that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite
that perſwades his Maſter to tolerate Injuſtice and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
upon the account of a Servile Fear, have a care that he
be not one day convinced either of ignorance. <hi>Rex eſt qui poſuit

            <p>The third grand intereſt, and the moſt deſtructive to the Natives,
is that of the Proteſtant Officers, who ſerved his Majeſty (or the
Parliament) in <hi>Ireland,</hi> before the year 1649. Whoſe arrears
have been caſt up, and ſtated to the vaſt ſum of Eighteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
thouſand pounds <hi>ſterl.</hi> in ſatisfaction whereof, the part of a
whole Kingdom (which certainly is worth many Millions) is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
upon them. They are entitled to all the Natives Eſtates
in four great Counties, to all the Cities, Corporations, and Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Towns in <hi>Ireland,</hi> to all the Land ſituated within a mile to the
Sea, and to the River of <hi>Shanon</hi> in the Province of <hi>Conaught,</hi> and
County of <hi>Clare,</hi> to all the Debts, Leaſes, Mortgages, and the
Reverſions of the <hi>Iriſh;</hi> for not only the real Eſtates, but alſo
all other pretenſions and Titles of the unhappy Natives are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited:
And leeſt all this ſhould come ſhort to content this inſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Party, the laſt act allows them one hundred thouſand pounds
out of the two half years Rent from Adventurers Souldiers, and
reſtored <hi>Iriſh.</hi> Though the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Officers have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
faithfully adhered to the Kings Intereſt, and never deſerted
his ſervice (as all, or moſt of theſe Proteſtant Officers in <hi>Ireland</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:49336:9"/>
have done, when the Uſurper prevailed) yet they being Papiſt,
diſables them from any ſatisfaction for their ſervice, which was a
Qualification not impoſed on the Catholicks in <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c. But
ſince the Ceſſation of Arms concluded in the year 1643. There was
no more fighting between his Majeſties Proteſtant, and <hi>Roman</hi>
Catholick Subjects, which makes a great difference between their
Loyalty in the point of merit, and that of our Cavaliers in <hi>England,</hi>
who, out of a generous reſolution, without any neceſſity, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
of private Intereſt, did freely embrace his Majeſties
Quarrel, ſiding always with the beſt, although weakeſt party,
which they maintained, for the ſpace of Six years, at their own
charges, with the loſs of ſo many thouſand brave lives, who were
all Sacrificed as unſpotted Victims on the Altar of Loyalty. How
comes it then to paſs, that a handful of <hi>Iriſh</hi> Proteſtants ſhould be
allowed 1800000 <hi>l.</hi> for two years ſervice, and that our Engliſh Roya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts,
who were a hundred times more numerous continued thrice
longer in ſerving the King and whoſe pure Loyalty was never
tainted with the mixture of any treachery or private Intereſt,
ſhould get among them all, without diſtinction of Nation or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
but 70000 <hi>l.</hi> to be diſtributed among the Needy Cavaliers,
(who had neither Eſtates of their own, nor any publick Chrges or
imployments) to keep them from ſtarving? Upon what account
ſhould the Officers of the Four or five Garriſons in <hi>Ireland</hi> that
plundered ten times more then their pay came to, enjoy four
large Counties, and all the great Towns and Corporations of a
Kingdom, whilſt the whole body of the Royalliſts in <hi>England</hi> are
ſo much ſlighted that there is not one Pariſh in the Country, nor
Street in any City, conferred upon them? Will not the <hi>Iriſh</hi>
Forty nine Men allow us, that Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> the Duke of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle,
Montroſs, Briſtol, Barkley, Middleton, Rochester, Gerard,</hi>
and ſeveral other Noblemen of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> deſerve to
have their Arrears ſtated and ſatisfied, as well as the Grandees of
<hi>Ireland?</hi> I, there any conveniency, (for I am ſure there can be
no Juſtice) to provide for the one and not for the other? It cannot
be ſaid that his Majeſty is obliged by the Act of 17. <hi>Car.</hi> by his
Declaration from <hi>Breda,</hi> or any other Covenant, to recompence
in ſo large a manner, the mercenary ſervice of his Proteſtant
Officers in <hi>Ireland,</hi> without any regard to be had for the innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Sufferings, and preſent want of ſo many Indigent Cavaliers
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49336:10"/>
in <hi>England,</hi> who have not bread to eat, nor a houſe to lye in, and
ſcarce a Rag to cover their Nakedneſs.</p>
            <p>To give ſome colour to this apparent partiality, the firſt Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
of State is forced to betake himſelf to his laſt refuge, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
as for a final reaſon, that the Proteſtant Engliſh Intereſt
cannot by maintained in <hi>Ireland,</hi> without extirpating the Natives.
And therefore, that the Counties and Corperations undiſpoſed of
by the Commonwealth, muſt not be reſtored to the Natives upon
any account. The preſervation of this Intereſt is now become <hi>ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tima
ratio,</hi> and the <hi>non plus ultra</hi> to all political Debates; and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Learned Gown-man will needs eſtabliſh it for a firſt Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
not to be denyed, is not amiſs to conſider more attentively
this Idol, that occaſions ſo much impiety. As for the Proteſtant
Intereſt, I muſt confeſs his Majeſties bound to maintain it in all his
Kingdoms and Dominions, as far forth as the Glory of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,
and the Law of Nations, and the ſeveral Conſtitutions of
particular places will admit. Certainly, no Man (though never
ſo zealous,) will ſay, that his Majeſty was obliged, when
he held the Town of <hi>Dunkirk</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> to expiate the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Inhabitants, and place new Engliſh Colonies in their room,
for the preſervation of a Proteſtant Intereſt. True Religion was
ever yet planted by preaching and good example, not by violence
and oppreſſion: An unjuſt intruſion into the Neighbours Eſtate,
is not the right way to convert the ancient Proprietors, who will
hardly be induced to embrace a Religion, whoſe Profeſſors have
done them ſo much injuſtice: And as to the preſent Settlement
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> it is apparent to the World, that the Confiſcation of
Eſtates, and not the Converſion of Souls, is the only thing aimed
at. If by the Engliſh Intereſt we underſtand the preſent Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>London</hi> Adventurers, and of <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Souldiers, there
is no doubt it is inconſiſtent with the reſtoration of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can the New Engliſh Title to Land be well maintained, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
deſtroying the old Title of the Natives; even as the Intereſt
of the late Common-wealth was incompatible with Monarchy,
and <hi>Cromwels</hi> Protectorſhip was inconſiſtent with the Kings Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
But, if by the Engliſh Intereſt, we underſtand (as we
ought to do) the Intereſt of the Crown and Cavaliers of <hi>England,</hi>
I ſee no reaſon why it might not be preſerved in <hi>Ireland</hi> for 500
years to come) as well it was preſerved there for 500 years paſt,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49336:10"/>
without extirpating the Natives. Why could not the Engliſh
Intereſt be maintained in <hi>Ireland,</hi> without extirpation, as well
as the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Intereſt is preſerved in <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Flanders;</hi> the
<hi>French</hi> Intereſt in <hi>Roſſilignion</hi> and <hi>Alſace;</hi> the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Intereſt in
<hi>Breme</hi> and <hi>Pomerland;</hi> the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Intereſt in <hi>Norway;</hi> the <hi>Auſtrian</hi>
Intereſt in <hi>Hungary;</hi> the <hi>Venetian</hi> Intereſt in <hi>Dalmatia;</hi> and the
<hi>Ottoman</hi> Intereſt over all <hi>Greece;</hi> and ſo many other Chriſtian Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
without diſpoſſeſſing the Antient Inhabitants of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonies
and Birth-rights? Forts, Cittadels, Armies, and Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons
Puniſhment and Reward, were hitherto held the only law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
means for the Chriſtian Princes to maintain their Authority,
and ſecure their Intereſt: Such an extirpation was never yet practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by any Prince that followed the Law of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>But, ſuppoſing that the preſervation of an Engliſh Intereſt
were ſo ſacred a thing, that it may be held lawful in that regard
to extirpate the old Inhabitants of <hi>Ireland,</hi> who have received from
the hand of God that Portion of the Earth for their Inhabitants;
upon what colour of Title can our rigid Stateſman deſign the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation
of ſo many Families in <hi>Ireland,</hi> or the Engliſh race and
Extraction, lineally deſcended from the beſt Families in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and thoſe Antient <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colonies who firſt brought over
that Intereſt into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and maintained it there for ſo many A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges?
If this <hi>Cannibal</hi> Engliſh Intereſt, gives no better quarter to
the Children of Engliſh in <hi>Ireland,</hi> what can Strangers expect?
Nay, what aſſurance can be had for the proſperity of thoſe very
Adventurers and Souldiers, that after an Age or two they ſhall not
be likewiſe devoured, or diſplaced to make room for a new ſwarm
of Engliſh Planters, upon the account of ſecuring a new Engliſh
Intereſt: And thoſe new Colonies alſo within an Age after, ſhall
extirpated upon the ſame ſcore; For the Children of thoſe who
were planted in <hi>Ireland,</hi> about the beginning of King <hi>James</hi> his
Reign, are now deſtroyed, for the better ſecurity of an Engliſh
Intereſt, as well as the poſterity of the firſt Engliſh, who Invaded
the Country in the days of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Second; ſo that to the
Worlds end, if we follow this Rule, we ſhall never be able to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
the Engliſh Intereſt in the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Grandees are the Fourth and laſt in order, that obſtruct
the Reſtoration of the Iriſh Natives: Their Title is ſoon examined,
being only founded on the Kings free Grant; for it cannot be ſaid
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49336:11"/>
that His Majeſty was bound by any former obligation, or pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
conveniency, to confer on his Courtiers and Favourites the
Land of other People. Can there be any conveniency (not to
ſpeak of Juſtice) that the Kings only Brother, and Heir apparent
to three Crowns, ſhould enjoy ſo many thouſands a year in <hi>Ireland</hi>
of poor Gentlemens Eſtates, whereof ſome had the honour to
ſerve under his Command in Foreign Countreys? And is it fit to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
his Royal Highneſs and his Princely Poſterity to the many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies,
and heavy Judgements which commonly follow
illegal and unjuſt acquiſitions? It is a remarkable paſſage, that
<hi>Miles Corbe<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> and other Regicides, who went over into <hi>Ireland,</hi>
got a large proportion of <hi>Iriſh</hi> Land, for no other ſervice, but
the execrable Sentence of Death which they gave againſt our late
Soveraign, and that the Duke of <hi>York</hi> ſhould now enjoy all that
Land, by no other Title but that of the Regicides. The Land
was given them by a Tyrant, for murthering the King, let the
World judge of the goodneſs of their Title; certainly whoſoever
comes to inherit them, can have no better. I ſhall make no mention
here of ſo many Courtiers of a leſſer Sphere, who have got vaſt
Eſtates in <hi>Ireland,</hi> by his Majeſties free Gift, and whom the firſt
Miniſters of State have purpoſely interreſſed in that Kingdom, to
engage them againſt the Natives; whereby the Reſtoration of the
<hi>Iriſh</hi> is rendred impoſſible, and the ſatisfaction of Adventurers and
Souldiers already diſpoſed by the Decrees of the laſt Court of
Claims, is much obſtructed, ſo many freſh Grants exhauſting the
ſtock of Repriſals.</p>
            <p>My Lord, I have hitherto ſet down in brief the hard uſage ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to the <hi>Iriſh</hi> ſince his Majeſties Re-eſtabliſhment, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined
the Title of the ſeveral Intereſts obſtructing their Reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Now it remains to ſay ſomewhat of the undoubted right, and
indiſputable Claim of the Natives, to thoſe Eſtates which by
<hi>Cromwels</hi> Decree, and his Majeſties confirmation, are kept from
them.</p>
            <p>I will not take upon me to juſtifie their firſt riſing, (although I
have ſeen a Treatiſe in Latin proving the lawfulneſs, or rather the
neceſſity, of that War on their ſide, having begun it in their own
defence, to prevent the general ruin and deſtruction deſigned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Kindom and themſelves (by the Presbyterian party

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49336:11"/>
preſuming to take Arms, upon any account or pretence whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
without the Authority of their Prince; I will only ſay, that
by their Inſurrection (how bloody and barbarous ſoever ſome are
pleaſed to print and paint it) four hundred Engliſh could not be
found murdered in <hi>Ireland,</hi> as appeareth by the proceedings (and
Records yet extant in <hi>Dublin)</hi> of the Uſurped Powers ſevere in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry,
and their Court of Juſtice, that for want of Men did hang
Women, not only without legal proof, but without probability
that they could or would be guilty of killing Souldiers, or Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
<hi>Engliſh.</hi> The <hi>Iriſh</hi> inſurrection, I ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hath not been accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with that Inſolence and Malice in the beginning, nor with
thoſe ſad and diſmal effects in the end, which other Rebellions
have been guilty of, and ſome Pamphlets have charged the <hi>Iriſh</hi>
with. They were ſcarce 22 Months in Arms, when they yielded
to a Ceſſation upon the firſt notice given of his Majeſties pleaſure,
although they had then the upper hand of their Enemies; and it
was known the Proteſtant party could not be well preſerved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it. This Ceſſation was enlarged from time to time, until a
final Peace was ſolemnly concluded in the City of <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> in
the year of our Lord 1648 by, and between the Lord Duke of
<hi>Ormond,</hi> his Majeſties Commiſſioner, in the behalf of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty;
and the General Aſſembly of the Confederate Cathol<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>cks
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> in the behalf of the ſaid Confederate Catholicks. This
peace was no ſooner publiſhed, than all the Garriſons, Forts, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadels
Strong-holds, and Magazines of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> were put under
the Command of the Kings Lieutenant; all the Nobility, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and Magiſtrates, both in Cities and Country ſubmitted to his
Government. And though the Engliſh Rebels have been ever
ſince very ſuccesful in all their attempts, yet the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
they were offered any conditions by the Uſurper, held
out, with an undaunted Courage, until the laſt Town, and the
laſt Fortreſs was loſt, and until they received expreſs Orders from
his Majeſty to yield to the times, and to make the beſt conditions
they could for their own preſervation. It is remarkable, that this
peace was concluded in a time, when the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Nation was in a
moſt flouriſhing condition, having Armies in the Field, and moſt of
the Cities and great Towns in their poſſeſſions, and more than
three parts of the Kingdom under their command, when they
were courted by the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> and ſolicited, by
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49336:12"/>
ſome Neighbouring Potentates, and when by eſpouſing his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
quarrel, (who was then deſtitute of all humane ſupport)
they were to draw on their Country all their united Force and
Power of the Victorious Rebels in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> and
conſequently expoſe themſelves and their Poſterity to the danger
of an unevitable ruin and deſtruction.</p>
            <p>I know their Adverſaries have practiſed all the artifice that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
could invent, to perſwade the World, that his Majeſty is no
way obliged to make good that peace which was concluded by
the Authority of his Royal Father. And Solemnly confirmed
by himſelf. Thoſe Articles, they ſay, were forced from His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
by the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Confederates who ought to looſe the benefit of
all his Majeſties gracious conceſſions, having baniſhed the Lord
Duke <hi>Ormond,</hi> His Majeſties Lieutenant, out of <hi>Ireland.</hi> It is
eaſily proved, that the King was forced to take the Solemn League
and Covenant, when he was environed by the Presbyteriam Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
in <hi>Scotland:</hi> But I do not underſtand how it can be made out,
that the Confederates of <hi>Ireland</hi> were able to exort that peace
from his Majeſty, who was then in <hi>France.</hi> It will ſeem very ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous
to ſay, that the Lord Marqueſs of <hi>Antrim,</hi> and the Lord
<hi>Muskry</hi> (imploy'd by the Conſederate Catholicks, to ſolicit, in a
moſt humble manner, for thoſe Articles which only contain a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
for the paſt, and the liberty of Free-born Subjects for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
ſhould come to <hi>Paris</hi> with a train ſufficient to force a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Prince, lodged in the <hi>Louvre,</hi> who was Couſin German to
his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty The other Aſſertion, that the Lord
Duke of <hi>Ormond</hi> was baniſhed out of <hi>Ireland</hi> by the Confederates,
is very falſe; His Lordſhip being driven out of the provinces of

to retire to the province of <hi>Connaught,</hi> from whence he took

(which if timely obtained) might probably give a ſtop to
<hi>Cromwels</hi> conqueſt, and render him unable to bring his Victorious
Forces out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and defeat his Majeſty at <hi>Worcester,</hi> His
Lordſhip having appointed the Lord Marqueſs of <hi>Clanrickard</hi> to
Command in his abſence, as the Kings Deputy, to whom the

that his Lordſhip was not baniſhed out of the Kingdom
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49336:12"/>
by the Confederate Catholiks; for whom he named, a Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in his own abſence: neither can it reflect upon the generality
of the Nation, what was decreed by ſome prelates convened in
<hi>Jameſtown,</hi> whoſe unſeaſonable zeal was ſoon after condemned,
and proteſted againſt by a general Aſſembly held in <hi>Loghreagh,</hi> of
the Clergy, Nobility, and Gentry of the whole Kingdom. And
the advantagious propoſals then made by <hi>Cromwels</hi> Agents, were
generouſly rejected by that Aſſembly, the Nation having unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly
reſolved to riſe or fall with the Kings Intereſt. But what
need we any other Evidence to prove that the Iriſh did not gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
violate the Articles of that peace, then His Majeſties own
words, in the preamble of his Declaration for the Settlement of
<hi>Ireland. And therefore we could not but hold our ſelf obliged to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
what we owe by that peace to thoſe who had honeſtly and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
performed what they had promiſed to us,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Iriſh</hi> being at the laſt over-power'd at home, though they
loſt their Countrey, they did not fail in their Loyalty, moſt of their
young Nobility and Gentry having followed his Majeſty into For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Countries, and reſorted from all parts to ſide with thoſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
who favoured his Intereſt; when the King was in <hi>France,</hi>
they quitted the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ſervice; and when he came to <hi>Flanders,</hi>
they abandoned the <hi>French</hi> ſervice and flocked in great numbers
about his Royal Perſon, having made up in ſhort time, a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
body of an Army, which rendred his Majeſty conſiderable to
his Friends abroad, and dreadful to his Enemies at home. Theſe
are verities that none dare impugn, ſeeing the King himſelf is
moſt graciouſly pleaſed to own them in his Declaration. <hi>And in
the firſt place, we did, and muſt always remember the great affection
a conſiderable part of that Nation expreſsed to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s during the time of
our being beyond the Seas, when with all cheerfulneſs and obedience they
received, and ſubmitted to our Orders, and betook, themſelves to that
ſervice which we directed as moſt convenient and behooveful at that
time to us, though attended with inconveniency enough to themſelves:
which demeanour of theirs, cannot but be thought very worthy of our
Protection, Justice and Favour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Lord, Is it not a ſad caſe, that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Nation who ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed
their Lives, their Eſtates and Fortunes, and all the Intereſt
they had in their Country for the Kings ſervice, who followed his
Majeſty abroad, and ſtuck to him in his Baniſhment, when he
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49336:13"/>
was abandoned almoſt by all the reſt of his Subjects in the three
Kingdoms, ſhould now be in a far worſe condition, than they were
reduced unto, during the Uſurpers Reign? For then their Eſtates
were kept from them by violence, and the un-reſiſtable power of
<hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Army; but now they ſeem to be legally adjudged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them by two Acts of Parliament. They were then in hopes
that God would one day Re-eſtabliſh his Sacred Majeſty in a
peaceable and entire Poſſeſſion of his Crown and Kingdoms, and
conſequently reſtore to them their ancient Patrimonies, which
they loſt upon the account of his Intereſt: But now, they behold
his Majeſty ſeated in the Glorious Throne of his Anceſtors, and
themſelves out of all hopes of ever enjoying their Eſtates, which
are conferred on their (and his Majeſties) Enemies, by a final
ſentence pronounced againſt them; and (which ſurpaſſeth all the
miſery that can be Imagined) they are eternally condemned by a
Meſſias, in whom they hoped for redemption, and for whoſe ſake
they ſacrificed their lives, loſt their Fortunes, quitted their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
and forſook all that was dear to them in this World: And
this done by the corruption and covetouſneſs of two or three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
whereof one was the firſt Miniſter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The extraordinary merit of this Nation in his Majeſties ſervice,
was freſh in his Majeſties memory when he ſpake after this man-to
the Houſe of Peers, on the</hi> 27 July, 1660. <hi>Touching the Act
of Indempnity;</hi> I hope I need ſay nothing of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and that they
alone ſhall not be without the benefit of my Mercy: They have ſhewed
much affection to me abroad, and you will have a care of my honour,
and what I have poomiſed to them.</p>
            <p>My Lord, to paſs by Honour and Gratitude, (which ſome States-men
little value) how ſhall we excuſe the Injuſtice of theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings?
Suppoſe the Peace concluded in the year 1648. was
invalid, and that his Majeſty received no ſervice abroad from any
of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Nation, can he in juſtice condemn 7000 Innocents, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they are heard) inoffenſive Perſons, who never offended his
Royal Father, nor himſelf: Let us ſuppoſe farther, that an Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
perſon could not be found in all <hi>Ireland,</hi> that every individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
of that Nation were an obſtinate Rebel from the beginning,
and that none of them ever deſerved the leaſt favour from his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
in point of Conſcience, Honour, or Gratitude; can our
prime Miniſter and his adherents ſay, that ſo many thouſand Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49336:13"/>
and Orphans (though never ſo criminal) are not fit objects of
his Majeſties Compaſſion and Clemency?</p>
            <p>That Kings are the Anointed of the Lord, and his Lieutenants on
Earth, is an infallible truth received among Chriſtians; and as
they derive their power immediately from God, ſo they ought to
imitate him in their Actions. But of all the Divine Attributes,
his Mercy, as it is above all the reſt of his Works, <hi>Miſericordia
ejus ſupra omnia opera ejus,</hi> ſo is it that alone which Princes are
moſt concerned to follow. It is by this Heavenly Virtue, that
good Kings have been always diſtinguiſhed from Tyrants, and
that they appeared to their Subjects as the very Images of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity.
I do not think that the Engliſh Crown was ever worn by
a Prince more Benign and Merciful than <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, I am
confident there is no King now living on Earth, who hath given a
larger Teſtimony of his natural propenſity and inclination that way.
How great then muſt be the Guilt of thoſe Miniſters of State that
cunningly obſtructed the effects of the Bounty and Clemency of
ſo good and gracious a Prince towards an Innocent people; and
perhaps not the leaſt deſerving of his Subjects? Their gettings
by the Bills of Settlement ſpoils their plea, and pretence for the
promotion of proteſtancy. It will ſeem a paradox to poſterity, that
the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Nation, which in all Inſurrections hath been pardoned,
and preſerved by the Royal Bounty of Kings, meerly Engliſh
ſhould now be condemned to an eternal extirpation by a King of
old <hi>Iriſh</hi> extraction (lineally deſcended from <hi>Ferguſius</hi> a Prince of
the Royal blood of <hi>Ireland)</hi> who of all the Kings that ever Regn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in <hi>England,</hi> was moſt obliged to the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Nation, and that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, (the moſt merciful Prince
that ever wore a Crown) ſo many thouſand Innocents ſhould be
exempted from a hearing, and others from a General pardon,
which by a Mercy wholly extraordinary, doth extend to ſome of
the very Regicides.</p>
            <p>Theſe are verities not to be doubted of in our dayes, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Ages will hardly admit, ſeeing the like was never before Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
in Annals, or mentioned in any Hiſtory: For, ſince the
Creation of <hi>Adam</hi> to this day (and perhaps our poſterity to the
Worlds end, may be as far to ſeek) we cannot produce another ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of the like meaſure extended to a Chriſtian people, under
the Goverment of a moſt Chriſtian Prince. The moſt bloody Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49336:14"/>
of former Ages, even thoſe Monſters of Nature, who ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be born for no other end, than the deſolation of Mankind,
did never extirpate their old Friends, to make room for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
Enemies: So that it muſt be a very difficult matter to
perſwade thoſe who are not Eye-witneſſes of the Fact, that the
Royal Authority of our Gracious King, which here in <hi>England</hi>
maintains the Peer in his Splendor and Dignity, the Commoner in
his Birth-right and Liberty, which protects the Weak from the
oppreſſion of the mighty, ſecures the Nobility from the Inſolence
of the people, and by which Equal and Impartial Juſtice is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently
diſtributed to all the Inhabitants of this Great and Flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing
Realm; ſhould be at the ſame time made uſe of in his
Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to condemn Innocents before they are heard,
to deſtroy ſo many thouſand Widows and Orphans, to confirm un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
and uſurped poſſeſſions, to violate the publick Faith, to
puniſh Virtue, to countenance Vice, to hold Loyalty a Crime, and
Treaſon worthy of Reward. The bloody and covetous States-man
who chiefly occaſioned all this diſorder, was very often heard to
ſay, with a fierce countenance, and paſſionate tone, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
to be extirpated, and then he would (after his uſual manner)
come out with a great Oath, and ſwear, they ſhall all be extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
Root and Branch. Good God, what a Heathen expreſſion is
this in the mouth of a Chriſtian, who is expreſly commanded to
love his Enemies? Does he think that the Divine Providence, which
orders the growth of Herbs, the fall of Leaves, and appoints an
Angel for the guard of every individual perſon, takes no care to
preſerve an entire Body of a Nation? and that it ſhall be in the
power of one man to deſtroy the work of God at his pleaſure; of
ſuch a Man that could not prevent his own diſgrace, not avoid
the many other inconveniences which are like to fall upon
him.</p>
            <p>This proud <hi>Haman,</hi> who, joyntly with ſome few others, to get
Money for themſelves, and Eſtates for their Children) contrived
the general extirpation of the whole <hi>Iriſh</hi> race; but before he
could fully compaſs his wicked Deſign (I muſt confeſs he went ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
near to do it, and if God had given him a longer continuance of
power he would undoubtedly make good his word) was forced for
his own ſafety, and the preſervation of his life, to quit his fine
Houſe, forſake his Family, and bid his Countrey farewel, and to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:49336:14"/>
travel in his old age, in the dead of Winter, through ſo
many dangers at Sea, and incommodities by Land, to ſeek
for ſome ſhelter abroad, ſeeing he could not be ſecure at home
<hi>Juſtu es, Domine, &amp; juſtum judicium tuum.</hi> He is gone with
all his Greatneſs, and the miſeries of the poor <hi>Iriſh</hi> do ſtill
continue; however they are yet in being, and live in hope that
the fall of their Mortal Enemy may be a beginning of their
Riſe, and that his Majeſty will now ſeriouſly reflect upon the
unparallel'd uſage hitherto extended to that Nation, who are
deprived of the Benefit of Law, Juſtice, and publick Faith:
The cryes and tears of more than an hundred thouſand Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
and Orphans, being worthy his Majeſties Princely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.
And certainly there can be no great difficulty met
with to diſſannul two illegal Acts, which are evidently repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
not only to the Law of God and Nature, contrary to
the common reaſon, and conſequently void in themſelves)
but alſo to all ſound Policy and reaſon of State; For that the
true Intereſt of <hi>England</hi> (as relating to <hi>Ireland)</hi> conſiſts in
raiſing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he <hi>Iriſh</hi> as a Bulwark, or ballance, againſt our <hi>Engliſh</hi>
and <hi>Scotch</hi> Presbyterians. The <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts agreed ſo well,
and lived ſo peaceably with our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Prelatiques, during
the Reign of King <hi>James,</hi> and Seventeen years of King
<hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, that they ſeemed to be of one mind in all
matters: And when the Presbyterian practiſes and <hi>Covenant</hi>
began to diſturb theſe Kingdoms, the Papiſts and Prelatiques
in <hi>Ireland</hi> (as well as in <hi>England)</hi> joyned their hearts and hands
againſt Presbytery for the King. The great Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi>
judged it was a true Proteſtant Cavalier Intereſt, to raiſe an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
of Papiſts in <hi>Ireland</hi> thereby to keep in awe the Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England.</hi> And indeed the Presbyterian
deſigns could never have had been compaſſed, if the
King had not been forced to disband the ſame Army Then
the Earl (now Duke of <hi>Ormond</hi> (thought it was the true
<hi>Engliſh</hi> and Cavalier Intereſt, joyn in Parliament with the
<hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Nobility and Gentry of <hi>Ireland,</hi> againſt the
Presbyterian Lords Juſtices, and their Faction; and therefore
joyntly with them, reſolved to ſecure their perſons, and
ſeize upon the Caſtle and Magazine of <hi>Dublin,</hi> for his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty;
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49336:15"/>
But this their Deſign was quaſhed by an inconſiderate
attempt of ſome Northern Gentlemen, which occaſioned
the late Rebellion and encouraged the presbyterian Lords,
Juſtices to force the Kings Loyal Subjects into deſperate
Courſes: But no ſooner were the presbyterian Lord Juſtices
depoſed, and impriſoned by the Kings commands, but the
<hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks, returned to their Duty, firſt by a Ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
next by a ſubmiſſive peace, delivering the whole
Kingdom to the Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> and joyning with
the Cavalier party againſt the Kings Enemies, and
ſo continued untill both were over-powered by <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another reaſon why underſtanding men judge the <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh</hi>
ought to be preſerved, and their Intereſt preferred
before that of <hi>Cromwels</hi> Creatures, is, that the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> are not able to defend themſelves
againſt the <hi>Scots</hi> in that Countrey; If the <hi>Iriſh</hi> be Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
The <hi>Scots</hi> are a people ſo numerous, ſo nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and ſo near unto <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſo cunning, cloſe,
and confederated in a common Intereſt, that ſome of
our States-men apprehend, they may ſoon poſſeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
of the whole Iſland, they being at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
not only Maſters of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iſter,</hi> but ſpread over the
other provinces, and very well armed. Now, if deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
ſhould dictate to the deſtroyed <hi>Iriſh,</hi> that it is
their conveniency to joyn with the <hi>Scots</hi> againſt the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
that poſſeſs their Eſtates, without queſtion the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
Intereſt will be loſt in <hi>Ireland.</hi> It is better there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Nation be gained, by reſtoring them
to their own (ſuch only excepted as had their hands in
murdering <hi>Engliſh)</hi> than that a few presbyterian and pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natick
up-ſtarts be made great by other Mens Eſtates,
and the whole Kingdom endangered to be wreſted out
of our hands, and ſeperated from the Crown of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:49336:15"/>
You ſee, my Lord that there ſeems to be as little
conveniency as Conſcience in my Lord <hi>Clarendon</hi>'s, and
his covetous partners Settlement of <hi>Ireland;</hi> yet I muſt
confeſs this Domeſtick affair agreeth well with his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy
in Foreign Negotiations. Until his time the States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of <hi>Europe</hi> (particularly the <hi>Engliſh,)</hi> made it their
buſineſs to keep the ſcales equal between <hi>France</hi> and
<hi>Spain,</hi> leaſt either of thoſe two potentates might aſpire
unto an Univerſal Monarchy; But the Earl of <hi>Clarendon</hi>
made it his buſineſs to utterly deſtroy <hi>Spain,</hi> and exalt
the <hi>French</hi> King to ſuch a height of power, that in a
ſhort time he might be Maſter of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> and
find no oppoſition in his way into <hi>England;</hi> And indeed
had not our Kings Conduct and Courage been extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary,
in cloſing up a new Defenſive League ſo ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably,
and in concluding a peace between <hi>Spain</hi> and
<hi>Portugal,</hi> no part of <hi>Europe</hi> that is worth the Coveting,
could be free from the <hi>French</hi> command. I hope, that
as God hath inſpired his Majeſty to prevent (by this
League and peace,) the dangers which corrupt Miniſters
drew upon us, ſo He will move him to eſtabliſh a laſting
peace in his Dominions, by a juſt repeal of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Act
of Settlement; And thereby to quaſh all the Deſigns
againſt <hi>England,</hi> That <hi>France</hi> or any Foreigner may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to ground upon the diſcontents of a deſtroyed, and
deſperate people.</p>
            <p>Now, my Lord, that you have had this account of
the tranſactions in <hi>Ireland</hi> ſince his Majeſties Reſtauration,
