            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <lg>
               <l>HOw now! what ist which I doe vainly read,</l>
               <l>Ought which belongs to Popish Romish Creed?</l>
               <l>I am deceiv'd, it is a Letter call'd,</l>
               <l>(At which I blusht) A hypocriticke scal'd</l>
               <l>Which did affront true Protestatine heads.</l>
               <l>No whit belonging unto Papall Beads.</l>
               <l>For such vaine trifles, O the Authors scorne,</l>
               <l>Although of Riches, yet not of truth forlorne.</l>
               <l>The Letter thus begins with Dash above,</l>
               <l>My Lord, as if the consequence were love.</l>
               <l>But read forward, and you shall truely finde,</l>
               <l>No love at all, but a most envious minde.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>My Lord,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>I call you not what long agoe you were,</l>
               <l>For now those golden dayes are past I feare,</l>
               <l>I feare, O sycophantick and base straine,</l>
               <l>Which for to name, a good man may disdaine;</l>
               <l>He feares but what, Bishops will nere go downe,</l>
               <l>Whose mature learning once did England crowne:</l>
               <l>Suppose that some be bad, must therefore all?</l>
               <l>Let bad men suffer, but the just nere fall.</l>
               <l>Each rayling line, I doe not now intend</l>
               <l>To answer, lest they cry me the Popes friend:</l>
               <l>Onely to chiefest points I doe reply,</l>
               <l>And that Ile doe although for it I die.</l>
               <l>Are not we all by nature bad? why then</l>
               <l>Descended Christ so low for to save men?</l>
               <l>But there's a Sect i'th world which dare to say,</l>
               <l>Their merits save them, what have they to pay,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:47811:3"/>But such are Romanists, but w'have a Sect,</l>
               <l>Which have Saint-like beleefe of which they cracke.</l>
               <l>And such are those which we call Schismaticks,</l>
               <l>Which thinke to gaine heaven by soothing tricks.</l>
               <l>And such a one was he which lately writ</l>
               <l>A Libell, to divulge his zealous wit.</l>
               <l>Zealous said I? excuse me (Reader) pray,</l>
               <l>Expressing zealous I m not to stay.</l>
               <l>No zeale it is, maliciously to raile,</l>
               <l>Against a prisoner, suppose he were fraile,</l>
               <l>Let Law condemne him, not each envious pen,</l>
               <l>Which sometimes will dispraise the best of men.</l>
               <l>I doe not say that he was such a one,</l>
               <l>That God forbid, there Ile let him alone.</l>
               <l>Let Law pursue him, and God forbid againe,</l>
               <l>That my rash pen should more augment his paine.</l>
               <l>Hence superstition, hence base Romish weeds,</l>
               <l>And hence I say all hypocriticke deeds.</l>
               <l>Suppose that he bowd vainly to the Altar,</l>
               <l>For that must he be hang'd with Inkie halter?</l>
               <l>But he did Sermons hate, and those abuse,</l>
               <l>Which to preach often piously did use.</l>
               <l>Did hee doe so? in it he was too blame;</l>
               <l>Let justice still obscure his once bright fame.</l>
               <l>But he at name of (Jesus) still did bow,</l>
               <l>Why not? dot not the Scripture it alow?</l>
               <l>That at his name each knee should lowly bend;</l>
               <l>Hath Scripture err'd and now at length amend?</l>
               <l>But 'tis the heart must bow, out outward knee.</l>
               <l>Did not God make them both? pray answer me?</l>
               <l>Why at his Name then should they not both bend,</l>
               <l>Which dy'd for man, his deserv'd grife to end?</l>
               <l>Sure Antignist to me thou'lt subscribe,</l>
               <l>If thou in hope wer't of a ten pound bribe,</l>

               <l>Thy actions are not pure, yet purely gilt,</l>
               <l>Did any one your Letter much applaud,</l>

               <l>O farre be such a sentence from my thought,</l>
               <l>I know with wisedome their heads still be fraught,</l>
               <l>But yet this Varlet (marke what I shall say,)</l>
               <l>From them doth seeme Justice to take away.</l>
               <l>O what a fiction doth he slily raise,</l>
               <l>For which he deserves more than Poets Bayse,</l>
               <l>A rope to boot, (He scornes vice to applaud)</l>
               <l>He knowes the Devill must have Bishop <hi>Laud,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>For so his meaning is, I dare to tell,</l>

               <l>O sinfull man, for if man so thou art,</l>
               <l>Where was thy charity, O where thy fleshy heart?</l>

               <l>Thy Saviour thousands of foes had more,</l>
               <l>Aud yet to them did he shew mercy store.</l>
               <l>He lov'd his foes, and for his foes did die:</l>
               <l>They 'gainst him, not he them, cry'd, crucifie.</l>
               <l>He lost his life, perhaps thou liberty,</l>

                  <hi>Saul</hi> made a shew that he did <hi>Davd</hi> love,</l>
