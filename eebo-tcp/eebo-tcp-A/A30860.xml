            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A DESCRIPTION OF THE COUNTRY OF Precious John, Vulgarly called <hi>PRESTER JOHN.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THe Empire of <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> is not inferiour to the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt in the World, if we conſider that vaſt Continent that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50809:125"/>
was anciently, and ſhould be now under the Command of the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Heir. It contained above thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty large Kingdoms, and many fruitful Provinces well furniſhed with Men, and ſtored with Rich Commodities; but the late un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Wars with the Neighbour Kings have much weakned this growing Empire, and reduced it to a little number.</p>
            <p>The Turks, the <hi>Gialas,</hi> the King of <hi>Mozambique,</hi> the <hi>Moors,</hi> and ſeveral others that ſurround this Chriſtian Principality, have diſ-membred the Provinces and Kingdoms that were anciently ſubject to it, and ſubmitted them to their ſeveral Jurisdictions. The <hi>Moors</hi> have ſeized on the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coaſt, the <hi>Turks</hi> have conquer'd the moſt fruitful Kingdoms that confine upon <hi>Egypt,</hi> the <hi>Gialas</hi> a war-like Re-publick of <hi>Africa,</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:50809:125"/>
command ſeveral large Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories that belong unto this Imperial Crown. The King of <hi>Mozambique</hi> and the reſt have robbed it of its chief Jewels and Ornaments, ſo that at preſent it is nothing ſo large, nor ſo conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as formerly it was. The cauſe of theſe great Loſſes muſt be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the Cowardiſe and unexperience of the Inhabitants more inclinable to Superſtition than war-like feats, and to the diverſity of Religion in which theſe Nations differ much from the Abyſſins. The <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Moors</hi> are nouriſhed up in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humetan, the <hi>Gialas</hi> and they of <hi>Mozambique</hi> in the Heatheniſh I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrie (which cannot comply with the Chriſtian Truth.) The Profeſſors of the former, have a natural antipathy againſt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelites of the latter; inſomuch,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50809:126"/>
that they can ſcarce ſuffer them to breath in the ſame air. This hatred entertained by the different ways of worſhipping the Creator, hath fomented all theſe wars and troubles that have for many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years ſhaken the Abyſſin Empire, and ſeparated from it the moſt excellent, and the largeſt Provinces that did belong unto it; ſo that at preſent it is reduced to a very narrow Circuit in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of what it was. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour nevertheleſs maintains the ſame State as he did formerly, and claims a right to all thoſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms that he hath loſt. His pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Dominions are not above 800 Engliſh miles in length, and 600 in bredth; they contain theſe Kingdoms, <hi>Amara, Tigre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mahon, Angot, Xoa, G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50809:126"/>
they are limited on the North by <hi>Nubia,</hi> and the Mountains and Sands that ſeparate them from <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt;</hi> on the Eaſt, by the Kingdoms of <hi>Zangebara, Aiana</hi> and <hi>Adel,</hi> which lie upon the red Sea; on the South, the Provinces of <hi>Cafutes</hi> and <hi>Fungi</hi> do ſhut it, and on the Weſt this Empire confines upon <hi>Congo, Medra</hi> and the <hi>Blacks.</hi> This Rich and In-land Country I have diſcovered by my Travels, and now that I am ſo happily returned to my own Native ſoil, after ſo long and troubleſome a Journey, I owe to my Country a Relation of thoſe things that I have learned, which I may ſay, never any knew ſo much of this place before, as the Reader may find in this Book. In the year 1655. ſome Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of <hi>Florence</hi> were preparing to ſail for <hi>Alexandria,</hi> I reſolved to adventure my ſelf in their
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50809:127"/>
Company, out of a great deſire to viſit the Holy-Land, and ſee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein places. I had then received ſome diſcontent at home, which made me ſeek my ſatisfaction a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad; having therefore furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my ſelf with large ſums of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and a Man Servant, I embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qued with them in a Dutch bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, and in a fortnights time we landed in that ancient City which <hi>Alexander</hi> had built. The plague was then very hot in that place, which obliged us to a ſhort ſtay there. Some French Merchants were then going for Grand <hi>Cairo;</hi> my company perſwaded me to take my journey with them, and viſit the curioſities of that large City; I was not willing to take that Road ſo ſoon, for I deſired firſt to pay my devotions at the Sepulcher of our Lord, but the perſwaſions of my friends forced
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50809:127"/>
me to leave that journey until my return, becauſe we could not find a fit opportunity to travel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Holy-Land I went there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with the French Merchants to <hi>Catro,</hi> and ſpent ſome days there in viewing all the Rari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>es of that Great City; we had a ſight there and in our way of many An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities which are ſo well known to all the world, that I ſhall not ſo much as mention them. I had not been there a month, but a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravan</hi> was preparing for the Red Sea. The French Conſul, at whoſe houſe I lay, encouraged me to take that occaſion of diſcovering thoſe Parts where Chriſtians of of Quality ſeldom adventure themſelves; aſſuring me, that it would be worth my while to ſee thoſe remote places, and diſcover ſomething to the Chriſtian world, which was not known before. It
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50809:128"/>
happened that as I was medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon this journey, an <hi>Abuna</hi> or a High Prieſt of the Abyſſins came to the Patriarchs houſe from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in his journey to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> intending to take the ſame way as the <hi>Caravan,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was the ſafeſt. This acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent I lookt upon as an invitation of providence amongſt thoſe <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frican</hi> Chriſtians that are not well known to our Northern Climates. Having therefore furniſhed my ſelf with Moneys and Bills of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change for ſo long a journey, I ſought the acquaintance of the <hi>Abuna</hi> before my departure. It was no difficulty to obtain, for he was learned in the <hi>Italian</hi> Tongue, and well verſed in the manner and Cuſtoms of the <hi>Franks;</hi> he was a Man of a ſwarthy countenance, both pleaſant and grave, of a high ſtature, about 60 years of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50809:128"/>

The <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buna</hi> was alſo in the diſguiſe of a Merchant, he had with him ſome Goods of a ſmall value; we began our journey in the moneth of <hi>March,</hi> and through ſeveral miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes we arrived at the Port Town of the Red Sea called <hi>Suez,</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:50809:129"/>
a famous place for Trade, it is the paſſage into <hi>Arabia Indoſtan</hi> and all other Countries of <hi>Aſia.</hi> Here are therefore a great company of Merchants of all Nations that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich this place, which otherwiſe would be very unconſiderable. It is a City fortified with a Caſtle and a Fort upon the mold as big as <hi>Piſa.</hi> The buildings are large, fitter for Merchants than Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; ſome are beautified with black and white Marble curiouſly wrought. Here is a Synagogue of the <hi>Jews</hi> much frequented on the Sabbath day, here is alſo an Idol Temple for the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> but the poor Chriſtians have no other place appointed for their Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but their Chambers and Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. The <hi>Abuna</hi> found here ſome Abyſſin Merchants, at whoſe dwellings he was courteouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and honouraby entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50809:129"/>
they invited me to ſhare with him in their Hoſpitality; I accepted their kind offer, becauſe I had no mind to ſeparate my ſelf from him, ſeeing my deſign was to accompany him as far as his Emperours Court. Here we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained ſeveral months, becauſe we heard of an Army of <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Moors</hi> that were making an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>road into the Territories of the Abyſſins, we were adviſed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect with patience their return, for otherwiſe we might have met them in the way and been brought back into Captivity, our liberty was too precious a thing to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderately ventured we; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore remained a long while in this City expecting a fair opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be gone. At laſt one pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented it ſelf not unworthy of our acceptance, the <hi>Turks Baſha</hi> of <hi>Egypt</hi> ſent an Ambaſſadour to the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50809:130"/>
               <hi>Precious John,</hi> who coming to <hi>Suez,</hi> we thought we could not meet with a greater happineſs if we could be admitted into his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue. We had ſome difficulty to obtain this favour, but upon the offer of 200 Crowns, it was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily granted. He took his leave of this City with a great Train, and we accompanyed him upon Mules, we paſſed through many different Soils, ſome fruitful, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially of Date-trees, others ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry barren. The moſt part of our way was over craggy Mountains, where nothing did preſent it ſelf to our view but wild Beaſts far different from thoſe that I have ſeen in <hi>Europe.</hi> We paſſed through ſome inhabited Land, where very ſtrong Caſtles were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to defend the Country from the enemies, the <hi>Moers</hi> did poſſeſs them, for this Nation is
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50809:130"/>
diſperſed all over this Country, we found alſo ſome ſtragling Tents of <hi>Arabians</hi> that wandred up and down, we met with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing remarkable, but Poverty and Miſery, that ſeem to have taken up their Reſidence amongſt the people that inhabit in this part of the world far in the Country. Their diet is ſuch things as this barren habitation will afford them; their bread is a root, their fleſh is of ſuch wild Creatures as they can happily kill, their Cloathing proclaims their needy condition, it is made of a large leaf of a Tree that grows in the Forreſts and Woods, neither is it ſufficient to cover the back, ſo it hides the <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denda hominis,</hi> they are abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly content; for that purpoſe a ſtring is ty'd above their middle unto which theſe leaves are faſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ſo that like ſo many Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50809:131"/>
they fall down and cover what nature teaches to hide. They have one conveniency and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage which they enjoy above our common people, as our Princes and Noblemen of <hi>Europe</hi> they wear not their Apparel long, they change often, almoſt every day. Theſe raſcally ſort of people that nature hath brought forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt theſe mountains, did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear unto us almoſt like Savages, they did not willingly come in our company, nor are they deſirous to change their habitation, their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies were big, and their Members thick and ſwarthy, they ſpoke a mixt <hi>Arabian,</hi> not well to be under<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtood but by thoſe that know all the dialects of that language; thoſe that live in the fortified places are far more ſociable, they had choſen the moſt convenient ſeats for their reſidence, ſome of the ground was
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:50809:131"/>
fit to Sow and Plow, and to feed Cattel. We were admitted into one of theſe Caſtles that was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected in the paſſage of a mountain very conveniently to hinder and ſtop the courſe of any enemy; the Commander in chief was a <hi>Moor,</hi> he received us with ſome expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of affection, but before we deparred we were forced to pay dear for our entertainment, ten Dollers a piece, for that is a Coin that is currant over all the world. The Embaſſadour and thoſe that did wait upon him were free, but for all ſtrangers that did follow him in his journey, they were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to lay down the money or return back again. This little Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant had gathered together ſome numbers of men, who lived thus in this difficult place upon all paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, forcing them to contribute to the maintenance of their lazy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50809:132"/>
There are many ſuch peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that exact upon ſtrangers, the Governors for the <hi>Turk</hi> do wink at them, becauſe at a certain time of the year they ſend a ſweet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume unto them, a Purſe full of Gold and Silver, and in conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this yearly tribute, they ſuffer them to exact, cheat and rob the poor Travellers and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants. We advanced far into the Country many days journey be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we came to the <hi>Turks</hi> Army, they were upon their return from pillaging the Chriſtians, they were laden with ſpoils and ſlaves. They made as much haſte as they could in their march, for the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious John</hi> had gathered his Army together, and was in the purſuit of them from <hi>Suez;</hi> we came firſt into the Country called by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants <hi>Ganfila,</hi> next to <hi>Dafro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ha,</hi> and ſo through <hi>Barnagaſſo, Lacca</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:50809:132"/>
and part of <hi>Dangali;</hi> we arrived at laſt upon the borders. The bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the <hi>Turks</hi> Army when we met it was near a large lake full of excellent fiſh. The people of this Country are ignorant of all kind of Arts, they have not the addreſs of fiſhing; with Bows and Arrows, they kill Birds and Beaſts upon which they feed and live; they own the <hi>Turks</hi> for their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters againſt their will. This lake is in the Kingdom of <hi>Bamagaſſo,</hi> which was lately conquered and taken from the Great <hi>Neguz,</hi> the people retain ſome Reliques of Chriſtianity, but with that igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that one can ſcarce diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh them from the Heathens, unleſs it be by the name, up and down the Country ſome ſorry houſes are erected, fitter for wild beaſts than men. The walls are of mud and ſtones, the roofs of a
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50809:133"/>
ſort of ſlender Cane and Reeds which grow near the water ſide, and in low places, the middle of it is ſupported by a Pillar of wood that ſtands in the huts, and keeps the whole Fabrick from falling to the ground, for this miſerable peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are not acquainted with the Art of Architecture. The Towns are compoſed of this ſort of dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, there are not many of them, but thoſe that are, have choſen the beſt Land for their ſcituations near ſome freſh waters or lakes; for unleſs it be in theſe places the ground is parched up all the year long, but during the time of the Rains. In <hi>Egypt</hi> they never fall, but in <hi>Aethiopia</hi> they are very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary about the month of <hi>January</hi> and <hi>February.</hi> Such vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſhowers do pour down, that no creature is able to abide with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſhelter, ſeveral parties of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50809:133"/>
the <hi>Turks</hi> Army were ſtragling up and down, but the main body was at the lake <hi>Guereſh.</hi> When we came up to them they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of Horſe and Foot about ſix thouſand, not able to abide a a combat with the Abyſſins; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they thought upon nothing elſe than a ſafe retreat. They had plundred the Country people that were yet ſubject to <hi>Preſter John,</hi> and had carryed men, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and children into captivity. A ſad ſight it was unto us that were Chriſtians, to behold our brethren and our Chriſtian name ſo miſerably abuſed by the enemy of Chriſt, our <hi>Abuna</hi> could not refrain from tears, he laboured to relieve ſome of them, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort them in their affliction, but for fear of diſcovering himſelf, he was not willing to expreſs too much grief or kindneſs to them. The
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:50809:134"/>
Embaſſadours credit ſaved us from all affronts, we lodged two nights with them; for during that time they expected the coming up of ſome Troups that were ſent to pillage. It is the cuſtom of the people that border upon the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byſſins, once a year to viſit their Territories, for they meet with a conſiderable deal of plunder with little or no hazard. The Abyſſins are more ſuperſtitious than war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, they have been renowned for Valour, but at preſent they are Cowards, they ſuffer every petty Nation that is daring to deſtroy their borders, which is the fault chiefly of their Governors; for having ſo much Riches as they have, ſo many Mines of Gold, and other conſiderable Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, they might allow a part to ſome war-like people to fight un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their banners, and aſſiſt them
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:50809:134"/>
againſt their troubleſome Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. At preſent they have little communication with people of their Religion, which if they had, it would be a mighty ſupport to them and their intereſt; When the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> were ſent with an unconſiderable party into thoſe Dominions, the <hi>Abyſsin</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour felt the benefit of forrein ſuccours, for the enemy was bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in two battels, and forc'd to yield to the Chriſtian Valour. Amongſt the Priſoners ſeveral Noblemens children were ſeen, who by their Meen and Garb were diſtinguiſhable from the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ſort. Theſe poor creatures were led to be ſold in <hi>Turky</hi> and other places as beaſts, and the worſt is, they were to be forced to renounce their Religion. What a grief was it to their Chriſtian Parents, to ſuffer ſuch a loſs, to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50809:135"/>
have their Sons and Daughters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Infidels? This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniency might be prevented, did theſe In-land Chriſtians keep a ſtrong Guard upon their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines, or with a ſtout reſolution labour to drive theſe Robbers far from their habitations, or labour to revenge themſelves, by carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the War into their own Land, or by ſeizing on the Sea coaſt, and the paſſages of the mountains that limit their Country, where they might place ſuch ſtrong Caſtles and numerous Guards as might keep the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Moors</hi> from all ſuch attempts: But when we have fully taken a view of <hi>Abaſsia</hi> or <hi>Aethiopia</hi> Superiour, and of the Emperour and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, we may be better able to ſee the cauſe of theſe diſorders that happen almoſt every year in ſome corner of the Land. Having
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:50809:135"/>
therefore ſpent ſome days in the view of our Chriſtian brethren that were led into Captivity, we took our leave of them and of the <hi>Turks</hi> Army, and marched on our journey towards a large Town of the Kingdom of <hi>Tigremahon</hi> called <hi>Baſhaw<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> it lies beyond a large Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that runs through <hi>Africa,</hi> it receives the tribute from other ſmall Rivers, and then it runs through many Countreys until it diſcharges it ſelf into <hi>Nilus,</hi> the people of the Country call it in their language <hi>Togaſsi</hi> and others <hi>Guekrahock.</hi> Were it not for this River, it were not poſſible to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in this In-land Country, but it divides it ſelf into ſo many bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and waters ſo large a Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, that no part of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours Country is without ſome benefit that it brings unto it. The Country round about did hear
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50809:136"/>
the Marches of the enemies rage and fury, the Towns were burnt to the ground, the people either fled or carryed into captivity, the land and trees were not ſpared in ſome places, for they had cut down a great quantity to facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate their paſſages over ſome Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. Here we came into a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try far more fruitful than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I had ſeen in <hi>Africa,</hi> it was capable of more improvement; did the Inhabitants skill and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry anſwer the goodneſs of the ſoil, I do not find but this part might bear as excellent Fruits as any other place of the world. The heat of the climate quickens na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the production of all Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getatives, ſo that it is bleſſed with two Springs every year, or at leaſt with two Crops of every thing that is ſown or planted, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be in thoſe places that
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:50809:136"/>
want the benefit of water; we met here with ſome flying parts of the <hi>Turks</hi> Army riding apace after the main body, for they were purſued by ſeveral troops of the <hi>Abyſsins.</hi> Thoſe thieves had adventured almoſt near the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Tents without reſiſtance, not without conſiderable plunder able to reward them for their labours; we proceeded on our way about two leagues before we came to meet with the inhabitants of the Country, the firſt were a party of horſe-men very well mounted purſuing their enemies, they complained unto the Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour of the <hi>Turks</hi> violences, we were afraid that they would have violated the Law of Nations upon him, they received us with that rage; the preſence of the <hi>Abuna</hi> hindred them from offering injury to his Perſon; Him they received
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:50809:137"/>
with all expreſſions of honour and kindneſs, and ſuffered ſome of them to return back to guard him, the reſt continued on their way. They overtook the <hi>Turks</hi> at the ford of a little River very buſie to get over their Captives and Goods, we heard that they fell upon them with a wonderful fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and recovered much of the ſpoils, killing great numbers of them. They returned afterwards in triumph with much honour, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſo ſucceſſefully encountred with their enemies. In the mean whiles we proceeded in our jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney towards the Emperour of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſsia,</hi> who hearing of the <hi>Abuna</hi>'s arrival, ſent ſome of his Court to Complement him and bid him welcome; where ever he paſſed the Clergy &amp; people came to receive him with more ſigns of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs than pomp, the proceſſions
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:50809:137"/>
of the people came to meet us at the entrance of the towns, and when we came within ſight of the Emperours tents, he ſent all the Court to receive the <hi>Abuna.</hi> I did carefully obſerve all the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Reception and Inſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The <hi>Abuna</hi> as ſoon as he came within the tents, went to kiſs the Emperours Girdle. He was ſtanding in a ſtately tent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected in the middle of the reſt, about it was a large place much like to a Market, where the Courtiers are accuſtomed to walk, at the right hand is another very beautiful, where the Emperours Wives and Concubines dwell; at the top of the Princes tent is a Golden Croſs with an Angel holding it in his left hand, with a drawn Cymeter in the right. The <hi>Abuna</hi> went to change his habit and put on another, according to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:50809:138"/>
the <hi>Abyſsin</hi> cuſtom. It is a very ſingular one, none but the High-Prieſt hath the liberty to wear it, for it is the badge or character by which he is diſtinguiſhed from the other <hi>Papa</hi>'s or Biſhops of that Country, and from the reſt of the Clergy, he was conducted next, to pay his reſpects to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, he was in the Kingdom of <hi>Beleguaze</hi> near a town very well peopled and ſcituated in a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant plain called <hi>Ikroah,</hi> about ſix leagues diſtant from the River <hi>Tagaſsi,</hi> I had the ſatisfaction to accompany the <hi>Abuna,</hi> for he was a man of a very mild and kind ſpirit, very pleaſant in company, yet grave and ſerious, he was led by the Maſter of the Ceremonies into the Inner room where the Emperour lay upon a curious Bed of White Cotton Bed with a large fringe of Gold, behind him
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:50809:138"/>
ſtood his naked Sword, and round about were the Lords of his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Councel; above was a Canopy of cloath of Gold, with green ſilk interwoven, the room it ſelf was hung with the ſame ſtuffe; aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoon as the <hi>Abuna</hi> enter'd the room he kneel'd three times on the ground, and then aſcended the ſteps to the Bed to perform his reſpects; In the mean whiles the Emperour roſe from his couch and half up embraced the <hi>Abuna,</hi> wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him much felicity in his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, they diſcourſed ſome time together, and then he was diſmiſt with all honour and civility; the Emperour was pleaſed to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of his retinue, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of my ſelf. I was alſo admitted to the honour of kiſſing his Gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, a ceremony only due to the Prince. I followed the <hi>Abuna,</hi> who received me into his own
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:50809:139"/>
lodgings, and would not ſuffer me whiles I was in that Country to be obliged to any other place for my retreat. Now I have brought my Reader into the Imperial tents of <hi>Abaſsia,</hi> it is convenient that we ſhould take a view as from a high place of all the inferiour orders of men, and of all particulars which his curioſity may be inquiſitive. And firſt</p>

               <head>Of the Emperour.</head>
               <p>THe Emperour of the <hi>Abyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins</hi> is a Prince highly hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of his ſubjects, becauſe they fancy him to be lineally deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from that noble and Religious King that firſt planted the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion amongſt them; and as they are extreamly devoted to it; ſo much, that they appear al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt extravagant in many of their
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:50809:139"/>
practiſes, they have no ſmall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to his Poſterity, who firſt brought them the advantage of the Chriſtian Faith. None hath acceſs to him of his ſubjects unleſs it be upon ſolemn occaſions, but the chief Officers of his Crown, when he rides or is carryed abroad in a Royal Throne, all his people fall upon their knees and adore him; this throne is a kind of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan, but far more ſtately, with ſteps aſcending to it made of wood gilt over, covered with Gold, it is carryed upon mens ſhoulders, or between four Horſes, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour appears in it with much ſtate, and with more glory than in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing that I have ſeen; He never ſtirs out of his tents, but 600 men do follow him at his heels, they are his daily guard, they wear a Livery and a Habit diſtinct from all other people, on
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:50809:140"/>
their head a Scarlet bonnet with three white plumes faſtned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind with a blew croſs on their ſhoulders, they have a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Coat that comes down to their middle, with a Girdle or Saſh, over it a Roman Mantle hangs, more proper for State than action; the colour is green, it is not very long, nor troubleſome when they are obliged to make uſe of their hands; ſometimes they ride, ſometimes they go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot, as the Emperours occaſion requires; for that purpoſe he hath always ready in his Stables great numbers of Horſes. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours Perſon is whiter than any of his Kingdom, for the <hi>Abyſsins</hi> are tawny, a colour drawing near to black. I never ſaw any others of his Relations or kindred, but I hear they are all of the ſame co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. The people interpret this
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:50809:140"/>
to his advantage, that God by this diſtinction, hath ſingled out that Family that is to Reign amongſt them, out of which they always chuſe their Emperour; their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom is, that he ſhould never mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry until he be crowned; then, with the conſent of his Nobles he chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth two Wives out of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, he entertains beſides as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Concubines as he pleaſeth. They are always with him in his tents with all their Attendants. The firſt Male-child uſually ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds the Father in his Kingdom. Aſſoon as the children are named, they are carryed to a very delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous place in the middle of a large mountain called <hi>Amarak,</hi> where a ſtately Caſtle is built encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed with the River <hi>Borohr,</hi> and fortified with a ſtrong wall. There they are kept with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther precious things belonging to
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:50809:141"/>
the Emperour, they never go out unleſs it be in the Gardens and places of Recreation, with which this territory is abundantly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed; and then they never looſe the ſight of their governours and guard; when the Father is dead the chief Officers of the Empire come to this place, and unleſs the eldeſt be uncapable of the honour, they take him to ſucceed in his Fathers room. If there be no Sons, the eldeſt Daughter takes the Scepter. During their Fathers life, they are kept here as in a <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio,</hi> to learn all exerciſes proper to their Sex and age. They are taught the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Arabick</hi> tongues, humane Philoſophy and the Principles of Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Here is for that purpoſe a large Library of above ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Volums all in Manuſcripts, ſome told me that they had there
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:50809:141"/>
the moſt ancient Books of the world written by the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Sages in the time of <hi>Moſes,</hi> by <hi>Phaenicians</hi> afterwards, and by the Learned of all Ages. I ſaw ſome in the Library (into which I had the leave to enter) that were made of the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> leaf called <hi>Papy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> and others made of old Parchment that did bear the marks of antiquity. I ask'd the <hi>Subdi</hi> an Officer that led me in to ſee the curioſities, how they did to preſerve the Books ſo many years from conſuming, he told me that they do uſually tranſcribe them when the leaves are worn or likely to decay, and that for that intent there are twenty three Perſons appointed with a good maintenance for them by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Emperours; their imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is only to tranſcribe and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py out the books that age threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens

Hither are alſo ſent the chief Noblemens ſons of the Empire to keep company with the Royal bloud, and to receive with them the inſtructions which this place only affords, for here is maintained a Learned Biſhop with: ſeveral inferiour Prieſts that have the charge of inſtructing and tutering the Children that are committed to their cuſtody.

The Embaſſadours of the Infidels do never receive the honour of ſpeaking to him, but they are dealt with by the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome appointed for that purpoſe. The <hi>Abuna</hi> is much reſpected at Court; what he ſpeaks, is received by all as a Law. The former Emperour was a man of War, but this is a Peace-maker to his own prejudice, and that of his Subjects. He hath this good quality, that he is ſevere againſt
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:50809:24"/>
all vices, againſt Swearing and Drunkenneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He is fitter to ſit upon a peaceable Throne than to govern one that hath ſo many watchful enemies about it as his hath. He is very inquiſitive into all Affairs, he ſuffers none to be diſpatcht without his knowledge. He is not eaſily over-ruled by Councel, but ſticks faſt to his own opinion and reſolution, ſometimes to his prejudice; he is very Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and a great obſerver of the Ceremonies of his Church, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all things that appear with the face of Innovation; by this means it happens that all about him look ſo ſerious in their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious duties, and ſhew leſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneſs in their Practiſes, their Princes example encourages them. If any be named debauch'd, he is certain to be diſgrac'd as ſoon as the fame hath reach'd his
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:50809:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Maſters ear. A great favourite of the Emperour, one that attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on him continually, was ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected to have ſome familiarity with anothers Wife, the ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was blown by ſome envious perſons into the Emperours ear, who preſently ſent for him, and diſmiſſed him his ſervice. This good ſeverity cauſeth his Laws to be well obeyed. Did this Emperour know as well how to deal with his enemies, as he doth know how to govern his Subjects, he would be as much feared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad as he is reverenced at home, and all his Neighbours would ſtand in aw of him. I doubt not but the Empire of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> would be again reſtored to its former Greatneſs, could he but as well manage a Sword as a Scepter. But that weakneſs is to be attributed to the manner and place of his
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:50809:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Education, he hath been ſhut with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the narrow limits of a little Territory unto which he did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine his ambition when he was produced in the world; his larger fortune did not increaſe his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, but being content to what he then enjoyed, the increaſe was look'd upon as a ſuper fluity, beſides this manner of Education weakens the ſpirits that ſhould have a compaſs and a larger ſcope to act than a narrow mountain or a ſmall Territory. He was there ſo accuſtomed to a Pedantick life, that he knew not how to handle the helm of State, and act ſupream in the buſineſs of the Empire. His Governours I conceive did ſo domineer over him, as it is their cuſtom, that he was ignorant in any other thing but how to obey. As therefore our Countryman <hi>Machiavel</hi> wiſely adviſes, let the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:50809:25"/>
Prince that is to ſucceed his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be nurſed up in the Camp, and in the midſt of buſineſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men of courage and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, that he may take impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions ſutable to the employment he is to have in the world; for were a Prince to judge of a propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of Divinity, or to compoſe a piece of Latine or Greek, I would then ſhut in the wandring thoughts of his youth, and not ſuffer them to ſee the world a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad: but ſeeing he is to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand men, rather than Schollars; and to compoſe thoſe Affairs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which depend his Subjects quiet and happineſs, I think it is wiſdom to train him up according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and let him ſee the face of Souldiers as well as of Pedants, a Gun and a Sword as well as Books, that he may not only be a Maſter, but a King. My buſineſs
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:50809:26"/>
is not to enlarge upon the manner of Education proper to a Prince, only I take notice of the defaults I have mark'd in <hi>Ethiopia</hi> in the bringing up their young Nobility, and the Perſon that is to wear the Crown, that if theſe Memoirs have the happineſs to fall into the hands of any of our Princes of <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly,</hi> they may not make their Children ſo bookiſh that they may not be able to handle a Sword. This preſent Emperour of <hi>Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia</hi> is the moſt Learned of all his Dominions, he ſpeaks <hi>Arabick, Perſian, Hebrew,</hi> and many other Languages; he is read in Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, in Aſtrology: He is fitter for contemplation than for action.</p>

               <p>Beſides the Biſhops that wait upon the Court, here are ten Chaplains, Miniſters of the Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Orders of the Clergy, who do on the Sabbath day expound before the Emperour in their turns, ſome Text of Scripture ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ancient manner of the <hi>Jews</hi> who had their Synago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, where the Law was read and explained to the people every week. The Saturday is the day appointed in this place for publick Devotion. The manner ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved at that time, I ſhall ſet
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:50809:27"/>
down in its place; all Orders of men do reſort to their Churches to aſſiſt in the ſervice of God.</p>
               <p>In the Court are entertained all the Princes ſons that have any dependency upon this Empire; when they come of age whiles they are young, they are kept in the Caſtle of <hi>Amara,</hi> and there brought up with the young Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror; a policy not unuſeful to this State, for by this means they are taught be time to know and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect their future Prince, and when they are of age to manage and govern the Affairs of their ſeveral jurisdictions; they are more faithful to his intereſt, for whom they have had a kindeſs from their Infancy, for nothing nouriſhes love ſo much as an early acquaintance; and nothing lays a better foundation to a ſincere friendſhip and loyalty, as a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:50809:28"/>
from their tender years. They are there taught to honour and reſpect the Emperours Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and he is alſo obliged to a loving correſpondency with them. But aſſoon as they come of age, the Emperor calls them to Court, and there they are further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed and tutored before he commits unto them their Fathers Eſtates and Kingdoms. This ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges alſo the Parents to ſtick cloſe to the Emperour, for their ſons are as pledges in His Court of their fidelity and obedience.</p>
               <p>The Emperour is not to dwell in any houſe, nor to make any long reſidence in any Town, for they look upon it as beneath his Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur to be confined within the Walls of any habitation; and they judge it not conſiſtant with the benefit of the publick, that one place ſhould conſtantly enjoy
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:50809:28"/>
him; therefore it is provided by the Statute Law of that Nation, that the Prince ſhall never ſtay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove four days in any Town, for that reaſon, when he hath been beaten by his Neighbours, he ſhut not up himſelf in Cities or Fortreſſes, but ſaved himſelf into the remoteſt and Deſart places, where none did offer to ſeek him out, or to adventure themſelves but the wild beaſts. The people of the Country that hold from him all their Lands and Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, do never ſuffer him to be long in that diſtreſs, but they flock about him out of a fear to loſe the right or privileges of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection; ſo that if he loſeth one battel and his people be deſtroyed whiles there are any remaining in the Land, he is able to make a head againſt the enemy, for all are obliged in ſuch caſes to appear in

will ſhew his Grandeur and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to his Courtiers, he ſends for his Chief Queen, who muſt appear in all the State and Glory that her Induſtry or Beauty can produce, ſhe is received by the Emperour with ſome expreſſions of kindneſs, and then ſhe is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to ſit down on his right hand, for the left is the place of honour in <hi>Abaſsia.</hi>

Theſe Judges have only a power over the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the Clergy and Monks have other Officers and Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants that do judge of their mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe inferiour Judges, every other year the grand Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal or Supream <hi>Bikir</hi> ſends men into ſeveral Provinces to hearken
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:50809:34"/>
after the behaviour, and examine the deportment of the Judges. If any be found guilty of any crime, he is ſeverely puniſhed and ſhamefully thruſt out of his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice with a mark of Infamy, that renders him incapable of having any publick employment in this Country. Such ſeldom remain there long, for the ſhame and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquy of the people forces them to be gone and ſeek other habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in a remote Country. The <hi>Bikir</hi> hath alſo his Lieutenants, like unto our Colonels, diſpoſed of in all the dominions of grand <hi>Neguz,</hi> each Lieutenant gives him account of all the men he is able to provide for the ſervice of the Prince in caſe of neceſſity, and he governs the people, keeps all things in order, aſſiſts the <hi>Bikir</hi> and all his inferiour Officers in the execution of their Offices, when
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:50809:34"/>
they are requir'd; for that purpoſe, they have ſo many men ready upon all occaſions to obey their orders; theſe receive a continual ſalary from the Emperour, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they are otherwiſe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in ſeveral Trades. At the leaſt ſummons they aſſemble at the Rendezvous, and follow their Leaders, who by this means keep all the Country in awe, and appeaſe the tumults and diſorders that may happen amongſt a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed multitude.</p>
               <p>In the time of the Wars, theſe Lieutenants of diſtinct places ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their men together at the place appointed, and then march with them according to order, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually to the place where the great <hi>Neguz</hi> is himſelf, to guard and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his Perſon. They carry with them their Proviſions and Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als proportionable to the time
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:50809:35"/>
appointed for them to ſtay in Arms. Theſe officers have places allotted to them for their mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance by the Emperour, who is Lord and ſole owner of all the Land within his great Empire. All the people are but his ſlaves, their ſubſtance and goods are his when he will require them; unto perſons more eminent than the reſt he appoints certain Lands and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for to recompence them for the pains they take in his ſervice. All the people pay the tenth part of all fruits to the King, that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue belongs to the Crown: they always pay the tribute and taxes in the Commodities of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, in Salt, Gold, Silver, Corn, Hides, Elephants Teeth, the horn of the <hi>Rhinocerot,</hi> ſlaves and ſuch like.</p>
               <p>Now this manner of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is only in the Territories,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:50809:35"/>
more immediately ſubject to the <hi>Neguz,</hi> the others, where tributary Kings do Reign, are not thus ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to his power, the Kings give no account of their actions to him, or to his Officers, but play the ſoveraigns in all their jurisdictions, cauſing money to be ſtamp'd in their names, tributes and cuſtoms to be levyed according to the publick wants, diſpoſing of all of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and places within their ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories at their will.</p>
               <p>Of late they have brought in ſtamped Coin, which before was not known in this Empire. The name and titles of the <hi>Neguez</hi> is Printed in one ſide, and a large Croſs on the other, with ſome Characters ſignifying that he is a defender of the Croſs. There are yet ſome little pieces of Gold, Braſs and Iron, with Pepper, and all other Merchandiſes, that ſerve
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:50809:36"/>
inſtead of Coin in the places far from the Imperial Court, and where Coin cannot ſo eaſily be obtained nor made. Thoſe that are found guilty of crimes, are not ordinarily puniſhed with death (they uſe to deprive them for their offences of ſome of their Limbs) of their eyes, hands, or feet, forcing them to a continual ſufferance the reſt of their days. If any commit ſacriledge, he is burnt without mercy in the fire; and thoſe that murder, by their Law are to loſe their lives, unleſs the Prince will mitigate the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment by a perpetual priſon or baniſhment.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Manda</hi> are ſeveral penal Statutes, amongſt the reſt, that if a Prieſt be guilty of any crime, as of murder, of perjury, adultery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he is to be puniſhed in the ſame manner as the reſt of the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:50809:36"/>
people, that he is to be called be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the common Judge after that the Biſhop hath notice of the fact, and that both together are to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the ſentence that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves without any mercy.</p>
               <p>It is commanded in that book, that all, both Secular and Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtick perſons are to abſtain from all carnal Copulation during the ſpace of twenty four hours next immediately before they enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Churches.</p>
               <p>There is in it a very wholſome Law that concerns the good of the publick: It is that two times every year there ſhall be an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly called of the moſt Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend and Eminent Perſons of the Nation to conſult of the Affairs of the Church, and eſtabliſh Laws according to the occaſions and times. That then the <hi>Abuna</hi> ſhall ſit as Preſident with the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:50809:37"/>
chief Judge, and that of the Clergy and Fryers, there ſhall be called out of all parts to make Decrees for the good of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</p>
               <p>Adulterers are puniſhed with death in this manner. The Man and the Woman are ſtript naked and ty'd up by the legs to ſome high tree, where they are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main to feed the Fowl of the air, until their bones and fleſh fall to the ground. It is no leſs than death to touch them, or to offer to ſhew favour to their dead Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaſſes. By this exemplary puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of theſe offenders, men grow more wary how they ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to defile their Neighbours Bed, and Women are not ſo free of their Tailes as amongſt our jealous <hi>Italians.</hi> Men in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try pretend not ſo much Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Gallantry, and Women
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:50809:37"/>
dare not countenance the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or paſſion of a ſecret Lover. Cuſtom here teaches women as much privacy as in any other place, but not with that ſtrictneſs that might render them ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, but they abuſe it not as other people do, the better to hide their foul actions, and the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of their Gallants. There is more innocency in the behaviour of the women; as much modeſty, but leſs craft and ſubtilty; as much freedom, but little debauchery.</p>
               <p>Murder is no leſs hateful in this place, it hath a puniſhment allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to it no leſs grievous: The murderer that knew how to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy others, is forced to deſtroy himſelf alſo; in this manner a Sword is put into his hands, and he is laid upon a large piece of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron flat, as long and as broad as a mans body, it is ſupported with
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:50809:38"/>
four feet under it, a gentle flame is entertained that heats it, and puts him by degrees to cruel tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the pain &amp; rage forces him to thruſt the weapon into his own bowels, by that means to deliver himſelf from the unmerciful fury of the fire, and abridge his tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. This kind of death is pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed in <hi>Tigremahon</hi> and <hi>Angote,</hi> in other places, the murder is exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted in another manner, they flea him alive, and cut his eye lids, and then they expoſe him to the Sun in that raw condition in ſome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent place, rubbing him over with honey to invite the Bees and Waſps to feed upon him. This kind of death is the moſt inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane that I ever beheld. The pain is both grievous and tedious, death creeps upon them by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and ſuffers them not to die till they have endured a world of miſery.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:50809:38"/>The Noblemen and Grandees of the Court that offend the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guz,</hi> or commit any other crime worthy of death, are not executed in the common manner, nor in the uſual places appointed for that purpoſe. There is in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Damut</hi> a high Mountain naturally well fortified with a ſteep ridge of hills on every ſide, a narrow paſſage leads up to the top, where a Caſtle is erected kept by the Souldiers of the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guz</hi> guard. There all noble men are brought that venture to break the Laws of the Land, or to diſpleaſe their Soveraign Lord. The Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorie round about is very bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, and the place extream cold moſt part of the year; whether it be the nature of the Soil, or the elevation of the Mountain into the ſecond Region of the Air, none could tell me, but here theſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:50809:39"/>
of Quality are famiſhed to death, impriſoned, and put to ſuffer ſeveral other ſorts of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments according to the pleaſure of the <hi>Neguz.</hi> This place is very convenient for that purpoſe, for the Friends and Acquaintance of the offenders cannot come to learn the miſeries that they endure, nor the cruelties that they ſuffer; which if they did know, might oblige them to a revenge, or ill will againſt their Emperours.</p>

Theſe men live ſuch pleaſant lives, that none can think of marrying whiles he remains amongſt them; they have plenty of all things provided for them, brought out of all parts of the world by means of their traffick; they have excellent company among themſelves, free from all troubles of the world.

If there be a Paradiſe on

earth, I think it is in <hi>Ethiopia</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt theſe Monks and Fryers; they are ſo far from begging, that at ſolemn times of the year, at the Nativity of our Saviour, at Eaſter, Pentecoſt, <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> and the birth-day of the Emperour, they ſend their liberalities to all the poor people round their Covents, eſpecially to thoſe that are burthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with numbers of Children, and have nothing to make them ſubſiſt but their daily labour. Were our Fryers, our Franciſcans, Mendicants, and the other Orders of Religious men of this diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in his Holineſs dominions, the people would honour and reſpect them, and they would gain much credit to the Roman Church by ſuch practiſes, and to themſelves. Theſe Fyers that are thus retired out of the great concourſe of the towns and people, are of ſeveral
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:50809:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>
fraternities, ſome are called the Moncks of St. <hi>Anthony,</hi> theſe are the moſt numerous. Their foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was an <hi>Anachoret</hi> of <hi>Egypt</hi> that ſpent his latter days in the deſart places in tilling and dreſſing the ground. He drew unto him ſuch numbers of people that were wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with the toil and troubles of the great world, that he ſaw ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſands imitate his example before he dyed. The other fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternities are thoſe of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> of St. <hi>Maconius,</hi> whoſe employment is the ſame with the Monks of St. <hi>Anthony,</hi> they differ only in their names. In every Covent they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect every year a Superintendant whom they call <hi>Loucana;</hi> he is to keep good orders, and to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer all the miſcarriages that are committed by the Society, if he allows of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:50809:48"/>Theſe bleſſed places are to pay no Revenue to the Emperour, but of their prayers. All other Lands are at his diſpoſal by the Statutes of the Empire, he is the Lord of them, but theſe that belong to the Fryers are none of his, and free from all impoſitions. So are all the other Lands and places that belong to the Clergy; for we may take notice that the tythes of all things belonging to the Emperor, the Clergy and thoſe that attend in the worſhip of God have a maintenance appointed unto them out of certain Lands and territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: which they muſt ſee manured as well as the reſt of the people do theirs, for they receive little or no benevolence from the Country, they depend not upon them for their maintenance: ſo that by that means they are highly honoured of all men, and beloved becauſe
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:50809:49"/>
they rather give to them, than take from them; and although they are well rewarded for their pains from the Lands allotted to them, their good Offices look as favours and kindneſſes done to the people, becauſe nothing proceeds from their labours or Eſtates to reward the Prieſts inſtructions and Attendance.</p>
               <p>The Churches are ſeparated into three diſtinct places or rooms according to the manner of the <hi>Jews.</hi> At the entrance of the Temple, about ſix paces there is a Curtain drawn that makes the firſt ſeparation, every body may go into the Church, but none but thoſe that have been ſanctified by the <hi>Abuna</hi> have liberty to go into that place, and paſs the firſt Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. This was wiſely enacted to oblige all the Nobility and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Quality to receive that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit

Next to this place before the Altar-table, is drawn another Curtain, beyond which none hath liberty to paſs but the Prieſts themſelves when the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is adminiſtred. Theſe curtains are drawn, but the people keep themſelves in their ſeveral diſtinct places until the time of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</p>
               <p>The Churches are very neatly adorned with Pictures, which theſe people do not worſhip, but only as Ornaments to their Religious Houſes, they place them there. The Churches are built of Lime and Stone, which they uſe not in their common buildings; for they think it decent that the places ſet apart for the Service of God ſhould have no common materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als. None therefore but ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:50809:50"/>
houſes of the Emperour are built in this manner, and with the ſame ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>When the Prieſt hath loſt his Wife by death, he may not mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry again unleſs he wil loſe the power of executing his function, yet the Patriarch may give a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe to marry again, but without that Licenſe it is altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful.</p>
               <p>They bury their dead with the greateſt ceremony imaginable, they cloath them in all their moſt gaudy attire, and carry them in a Chair with their faces and hands uncovered, if the dead hath been a Souldier, he hath the honour to go armed into the grave; before, march the Prieſt and the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men, ſaying ſome good ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, adviſing the people to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare to depart; then comes the Corps ſeated in his Chair of State
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:50809:50"/>
trimed with Garlands and Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and with ſome white Feathers, if he be young, with yellow if he be of a middle age, and with black if he be old. The ſight is ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, that it would almoſt give e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one a mind to be in the room of the dead; the Parents follow with a badge of mourning upon their heads, a handful of aſhes, the next come their friends and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance; thus they proceed to the Grave in order, where the firſt ch. of the Goſpel of S. <hi>John</hi> is read, &amp; the noble Actions &amp; vertues of the dead are rehearſed, all hearing with much devotion, then the Prieſt as they put the body in the Grave pronounceth theſe words, <hi>Duſt thou art, and to dust thou ſhalt return.</hi> The next day they give alms, and ſend gifts to their friends in the name of the deceaſed, and bring upon his Grave a banquet
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:50809:51"/>
according to the Quality of the Perſons. And every day for a moneth they continue to viſit the Sepulchre of the dead, and to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer up ſome prayers for him to Almighty God, for they imagine ſomething of purgatory, and of the unſealed eſtate of the Soul im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after its departure out of this life, which obliges them to intreat for them, that they may enter into the joys of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>

it; I did really hear ſtrange voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and names in the air, but ſaw nothing, but I did attribute the cauſe to the wind, and the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the mountains that are ſo placed, that when a ſtrong gale blows upon the Rocks there are unuſual names heard; the wind ſtrikes alſo through ſeveral Caves, and at the entry many ſhreiks and crys are heard, ſo that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try people dare not adventure in to know the cauſe of them. The vulgar opinion is, that this place leads into hell, and that the Souls of the damned tormented in theſe lower-parts of the earth, do ſend up here their complaints.

by the profeſſors of it. The ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages to be expected in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity are ſufficient to perſwade us, violence better becomes a <hi>Mahomet</hi> than Chriſt, he never made uſe of his whip, but to drive men out of his Church.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> have here their Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues, but they are at preſent ſo little frequented, that I think the name will be one day loſt by reaſon of their great numbers that daily turn Chriſtians.</p>

the Emperours as Hoſtages of their fidelity.

But we do not acknowledge the Superiority that his Succeſſors the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> do derive from S. <hi>Peter;</hi> nor do we believe that he ever had any priviledge which the others did not enjoy. We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the holy Apoſtles, Saints, and Martyrs that are in glory did follow the foot-ſteps of our Saviour Chriſt, and that they have received from him the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:50809:70"/>
of their ſins, as we do. We believe that we muſt honour them with the holy Angels, but we do not approve of prayers made unto them, nor of the ſufficiency of their Merits to benefit us, or the Church of Chriſt. We believe that it is well done to confeſs our ſins before the Miniſters of the Church, for by their prayers we may be aſſiſted and comforted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We receive all the books of the Old and New Teſtament, as they were delivered unto us by S. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> without any addition or inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. We believe that our Clergy have liberty to Marry, as the Apoſtles and Diſciples of our Saviour were, but that it is not lawful for a Prieſt to have two Wives or a Concubine. We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that we are bound to obey in Conſcience cur Supream Lord <hi>

                  <hi>Abuna</hi> of our Church, with all the reſt of our Eccleſiaſtical and Civil Magiſtrates and Superiours, but no other. We religiouſly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that there is a place where the leſs Regenerate perſons do go after this life, which is neither Hell, nor Heaven; what it is, and what the ſouls do ſuffer in it, we are not able to define. We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that none can be ſaved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the bloud of Jeſus Chriſt, that it is ſufficient to cleanſe us from all our ſins, without any other aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, and that we are not to truſt upon the Merits of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Saints that were but ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful men as we were. We believe that there ſhall be a day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment where Chriſt ſhall appear in glory to Judge all men; that we muſt all appear before him to give an account of our actions, and that after that we ſhall all either go to
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:50809:71"/>
hell or heaven; the wicked to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting burning, and the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous to eternal bliſs. <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the faith that the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of <hi>Precious Giam,</hi> which we are to maintain until the coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.

               <p>This addition was lately made, ſince the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> and other <hi>Europeans</hi> have travelled into thoſe parts; for when ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious men did endeavour to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the Emperour to ſubmit to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> and joyn with the other Chriſtian Princes in their obedience to the Popes power. He would never do it, not would never ſuffer the divulging the opinions which we do embrace in <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:50809:71"/>They do believe whatſoever is in their Books called <hi>Manda</hi> and <hi>Abetil,</hi> as the Goſpel it ſelf; they do fancy that the Apoſtles and Diſciples being aſſembled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> did cauſe them to be written for the benefit of Chriſtianity. In them are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained theſe precepts.</p>
               <p>To faſt every <hi>Wedneſday</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the wicked reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Jews</hi> made upon that day to crucifie Chriſt.</p>
               <p>To faſt every <hi>Fryday,</hi> becauſe on that day Chriſt was crucified for our ſins, on theſe days it is commanded to faſt untill the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>To obſerve forty dayes Lent, eſpecially the Paſſion week, and then to feed upon nothing but bread and water.</p>
               <p>To meet together on the Lords day, and then to hear the Reading
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:50809:72"/>
of the holy Writings of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Prophets, which are to be expounded by ſome appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>To meet alſo upon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-day, and then to ſpend the time in prayer and holy duties, in which days it is not permitted to do any ſervile work. The <hi>Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> they keep becauſe God on that day had finiſhed the great Work of the Creation of the world; The Lords-day is alſo ſet apart for Religious duties, becauſe Chriſt on the firſt day of the week did riſe from the dead.</p>
               <p>Several other days of the year are kept holy, ſome are thoſe that are obſerved in our Church, others are particular days appointed to continue the Memory of ſome great deliverances and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar favours which that Church and Empire have received.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:50809:72"/>They do believe that in their Feſtival days; and in the Sabbath and Lords-day, the ſouls of the damned are releaſed from their torments until the Evening, but that they can never come out of that place of darkneſs.</p>
               <p>Some thoughts they have of Purgatory, but not as we in the Catholick Church; they do not think that Maſſes, Prayers, or any other pious actions can convey any benefit to the miſerable ſouls that are there frying in the ſubterrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ovens; therefore they never beſtow their Eſtates for the dead, but when they are departed, they leave them to their fortunes, as they do us to ours. One thing is very commendable amongſt them; when any are dead that have left ſome viſible eſtate, they ſend for the pooreſt perſons of that place, &amp; offer unto them gifts in the name
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:50809:73"/>
of the deceaſed; they make a Feaſt for others better qualified, and ſpend two or three days in Mirth and jollity at the expences of the dead; a cuſtom derived from the <hi>Scythians,</hi> who did thus rejoyce when their friends depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the world, and did cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate their entrance into it with the effuſion of tears, or rather this practice is derived from the belief of a Reſurrection, and the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that the party that is dead is free from all the ſenſe of miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and affliction, unto which the living are expoſed daily.</p>
               <p>They do not believe that Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes can redeem the ſouls of men from the puniſhments unto which they are liable by their miſcarria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, therefore they never ſee the Prieſt to huddle up before the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar any prayers for them, nor do the dying perſons leave any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:50809:73"/>
rents for Maſſes to be ſaid in remembrance of him, or to fetch him out of the flames of Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
               <p>The Sacrament of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt they do adminiſter, ſometimes every Sunday or Sabbath-day, but as it was anciently practiſed by the the Chriſtians of Primitive times in both kinds. They are not afraid of that inconvenience that the wiſe men of our latter days have thought upon, of profaning the bloud of Chriſt upon every unhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed lip, or by ſpilling it on the ground, therefore the people do receive with the Prieſt in a moſt humble manner, almoſt proſtrate to the ground, before they take it into their hands, they make three bows to expreſs the ſacred Trinity of perſons, and then with lifted up eyes and hands they eat the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, or the bread, and drink of the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:50809:74"/>
cup, kiſſing it before they part with it out of their hands. They have as much reverence for that Sacrament, as we in <hi>Italy,</hi> but they do not think the bread to be Tranſubſtantiated into fleſh, nor the wine into bloud, nor do they pay any reſpect unto it, but only when they do receive it. I did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of ſome of them why they did eat it with that reverence, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they did not fancy it other than our ordinary bread; the anſwer was, that it was conſecrated to a holy uſe, and that ſome reſpect was therefore due unto the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Bread and Wine; but when that ſhould not be, the moſt humble poſture was moſt decent for thoſe that received from Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, ſo great a favour as the ſigns of Chriſt Crucified. They do not preſerve either the Bread or Wine upon their Altars (that
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:50809:74"/>
are much like ours) to another day, nor do they ſend it to comfort the ſick; that cuſtom they do not approve of, becauſe they may ſo frequently receive it every where, that they do not ſtand in need of it in ſo ſhort a time as their ſick perſons do continue in their crazie eſtate.</p>
               <p>This cuſtom they have amongſt them, that when any hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Bread and Wine, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ventures to ſpit all that day, but retains all the humidity that flows into his mouth, and ſwallows it for fear of caſting to the ground any part of that Cup that was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for to increaſe their faith. This cuſtom is kept ſo Religiou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly, that there is a great penalty put upon every one that is ſeen to ſuffer any water to go out of his mouth that day, untill the eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; he is forced to pay to the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:50809:75"/>
poor, and towards the reparations of their Church a large ſumme of money, and to ſuffer an impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſix days, during which time he hath ſcarce enough of water allowed unto him to drink. Thus they puniſh exceſs or want of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence by want of neceſſaries, a good way to make a man ſober. They give the Sacrament not only to men grown up in years, but alſo to Babes and Children, for they do imagine, that ſeeing Chriſt and his Apoſtles do eſteem them holy, of the body of the Church, and commands them to be admitted into the Communion of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, that therefore it is lawful to grant unto them the priviledges of Chriſtian people, as if they had an actual faith as thoſe that are more aged have. They are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of thoſe great diſputes that have lately allarm'd <hi>Europe,</hi> and
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:50809:75"/>
are not acquainted with theniceties that have put us together by the ears about the Euchariſt. They know nothing of Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the words of the Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they underſtand, without any interpretation, that they declare unto us the uſe and benefits that we are to receive by this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Chriſtian Church. They do not trouble their heads whether perſonally or virtually, whether corporally or ſpiritually Chriſt is preſent in his Ordinance. They hope for ſalvation without the knowledge of theſe curioſities, and I think they will attain unto it before us that are carryed by theſe diſputes of the Schools to deadly animoſities againſt our brethren; we had been in <hi>Europe</hi> very happy, if the liberty of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in this particular had been left to every one of us, but the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:50809:76"/>
Devil cannot fiſh but in troubled waters, and turbulent men have raiſed theſe diſputes for their own intereſt, but could never bring any benefit to the publick by them, but ruine and deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. If like the <hi>Abyſsin</hi> Church, we had not troubled our ſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout trifles, we had ſpared the bloud of many Chriſtian Nations, and might be more ready to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the <hi>Turk,</hi> that daily incroaches upon us. In the celebration of the Sacrament, they uſe no cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, nor inſignificant geſtures at the Conſecration, but as Chirſt commanded, ſo they practice; the Bread is of the ordinary bread that they uſe in thoſe Kingdoms, they take of the better ſort for this uſe, and lay it in a large plate of Gold or Earth of a blew colour, and the Wine is of the juice of the Grape ſqueezed out of it on purpoſe.
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:50809:76"/>
They place both very handſomely upon a Table or Altar at the end of the Church, and after the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration, the Prieſt followed by ſome Attendants, goes to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Separations, where he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers both kinds to them, and they receive them with the greateſt expreſſions of humility and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs imaginable; after all is done, they ſing a Hymn in the Church, and the Prieſt gives them leave to depart with a bleſſing.</p>
               <p>They baptize both Male and Female, the Male on the tenth day, the Female on the eighth. This Sacrament they often do rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate, but not out of neceſſity, but out of a cuſtom that hath continued many hundred years derived as ſome do conceive from the practice of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that thought the bodily waſhing able to contribute to the ſalvation of
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:50809:77"/>
the ſoul. Theſe people therefore that were zealous Profeſſors of that Religion, do yet retain many of their cuſtoms, although they do not believe thoſe things that occaſioned them at firſt for that reaſon they circumciſe, they often waſh, and to render their waſhing more beneficial, the Prieſt on the day of <hi>Epiphany</hi> repeats over to the perſons ſprinkled the words of Baptiſm, <hi>I baptize thee in the Name of the Father, &amp;c.</hi> All of them do declare that they retain this cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom not out of the belief of its neceſſity, but only becauſe it hath continued ſo long time amongſt them for ſo many hundred years, they know not how to reform it. But I think that they have no mind to reform or leave it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it flatters the intereſt of both Prieſt and people; for on that day the Princes officers do
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:50809:77"/>
make a Feaſt, and give gifts in the name of their Emperour to ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral perſons, they rejoyce and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer none to do any ſervile work. This cuſtom is ſtrengthned by a Law very ancient, that whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is then baptized ſhould be free from ſome ſmall impoſitions that are laid upon them by the Prince. Their former Kings have thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſed the people in the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to their pious commands, ſo that although they ſee how the performance is inſignificant and uſeleſs, nevertheleſs they do as Religiouſly obſerve this cuſtom, as if upon it did depend their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſalvation; when the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are baptized, they give the Bread of the Sacrament ſoftned in ſome Liquor to them.</p>
               <p>Their Religion in general is a mixture of the Jewiſh and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, for they obſerve many of
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:50809:78"/>
the Ordinances of the Law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> that were meerly ceremonial, only becauſe their fore-fathers did ſo. This people hath always had a great Veneration for that which is derived unto them by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, and in which they were firſt educated, ſo that they dare not venture to alter what was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended unto them by their Anceſtors practice, they wiſely fore-ſee the diſorders that change would bring amongſt them, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially when the cuſtoms and ceremonies obſerved are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves indifferent.</p>
               <p>If any be polluted according to the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> they forbid him to enter the Church until twenty four hours be paſt, and then he muſt cleanſe himſelf with water.</p>
               <p>For their Churches they have a great Veneration, inſomuch, that
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:50809:78"/>
in them they neither ſpit nor ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any unclean creature to enter, when they do go in, they take off their ſhooes, the reaſon that they do alledge is this, becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> was commanded to appear before the buſh with naked feet, their Temples being as holy as that place on which he did tread, they think themſelves obliged to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ſame Religious practice. They will not alſo ſuffer any to walk up and down in their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, nor to diſcourſe of their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate buſineſs, nor to laugh, ſo highly do they reverence them; our people in <hi>Italy</hi> do profeſs as much outward reſpect, but they bear leſs to the Houſes of prayer, for it is ordinary amongſt us to make the great Churches a Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvous of Lovers inſtead of praying to a Saint, many whiſper their devotions to their Miſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:50809:79"/>
that are at their ſides; and they do return anſwers accordingly; thus they cheat the world that fancies them at their prayers, and they profane the holy places with unhallowed and laſcivious actions. The <hi>Abyſsins</hi> do ſhew unto ſuch an excellent example of piety and and devotion. They are no l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſs Religious in the other obſervances of Religion; the water in Baptiſm it is true they do not ſanctifie by exorciſms, nor do they mingle any other ingredient, but as the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch of Queen <hi>Candaces</hi> was Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed by pure water, ſo do they dip or ſprinkle with the ſame element free from mixture; all that are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed, they either dip or ſprinkle them, that is left to the pleaſure and choice of the Miniſter as he ſees convenient, or as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the child requires he accordingly deals with it
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:50809:79"/>
And when the child is but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſprinkled with water, he is lookt upon as well baptized as if he had been waſhed in the main Ocean over head and ears, for they think not that the quantity of water does bring any advantage to the ſoul, nor that an entire waſhing is eſſential to the Sacrament of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, but rather ſo much only as may ſuffice to ſignifie the inward waſhing and clenſing of the mind from all filthy inclination.</p>
               <p>Their circumciſion as we have ſaid, they will not leave, but they do not eſteem themſelves for it, nor do they diſ-eſteem other Chriſtians for wanting it, for they are ſenſible that the ceremony doth not render them more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to Almighty God, nor doth it give them a pre-emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence above others. It were to be wiſhed that Chriſtians over all the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:50809:80"/>
world were of their diſpoſition, they would not then curſe and damn their brethren for trifles, nor ſend them to hell becauſe they do not jump with them into the ſame opinions, and follow the ſame frivolous cuſtoms invented by themſelves. A Chriſtian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcention becomes us, we ſhould not rack and ſend to the flames, men of the ſame profeſſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe only they do not joyn with us in indifferent performances; but my deſign is not to ſhew the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice of the Court of Inquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor the cruelty of our Prelates againſt the diſſenting perſons that are ſcattered all over <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> but to declare the practice of the <hi>Aethioplan</hi> Church, and their moderation.</p>
               <p>They have not that uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble opinion of unbaptized Infants as we have, they do not judge
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:50809:80"/>
them in hell or any other place out of Paradiſe, becauſe they have not had the happineſs to receive the Seal of the Covenant, but they name them half Chriſtians here, and think that heaven is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for them as well as for the reſt of mankind hereafter, becauſe that they are born of Chriſtian Parents, ſanctified from the womb and in the womb, by drawing ſome nouriſhment from the Sacrament of the Euchariſt when their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do receive it, the leaſt part of that being ſufficient to ſanctifie them.</p>
               <p>They often make uſe of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, not as we do, but in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that commends their mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, their wiſdom and modeſty. The perſons that are to confeſs do meet the Prieſt at certain days in the Church before prayers do begin, where they privately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:50809:81"/>
unto him in general all thoſe ſins of which they are guilty; they name them not unleſs they be heavy upon their conſciences, then they conſult him about the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies proper to ſatisfie themſelves, and about the means to avoid ſuch miſcarriages for the future. I could never learn that they were tyed to this by any other Law, but that which is derived from their own neceſſity and good; they are not tyed to particularize their crimes unleſs they ſee it conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for their comfort and refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. The Prieſt aſſiſts them in this occaſion, aſſures them of the mercy of God, of the pardon of their ſins if they continue in that repentant, ſorrow, and if it can produce the amendment of their lives. He prayes for them, and then ſends them away with a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. The woman that is near the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:50809:81"/>
time of her travel is wont to ſeek this comfort from her Ghoſtly Father. The man that is to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take ſome long or perillous jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney unloads and diſcharges his conſcience thus to render himſelf more ready to undergo the hazard. Thoſe that march out with the armies, take with them ſome word of exhortation and comfort from their Prieſts, they eſteem this cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom neceſſary to them for the maintenance of Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſtir up from time to time mens drowſie and ſottiſh ſpirits in the duties of Religion. By this means alſo the Prieſts do creep into the favour of every one, and become neceſſary in their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. We are naturally prone to contempt and ſloathfulneſs in devotion, this practice is moſt proper to remove and rid us of thoſe vices. Their confeſſions are more modeſt, more bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:50809:82"/>
and Chriſtian-like than ours are. The Prieſt doth not by any power granted unto him pretend to abſolve them, but he ſhews them the gracious promiſes of God in his word, and tells them how pleaſed he is at repentance, what hopes there are of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, he alſo warns them to forbear from ill company, and other temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations that do endanger our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate; after confeſſion they receive the Euchariſt.</p>
               <p>They acknowledge the Old and New Teſtament without any addition to them 46 of the old 35 of the new are the number of the books; unto theſe they think it not lawful to make any additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but they obſerve many other things that are not contained in theſe books.

be obſerved in thoſe Countryes; beſides, they obey the conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and degrees of their <hi>Abuna,</hi> and his Clergy, who commonly aſſemble once in two years at the Imperial Court to conſult about the publick buſineſs, and give ſuch orders as may prevent the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs that the <hi>Mahumetans</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> do daily plot againſt them; for their Prieſts and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men do labour to incroach upon the ſimplicity of the <hi>Abyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins,</hi> and to abuſe their good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by making it a means to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the Profeſſors of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; they diſguiſe themſelves into Merchants and other neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry perſons, that they might have the liberty to convey, with leſs difficultie, their venemous Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines to the ſillypeople whom they Court with all manner of civility. To prevent therefore their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns,

and to give order to all the contingencies that do happen in a large Empire very often. This great aſſembly meets in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of their Emperour to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult about the preſervation of themſelves and of Religion; the <hi>Abuna</hi> ſits in the Chair, unleſs when the Emperour appears a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them himſelf, then the <hi>Abuna</hi> ſits at his feet, and a Throne is erected a purpoſe for the <hi>Neguz,</hi> the Clergy, Biſhops and other perſons called from all the Kingdoms, are round about in a Ring in ſeveral ranks; when any is to ſpeak, he riſeth from his place and goes forth into the middle, and after an humble obeiſance to the <hi>Abuna</hi> or Emperour, he declares his judgment, the plurality of voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces determines the buſineſs in hand.</p>

                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:50809:83"/>The affirmative part do lift up their fore-finger, and profeſs at the ſame time their conſent, and if the plurality be on their ſide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove two or three perſons, their judgment is good and lawful, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe the buſineſs is debated untill that number be found in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide. Their decrees are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the Emperour and his Privy Counſel, and nothing is lawful without his conſent. He is the only Prince that governs in his dominions, none dares but by force of Arms pretend any juriſdiction over his ſubjects but himſelf, therefore he ſuffers nothing either in Church or State to be obeyed or impoſed without his cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance. The Biſhops and Clergy have a power to execute their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, teach the people their duty, and ſee to their ſeveral charges, but they dare not innovate or
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:50809:84"/>
command the leaſt new thing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be very neceſſary, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Emperors leave. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly declares his pleaſure by granting a writing, unto which his Picture is annexed as a Seal, with a great Croſs in his left hand, and a ſword in his right. This Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is conveyed into thoſe parts that it concerns, where the people do in a moſt humble manner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it. When P. <hi>Clem.</hi> ſollicited him to ſubmit to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> he would never do it, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Embaſſadour that had made that propoſition, to depart out of his dominions, where he had created a great diſturbance, by divulging Doctrines that were not known in thoſe parts before.</p>
               <p>Thus the Emperour is ſole Lord of both Spiritual and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, and will not give an account of his actions to any one upon
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:50809:84"/>
earth. He is reſpected according to his Authority or Power, none dares oppoſe or contradict his commands, but they all yield a blind obedience unto them, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing their willingneſs to ſubmit by kiſſing on their knees the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that is brought unto them.</p>
               <p>They make little conſcience in the choice of their meats, but becauſe it hath been the cuſtom of their fore-fathers to abſtain from ſome ſorts of fleſh, they do ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that they had ſome reaſon to do it which they do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, therefore they continue the ſame cuſtoms to this day, they will not eat of any Beaſt prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Moſes</hi> to the <hi>Jews,</hi> nor will they ſuffer any of them to be kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amongſt them unleſs it be in hunting. If any ſuch creature be dead, they bury him immediately; they will neither eat of fleſh torn
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:50809:85"/>
in pieces, nor that hath been hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſtifled, or of which ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beaſt hath been ſuffered to feed; they will not eat any bloud nor fleſh where the bloud remains; in theſe particulars, they are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious obſervers of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> not out of conſcience, but they know not how to leave cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms unto which they were bred up from the beginning.</p>
               <p>They have no corporal penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties impoſed upon them by their Confeſſors, unleſs it be in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents and Religious Houſes. In the Country thoſe that commit any ſin, do ſuffer for it the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of his Neighbour and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from the Euchariſt, untill he profeſſes his repentance, which commonly is done at the door of the Churches when the people and the Prieſt go out, the Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent preſents himſelf with aſhes
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:50809:85"/>
upon his Head, and a ſorrowful countenance confeſſeth his guilt, promiſeth an amendment and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the damage if any be received by the Neighbour, then the Prieſt abſolves him, by decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that for the time to come he ſhall have liberty to come to the Lords body. Thoſe that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractory and obſtinate they puniſh by forbidding their Neighbours to converſe with them. Every one obſerves this ſo Religiouſly, that they flee from an excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated perſon, as from a Peſtilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious body, ſo that he is forc'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he will become an <hi>Anachoret</hi> and run from the converſation of the world, to reconcile himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to the Church by begging the pardon of his offence. The power of Excommunication is in the Biſhop of every Dioceſe, who is informed by the Prieſts of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:50809:86"/>
Region or Precinct, of the miſdemeanors of the people; when he is rightly informed, not only by the Prieſt, but alſo by the congregation, he diſpatches an offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer called a <hi>Shimcru,</hi> to give leave to Excommunicate the offending perſon. The Prieſt in a full aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly informs the people of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, declares unto them the ill behaviour of the perſon, his wicked life, and the ſcandal that he had given to his Neighbours, he makes a long diſcourſe of the means employed to recal him of his obſtinacy, in deſpiſing the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly admonitions that had been made to him; and further ſhews the danger to let him continue in their Communion. He concludes with an Excommunication, and to render this action more dreadful, he gives leave to the infernal ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits to ſeize upon ſuch a perſon,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:50809:86"/>
caſting into the Air a fire-brand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with ſome kind of execration.</p>
               <p>☞ But this kind <note n="*" place="margin">The Tranſlator.</note> of ſeverity is not often uſed, the offences muſt be very grievous to oblige the Church to caſt upon them her thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolts, and when ſhe doth it, is done with that precaution, and with that time, that the offender hath leiſure to repent, and every one is fully ſatisfied that it neither proceeds from malice nor deſign. When men by their open profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and horrid crimes do diſgrace the Chriſtian profeſſion, when they continue in this manner of life, and declare their contempt of God and his power; It is then only time to ſeparate ſuch from our Communion, who have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſeparated themſelves from Chriſt, and declard their unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs to participate with us in
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:50809:87"/>
the privileges of Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This was the practice of the Apoſtles, and of the primitive Churches, they did ſhut them out of Heaven who declared they had no deſire to come thither, and publiſhed to the reſt the eſteem that every one was to have of their perſons. Amongſt them the power of Excommunication was ſacred and holy, it was only em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed at the extremity when no other means, neither reprehenſion nor ſhame could recal men from their abominable vices; It was then eſteemed accordingly, men were as fearful to fall under it, as to be caſt into the flames of hell. And then it was followed by ſuch effects as did declare the dreadful power of it; the evil ſpirits did take the excommunicated perſon into their poſſeſſion, and did begin to torment him in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:50809:87"/>
that he ſhall be in hell, ſo that many times people being ſenſible of their woful condition did fall upon their knees, and beg the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of the Church. It was alſo the cuſtom of old Chriſtians never to come near an Excommunicated perſon, all his acquaintance and friends did ſhun his company; ſo that when he did ſee himſelf aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd by every one, ſhame &amp; grief did work upon him and obliged him to an amendment of life. In the time of the Chriſtian Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours this power of Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation began to be horribly abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and profan'd in civil Matters, to ſatisfie hatred and vengeance, ſome Biſhops did Excommunicate others; at the leaſt diſpleaſure, they would ſend their adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to hell, and ſuffer no corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondency to be further enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained between them on earth;
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:50809:88"/>
by this means they did proclaim a publick war one againſt another, and made uſe of the ſacred wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of Excommunication to make good their quarrel, as if God were bound to eſpouſe their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular intereſts and ſins with them againſt thoſe for whom they had conceived a diſpleaſure. <hi>Victor</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> with one thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolt of the Vatican was reſolved to caſt all the Eaſtern Churches from the hopes of arriving to Heaven. The Biſhops of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> Excommunicated thoſe of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and they excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated them of <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> and in the ſame City theſe thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-bolts of Excommunication were heard againſt ſeveral facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, meer ſcar-crows when ill ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed; when Excommunication is abuſed to promote our ſecular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, it is like the <gap reason="foreign">

Let them take heed how and upon whom for the future they employ this holy weapon, for they may by the abuſe of it bring a contempt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelves and Religion, that all their policy and ſeverity will never be able to remove; I pray God to grant unto thoſe amongſt us ſuch Chriſtian wiſdom and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, that piety may be cheriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the profaneneſs diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; that peace and unity may Reign amongſt us, and that they may advance the intereſt of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity as well as of this or of that faction.</p>

               <p>Therefore it is an unworthy act to reprove forrein Chriſtians ſo fiercely and in a hoſtile manner, as I have been for this and other matters that concern not true faith. It were more wiſely done
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:50809:94"/>
to bear with ſuch Chriſtian men as the <hi>Greeks, Armenians,</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopians</hi> are, to treat them with kindneſs and charity, and to ſuffer them to live and converſe with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſtians, for we are all baptized in the ſame baptiſme, and ſubſcribe unanimouſly to the ſame belief. There is no cauſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any ſhold ſo furiouſly diſpute about ceremonies, let every one obſerve his own without hatred and railing one againſt another, for that the correſpondency between Churches ſhould not be interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, if afar off they uſe cuſtoms in thoſe Provinces proper to the place and genius of the people. Beſides, we have in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> how <hi>Peter</hi> ſaw the Heavens opened, and a certain veſſel come down like a great ſheet bending on the four corners to the earth, in the which were all
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:50809:94"/>
ſorts of four-footed Beaſts and Serpents of the earth, with the Fowls of the Air, unto him the voice did ſay, <hi>Riſe</hi> Peter <hi>and eat,</hi> unto whom <hi>Peter</hi> anſwered, <hi>Far be it from me Lord, for I never did eat any common or unclean thing.</hi> The voice anſwered him, <hi>What God hath purified do not thou call it unclean;</hi> which being often repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the veſſel was taken up into Heaven.</p>
               <p>Theſe things being done, the ſpirit ſent him to <hi>Caeſarea</hi> to <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius</hi> a pious man, and one that did fear God, unto whom as <hi>Peter</hi> did preach: <hi>The Holy Ghoſt fell upon all that heard the word of God, and</hi> Peter <hi>did baptize,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This Viſion is thus interpreted by us in <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> the clean Beaſts are the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who are thus called, becauſe they are worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:50809:95"/>
of Idols, and act the unclean works of the Devil. And whereas the voice ſaid unto <hi>Peter, Peter riſe and kill,</hi> we thus underſtand it, <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Baptize, Eat;</hi> that is, preach and publiſh the faith and the Law of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and to the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> It is certain that it can never be found, that <hi>Peter,</hi> or any other of the Apoſtles did either kill or eat unclean Beaſts after this Viſion. Now when the Scripture menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons food, in ſeveral places it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to ſignifie unto us Chriſt and his Doctrine; we muſt not therefore underſtand it of any cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral or nouriſhing food. All the learned do agree that this ſheet that was ſhewn unto <hi>Peter,</hi> did teach him high and ſublime mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and not the inferiour things of the world that relate not to our ſalvation, neither are we to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:50809:95"/>
from thence that we have liberty to eat of unclean things, ſeeing that can never be gathered out of Scripture; wherefore do the Apoſtles amongſt the Decrees of their Council command us not to eat of creatures hang'd, ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>orn in pieces, or half eaten by other beaſts, or of bloud; for God loves cleanneſs and ſobriety, and hates glutton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and uncleanneſs. God loves them alſo that abſtain from fleſh, and much more them that feed upon bread and herbs, and are content with water, as St. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> that lived a Hermite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond <hi>Jordan,</hi> he always fed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on herbs, St. <hi>Paul</hi> the Hermite led a ſparing life in the deſart 80 years, St. <hi>Anthony,</hi> and St. <hi>Maca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> and many of their followers never taſted any fleſh. Therefore my brethren you muſt not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn, nor revile us, for St. <hi>James</hi>
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:50809:96"/>
ſaith, he that ſpeaks evil of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or Judges his bother, ſpeaks evil of the Law, and Judges of the Law; and S. <hi>Paul</hi> adviſes to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with our own traditions, and not to diſ-pute about the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> with Chriſtians, wherefore it is not handſome to quarrel with our brethren about the Law, or the choice of Meats, for meats do not render us more or leſs acceptable to God; therefore let us ſeek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the heavenly food, and ſet aſide theſe frivolous diſputations about meats.</p>
               <p>Theſe things that I have here written about traditions, proceed not out of an itch of diſputation, nor out of contention, but only that I might juſtifie my own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from the cruel accuſations of many who having no reſpect for my Maſter the moſt Potent Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Precious Giam,</hi>

from their ſlanders that accuſe us, and that I might oblige the Doctors of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be the more kind to us.

moſt Mighty Emperour hath-all the books of the General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel's, and is much grieved, ſo are all his ſubjects; for the diſcords and errours, theſe Tares that the Devil hath ſown in the Lords field; the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> we have always <hi>eſt comedus,</hi> the firſt and moſt powerful Biſhop of the world, and were it not for the <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> whoſe Country be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between us, do hinder our paſſage, &amp; for the great diſtance of places, we ſhould ſend to his Court very often. King <hi>Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel</hi> of bleſſed Memory did firſt open a way to us from the Red ſea, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having ſpoken of theſe things, I will ſay ſomething of our Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, &amp; of our Patriarch. You muſt know firſt, that our Patriarch is thus ſolemnly elected by and out of our Monks of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> that
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:50809:98"/>
there do dwell at the Sepulchre of our Lord. When the old Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch is dead, the Emperour di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatches away with all ſpeed an expreſs to the Monks that live at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as ſoon as they have received the news of the death of the <hi>Abuna</hi> with the Preſents that the Emperour ſends to our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours Sepulchre, they proceed to the election of another <hi>Abuna,</hi> whom they chuſe by the plurality of voices. It is not lawful to pitch upon another for that office, but only upon an Inhabitant of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi> and upon one whoſe life is irreproachable. When they have choſen him, they give unto him his diſpatches with the meſſenger that came to give them notice of the former <hi>Abuna</hi>'s death. They go together to Grand <hi>Cairo,</hi> to meet the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Patriarch that hath there his ordinary reſidence,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:50809:99"/>
to the end that he may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the election. The Patriarch when he approves of the ſufficiency of the perſon for ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent an office; he ſends him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Ethiopia</hi> with the meſſenger, who muſt always be according to the ancient cuſtom, a Monk of the Order of St. <hi>Anthony</hi> the Hermite, with him this meſſenger haſten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> towards <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> wherewith all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of joy and honour they are received of all men. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a year or two paſſes before this buſineſs can be diſpatched. In the mean while the <hi>Neguz</hi> diſpoſes of the great Revenue of the <hi>Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> according to his pleaſure. Now the chief office of an <hi>Abuna,</hi> is to confer Holy Orders, none but he can give them, or ought to take them away, or degrade the Prieſts. He never affects to meddle with the giving of Biſhopricks, or of
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:50809:99"/>
Benefices that do belong to the <hi>Precious <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>iam,</hi> who may do with them according to his pleaſure. And when the Patriarch or <hi>Abuna</hi> is dead the Emperour is the Heir of his Eſtate, which is very great. It belongs alſo to the Patriarch to excommunicate contumacious of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders. He never grants any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgencies of thoſe penalties that are impoſed for grievous faults. The Sacraments of the Church are never prohibited to any unleſs it be for the crime of Murder. Our Patriarch is called in our lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage <hi>Abuna,</hi> he that is at preſent in this place is called at his baptiſm <hi>Mark;</hi> a man aged of about 100 years. Moreover it is to be noted that we begin the year the firſt of <hi>September,</hi> which is with us the Eve of St. <hi>John Baptists</hi> day, the reſt of the Feaſt days we keep at the ſame time that they are kept
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:50809:100"/>
by the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> We muſt not omit that St. <hi>Philip</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle came into our Country, and did there preach the Goſpel of our Saviour Chriſt.</p>
               <p>You muſt further know the name of our Emperour, that it is <hi>Precious John</hi> or <hi>

When the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were overthrown, the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> had wonderful ſucceſs againſt them, they ſubdued all the Country as far as <hi>Thebis</hi> border<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Red Sea, but about thirty years afterwards there roſe a King of <hi>Egypt</hi> that was valiant in war that recovered with his ſmall numbers of men, all the domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons belonging to his Predeceſſors, as far as the Mountains where the River <hi>Nilus</hi> hath a terrible down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall. In his race it continued until the time of <hi>Cambyſes</hi> who enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Egypt,</hi> and conquered it, but could never ſubdue <hi>Ethiopia;</hi> for when he ſent his Embaſſadours to our Emperor, they were ſent back with a defiance of his Power, as he was paſſing over ſome of the

The wind did fight for us againſt our enemies, it ſaved us the trouble and hazard of venturing againſt them with our ſwords.</p>
               <p>In the time of King <hi>Solomon,</hi> our Empire was governed by Queen <hi>Maqueda,</hi> ſhe ſent Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors to him, and afterwards went to viſit him her ſelf, ſhe was kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entertained at her return, ſhe was brought to bed of a Son which ſhe had by <hi>Solomon,</hi> called <hi>Melich,</hi> ſhe brought Circumciſion into the Land, and laid the foundations of
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:50809:110"/>
the Jewiſh Religion, which her Son afterwards when he was come from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> did eſtabliſh, commanding all people under his command to receive it. After him many Kings did Reign in <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> the moſt famous was <hi>Ubſharem, Habraini, David</hi> the 1 <hi>Solomon,</hi> the 1 and many others. The Scepter hath always continued in the ſame race ſince that time until now. <hi>Ubſharem</hi> was a warlike Prince, he conquered all the Provinces as far as the Sea-coaſt South-wards, and made all the Kings his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to ſend Preſents to him, but when he was forty years old he grew amorous and wanton, ſo that his new conquered ſubjects took advantage of him in a Battel, where he loſt all that he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered with his life, his ſucceſſour laboured to revenge this affront, but in vain, until the days of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>

the firſt, none ever did recover the vaſt dominions that did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly own the <hi>Ethiop.</hi> Scepter. This Prince was wiſe and very politick, ſufficiently qualified to fit at the Helm of State, but he was no Warrior for want of Courage; to manage the affairs in deſperate occaſions, he appointed a General, <hi>Zecharia,</hi> a ſtout man that did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Office of his Prince in this particular. He was very ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful againſt all our Neighbours, eſpecially againſt the Blacks that inhabit beyond the ſands, their Princes came to do homage unto our mighty Emperour, and to pay their yearly tribute; they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in their obedience many years, until the Reign of <hi>Joſeph</hi> the third, a Prince that was given to all manner of debauchery, he Reigned ten years, and was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards killed by his chief Officers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="223" facs="tcp:50809:111"/>
who were willing to preſerve the State from total ruine; which would have happened had he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued longer upon the Throne, for he did not only permit, but alſo invite the enemies of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire to enter into his dominions, that they might revenge him of thoſe Princes that he did not love, and that he did not dare to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh himſelf, therefore he made uſe of the ſtrangers weapons to vex them that he could not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe overcome. From that time we have nothing remarkable, until Chriſts death at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> for all the Princes that did rule until that time were neither good nor bad, they contented themſelves with their own limits, and if they did loſe any part of their poſſeſſions, they never made any great noiſe by raiſing their Armies to retake them. Queen <hi>Candace</hi> was a moſt

pious and Religious Woman, her Eunuch of the Race of Black a-Moors did follow her ſteps, he made his Pilgrimage to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> every five years from that place, he brought the Chriſtian faith that did daily increaſe, inſomuch that not one was found oppoſing it within two hundred years after. The eldeſt Son of <hi>Candace,</hi> for whom ſhe did govern was <hi>Shedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ahr,</hi> a moſtvertuous man, he encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged Chriſtian Religion in his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, but would never ſuffer the old ceremonies to be aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſo that ſince, the Jewiſh and Chriſtian are mingled together; he pull'd down many Idol Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples upon the borders, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the revolt of ſome of his moſt ſuperſtitious ſubjects, but one bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel brought them under his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand again. His Son was <hi>Adreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chek,</hi> he ſucceeded his father
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:50809:112"/>
when he was but ſixteen years of Age. A certain Heathen Prieſt had crept into his favour ſo much, that for his ſake he did labour to oppoſe the ſucceſs of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an and the continuance of the Jewiſh Religion in <hi>Ethiopia.</hi> His Princes could not ſuffer him long, they conſpired againſt him, and placed his young brother in his place, but him they ſent into the Kingdom of <hi>Damut,</hi> into a cloſe Priſon that hath always been in thoſe parts; he did afterwards e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape out of it and fled to the Blacks, who did come againſt <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopia</hi> with a ſtrong Army, but they were vanquiſhed and forced to ſuffer their Fugitive Prince to become a Priſoner again. The el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Son of this King was an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed Prince, ſo that his Uncle had ſome jealouſie of him, &amp; therfore clapt him in a cloſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

with his Father, but when he was dead, the Grandees fetcht him out of his confinement, and raiſed him to the Throne during the life of his Father, who conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the promotion of his Son. After him <hi>Abſalom</hi> was a famous Prince, renowned for his careful proviſion againſt the enemies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions, for he cauſed certain Forts to be built in convenient places to bridle them in. They were afterwards neglected and ruinated by the Wars. He firſt began to encourage Shipping, by offering great advantages to the Mariners and men that did ſtudy the Art of Navigation. This good policy cauſed all the idle perſons to render themſelves ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent in the Sea affairs, and laid the Foundation to that greatneſs, unto which the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> Empire did afterwards riſe.</p>

                  <hi>Benjamin</hi> Reigned forty years, about the year 600 after Chriſt, from his time we have a good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of all our Kings, but before none are named but thoſe that have been excellent for ſome ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, or infamous by their notable vices. This Prince was full of piety, he reformed the diſorders of the Clergy, and put them in that form of Government in which they are at preſent; before, the perſons that did wait upon the Worſhip of God, had no ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led allowance; the people gave them what they pleaſed, ſo that unleſs they did work as other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for their livings, they were reduced to great neceſſities, which nevertheleſs did happen in many places, for he that depends upon his peoples kindneſs, ſhall be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entertain'd with courſe Diet; unto this great evil that entroduces

many others in a Nation; this Religious Prince did bring a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy. As he was the ſole Lord of all the Lands of his Empire, and that none enjoyed them but from him, he cauſed ſuch a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of ground to be ſet apart for the maintenance of the Prieſts and Biſhops, as might entertain them with the yearly Revenue, and cauſed this Land to be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the reſt, by granting unto it the priviledge of immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity from all ſaxes and Impoſts, ſo that they depend no longer up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Crown. This liberality redeemed the Clergy from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and raiſed them in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem of the people, that uſually treats them, not according to their deſert, but according to that State that they maintain.</p>
               <p>After the good Prince, his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Son <hi>Hechakiah</hi> did Reign,

               <p>His Brother <hi>Abraham</hi> the firſt, ſucceeded, he held the Scepter ten years, and then left it to his Son, with all the Wealth his Brother had gotten.</p>
               <p>His Sons name was <hi>Haroahki,</hi> a Warlike Prince, he began to leave the Cities, and to paſs his time in Tents, for in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his Reign all the Nations ſubject to the <hi>Neguz,</hi> began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt from him, he could not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe the tumult ſo ſoon; he was therefore forced to live in the Camp, and to be in continual action all the time of his Reign.

                  <hi>Ethiopian</hi> Emperour ſhould never ſpend above ſix days in a Walled Town at a time, but ſhould live in the open Field. All the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that doth follow the Princes cuſtom, imitates him in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. They look upon it as a great expreſſion of weakneſs and fear to run into a fortified place. This hath cauſed them to neglect ſuch places, and ſuffer them to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantled by time, ſo that at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in all the Empire there are but few Walled Towns, and they are ſo pitiful that the weakeſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy might ſtorm them.

<pb n="232" facs="tcp:50809:116"/>
numerous Army he Landed in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabia,</hi> and conquered all that part of the Country that lies upon the Sea-ſhoar. The <hi>Abyſsins</hi> found their abode in <hi>Aſia</hi> far more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant than in <hi>Africa,</hi> therefore great numbers of men went over and paſſed the Seas into the new conqueſts. The <hi>Perſians</hi> and <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians</hi> did oppoſe their deſigns, but our Emperour being there in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, did ſo order his buſineſs that all the Forces that were ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us were routed, many bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels were fought between us with various ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>The laſt was near the place where the River <hi>Euphrates</hi> diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges it ſelf into the Sea, ſeven Kings were met upon the place with all the men that they could conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently bring to withſtand our Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour. The enemies reckoned about two hundred thouſand men
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:50809:116"/>
in their Army; we had then about forty thouſand, this unequal num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber did encounter them, and by the wonderful goodneſs of God they did overcome them. This Victory opened a way to our ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in <hi>Aſia,</hi> for it rendred the name of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> moſt terrible, ſo that none did dare to meet us with equal numbers of men, every year our people ſent great numbers of men with their Families, to inhabit in <hi>Aſia,</hi> and by that means to ſecure their intereſt from the ancient Inhabitants by force of Arms. The next that ſucceeded in the Empire was <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> I. A man no leſs Valarous than his Father, a great lover of Learning and of the Learned men, he enlarged his dominions beyond the River <hi>Indus,</hi> and conquered all that part of the Country that is ſo fruitful, that the <hi>Aſiatiques</hi> eſteem it the beſt and moſt fruitful

In one the King of <hi>Malabar</hi> came againſt him with 40000 Foot and Horſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The <hi>Ethiopians</hi> were full of valoue and courage, but the numbers of their enemies put them to great ſtraits, ſo that they offered to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der themſelves into their hands in caſe they would ſuffer them qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly to depart with their lives ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. The enemy would not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of that offer, to his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment, for ours being refuſed the condition propoſed, and ſeeing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but death, or at leaſt but bondage and miſery prepared for them and their Prince, they tool courage, encounter'd the enemy with a great reſolution broke the firſt ranks of them, and then pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued them with that fury, that

they left not killing until the whole multitude with their King at their head fled away, leaving all their own ſpoils, and the Goods that they had taken in the former advantages they had had againſt our Emperour.

The Tartars about that time made ſome In-roads into <hi>China,</hi> and finding the Climate good, and the Country fruitful, they invited their Countrymen into thoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions. Some few years after they had gathered a numerous Army to enter <hi>China,</hi> they conquer'd the Emperour of that Country,

who had deſired our aſſiſtance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, we complyed with their deſires, our Emperour ſent 30000 men to their aſſiſtance, but by the ſtratagems and valour of the Tartars, our men were almoſt all ſlain. The <hi>Chinenſes</hi> being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of that ſuccour, yielded themſelves to the mercy of the Conquerours, who thought upon nothing but how to revenge themſelves upon us; they came therefore with their own forces, &amp; with thoſe that they had gathered in the Country, and drive out our people out of <hi>China,</hi> giving no quarter to thoſe that ſubmitted to them. There aroſe ſome diſpute between ſome of our Generals at that time, that aſſiſted the Tartars againſt us, ſo that when <hi>Uncan</hi> was kill'd in a battel by <hi>Cingi</hi> the Tartar Prince, all our Countrymen left <hi>Aſia,</hi> with all
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:50809:118"/>
hopes of returning thither again. Since, we have had many grievous encounters with our enemies the <hi>Mahumetans</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who have ſometimes perſecuted us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the heart of the Country when they took us at an advantage. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the year 1434 the King of <hi>Adel</hi> with many of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours ſtormed our Sea-port Towns when our Emperour was but young, and ſo ſhut us in, that we have no place to entertain Commerce with any Nation without their leave.</p>
