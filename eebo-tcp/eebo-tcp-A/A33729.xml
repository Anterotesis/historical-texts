         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

REPLY
TO THE
ANSWER of the MAN of
No Name, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>IT it the Caſe of <hi>Truth</hi> to be oppoſed, but
to <hi>prevail;</hi> and of <hi>Error,</hi> though de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,
to be <hi>vanquiſh'd.</hi> Ill Cauſes can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but be Ill maintained: They may look
like <hi>true,</hi> but that is <hi>Art,</hi> which cannot change
Nature. An Aſs can never be a <hi>Doctor,</hi> nor a
Fool a <hi>Solomon:</hi> Bulk given no <hi>Weight,</hi> nor
Sound, <hi>good Senſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to ſay true, it was never much better
prov'd, than in the <hi>Anſwer</hi> of the Duke of <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham</hi>'s
Paper: At firſt it amaz'd me with a
<hi>flaſh</hi> of Words; the ſecond Reading I came to
<hi>my ſelf;</hi> and at the <hi>laſt,</hi> I ſaw, they came to <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:98577:3"/>
began with <hi>falſe Wit,</hi> and ended with
<hi>Noiſe</hi> and <hi>Fumble.</hi> And to ſhew you a little the
Man in his <hi>Talents, Stile, Arguments,</hi> and <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,</hi>
(for his own Book does it beſt at large)
take what follows.</p>
            <p>I will begin with his beginning.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That I have Written this Pamphlet</hi> (ſays he) <hi>is
plain.</hi> But who this (I) is that Writ it, is not
<hi>plain;</hi> for he has not told us his Name. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
'tis plain, 'tis <hi>writ;</hi> and ſo it is, that his
<hi>Apology</hi> is againſt himſelf; which is, <hi>That a
Sore always wants a Plaiſter.</hi> In which we muſt
either underſtand, He confeſſes the <hi>Wound</hi> the
<hi>Duke</hi> has given <hi>Atheiſm</hi> and <hi>Violence,</hi> to which
he Conſecrates a <hi>Plaſter;</hi> or that his <hi>Book</hi> is in
it ſelf a <hi>Sore,</hi> and he has a mind to <hi>cover</hi> it. If
the Firſt, he has an <hi>Ill time</hi> of it: if the Laſt,
'tis <hi>Non-ſenſe.</hi> But this is but a part of his <hi>Excuſe;</hi>
he thinks he may Anſwer him, becauſe the <hi>Duke</hi>
won't Anſwer himſelf, and act both <hi>Plaintiff</hi> and
<hi>Defendant;</hi> as they do, that <hi>turn</hi> with the times;
<hi>ſhift</hi> Principles for Livings; and love to be <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of Bray</hi> ſtill. But whatever that <hi>Noble Duke</hi>
does, the <hi>Anſwerer</hi> has that faculty; for he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighs
againſt <hi>Reaſon, pag.</hi> 12, 13. and yet
<hi>p.</hi> 36. ſends his Reader in a <hi>warm Fit</hi> to <hi>Reaſon,</hi>
not only to <hi>Chuſe</hi> and <hi>Eſtabliſh</hi> to himſelf a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
but to <hi>Convince</hi> others by.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:98577:3"/>
And now he falls on with a Tantivy—<hi>How
Pernicious an Animal</hi> (ſays he) <hi>this Mountain
and wild Conſcience hath been to</hi> England, <hi>is too
well known, and how Fatal Toleration would be.</hi>
What ſtuff is here! Could a Man fetch any
thing more <hi>ſavage</hi> out of the <hi>Highlands</hi> of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
or from the <hi>Lakes</hi> of <hi>Canada?</hi> One would
think, 'twere Writing in <hi>ſhamm,</hi> and a Definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in <hi>Burleſque:</hi> Some <hi>Cypher,</hi> but that there is
<hi>no Key</hi> to it; for that a <hi>Mountain</hi> ſhould be an
<hi>Animal,</hi> and <hi>Conſcience a Mountain,</hi> has neither
Matter, Figure, Rhetorick, nor common Senſe
in it. Which, indeed, is the <hi>pitiful end</hi> of all
<hi>Quacks</hi> and <hi>Pretenders.</hi> And hence he turns
<hi>Vintner</hi> too: for in a moment he reads you a
Lecture of <hi>Ferments</hi> and <hi>Lees,</hi> and the beſt way
of turning the <hi>Wine</hi> of (Mount) <hi>Hope</hi> into the
<hi>Vinegar</hi> (of the Valley) of <hi>Deſpair.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Gentleman, that he might <hi>Run</hi> far e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
from the Duke's <hi>Lenity,</hi> has <hi>paſs'd the
Line,</hi> and talks <hi>Antipode</hi> to common Experience.
For with him Toleration <hi>pricks;</hi> Perſecution
does not. I had thought that <hi>ſweet</hi> and <hi>ſoft</hi>
things had prevented <hi>ſouring;</hi> and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>eager</hi> and <hi>lean</hi> Wines were fed with the
<hi>richeſt Malagoes.</hi> But the meaning of this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
<hi>ſimile,</hi> is, The Gentlemen of his <hi>Clan</hi>
would keep the <hi>Wine</hi> to themſelves: every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98577:4"/>
knows <hi>they love it.</hi> But I muſt needs ſay,
'tis a <hi>Churliſh</hi> and <hi>Guzling</hi> trick, to <hi>drink all:</hi>
Right Good-fellows are freer of their Liquor.
And beſides, it ſhews a mighty Ill Nature, that
other Folks <hi>drinking</hi> ſhould make it taſte <hi>ſowre</hi>
with them: 'Tis not the <hi>Liquor,</hi> but the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late:</hi>
The Gall <hi>overflows;</hi> the Humor vitiates
the <hi>Taſt. Calvin</hi>'s <hi>Predeſtination,</hi> in his Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>p.</hi> 16. is not worſe natured than <hi>This.</hi>
Thunder ſometimes <hi>turns</hi> Liquor; but I never
heard it of <hi>fair</hi> and <hi>gentle weather:</hi> Certainly,
it muſt be an <hi>unnatural</hi> Subject, upon which the
moſt <hi>natural</hi> Things have an ill <hi>operation.</hi> And
yet in ſome <hi>Ill temper'd Children</hi> we have ſeen
the <hi>ſeeds</hi> of this <hi>ſowre</hi> Humor; who would not
<hi>Eat</hi> or <hi>Wear</hi> a thing, if others muſt have it as
well as themſelves. However, this Doctrine
very naturally ariſes from the Text, <hi>That ſome
Men, if they may have their humor, will be as
ſweet as Wine; and if not, will Turn as ſowre as
Vinegar.</hi> The Uſe and Application I leave to
<hi>His Majeſty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this is not all; he explains himſelf upon
this point <hi>pag.</hi> 33. where he <hi>dreads the Church
of</hi> England's <hi>Receeding from her Active Loyalty
in oppoſing Diffenters, and the Terrible and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable
conſequences of their betaking themſelves
to a Paſſive Loyalty.</hi> I hope he has made more
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98577:4"/>
bold than welcome with that Venerable Name;
ſince 'tis to ſay, The Church of <hi>England</hi>'s Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty
is to ſerve their own Turn, and the Prince's
no longer than he will <hi>Ruin others</hi> to <hi>humor</hi>
Her. That ſhe <hi>oppoſes Diſſenters</hi> for that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon:
And is uncharitable to all others: That
though ſhe Aſſerts <hi>Free-Will,</hi> ſhe will <hi>Force</hi> other
Mens. That ſhe is not content with her <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours,
Imployments</hi> and <hi>Profits,</hi> unleſs others are
<hi>Reprobated</hi> to a Civil Damnation: That ſhe
knows not where to <hi>ſtop,</hi> nor where to End her
Reſentments and Severities: That <hi>Law</hi> only
maintains her, and her Eſtabliſhment takes riſe
from <hi>humane</hi> Inſtitution, and by <hi>humane</hi> Force
is upheld: Nay, That if ſhe may not have her
Will, let the <hi>Black Box</hi> prevail, and the <hi>Oxford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>
come in if they will, <hi>Fight Dog, fight Bear,
We will be Quiet; We will be Paſſive.</hi> Theſe
are the Conſequences of ſuch Reſolves: Things
too harſh and Idle to imagine of a Society of ſo
much Wiſdom and Integrity; and therefore
this Gentleman to be thought <hi>officious,</hi> if not
<hi>ſcandalous</hi> in this attempt. And I hope her
beſt Members will think, That more Reaſon to
the Duke, and Diſcretion to the Church, had
done better: for <hi>Scandalum Cleri</hi> with the one,
ought to ſit as uneaſie, as <hi>Scandalum Magnatum</hi>
with the other.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:98577:5"/>
I have done a little to ſnew his <hi>folly</hi> and
<hi>uncharitableneſs;</hi> more follows: and he that
ruus may almoſt read it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He <hi>wonders, his Grace
the Duke of</hi> Buckingham <hi>ſhould become a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion
for Whiggiſm,</hi> p. 1. And indeed ſo do I too:
for I am ſure, it muſt be very lately; and 'tis
an ill time to begin in. But is this his Diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
(<hi>pag.</hi> 2.) that was to defend him from a
<hi>Scandalum Magnatum?</hi> But why a Whig? It ſeems
it is, becauſe he is for <hi>Toleration.</hi> A fine Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion:
and yet he makes this, but <hi>half a Whig</hi>
neither. For he tells us in his Character, That
<hi>Perſecution</hi> makes up t'other <hi>half:</hi> ſo that a
Right <hi>Whig</hi> is, a <hi>Tolerating Perſecuter.</hi> Upon
the whole matter then, the Duke is but <hi>half a
Whig;</hi> and his Anſwerer it <hi>t'other half,</hi> who
tells us, That his <hi>opinions have ever been Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trically
oppoſite to thoſe of his Grace's Paper; and
whoſe Book it ſelf is Perſecution.</hi> And is it not
a pretty thing to conſider that the <hi>Bill</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,</hi>
the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> and <hi>Defendant</hi> (as he calls
them) ſhould make up <hi>one Whig?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to do it, when <hi>Whiggiſm</hi> is <hi>ſuper-annitated,</hi>
and looks like a <hi>caſt Miſtris, and is contemn'd of
all,</hi> heightens the Man's Admiration: And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
he knew the <hi>Duke,</hi> when he did not uſe
to make ſuch <hi>ſtale choices</hi> too. But to make
him amends, the Man places it to his <hi>Compaſſion,</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:98577:5"/>
which is yet <hi>Satyr</hi> enough upon himſelf, that
not only has none, but makes it <hi>Whiggiſh</hi> in
that Noble Perſon to Pity, Age and Neceſſity.
<hi>Mad</hi> he muſt be, or he would not yield away
ſo great a Vertue to ſo ill a thing. But is ſhe
<hi>ſuper-annuated</hi> and <hi>caſt?</hi> pray, why then <hi>feared</hi>
in one part, and <hi>loved</hi> ſo fondly in another, by
this <hi>Knight</hi> of the <hi>Robe?</hi> She is but half Caſt;
the <hi>Toleration ſide</hi> is only <hi>ſuper-annuated</hi> with
him; t'other is not above <hi>Eighteen</hi> yet, freſh,
ſtrong, and ruddy, in his Deſires at leaſt:
And that ſhe may live longer a-that ſide, he is
<hi>blowing Breath</hi> through his Quill, as faſt as he
can.</p>
            <p>And to ſay true, he has <hi>Air</hi> enough, to help
her: But when all is done, he will make an <hi>Ill
Miſtreſs</hi> of her; for ſhe is to be <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>Caſt</hi> (if
not <hi>Dead</hi>) a <hi>one ſide</hi> ſtill: This is <hi>her Palſie,</hi> and
<hi>his Phrenſie.</hi> I am of Opinion, when he thinks
what he has done, he will (like his <hi>young Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant,
Pag.</hi> 6.) cry, <hi>a Pox upon Conſequences, I
hate Conſequences.</hi> So Pragmatical ſo Incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and ſo Indiſcreet has the Gentleman been
in his haſty Attaque.</p>
            <p>But to come to the <hi>body</hi> of his pretended An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.
After telling us, <hi>p. 6. He will not Anatomize,
nor Diſſect each Nerve and Muſcle of His</hi> Grace
<hi>'s Paper,</hi> (though elſe where it has neither, in his
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98577:6"/>
Opinion) and that <hi>he hates Haſhing of Books, and
ſerving them up with Limon and Anchovies,</hi> turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Chryrurgeon</hi> and <hi>Cook</hi> in a breath: he ſays, He
<hi>will deliver his thoughts in a lump;</hi> as if he had
a mind to a <hi>Pudding</hi> more than a <hi>Haſh.</hi> The
Truth is, he has little Shape, and leſs Life: and
therefore the Gentleman has in one word, <hi>Whig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,
turn'd Goſſip</hi> to his own <hi>Chits</hi> with more
propriety, than is in all his Book beſide.</p>
            <p>But let's look upon his <hi>Lump</hi> a little further.
Firſt, he ſays, <hi>His Grace has taken an Improper
way to confute the wity Atheiſt, or Eſtabliſh Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi>
(And why ſo?) <hi>Becauſe the changeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the World does not diſprove</hi> its Eternity,
<hi>any more than the Mutations of his Grace's Body
alters him from being that</hi> George <hi>D. of</hi> Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham,
<hi>that he was Forty Years ago.</hi> But the
D. of <hi>Buckingham</hi> does not pretend to be <hi>the
ſame Man</hi> that he was Forty Years ago; and
would give this Gentleman, Ten thouſand pound
to make him ſo. And to ſay true, he that ſays,
A changing World is Eternal, is not many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves
from that which we call a <hi>Changling.</hi> For
though a Man be <hi>the ſame,</hi> as to his Faculties
and Properties: Yet we have freſh Spirits and
Fleſh; and this World has its Alterations and
Renewings too.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:98577:6"/>
What the <hi>firſt Matter</hi> was, and <hi>how</hi> formed,
and which way it ſubſiſts, are much beyond us!
yet the more we look into them, the more we
are led from the Regular Motions and Seaſons
of the Fabrick we ſee with the diſtinct <hi>kinds</hi> and
<hi>ſpecies</hi> of Creatures therein, to Conclude and
Admire a <hi>Prior</hi> and <hi>Superior Being.</hi> A Man that
is a Creature of time, may be ſaid <hi>to be,</hi> and in
ſome caſes <hi>not to be the ſame:</hi> for he is not <hi>the
ſame</hi> in <hi>the ſame</hi> Being always; but an <hi>Eternal</hi>
thing cannot be ſo <hi>varied.</hi> And 'tis fallacious
to argue from a Man's being <hi>the ſame Man,</hi>
under changes, to the World's being Eternally
the <hi>ſame</hi> World under Changes; ſince it were
to ſay, That a thing were the ſame in that in
which It changes: for that were to be in that
which is not, or is not any more that which it
was; The ſupeameſt Non-ſence a Man can be
guilty of.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Duke</hi> was not ſtrict in this matter; and
his <hi>Anſwer</hi> is ſtricter with him, than wiſe;
eſpecially when he faults him in a thing Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
and yet promiſes not to diſturb, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
his Arguments for a God. But ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
is the Genius of this <hi>Gentleman,</hi> that he
frequently breaks his Word, though be breaks
his Head with it. There are but three of four
things the <hi>Duke</hi> goes upon; That <hi>the World did
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98577:7"/>
not make it ſelf:</hi> That <hi>he that made it is God:</hi>
That <hi>he was dignified Man with ſomething more
Excellent, than what belongs to other Creatures:</hi>
That <hi>this makes him look and hope beyond Death;
therefore Immortality, probable:</hi> That <hi>thoſe that do
well, ſhall be Happy; the contrary, Miſerable:</hi>
That <hi>to this Choice they are free and uncompell'd.
And</hi> laſtly, <hi>That none ſhould Extinguiſh Men's
Religious Impreſſions, by forcing them againſt their
Perſwaſion.</hi> Theſe Sober and Worthy Thoughts
might have been better treated.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>'Tis true</hi> (he ſays, <hi>pag. 7.) his Notions are
very fine, and many of them very natural and
true; but not too Logical.</hi> No matter for that;
he Writ like a Gentleman, and not a Pedant.
But to ſee, how true this perſon is to himſelf,
within ſix lines after the Character of many <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi>
and <hi>true</hi> Notions; he tells us, without
bluſhing, though not without confuſion, That
<hi>the Conſequences which neceſſarily follow the
Duke's Conceptions, are greatly to the diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
not only of Religion, but of the politick Frame
and Government of the World.</hi> I cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
which way; and he has carefully avoided
to inform me. But I cannot ſee, how the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the <hi>Great Turk,</hi> and the <hi>Great
Mogul</hi> are concern'd in the Duke of <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s
Book? They may indeed, if they could
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:98577:7"/>
read it, becauſe he Recommends to all Men
the Chriſtian Religion, (<hi>pag.</hi> 18.) And, if I
know any thing, the <hi>Conſequence</hi> of his Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory
Aſſertion, is, That the <hi>Mogul</hi> muſt be
<hi>Infidel</hi> ſtill, and the <hi>Great Turk</hi> muſt be a <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometan</hi>
ſtill. For this good Chriſtian goes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this Principle, That the Religion Eſtabliſh'd
by Law, ought therefore to be Conformed to
of all; and conſequently, Liberty even to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian's
Conſciences is dangerous to the Political
Frame of that Government that is not Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He proceeds to oppoſe the Duke's</hi> Deduction,
<hi>in Reference to the Worſhip of God,</hi> pag. 11,
&amp; 12. For in truth (<hi>ſays he</hi>) if his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation
be allowed, here is as fair a plea for the
ALCORAN, as the NEW TESTAMENT; for
PYTHAGORAS's GOLDEN VERSES, as <hi>St.</hi>
PAVL's EPISTLES. For, if I be not miſtaken,
in what his Grace calls that Part of us, which is
neareſt a-kin to the Nature of God, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
of a Deity, this muſt be humane Reaſon;
not as Regulated by any Publick and Politick Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of a Community, but as every private perſon's
Reaſon ſhall dictate.</p>
            <p>But how unjuſt and precarious is all this?
Firſt, Aſſert; and then, <hi>If he miſtakes not, the Duke
meant ſo.</hi> But if the Duke meant not ſo, then
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98577:8"/>
he is <hi>miſtaken:</hi> and the Duke could not mean,
as he ſtates his underſtanding of it. For though
he takes leave to miſtake the Duke, the Duke
does not miſtake himſelf: There is not one
Word of <hi>Humane Reaſon</hi> in the Queſtion,
nor is Humane Reaſon that <hi>Inſtinct</hi> of the
Deity.</p>
            <p>We have a Natural Capacity to apprehend
Divine things; but 'tis that <hi>Inſtinct,</hi> which
gives us the Religious uſe of it. All Men that
have Eyes, have the Capacity of <hi>ſeeing;</hi> but
without <hi>light</hi> they cannot <hi>ſee.</hi> Pray, who was
he that ſaid; <hi>There is a Spirit in Man, but the
Inſpiration of the Almighty gives <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding?</hi>
and that, <hi>Whatſoever may be known of God, is
manifeſted in Man?</hi> Rom. 1. By what elſe is
it, that the Prophet declares, That God <hi>tells unto
Man his thoughts?</hi> And St. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſly ſays,
That <hi>thoſe that had not the Law, became a Law
unto themſelves,</hi> (By what? if not by this <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct,</hi>
this Syntereſis?) <hi>their Conſcience accuſing
or exeuſing them</hi> before God. And St. <hi>John</hi>
goes farther, who ſays; <hi>If our Hearts condemn
us, God is greater; but if our Hearts condemn us
not, then have we boldneſs before God.</hi> And does
this make as much for the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> as for the
<hi>Scripture?</hi> and <hi>Pythagoras's</hi> Writings, as St.
<hi>Pauls's Epiſtles?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:98577:8"/>
The Duke ſpoke to a peculiar Rank of Men:
<hi>Wits</hi> without much Religion, to give Religion
the beginnings of <hi>Credit</hi> with them: He did not
ſay, That was enough? That Scripture or other
external helps were uſeleſs, or not requiſite: And
yet, when all is done, we muſt chuſe for our
ſelves, and not by the <hi>Political Reaſon</hi> of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity;</hi>
or elſe we ſhall believe upon <hi>Authority</hi>
and not upon <hi>Conviction;</hi> which was not the
Chriſtian way. St. <hi>Paul</hi> bids us, <hi>Pray with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding;</hi>
and if ſo, ſurly, our underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ought to be ſatisfied, to whom, and how
to pray. And this Gentleman makes it an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
<hi>not to pray knowingly;</hi> and if ſo, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
we ſhould have ſome <hi>Reaſon</hi> for our Hope
too.</p>
            <p>And therefore, I cannot perſwade my ſelf to
believe, that <hi>Noble Peer</hi> writ like a <hi>Minor,</hi> when
he proceds to this Deduction? <q>That it is one
of the greateſt Crimes a Man can be guilty
of, <hi>to Force us</hi> to act againſt that <hi>Inſtinct</hi> of
Religion; and ſomething a kin to the Sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Holy Ghoſt.</q> This Notion the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
throws with ſcorn at the <hi>Quakers,</hi> (an
Honeſt and well-meaning People;) and if this
be <hi>a Kin</hi> to their Doctrine, they are ſounder
than he that deſpiſes them. And to ſay true,
He does them greater Honour, than it may be,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98577:9"/>
he is aware of. But why not believe upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction?
For, <hi>Whatever is not of Faith,</hi> (St.
<hi>Paul</hi> tells us) <hi>is Sin:</hi> And <hi>Force</hi> upon any Man's
Conſcience, muſt overthrow the Reaſon of this
<hi>Fear, Faith</hi> and <hi>Hope.</hi> For how dark and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
any Man's Conſcience is, <hi>Force</hi> brings no
Light no Knowledge: It may diſtract, doubt,
and ſo damn.</p>
            <p>But I cannot enough admire at the <hi>Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
this Gentleman draws from this moſt Inof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive
and Orthodox Expreſſion. The <hi>Firſt</hi> is
this: That <hi>Reaſon is the Guide of every Man's
Religion.</hi> This is ſpurious: For, though he that
embraces a Religion without <hi>Reaſon,</hi> has no more
<hi>Religion</hi> than my <hi>Horſe;</hi> yet a Man's own Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
ſo rectified, is not the <hi>Guide</hi> of Man in his
Religion: for his <hi>Reaſon</hi> is that which is to be
<hi>Guided.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His <hi>Second</hi> is yet more Extravagant, <hi>viz.</hi> That
<hi>Divine Revelation is not neceſſary to Salvation.</hi> In
which he has bid boldly; for there is not a
word in the <hi>Duke's Diſcourſe</hi> about it. He aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts
the <hi>Divine Inſtinct;</hi> 
               <q>That it inclines and
diſpoſes Men to be Religious; That they
are to be commended, that beat a ſincere Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to it.</q> But not a word, that Men ſhould
not crave further Help, or read the Holy <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,</hi>
that contain our Revealed Religion. On
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:98577:9"/>
the contrary, he tells us; <q>
                  <hi>He therefore wav'd
the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of them in this Diſcourſe,</hi> becauſe of
the Perſons to whoſe Condition he calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it.</q> Were it not a ſine Concluſion in
this Doctor, to ſay, <hi>A Man that goes to</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter
<hi>ſhall never come to</hi> Canterbury, though
it be in the Way, and the better part of it?
Juſt ſo Reaſonable his <hi>Conſequence</hi> is againſt the
<hi>Duke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But he advances in his Humour of perverting
his Words; for the <hi>Third Conſequence</hi> he draws
in his Name, is this: <hi>That it is a moſt horrid
Sin, to lead Men out of Errors,</hi> (pag. 13.) when
there is not one word of <hi>Leading</hi> in the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
For the Duke ſays, [<hi>To Force,</hi>] and he
infers, <hi>To Lead.</hi> His Words are; <q>That it is
one of the greateſt Crimes a Man can be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of, <hi>To Force us</hi> to act or ſin againſt that
Inſtinct of Religion; and ſomething a-kin to
the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt.</q> The Duke
ſays, <hi>To force Men to ſin;</hi> he ſays, <hi>To lead Men
out of Errors:</hi> As if <hi>Leading</hi> and <hi>Forcing</hi> were
the ſame; when one is the way of <hi>Perſwaſion,</hi>
and the other of <hi>Fines</hi> and <hi>Priſons.</hi> I cannot
tell what this Gentleman would not ſay; he
may as honeſtly apprehend a <hi>Beggar</hi> on the
Road, for an High-way-Man.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:98577:10"/>
His <hi>Fourth</hi> and laſt <hi>Conſequence</hi> he beſtows up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this <hi>Noble Peer,</hi> is this, <hi>pag. 13. That Men,
who believe a</hi> God, <hi>and follow the Dictates of
Reaſon in his Worſhip, may be ſaved in any, in all
Religions; provided they know not a better.</hi> And
what, if he had ſaid ſo? It had ſhewn his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
Does not <hi>God wink in times of Ignorance?</hi>
And what is <hi>Knowing no better,</hi> but a State of
Ignorance? Is there no Allowance for Times,
Places and Conditions? Certainly, this Man
thinks, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> are as much below
him, as he is above the Duke of <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi>
This is riding Tantivy, through thick and
thin.</p>
            <p>But to Anſwer his ſhort, yet full: This
Charge upon his Grace, charges himſelf; <hi>Firſt,</hi>
That <hi>Faith in</hi> God, <hi>and the Dictates of Reaſon,
can ſwallow all ſorts of Religion;</hi> for he excepts
not the moſt Idolatrous; yet ſets up <hi>Reaſon</hi> elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
to judge of true Religion, (<hi>pag.</hi> 14, 36.)
And Men muſt leave <hi>Reaſon,</hi> when they fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Superſtition and Idolatry. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That
<hi>this Hero</hi> is <hi>for chuſing his Religion without Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon:</hi>
And that's not worth a Fig, (with his
leave.) <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That <hi>the Duke does not prefer
Chriſtianity, by the Courſe of his Deductions:</hi> which
he plainly does, <hi>pag.</hi> 18.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:98577:10"/>
But after he hath ſhewn the Duke's Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
or Miſtake (in his Opinion) to make him
abler than he found him, and the Book wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thier
the Reader's notice; with a Modeſty, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
equal to his <hi>Reaſon,</hi> he tells us: <hi>NOW, IF
I WERE TO DISCO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RSE AN ATHEIST,</hi>
(pag. 9.) and: <hi>IF I HAD BEEN TO FOL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOW
HIS GRACE's BLOW. I would have
urged This;</hi> and, <hi>I would have done That,</hi> &amp;c.
By which, I perceive, this Gentleman is better
natur'd than Sir <hi>Jo. Falſtaff,</hi> that being call'd
upon for a Reaſon for what he ſaid, anſwer'd;
That <hi>if Reaſons were as rife as Black-Berries, he
would not give him one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have ſeen Cowards fight thus ſtoutly: Now,
Sir, (ſays he) here I could have you, Sir; and
there I could have you, Sir: and, if I ſtrike
you, Sir, infallibly I hit you, Sir: and, if I hit
you, Sir, you'll feel it, Sir: Are not you of
my mind, Sir? This Gentleman wanted ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
and though the Duke be no <hi>Minor,</hi> he
has a mind to play the <hi>Senior</hi> upon him, and
uſe him ſo: And what a fine time he would
have, to be Ward to ſuch a Jewel?</p>
            <p>Such Coxcombs I have ſeen in my time; for
there is not ſo true a Mark of that Animal, as
<hi>Officiouſneſs</hi> upon <hi>Miſtake,</hi> to <hi>praeter</hi> do, or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do
a thing. <hi>Look you, Sir; upon my word, Sir;</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:98577:11"/>
you are out, Sir; you mean this, Sir; I know your
meaning, Sir, as well as if I were in you, Sir; alas,
Sir, there is a better way far, Sir; and then, Sir,
you don't hit it neither, Sir; for, Sir, if you aim at
the end, Sir, you muſt aim at the means, Sir; and
that I pretend to know, Sir, as well as any Man, Sir;
and therefore, Sir, by your favor, Sir, if I had been
to have follow'd your blow, Sir, I would have done
no body knows what, Sir; <hi>Gramarcy Doctor. 'Tis
pity to think, what pains ſome Men take to
play the Fool.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His ſecond great Head (and little Wit) is
about the <hi>Anti-Chriſtianiſm of Perſecution,</hi> oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the Duke's Notion of it, thus <hi>pag.</hi> 17, 18,
19, 20. And firſt, he ſays, <hi>That though to
puniſh Profeſſors of the true Religion, for that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
whilſt inoffenſive in all things to the Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
is real Perſecution, and truly Anti-Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an;
as that of the Primitive Chriſtians by the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Roman Emperors; yet to puniſh Diſſenters, as
Papiſts and Phanaticks, is not ſo; becauſe they are
in the wrong, and offenſive to the Government.</hi> This
in a <hi>Lump</hi> (as he calls it) and perhaps a little
better collected than his was. In all which he
begs the Queſtion of the <hi>Roman Emperors</hi> for
the <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> and of the Diſſenters for their
Adverſaries; though upon differing terms.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Heathen Emperors</hi> had <hi>Antient Rites</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:98577:11"/>
to plead, and the <hi>Eſtabliſh'd Law</hi> of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
againſt the progreſs of Chriſtianity; And
that is all this Gentleman has ſaid here for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and againſt them. For he undertakes not to
prove the Points Controverted true againſt the
<hi>Diſſenters;</hi> but urges the kn<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cking Argument of
the <hi>Jews, We have a Law, and by our Law he ought
to die.</hi> Nay, he ſends the Duke to <hi>Lewis</hi> the
<hi>Fourteenth, (pag.</hi> 29.) to ask, <hi>If it be ſafe To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerating
another Religion than his own:</hi> By which
he determines the caſe againſt the <hi>Perſecuted
Proteſtants</hi> there, leſt their <hi>Indulgence</hi> ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplarily
make way for ours to the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> here.
Is not this a dainty Proteſtant, that can cheriſh
Cruelty againſt Men of his own Religion abroad,
rather than not act it at home upon <hi>Diſſenters?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is to make <hi>Religion</hi> a <hi>Politick Intereſt,</hi>
and to Anſwer Worldly ends: A greater Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> than any he has offer'd againſt
it. The Primitive Chriſtians had died <hi>Idolaters</hi>
upon this Principle: For <hi>Authority,</hi> not <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction,</hi>
with him all along concludes the Point.</p>
            <p>He begs the Queſtion of the <hi>Diſſenters;</hi> for
he argues nothing about the grounds of <hi>Diſſent,</hi>
but the <hi>Law; 'Tis the Religion by Law Eſtabliſh'd:</hi>
And why not by the Bible? but that it yields
not to it the preſent Advantages of <hi>Force</hi> and
Worldly Authority. Now (as he ſays) <hi>If I had
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98577:12"/>
been to Diſpute them, and follow his blow,</hi> I would
have Evinc'd their Error, before I would have
pronounc'd my Judgment.</p>
            <p>But they are <hi>Factious, Seditious, and danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to the Government; therefore ſevere Laws
were made againſt Papiſts, Prieſts and Jeſuits on
the one Hand, and Phanaticks on the other.</hi> Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
this were as he frowardly Clamors; Is it to
be thought, that they would be <hi>dangerous,</hi> if
they were Eaſie, and ſo endanger themſelves?
they know better. And we ſee, this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
fears the <hi>Church's Receeding in her Loyalty,</hi>
if there be but <hi>Indulgence</hi> to <hi>Diſſenters;</hi> making
her Eye evil, if the Governments be good. Pray,
what then would ſhe do, if ſhe were Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
as they are? Can more, with Juſtice, be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
from <hi>Hereticks</hi> and <hi>Schiſmaticks,</hi> than
from the <hi>Orthodox?</hi> If they were more patient,
I ſhould begin to fear, they would be quickly
more Orthodox too. But I cannot tell how to
think that Men in their Wits would forfeit <hi>Eaſe</hi>
when they have it; though to get it they might
be Indiſcreet.</p>
            <p>And one thing I muſt ſay, <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi>
have been <hi>Loyal</hi> in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> and
<hi>Bresbyterians</hi> in <hi>France</hi> and the <hi>German</hi> Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.
So that 'tis not neceſſarily true, they are
not <hi>Seditious,</hi> as they are <hi>Diſſenters:</hi> Men go by
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98577:12"/>
their Intereſts. The Gentlemen that <hi>Tore</hi> the
King's Declaration of <hi>Indulgence</hi> from him, were
high <hi>Church-men;</hi> and they oppoſed his <hi>Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Capacity</hi> to his <hi>Natural,</hi> on purpoſe to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
that Act of Grace, by which diſtinction
the late Civil War was made; ſo that 41. over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
73. or that return'd to 41. And who

how to pray, but out of our <hi>Liturgy;</hi> that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
to Exclude the <hi>Preſumptive Heir</hi> to the
<hi>Crown</hi> upon the ſcore of his <hi>Religion.</hi> And
though this <hi>Jehu</hi> drives ſo furiouſly upon <hi>Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
on that Account, if he will think (which I
fear he ſeldom does) he will find that an <hi>Heir</hi>
is but a Subject; and the ſame <hi>Law</hi> governs
properly a-like in this Kingdom to all Ranks of
Subjects. And that ſome of the ſame Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
that formerly ſhook ſmall Folks <hi>Property</hi>
for <hi>Non-Conformity,</hi> had lately a mind, to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
the preſent King's for Diſſent. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let us make Men eaſie, take Temptations
out of their way, and not lay ſtumbling-blocks
before weak or peeviſh people, nor pinch them
with thoſe Burdens or Yokes, that our Fathers

Friendly ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>It is by this Nameleſs Author Objected in a

               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:98577:13"/>
(pag. 28, &amp; 29.) <hi>but is dangerous to a
Monarchy.</hi> But not half ſo much in my opinion,
as his Objection is. For, doubtleſs, <hi>Monarchy</hi>
has as extended and ſaving a bottom to live
upon, as any <hi>Republick</hi> in the World; nay,
rather the Power of more Mercy, Favour and
Indulgence. For the Number of Subjects is the
Glory and Strength of a King; and that which
makes the <hi>People eaſie,</hi> makes the <hi>Government</hi> ſo
to the <hi>Monarch.</hi> 'T were laviſh to prefer a
<hi>Common-Wealth</hi> to make it more capable of good
to the various conditions of Mankind than
Monarchy. It is therefore his little skill in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks
as well as Religion, that makes him quote
the practice of the <hi>French</hi> King (<hi>p.</hi> 29.) for
no body knows yet the conſequence: His Cake
is but Dough ſtill: 'Tis early day with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject:
See if his Son, ay, if He don't feel it yet.
For Uniformity is a mean Recompence for a
thin and poor Country. What might not an
Union of Intereſts and Affections, under ſo
great a Prince as we have, recover and eſtabliſh
in the World? Wonders; for Miracles come
from Heaven.</p>
            <p>Inſtead of this, old Sores are daily rubb'd
freſh; and new impreſſions of former Tragedies
are thrown abroad to prejudice us againſt the
means of our own Peace and Glory: God (if
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:98577:13"/>
he pleaſes) avert the conſequences of our own
bitterneſs and Animoſity.</p>
            <p>His laſt Head is about <hi>Toleration,</hi> (p. 25.)
though included in his <hi>ſecond;</hi> this he labours
with his uſual pains; <hi>'Tis neither</hi> (ſays he) <hi>good
Divinity, nor good Politicks;</hi> and of this he is as
certain as if he found a Mare's Neſt.</p>
            <p>The firſt Reaſon, why it is not good Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;
is, <hi>That falſe Religions in a Chriſtian Dreſs,
would then be Tolerated to the injury of Chriſtian
Religion and Mens Souls,</hi> p. 26. But he does
not conſider, how many he will Damn by Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie.
But in that, perhaps I am out, he
may not think that a Damnable Sin; and that
it is better be an <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> than a <hi>Diſſenter;</hi>
though One thinks he is in the right, and the
Other knows he is in the wrong; and ſo one
of St. <hi>Paul's true Hereticks,</hi> viz. <hi>ſelf-Condemned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Be that as it will, Jeſus Chriſt is againſt his

Let him go to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi>
whoſe Anceſtor begun the Glory of that Country
with it, to the Princes of the <hi>Empire.</hi> And if
this <hi>French</hi> King will be Impartial, ask him, If
greater Feats were done without, than with a
<hi>Toleration?</hi> So far is it from being dangerous to
Princes.</p>
            <p>And if <hi>Opinions</hi> were yet worſe than they are,
there cannot (in my judgment) accrue any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to the Government that <hi>Tolerates</hi> them. For,
Firſt, the Profeſſors of them have, which they
could be thought to <hi>Plot</hi> to get; but will never
<hi>Plot</hi> to <hi>loſe.</hi> And, Secondly, if any ſuch peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
could be, there are or may be Laws enough

            </p>
            <p>What makes Men <hi>Dangerous?</hi> Firſt, they

Man's own power. Next, ſo ſoon as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
it, the Law cuts him off from the Favour
and Protection of the Magiſtrate. Is it then the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:98577:14"/>
Man that makes himſelf <hi>dangerous,</hi> or is he
made <hi>dangerous</hi> for that <hi>Diſſent?</hi> And if that be
it, 'twill not be hard to determine, how a <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenter</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Forcing</hi> Men to Religions is as if it were in a
Man's power to uſe his <hi>Conſcience</hi> as he can his

            <p>I conclude, That <hi>Toleration</hi> is ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an Enemy to <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Monarchy,</hi> That
it gives God his due, prevents Hypocriſie, and
reſtores Society inſtead of Unity: And by an

<hi>King Great</hi> and <hi>Terrible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I now wait upon his Three Queſtions: the
Firſt has Four in the belly of it, (<hi>p.</hi> 34, 35.)
Firſt: <hi>If Chriſt did not believe Soveraign Power
might maintain the order of Society by Rewards
and Paniſhments.</hi> Truly I don't know his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
nor how ſuitable it might be to him to
believe, being the Object of ours. But he
commanded it, though with a <hi>ſalvo</hi> to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
he came to Inſtitute. They were his
Sheep, 'twas his Kingdom.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:98577:15"/>
The next Query is to the Duke, <hi>If he ha<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
conſider'd, That ſpiritual Puniſhments are far more
rigorous, than Temporal ones?</hi> I believe, as much
as this Gentleman has, <hi>Whether Temporal be leſs
than Eternal?</hi> But what of all that? Why,
(next to follow his blow) he asks; <hi>If Jeſus
Chriſt then has not uſed greater force to compel
Men to his Religion, than all the Powers of the
Earth have done?</hi> But if it were ſo, I am of the
poor <hi>Welch</hi>-man's mind; <hi>Let her alone till <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

fall into the hands of God, than Man.</hi> But: is this
proper, juſt, and adequate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Chriſt puniſhes</hi>
Spiritual Faults with Spiritual Puniſhments, <hi>Ergo,</hi>
The Powers of the Earth ought to puniſh the
ſame Faults with Temporal and Corporal Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
ſuch as <hi>Priſons, Fines, Exiles</hi> and <hi>Death?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in the next place, I don't think he has out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
the <hi>Heathen</hi> and ſome Chriſtian Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
the Reaſon of both conſider'd. For he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides
the Controverſie by <hi>Good Works;</hi> They
by <hi>Opinions:</hi> He cryes, <hi>Come ye well-doers;</hi> there
are his <hi>Sheep: Go ye Workers of Iniquity;</hi> there
be his <hi>Goats.</hi> But Conformity makes an <hi>Ill-Man</hi>
Grateful, and Non-Conformity a <hi>Good-Man</hi>
Hateful: here <hi>Good Works</hi> don't determine the
point, as at Chriſt's Judgment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:98577:15"/>
Howbeit, it is monſtrous to argue, That Men
ſhould be <hi>twice puniſh'd</hi> for the ſame Offence;
by the Magiſtrate here, and Chriſt hereafter:
This is held unequal among Juſt Men in all Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments.
But 'tis no matter, let <hi>Zeal</hi> or <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt</hi>
Chriſten it, and its well enough for a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt</hi>
or a <hi>Phanatick.</hi> But if this Gentleman
were as much under their power, as they are
now under his Cenſures; and ſhould they uſe
him, as the provokes the Civil Magiſtrate to
treat them, I am of the mind, he would think
and call it too <hi>Anti-Chriſtian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this <hi>Second</hi> main Queſtion (in ſubſtance
Anſwer'd before) <hi>Whether there being an hundred
Monarchies happy without Toleration and Liberty
of Conſcience, to one Republick that allows it with
Reſtriction, whoſe future Fate we are ignorant of;
and whether that may not in time prove its Ruin;
It be not an hundred to one, that Monarchy ſhall be
more flouriſhing, ſafe and laſting without a Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
than with it?</hi> To this I ſay; he makes the
ground of it <hi>Fact;</hi> and that's falſe: There is
not only no ſuch thing, as <hi>an hundred Monarchies
that have been happy without it:</hi> but more have
been happy with, than without it, All the
Eaſtern Monarchies, almoſt generally give it
with ſucceſs. Next, the <hi>French.</hi> Monarohy was
happier in <hi>Henry</hi> the IV. than <hi>Charles</hi> the IX.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:98577:16"/>
and <hi>Ours</hi> in Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> than in King
<hi>Henry</hi> the VIII. for though Her's was not a Reign
of Liberty, yet of leſs ſeverity than His. He
makes it <hi>Republican,</hi> and knows not what he
ſays: for as his ſtory of <hi>Monarchies</hi> is untrue, ſo
that of <hi>Republicks,</hi> a Fiction: there being <hi>Two</hi>
Monarchies to <hi>One</hi> Republick that gives it.
What will be, we cann't tell: but <hi>Holland</hi> is a
greater proof for the Prudence of a <hi>Toleration,</hi>
than any Country that can be named on the ſide
of Coertion; and the Effects that are, ſhew
what the ſame meaſures will do for the time to
come if kept to.</p>
            <p>To the Third, and laſt Queſtion, <hi>viz. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be not Croſs and Pile, whether a Man, who
may be of any, or all Religions, will be of any, or
of none at all?</hi> I muſt tell him, That they that can
be of all Religions, have little or none. And
therefore I always thought thoſe <hi>Clergy-men</hi> that
in <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's time turn'd <hi>Trimmers,</hi> and
<hi>Proteſtants</hi> in <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth's, and <hi>Papiſts</hi>
in Queen <hi>Mary's,</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants</hi> again, with a
witneſs, in Queen <hi>Elizabeth's,</hi> had <hi>no Religion</hi>
but their <hi>Benefices.</hi> And, as I take it, there
were not <hi>Three Hundred,</hi> of all Qualities, out
of <hi>Ten Thouſand,</hi> that ſtood out; to ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of their <hi>Fountains</hi> that ran freely through
all thoſe Rubs and Revolutions, I mean <hi>Oxford</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:98577:16"/>
and <hi>Cambridge.</hi> If he pleaſe to remember what
numbers turn'd <hi>Presbyterians</hi> between the years
<hi>Forty</hi> and <hi>Fifty,</hi> how many in <hi>Sixty</hi> return'd;
and with what <hi>Oaths, Covenants, Engagements,</hi>
and <hi>Abjurations</hi> they maintain'd their Poſſeſſion,
will have cauſe to ſay, that it is, ſometimes, hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Croſs</hi> and <hi>Pile</hi> with too many, what Religion
they are of, and thoſe of no ſmall pretences
too.</p>
            <p>And ſince he has put it upon that game, I
cami't forbear ſaying, That he has hit upon the
apteſt Alluſion he could have made. For <hi>Croſs</hi>
and <hi>Pile</hi> in ſome Countries ſtand <hi>Pope</hi> and
<hi>King,</hi> and where they meet that Game is
up.</p>
            <p>If he thinks the buſineſs yet worth his while,
I ſhould be glad to ſee ſomething truly ſolid and
Chriſtian. In the mean time, I take the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
he gives me in his Concluſion, <hi>to make my</hi>
Choice <hi>by Reaſon and Vertue, To diſcourage all Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
and Diſloyalty; to Tolerate none, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
to cut other Mens Throats for Conſcience ſake:</hi>

            <p>The <hi>Concluſion</hi> is firſt <hi>Particular</hi> then <hi>General</hi>
I would beſeech the Gentleman, to whom this
<hi>Reply</hi> is made, to <hi>Avoid Prejudice,</hi> which is here
(I fear) an Ill Habit of Education. For he ſays,
<hi>He was always Diametrically oppoſite to the Duke's
Opinion in the Points treated on:</hi> As if he had
ſuck'd it with his Milk. Examination helps
Judgment; it is Chewing and Digeſting well;
t'other is ſwallowing and not Concocting: and
ſometime a Man gets a Hook in his Throat too.
Let him have a Care of <hi>Tarantula's</hi> and the Itch
of Anſwering, before he conſiders well; for
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:98577:17"/>
that will be as unaccountable, as, he ſays, his
Wit is <hi>poiſonous Wit,</hi> (pag. 4.)</p>
            <p>There are Two other things that make a Man
heave and throw, and diſorder himſelf extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
and that is the <hi>Fly</hi> and the <hi>Worm;</hi> eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in <hi>Spring-time;</hi> and this has been unuſually
dry and hot. But for all this, I will end well
with him; For what ever he thinks, I wiſh him
as well as my ſelf; and that we may both live
and die happily with a <hi>Toleration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, <hi>Reader,</hi> 'tis fit I ſay ſomething of
this undertaking. The <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Honor</hi> I have
for the Truths deliver'd by that <hi>Noble Perſon,</hi>
and the <hi>eaſie, plain, ſhort,</hi> and yet <hi>full,</hi> I and
<hi>ſtrenuous</hi> way in which he has recommended
them to the World, obliged me to this Defence,
ſuch as it is. But I cannot but wiſh, he had
met with a Man that had deſerv'd his own no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
becauſe no body can better Defend his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments:
which the oftner I read, the Weighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
they ſeem to me; and his <hi>Adverſary's</hi> looſer
and ſlighter. 'Twas a Reſpect I owed his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and a Duty to his Eſſay.</p>
            <p>And now, <hi>Reader,</hi> as Men that die, ask for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givneſs
of all the World, ſo do I. It is true,
it does not yet appear to me, that I have In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd
any perſon or thing; I would not do it
for the World: And, therefore, am even with
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:98577:18"/>
it: but I would be Modeſt at leaſt. I have
Writ my Heart in the main; I hate ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Turns: I love <hi>Old England</hi> as well as
any Man, and I would fain ſee her Happy. I
have long thought this the way, <hi>VERTVE
OF LIFE</hi> and <hi>INDVEGENCE OF CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SCIENCE,</hi>
for the <hi>KING,</hi> for the <hi>Clergy,</hi>
and for the <hi>People.</hi> And if our hopes of <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality</hi>
were but half as ſtrong, as we care
they ſhould be thought, we could not uſe one
another with ſo much Jealouſie and Bitterneſs:
We carry not a true Eſtimate of the World with
us, to be ſo eaſily and ſo often diſorder'd for
it. Let us not then palliate our <hi>Fury,</hi> or <hi>Intereſt</hi>
with the ſacred Name of <hi>Religion:</hi> Let us An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
for our own Faults; we ſhall, we muſt:
and therefore let us mend them, that we may
have leſs to Anſwer for, when we come to
Judgment.</p>
