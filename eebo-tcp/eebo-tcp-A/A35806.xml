         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>Becauſe that the Tempeſt it was ſo great,</l>
               <l>his way he could not ſee:</l>
               <l>But under on Oak, inſtead of a cloak,</l>
               <l>he ſtood to keep himſelf dry,</l>
               <l>And as he ſtood, a Fryer in his hood</l>
               <l>by Chance came paſſing by:</l>

               <l>with that he croſt his breaſt;</l>
               <l>Then up the Devil ſtarted, the Fryer was faint-hearted,</l>
               <l>you may wink and chooſe the Beſt:</l>
               <l>For I am the Fryer and thou art the Lyar,</l>
               <l>therefore thou art my Father;</l>
               <l>I am a Doctor of Evil, and thou art the Devil,</l>
               <l>the Worſer I hold thee rather.</l>

               <l>A Collier and his cart came by,</l>
               <l>which coats he did uſe to carry,</l>
               <l>And ſo ſoon as the Devil he did him eſpy,</l>
               <l>he caus'd him a while to tarry,</l>
               <l>For why I do think, that with thee I muſt drink,</l>
               <l>and he call'd for a glaſs of claret;</l>
               <l>Now I find by thy ſmell, that thou cameſt from Hell,</l>
               <l>and I fear thou haſt ſtole my chariot.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then the next that came by was a Chimny-ſweeper,</l>
               <l>with poles, his brooms and ſhackles,</l>
               <l>What meaſt, thou Man, the Devil, he ſaid,</l>
               <l>that thou uſeſt all thoſe tackles?</l>
               <l>I prithee, gentle Blade, tell me thy trade,</l>

               <l>Hadſt thou been ſo black, and no tools at thy back,</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Sir, a Chimny-ſweeper, I do profeſs,</l>
               <l>although my trade's but mean,</l>
               <l>It is for to ſweep all dirty hales,</l>
               <l>and to keep foul chimnys clean:</l>
               <l>Then go thou to Hell, where the Devil he doth dwell,</l>
               <l>and he will give thee a piece;</l>
               <l>God-a-mercy, old Dog, when I ſheer my hog,</l>
               <l>then thou ſhalt have the fleece.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The next that came by was a Tawny moor,</l>
               <l>and the Devil did him ſee,</l>
               <l>And he fleered on his tawny skin,</l>
               <l>crying, Friend, art thou any kin to me;</l>
               <l>For ſure your skin doth reſemble our kin,</l>
               <l>therefore let us walk together,</l>
               <l>And tell me how you do allow</l>
               <l>of this tempeſtuous weather.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then the next that came by was a Gun-powder-man,</l>
               <l>which coals and brimſtone ſifted,</l>
               <l>That in three quarters of a year,</l>
               <l>himſelf had hardly ſhifted:</l>
               <l>Then up the Devil roſe; and ſnuffed his noſe,</l>
               <l>he could indure it no longer,</l>
               <l>Cry'd Away with this fume, 'tis not fit for the room,</l>
               <l>it will neither quench thirſt, no, nor hunger.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>I prithee, gentle Blade, tell me thy trade,</l>
               <l>as thou haſt ſo ſtrong a ſmell?</l>
               <l>It it is for to make gun-powder, he ſaid,</l>
               <l>for to blow the Devil out of Hell;</l>
               <l>And if I had him here, his joynts would I tear,</l>
               <l>he ſhould neither ſcratch, no, nor bite;</l>
               <l>I would plague the Devil for all his evil,</l>
               <l>and make him leave walking by night.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then a Tinker worſe than all the reſt,</l>
               <l>although that he was not ſo black,</l>
               <l>By chance as he came paſſing by,</l>
               <l>with his budget on his back,</l>
               <l>He cry'd, Yonder is the Devil's Tree,</l>
               <l>let us ſee who durſt go thither,</l>
               <l>For it will ſuſtain, from the wind and the rain,</l>
               <l>or any tempeſtuous weather.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>That ſhall be try'd, the Devil then he cry'd,</l>
               <l>then up the Devil he did ſtart:</l>
               <l>Then the Tinker threw his ſtaff about,</l>
               <l>and he made the Devil for to ſmart;</l>
               <l>There againſt a gate, he did wake his pate,</l>
               <l>and both his horns he broke:</l>
               <l>And ever ſince that time, I will make up my thyme,</l>
               <l>it was called, <hi>The Devil's Oak.</hi>
