            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<hi>with this question?</hi> Who hath as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended
up into heaven, or descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded?
who hath gathered the wind in his fists? who hath
bound the waters in a garment? who hath established
all the ends of the earth? What is his Name, and what
is his <hi>SONS</hi> name, if thou canst tell? <hi>To help us here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
the SON Himselfe did tell us, when he was

here upon earth, that</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">Ioh. 3. 13.</note> None hath ascended up

the Son of man which is in heaven. <hi>And that we

Esay <hi>did not long before foretell, that</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">Esai, 9. 6.</note> Vnto us a

            <p>Where if it be demanded, how these things
can stand together? that the <hi>Son of man</hi> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
upon <hi>earth,</hi> should yet at the same instant

be <hi>born in time?</hi> and that the <hi>mighty God</hi>
should become a <hi>Childe;</hi> which is the weakest

that the first letter of this great Name, is WON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DERFUL.
When he appeared of old to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noah,</hi>
his <hi>name</hi> was <hi>Wonderfull,</hi> and he did won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derously,
<hi>Judge</hi> 13. 18, 19. But that, and all
the wonders that ever were, must give place to
the great mystery of his Jncarnation, and in
respect thereof cease to be wonderfull. For of
this work, that may be verified, which is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of those wonderfull judgements, that God
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51763:3"/>
brought upon Egypt; when he would<note n="d" place="margin">Exod. 9. 16.</note> shew

            <p>Neither the creation of all things out of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
which was the beginning of the works

the last workes that shall goe before that ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Sabbath (which shall have a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
but never shall have end:) neither that
first, I say, nor these last, though most admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable

this; wherein the Lord was pleased to shew
the highest pitch (if any thing may be said to
bee highest in that which is infinite and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt
from all measure and dimensions) of his
Wisedome, Goodnesse, Power and glory.</p>
            <p>The Heathen Chaldeans, to a question pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded

<note n="h" place="margin">Dan. 2. 11.</note> that it was <hi>a rare thing</hi> which hee required
and that none other could shew it, <hi>except the
Gods; whose dwelling is not with flesh.</hi> But the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie

nature of the Lord) with such a kinde
of fullnesse, that <hi>Moses</hi> himselfe was not able
to aproach unto it; (therein comming short,
<note n="m" place="margin">Heb. 3. 3. 6.</note> as in all things, of the Lord of the house) and
filled the Temple of <hi>Salomon</hi> (a Type likewise

Esai. 7. 14.</p>
            <p>A notable wonder indeed, and great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
all comparison, That the Son of God
should be<note n="t" place="margin">Gal. 4. 4.</note>

and when he had finished his course,
was <hi>cut off out of the land of the living</hi> at Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51763:5"/>
should yet notwithstanding be in truth,
that which his shadow <hi>Melchisedek</hi> was
onely in the conceit of the men of his time;
<note n="z" place="margin">Heb. 7. 3. with Esai 53. 8. &amp; Mica. 5. 2.</note> 
               <hi>without Father, without Mother, without Pedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,

and yet he his Fathers<note n="b" place="margin">Ioh. 5. 18. Phil. 1. 6.</note> 
               <hi>equall.</hi> That he<note n="c" place="margin">Ioh. 8. 58.</note> 
               <hi>is,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Abraham was;</hi> and yet <hi>Abrahams</hi> birth
preceded his, well nigh the space of two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
yeares. And finally, that he who was
<hi>Davids Sonne,</hi> should yet be <hi>Davids</hi> Lord:<note n="d" place="margin">Matth 22. 42, 43, &amp;c.</note> a
case which plunged the greatest Rabbies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Pharesies; who had not yet <hi>lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
this Wisedome, nor known this knowledge of the
holy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The untying of this knot dependeth upon
the right understanding of the wonderfull
conjunction of the Divine and humane Nature
in the unity of the Person of our Redeemer.
For by reason of the strictnesse of this Personall
union, whatsoever may be verified of either
of those Natures, the same may be truely spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of the Whole Person; from whether so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
of the Natures it be denominated. For
the clearer conceiving whereof, we may call
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51763:5"/>
to minde that which the Apostle hath taught
us touching our Saviour:<note n="e" place="margin">Col. 2. 9.</note> 
               <hi>In him dwelleth all the
fulnesse of the Godhead bodily,</hi> that is to say, by
such a personall and reall union, as doth unse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably
&amp; everlastingly conjoyn that infinite
Godhead with his finite Manhood in the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of the selfe-same individuall Person.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He</hi> in whom that fulnesse dwelleth, is the
PERSON: <hi>that</hi> fulnesse which so doth dwell
in him, is the NATURE. Now there dwelleth
in him not onely the fulnesse of the <hi>Godhead,</hi>
but the fulnesse of the <hi>Manhood</hi> also<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
him to be both perfect God, begotten of
the substance of his Father before all worlds;
and perfect Man, made of the substance of his
Mother in the fullnesse of time. And therefore
we must hold, that there are two distinct <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi>
in him: and two so distinct, that they doe
not make one compounded nature; but still
remaine uncompounded and unconfounded
together. But <hi>Hee</hi> in whom the fulnesse of the
Manhood dwelleth, is not one, and hee in
whom the fulnesse of the Godhead another:
but he in whom the fulnesse of both those na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
dwelleth, is one and the same <hi>Immauel,</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:51763:6"/>
and consequently it must be beleeved as firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that he is but one <hi>Person.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here wee must consider, that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Nature did not assume an humane Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
but the divine Person did assume an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature: and that of the three Divine
Persons, it was neither the first nor the third
that did assume this Nature; but it was the
middle Person, who was to bee the middle
one, that must undertake this mediation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
God and us. which was otherwise also
most requisite, aswell for the better preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the integrity of the blessed Trinity in
the Godhead, as for the higher advancement
of Mand-kinde by meanes of that relation
which the second Person the Mediatour did
beare unto his Father. For if the fulnesse of the

            <p>We are further here also to observe in this
our<note n="x" place="margin">Heb. 7. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Melchisedeck,</hi> that as he had no <hi>Mother,</hi> in

most requisite, as for other respects, so
for the exemption of the assumed nature from

is thereby freed from all the touch and taint

who although shee were but the passive and

and efficient; yet cannot the man Christ Jesus

thereby be made the <hi>Son</hi> of his<note n="a" place="margin">Gal. 4. 6. Rom. 8. 9.</note> owne Spirit.
Because Fathers do beget their children out of
their owne substance: the holy Ghost did not
so, but framed the flesh of him, from whom
himself proceeded, out of the creature of them
both,<note n="b" place="margin">Luk. 1. 38, 48.</note>

            <p>That blessed wombe of hers was the
bride-chamber, wherein the Holy Ghost did
knit that indissoluble knot betwixt our hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
nature and his Deity: the Son of God
assuming into the unity of his Person that
which before he was not; and yet without
change (for so must God still be) remaining
that which he was. Whereby it came to passe,
that<note n="c" place="margin">Luk. 1. 35.</note> this <hi>holy thing which was borne of her</hi> was
indeed and in truth to be <hi>called the SONNE of
GOD.</hi> Which wonderfull connexion of two

with God, old</hi> Ely <hi>sheweth by this maine
argument:</hi>
               <note n="m" place="margin">1 Sam 2, 25.</note> If one man sinne against another,
the Judge shall judge him: but if a man sin against
the Lord, who shall plead or intreat for him? <hi>and</hi>

               <note n="n" place="margin">Iob 9. 32, 33.</note> He is not a man as I am, that I
should answer him, and we should come together in
judgement: neither is there any Dayes-man, <hi>or</hi>
Vmpire betwixt us, that might lay his hand upon us
both. <hi>If this generall should admit no manner
of exception, then were we in a wofull case,
and had cause to weep much more than Saint</hi>
Iohn <hi>did in the Revelation; when</hi>
               <note n="o" place="margin">Revel. 5. 3, 4.</note> 
               <hi>none was
found</hi> in heaven, nor in earth, nor under the earth,
<hi>that</hi> was able to open the booke <hi>which he saw in
the right hand of him that sate upon the
Throne,</hi> neither to look thereon. <hi>But as S.</hi> Iohn
<hi>was wished there, to refraine his weeping;
because</hi>
               <note n="p" place="margin">Ibid. vers. 5.</note> the Lion of the tribe of Iuda, the root of
David, had prevailed to open the book, and to loose

the seven seales thereof: <hi>so he himself else where
giveth the like comfort unto all of us in this
particular.</hi>
               <note n="q" place="margin">Ioh. 2, 1, 2.</note> If any man sin, we have an Advocate
with the Father, Iesus Christ the righteous: and he
is a propitiation for our sins; and not for ours only,
but also for the sins of the whole world.</p>
            <p>For as<note n="r" place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 5, 6.</note> there is <hi>one God,</hi> so is there <hi>one Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour
between God and men, the man Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
who gave himselfe a ransom for all;</hi> and in
discharge of this his office of Mediation, as
the only fit Umpire to take up this controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
was to lay his hand as well upon GOD, the
party so highly offended, as upon <hi>Man,</hi> the
party so basely offending. In things concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
God, the <hi>Priesthood</hi> of our Mediatour is
exercised.<note n="s" place="margin">Heb. 5. 1. &amp; 2. 17.</note> 
               <hi>For every high Priest is taken from

to God.</hi> The parts of his Priestly Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
are two; <hi>Satisfaction</hi> and <hi>Intercession:</hi> the
former whereof giveth contentment to Gods
<hi>Justice;</hi> the latter solliciteth his <hi>Mercy,</hi> for the
application of this benefit to the children of
God in particular. Whereby it commeth to
passe, that God in<note n="t" place="margin">Rom. 9. 15, 16.</note> shewing mercy upon
whom he will shew mercy, is yet for his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice

               <hi>just, and the justifier
of him that beleeveth in Iesus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By vertue of his <hi>Intercession,</hi> our Mediatour
<note n="x" place="margin">Heb. 9. 24.</note> appeareth in the presence of God for us,
and<note n="y" place="margin">Rom. 8. 34. Hebr. 7. 25.</note> maketh request for us. To this purpose,
the Apostle noteth in the fourth to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes,
1. That <hi>we have a great high Priest,
that is passed into the heavens, Iesus the Sonne of
God.</hi> (vers. 14.) 2. that <hi>we have not an high Priest
which cannot be touched with the feeling of our
infirmities, but was in all things tempted as wee
are; yet without sinne.</hi> (vers. 15.) Betwixt the <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi>
of such, and the <hi>not having</hi> of such an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercessor,
betwixt the <hi>height</hi> of him in regard
of the one, and the <hi>lowlinesse</hi> in regard of his
other nature, standeth the comfort of the
poore sinner. He must be such a suitour as ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
our cause to heart: and therefore<note n="z" place="margin">Heb. 2. 17.</note> 
               <hi>in all
things it behoved him to be made like unto his
brethren; that he might be a mercifull and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
high Priest.</hi> In which respect as it was
needfull hee should partake with our flesh
and bloud, that he might be tenderly affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
unto his brethren: so likewise for the
obtaining of so great a suit, it behoved he
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51763:13"/>
should be most deare to God the Father, and
have so great an interest in him, as he might
alwayes be sure to be<note n="a" place="margin">Iohn 11. 42.</note> heard in his requests<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
who therefore could be no other, but he of
whom the Father testified from heaven,<note n="b" place="margin">Matth. 3. 17.</note> 
               <hi>This
is my beloved Sonne, in whom I am well pleased.</hi>
It was fit our intercessor should be man, like
unto our selves; that we might<note n="c" place="margin">Heb. 4. 16.</note> 
               <hi>boldly</hi> come
to him, <hi>and finde grace to help in time of need:</hi>
it was fit he should be God, that he might
<hi>boldly</hi> goe to the Father, without any way di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sparaging
him; as being his<note n="d" place="margin">Zach. 13. 7.</note>

full <hi>satisfaction</hi> made by himselfe, as our

               <note n="i" place="margin">Heb. 7. 12.</note> 
               <hi>suretie,</hi> unto all the debt wherewith we any
way stood chargeable. Now the <hi>Satisfaction</hi>
which our surety bound himselfe to performe
in our behalfe, was of a double <hi>debt:</hi> the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall,
and the accessory. The principall debt
is obedience to Gods most holy Law: which
man was bound to pay as a perpetuall tribute
to his Creator, although he had never sinned;
but, being now by his owne default become
bankrupt, is not able to discharge in the least
measure. His surety therefore being to satisfie
in his stead; none will be found fit to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
such a payment, but he who is both God
and Man.</p>
            <p>Man it is fit he should be: because Man
was the party that by the Articles of the first
Covenant was tied to this obedience; and it
was requisite that,<note n="k" place="margin">Rom. 5. 19.</note> 
               <hi>As by one mans disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
many were made sinners, so by the obedience
of one Man likewise, many should be made righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous.</hi>
Againe, if our Mediatour were only
God, he could have performed no obedience
(the Godhead being free from all manner
of subjection:) and if he were a bare Man,
although he had beene as perfect as <hi>Adam,</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:51763:14"/>
in his integrity, or the Angels themselves; yet
being left unto himselfe amidst all the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Satan &amp; this wicked world, he should
be subject to fall, as they were; or if he should
hold out, as<note n="l" place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 21.</note> 
               <hi>the elect Angels</hi> did; that must
have been ascribed to the <hi>grace</hi> and favour of
another: whereas the giving of strict satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to Gods <hi>justice</hi> was the thing required in
this behalfe. But now being God, as well as
Man, he by his owne<note n="m" place="margin">Heb. 9. 14.</note> 
               <hi>eternall Spirit</hi> preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
himselfe without spot: presenting a farre
more satisfactory obedience unto God, than
could have possibly been performed by <hi>Adam</hi>
in his integrity.</p>
            <p>For beside the infinite difference that was
betwixt both their <hi>Persons,</hi> which maketh
the actions of the one beyond all comparison
to exceed the worth and value of the other: we
know that <hi>Adam</hi> was not able to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
holy; but what holinesse he had, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from him who created him according
to his owne Image: so that whatsoever obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
<hi>Adam</hi> had performed, God should
have<note n="n" place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 7.</note> eaten but of the fruit of the Vineyard
which himselfe had planted; and<note n="o" place="margin">1 Chron. 29. 14, 16. <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>of his owne</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:51763:15"/>
would all that have been, which could be
given unto him. But Christ did himselfe san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie
that humane nature which he assumed,
according to his owne saying, <hi>John 17. 19.
For their sakes I sanctifie my selfe:</hi> and so out
of his owne peculiar store did he bring forth
those precious treasures of holy obedience,
which for the satisfaction of our debt he was
pleased to tender unto his Father. Again, if
<hi>Adam</hi> had<note n="p" place="margin">Luke 17. 10.</note> done all things which were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
him, he must for all that have said:
<hi>I am an unprofitable servant; I have done that
which was my duty to doe.</hi> Whereas in the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
obedience, which Christ subjected
himselfe unto, the case stood farre other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</p>
            <p>True it is that if we respect him in his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
nature,<note n="q" place="margin">Ioh. 14. 28.</note> 
               <hi>his Father is greater than he;</hi> and
he is his Fathers<note n="r" place="margin">Esay 53. 11. Mar. 12. 18.</note> 
               <hi>servant:</hi> yet in that he said,
and most truly said, <hi>that God was his Father,</hi>
               <note n="s" place="margin">Iohn 5. 18.</note> the Jewes did rightly inferre from thence,
that he thereby <hi>made himselfe equall with God;</hi>
and<note n="t" place="margin">Zach. 13. 7.</note> the Lord of hosts himselfe hath proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
him to be <hi>the man</hi> that is <hi>his fellow.</hi> Being
such a man therefore, and so highly borne;
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:51763:15"/>
by the priviledge of his birth-right, he might
have claimed an exemption from the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
service whereunto all other men are tied:
and by being<note n="u" place="margin">Matth. 17. 25, 26.</note> the Kings Sonne, have freed
himselfe from the payment of that tribute
which was to be exacted at the hands of Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.
When<note n="x" place="margin">Heb. 1. 6.</note> the Father brought this his first-begotten
into the world, he said; <hi>Let all the
Angells of God worship him:</hi> and at the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
wherein the Sonne advanced our nature
into the highest pitch of dignity, by admitting
it into the unity of his sacred person, that
nature so assumed was worthy to be crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with all glory and honour: and he in that
nature might then have set himselfe downe
<note n="y" place="margin">Heb. 12. 2.</note> at the right hand of the throne of God; ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to no other subjection than now he is, or
hereafter shall be, when after the end of
this world he shall have delivered up the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
to God the Father. For then also, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of his assumed nature, he<note n="z" place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 27.</note> 
               <hi>shall be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
unto him that put all</hi> other <hi>things under
him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the Sonne of God, if he had min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
only his owne things, might at the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:51763:16"/>
very first have attained unto the joy that was
set before him: but<note n="a" place="margin">Philip. 2. v. 4, 5, 7, 8.</note> looking <hi>on the things of
others,</hi> he chose rather to come by a tedious
way, and wearisome journey unto it; not chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenging
the priviledge of a Sonne, but taking
upon him <hi>the forme of a</hi> meane <hi>servant.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
in the dayes of his flesh, he did not serve
as an honourable Commander in the Lords
host, but as an ordinary souldier: he <hi>made

                  </gap> Phil. 2. 7.</note> emptying himselfe of his high state and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;
<hi>he humbled himselfe, and became obedient</hi>
untill his death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being content all his life long
to be<note n="b" place="margin">Gal. 4. 4.</note> 
               <hi>made under the Law:</hi> yea so farre, that
as he was sent<note n="c" place="margin">Rom. 8. 3.</note> 
               <hi>in the likenesse of sinfull flesh,</hi> so
he disdained not to subject himselfe unto that
Law, which properly did concerne <hi>sinfull
flesh.</hi> And therefore howsoever <hi>Circumcision</hi>
was by right appliable only unto such as were
<note n="d" place="margin">Coloss. 2. 11, 13.</note> 
               <hi>dead in their sinnes, and the uncircumcision of
their flesh;</hi> yet he, in whom there was <hi>no body
of the sinnes of the flesh</hi> to be put off, submitted
himselfe notwithstanding thereunto: not only
to testifie his communion with the Fathers
of the old Testament; but also by this meanes
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:51763:16"/>
to tender unto his Father a bond, signed with
his owne bloud, whereby he made himselfe
in our behalfe a debtour unto the whole Law.
<hi>For I testifie</hi> (saith<note n="e" place="margin">Gal. 5. 3.</note> the Apostle) <hi>to every man
that is circumcised, that he is a debtour to the whole
Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In like manner <hi>Baptisme</hi> appertained pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
unto such as were defiled, and had need
to have their<note n="f" place="margin">Act. 22. 16.</note> sinnes washed away: and
therefore when all the land of Judea, and they
of Jerusalem went out unto <hi>John,</hi> they<note n="g" place="margin">Matth. 3. 6. Mark 1. 5.</note> 
               <hi>were
all baptized of him in the river Jordan, confessing
their sinnes.</hi> Among the rest came our Saviour
also: but the Baptist considering that he had
need to be baptized by Christ, and Christ no
need at all to be baptized by him, refused to
give way unto that action; as altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>befitting
the state of that immaculat Lamb of
God, who was to take away the sinne of the
World. Yet did our Mediatour submit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to that ordinance of God also: not only
to testifie his communion with the Christians
of the new Testament; but especially (which
is the reason yeelded by himselfe) because
<note n="h" place="margin">Matth. 3. 15.</note> 
               <hi>it became him thus to fulfill all righteousnesse.</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:51763:17"/>
And so having fulfilled all righteousnesse,
whereunto the meanest man was tied, in the
dayes of his pilgrimage (which was more than
he needed to have undergone, if he had respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
only himselfe:) the workes which he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
were truly works of <hi>supererogation,</hi>
which might be put upon the account of them
whose debt he undertook to discharge; and
being performed by the person of the Sonne of
God, must in that respect not only be equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
but infinitely overvalue the obedience of
<hi>Adam</hi> and all his posterity, although they had
remained in their integrity, &amp; continued untill
this houre instantly serving God day &amp; night.
And thus for our maine and principall debt of
Obedience, hath our Mediator given satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
unto the Iustice of his Father; with<note n="i" place="margin">Luk. 6. 38.</note> 
               <hi>good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
pressed down, shaken together, &amp; running over.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But beside this, we were liable unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
debt; which we have incurred by our
default, and drawn upon our selves by way
of forfeiture, and <hi>nomine poenae.</hi> For as<note n="k" place="margin">Luk. 17. 10. Rom. 8. 12. Gal. 5. 3.</note> Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is a due <hi>debt;</hi> and Gods servants in regard
thereof are truly <hi>debters:</hi> so likewise is sinne
a<note n="l" place="margin">Matth. 6. 12. compared with Luk. 11. 4.</note> 
               <hi>debt,</hi> and sinners<note n="m" place="margin">

               <hi>debters,</hi> in regard of the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:51763:17"/>
penalty due for the default. And as the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the debt which commeth <hi>nomine poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae,</hi>
dischargeth not the tenant afterwards from
paying his yearly rent; which of it selfe would
have been due, although no default had been
committed: so the due payment of the yearly
rent, after the default hath been made, is no suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
satisfaction for the penalty already in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred.
Therefore our surety, who standeth
chargeable with all our debts, as he maketh
paiment for the one by his <hi>Active,</hi> so must he
make amends for the other by his <hi>Passive</hi> obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience:
he must first<note n="n" place="margin">Luk. 24. 26.</note> suffer, &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> enter into his
glory.<note n="o" place="margin">Heb. 2. 10.</note> 
               <hi>For it became him, for whom are all things,
and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons
unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation
perfect</hi> (that is, a perfect accomplisher of the
work w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he had under take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) <hi>through sufferings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Godhead is of that infinit perfection,
that it cannot possibly be subject to any passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
He therefore that had no other nature but
the Godhead, could not pay such a debt as this;
the discharge whereof consisted in suffering
and dying. It was also fit, that Gods justice
should have bin satisfied in that nature which
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:51763:18"/>
had transgressed; and that the same nature
should suffer the punishment, that had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
the offence.<note n="p" place="margin">Heb. 2. 14, 15.</note> 
               <hi>For asmuch then as the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
were partakers of flesh and blood, he also him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
likewise tooke part of the same: that through
death he might destroy him that had the power
of death, that is, the Devill; and deliver them
who through feare of death were all their life
time subject to bondage:</hi> Such and so great was
the love of God the Father towards us, that
<note n="q" place="margin">Rom. 8. 12.</note> 
               <hi>Hee spared not his owne Sonne, but delivered
him up for us all:</hi> and so transcendent was the
love of the Sonne of God, towards the sonnes
of men, that he desired not to be spared; but
rather than they should lye under the power
of death, was of himselfe most willing to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
death for them. which seeing in that infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
nature, which by eternall generation he
received from his Father, he could not doe; he
resolved in the appoynted time to take unto
himselfe a Mother, and out of her substance to
have a body framed unto himselfe, wherein
he might<note n="r" place="margin">Phil. 2. 8.</note> 
               <hi>become obedient unto death, even the
death of the crosse,</hi> for our redemption. And
therefore<note n="s" place="margin">Heb, 10. 5, 7</note> when he commeth into the world,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:51763:18"/>
he saith unto his Father, <hi>A body hast thou fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
me; Lo, I come to doe thy will, O God.</hi> By the
which will (saith the<note n="t" place="margin">Ibid. vers. 9, 10.</note> Apostle) <hi>we are sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ
once for all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we see it was necessary for the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of this debt, that our Mediator should
be Man: but he that had no more in him than
a Man, could never be able to goe thorow
with so great a worke. For if there should be
found a Man as righteous as <hi>Adam</hi> was at his
first creation, who would be content to suffer
for the offence of others: his suffering possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
might serve for the redemption of one
soule; it could be no sufficient ransome for
those<note n="u" place="margin">Revel. 7. 9.</note> innumerable multitudes that were
to be<note n="x" place="margin">Revel. 5. 9.</note> 
               <hi>redeemed to GOD out of every kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
and tongue, and people, and nation.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
could any Man or Angell be able to hold
out, if a punishment equivalent to the end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
sufferings of all the sinners in the world
should at once be laid upon him. Yea the
very powers of Christ himselfe, upon whom
<note n="y" place="margin">Esay 11. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <hi>the Spirit of might did rest,</hi> were so sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

            <p>
               <note n="c" place="margin">Heb. 10. 12.</note> This man therefore being to offer one sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice

foretold by his Prophet.<note n="m" place="margin">Zach. 13. 7. with Matth. 26. 31.</note> 
               <hi>Awake, O

that is <hi>my fellow, saith the Lord of hosts: smite the

shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered.</hi> The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Israell, we reade, did so value the life of
<hi>David</hi> their King, that they counted him to be
worth<note n="n" place="margin">2 Sam. 18. 3.</note> 
               <hi>ten thousand</hi> of themselves: how shall
we then value the life of<note n="o" place="margin">Matth. 22. 43, 44.</note> 
               <hi>Davids Lord;</hi>
               <note n="p" place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 15. Revel. 19. 16.</note> who
is <hi>the blessed &amp; only Potentate, the King of kings,
and Lord of lords?</hi> It was indeed our nature that
suffered; but he that suffered in that nature,<note n="q" place="margin">Rom. 9 5.</note> 
               <hi>is
over all, God blessed for ever:</hi> and for such a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to have suffered but one houre, was more
than if all other persons had suffered ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
millions of years.</p>
            <p>But put case also, that the life of any other
singular man might be equivalent to all the
lives of whole mankinde: yet the laying down
of that life would not be sufficient to doe the
deed, unlesse he that had power to lay it down,
had power likewise to take it up again. For to
be detained alwayes in that <hi>prison,</hi>
               <note n="r" place="margin">Matth. 5. 26.</note> 
               <hi>from
whence there is no comming out, before the payment
of the uttermost farthing;</hi> is to lie alwaies under
execution, and so to disanull quite the plea of
that full payme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the debt wherein our surety
stood engaged for us. And therefore the Apostle
upon that ground doth rightly conclude; that
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:51763:20"/>
               <note n="s" place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 17.</note> 
               <hi>if Christ be not raised, our faith is vaine, we are
yet in our sinnes;</hi> and consequently, that as he
must be<note n="t" place="margin">Rom. 4. 25.</note> 
               <hi>delivered</hi> to death <hi>for our offences,</hi> so he
must be <hi>raised again for our justification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea, our Saviour himselfe, knowing full
well what he was to undergoe for our sakes,
told us before hand, that the <hi>Comforter</hi> whom
he would send unto us, should<note n="u" place="margin">Ioh. 16. 10.</note> 
               <hi>convince the
world,</hi> that is, fully satisfie the consciences of
the sonnes of men, concerning that<note n="x" place="margin">Dan. 9. 24.</note> everlasting
<hi>righteousnesse</hi> which was to be brought in by
him, upon this very ground: <hi>Because I goe to
my Father, and ye see me no more.</hi> For if he had
broken prison, and made an escape, the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the debt, which as our surety he took
upon himselfe, being not yet satisfied, he
should have been seene here againe: Heaven
would not have held him, more then Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise
did <hi>Adam,</hi> after he had fallen into Gods
debt and danger. But our Saviour raising
himselfe from the dead, presenting himselfe
in Heaven before him unto whom the debt
was owing, and maintaining his standing
there, hath hereby given good proofe, that he
is now a free-man, and hath fully discharged
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:51763:20"/>
that debt of ours for which he stood com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.
And this is the evidence we have to
shew of that <hi>righteousnesse,</hi> whereby we stand
justified in Gods sight: according to that of
the Apostle.<note n="y" place="margin">Rom. 8. 33, 34.</note> 
               <hi>Who shall lay any thing to the
charge of Gods elect? It is God that justifieth:
who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died,
yea rather that is risen again; who is even at the
right hand of God, who also maketh intercession
for us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now although an ordinary man may easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
part with his life; yet doth it not lye in
his power to resume it againe at his own will
and pleasure. But he that must doe the turne
for us, must be able to say as our <hi>IESVS</hi> did.
<note n="z" place="margin">Ioh. 10. 17, 18.</note> 
               <hi>I lay down my life, that I may take it again. No
man taketh it from me, but I lay it downe of my
selfe: I have power to lay it down, and I have power
to take it againe.</hi> and in another place:<note n="a" place="margin">Ioh. 2. 19, 21.</note> 
               <hi>Destroy
this Temple, and in three dayes I will raise it up;</hi>
saith he unto the Jewes, <hi>speaking of the Temple
of his body.</hi> An humane nature then he must
have had, which might be subject to dissoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
but being once dissolved, he could not by
his owne strength (which was the thing here
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:51763:21"/>
necessarily required) raise it up againe; unlesse
he had<note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 1. 4.</note> 
               <hi>declared</hi> himselfe <hi>to be the Son of God
with power, by the resurrection from the dead.</hi> The
<hi>Manhood</hi> could suffer, but not overcome the
sharpnesse of death: the <hi>Godhead</hi> could suffer
nothing, but overcome any thing. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that was both to suffer and to overcome
death for us, must be partaker of both natures:
that<note n="c" place="margin">Pet. 3. 18.</note> 
               <hi>being put to death in the flesh,</hi> he might
be able also to <hi>quicken</hi> himselfe by his owne
<hi>Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now are wee come to that part of
Christs mediation, which concerneth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veiance
of<note n="d" place="margin">Ephes. 1. 14.</note> 
               <hi>the redemption of</hi> this <hi>purchased pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session</hi>
unto the sons of men. A deare purchase
indeed, which was to be redeemed with no
lesse price then the bloud of the Sonne of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but what should the purchase of a stranger
have been to us? or what should we have
beene the better for all this; if we could not
derive our descent from the purchaser, or raise
some good title whereby we might estate our
selves in his purchase? Now this was the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
in former time in Israell, concerning re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demptions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that unto him who was the next
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:51763:21"/>
of kinne belonged the right of being<note n="e" place="margin">Ruth 3. 12. &amp; 4. vers. 1, 3, 4, 7.</note> 
               <hi>Goël,</hi> or
the <hi>Redeemer.</hi> And <hi>Iob</hi> had before that left
this glorious profession of his faith unto the
perpetuall memory of all posterity.<note n="f" place="margin">Iob. 19. 25, 26, 27.</note> 
               <hi>I know
that my Goël</hi> or <hi>Redeemer liveth, and at the last
shall arise upon the dust</hi> (or, <hi>stand upon the earth:)
And after this my skinne is spent; yet in my flesh
shall I see God. Whom I shall see for my selfe, and
mine eyes shall behold, and not another</hi> for me.
Whereby we may easily understand, that his
and our Redeemer was to be the invisible
God, and yet in his assumed flesh made visible
even to the bodily eyes of those whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed.
For if he had not thus assumed our
<hi>flesh,</hi> how should we have been of his bloud,
or claimed any kindred to him? and unlesse the
<hi>Godhead</hi> had by a personall union beene unse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably
conjoyned unto that flesh; how could
he therein have beene accounted our <hi>next</hi> of
kinne?</p>
            <p>For the better clearing of which last rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
we may call to mind that sentence of
the Apostle.<note n="g" place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 47.</note> 
               <hi>The first man is of the earth earthy:
the second man is the Lord from heaven.</hi> Where,
notwithstanding there were many millions
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:51763:22"/>
of men in the world betwixt these two; yet we
see our Redeemer reckoned <hi>the second man.</hi> and
why? but because these two were the only
men who could be accounted the prime foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
from whence all the rest of mankinde
did derive their existence and being. For as all
men in the world by meane descents do draw
their first originall <hi>from the first man:</hi> so in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of a more immediate influence of effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie
and operation do they owe their being
unto the <hi>second man,</hi> as he is <hi>the Lord from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
This is Gods own language unto <hi>Jeremy.</hi>
               <note n="h" place="margin">Jerem. 1. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Before I formed thee in the belly, I knew thee:</hi>

               <hi>Thy hands have made me and fashioned

for us all: <hi>In him we live, and move, and have

that <hi>we are the off-spring</hi> or <hi>generation of God;</hi>
and that <hi>he is not farre from every one of us.</hi> this
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:51763:22"/>
being to be admitted for a most certaine truth
(notwithstanding the opposition of all gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>)
that<note n="*" place="margin">See Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardin de causâ Dei, lib. 1. cap. 3, &amp; 4.</note> God doth more immediately
concurre to the generation and all other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

doth or can doe. And therefore, <hi>if</hi>
               <note n="o" place="margin">Rom. 5. 17.</note> 
               <hi>by one mans
offedce, death raigned by one; much more they
which receive abundance of grace &amp; of the gift of
righteousnes, shall raign in life by one, Jesus Christ,</hi>
considering that this <hi>second</hi> man is not only as
universall a principle of all our beings, as was
that <hi>first,</hi> and so may sustaine the common
person of us all, as well as he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but is a far more
immediate agent in the production thereof:
not, as the <hi>first,</hi> so many generations removed
from us, but more near unto us then our very
next progenitours; and in that regard justly
to be accounted our <hi>next</hi> of kinne, even before
them also.</p>
            <p>Yet is not this sufficient neither: but there
is another kinde of generation required, for
which we must be beholding unto <hi>the second
man, the Lord from heaven;</hi> before we can have
interest in this purchased <hi>Redemption.</hi> For as
the guilt of the <hi>first mans</hi> transgression is deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:51763:23"/>
unto us by the meanes of carnall generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
so must the benefit of the <hi>second mans</hi> obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
be conveyed unto us by spirituall rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.

of our Lord in the wombe of the Virgin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to new mould and fashion every member
of his mysticall body unto his similitude and
likenesse.</p>
            <p>For the further opening of which mystery
(which went beyond the apprehension of
<note n="c" place="margin">Ibid. vers. 4, 9, 10.</note> 
               <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> though <hi>a master of Israel)</hi> we are
to consider; that in every perfect generation,
the creature produced receiveth two things
from him that doth beget it: <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Likenesse.</hi>
A curious limmer draweth his own sonnes
portraiture to the life (as we say) yet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there is no true life in it, but a likenesse
only; he cannot be said to be the begetter of
his picture, as he is of his Son. And some crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:51763:24"/>
there be that are bred out of mudde or
other putrid matter: which although they
have life, yet because they have no correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in likenesse unto the principle from
whence they were derived, are therefore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
to have but an improper and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocall
generation. whereas in the right and
proper course of generation (others being
esteemed but monstrous births that swarve
from that rule) every creature begetteth his
like:</p>
            <q>

            <p>
               <hi>Now touching our spirituall death &amp; life,
these sayings of the Apostle would be thought
upon.</hi>
               <note n="d" place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 14, 15.</note> Wee thus judge, that if one dyed for all,

rose againe.<note n="e" place="margin">Ephes. 2. 4, 5</note> God who is rich in mercy, for his

that if by the obedience and sufferings of

should have beene prepared for the curing

also are to be considered.<note n="h" place="margin">Iohn 5. 26.</note> 
               <hi>As the father hath

               <hi>I am the living bread,
which came downe from heaven; if any man eat of

that I will give; is my flesh, which I will give for
the life of the world.</hi> the substance whereof is
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:51763:25"/>
briefly comprehended in this saying of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle:
<note n="l" place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 45.</note> 
               <hi>The last Adam was made a quickening
spirit.</hi> An <hi>Adam</hi> therefore and perfect Man
must he have been; that his flesh, given for us
upon the Crosse, might be made the conduit
to convey life unto the world: and <hi>a quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
spirit</hi> he could not have been, unlesse he
were <hi>God,</hi> able to make that flesh an effectuall
instrument of life by the operation of his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

               <hi>It
is the Spirit that quickeneth;</hi> without it, <hi>the flesh

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>As for the poynt of similitude and likenesse:
we reade of</hi> Adam, <hi>after his fall, that he</hi>
               <note n="n" place="margin">Gen. 5. 3.</note> beg at
<hi>a son</hi> in his owne liknesse, after his image. <hi>and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally,
as well touching the carnall as the
spirituall generation, our Saviour hath taught
us this lesson.</hi>
               <note n="o" place="margin">Iohn 3. 6.</note> That which is borne of the flesh, is
flesh; and that which is borne of the Spirit, is spirit.
<hi>Whereupon the Apostle maketh this compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
betwixt those who are borne of that first
man, who is of the earth earthy, and of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

               <note n="p" place="margin">1 Cor. 15, 48, 49.</note> As

and as we have borne the image of the earthy,

is able even to subdue all things unto himselfe. <hi>Yet
in the mean time also, such a conformity is
required in us unto that heavenly man, that</hi>
               <note n="r" place="margin">Ibid. ver. 20.</note> our conversation must be in heaven, whence we
look for <hi>this</hi> Saviour: <hi>and that we must</hi>

the necessity of his former employment requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

to be of so high a nature: that
none could possibly by such ligatures knit up
so admirable a body, but he that was God

such a man might be found who should
perform the Law for us, suffer the death that
was due to our offence and overcome it; yea
and whose obedience and sufferings should
be of such valve, that it were <hi>sufficiett</hi> for the

not be <hi>efficient</hi> to make us live by faith, unlesse
that Man had been able to send Gods spirit to
apply the same unto us.</p>
            <p>VVhich as no bare Man or any other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

taught by S.<note n="o" place="margin">Colos. 2. 12. 2. Thes 1. 11.</note> 
               <hi>Paul,</hi> that it is <hi>the operation of

power, wherewith Christ himselfe was <hi>raised
from the dead.</hi> VVhich is the ground of that
prayer of his, that the<note n="p" place="margin">Ephes. 1. 19, 20, &amp;c.</note> eyes of our understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
being enlightened, we might know
<hi>what is the exceeding greatnesse of his power to
ms-ward who beleeve, according to the working of
his mighty power, which he wrought in Christ when
be raised him from the dead, and set him at his own
right hand in the heavenly places, farre above all
principality, and power, and might, and every
Name that is named not only in this world but also
in that to come: and hath put all things under his

            </p>
            <p>Yet was it fit also, that the <hi>Head</hi> should be

               <hi>He that eateth my flesh,

declaring thereby, <hi>first,</hi> that by this mysticall
and supernaturall union we are as truly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
with him, as the meat and drink we

<hi>secondly,</hi> that this conjunction is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately

that the<note n="t" place="margin">Revel. 5 12. &amp; 13. 18.</note>

            <p>Upon this ground it is, that the Apostle

way which he hath consecrated for us, through
the vaile, that is to say, his flesh.</hi> That as in the
Tabernacle, there was no passing from the
Holy to the most Holy place, but by the vaile:
so now there is no passage to be looked for
from the Church Militant to the Church Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant,

               <hi>Hereafter you shall see heaven

well collect, that the only meanes whereby
God standing above, and his Israel lying here

ladder whereby Heaven may be scaled by us,
is the <hi>Son of man.</hi> The type of whose flesh, <hi>the

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now</hi> Moses, <hi>we know, had a singular

mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not in dark

let me see this great fire any more, that I dye not.
And the Lord said unto me, They have well spoken,
that which they have spoken. I will raise them up a
Prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee,
and will put my words into his mouth, and he shall
speak unto them all that I shall command him. And
it shall come to passe, that whosoever will not hearken
unto my words, which he shall speak in my name,
I will require it of him.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Prophet</hi> therefore must be a man raised

with open face, beholding as in a glasse the glory of

            </p>
            <p>And this is daily effected by the power of
the ministery of the Gospell, instituted by the
authority, and seconded by the power, of this
our great Prophet: whose transcendent excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
beyond <hi>Moses</hi> (unto whom, in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of that function, he was otherwise
likened is thus set forth by the Apostle.<note n="u" place="margin">Heb. 3. 3, 4, 5, 6.</note> He
is <hi>counted worthy of more glory then Moses, in as
much as he who hath builded the house hath more
honour then the house. For every house is builded
by some one: but he that built all things is God. And
Moses verily was faithfull in all his house, as a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
for a testimony of those things which were to
be spoken after: but Christ as the Son, over his owne
house.</hi>
               <note n="x" place="margin">1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Tim. 3. 15.</note> This house of God is no other then

               <hi>the Church of the living God:</hi> whereof as he is the
only <hi>Lord,</hi> so is he properly the only <hi>Builder.</hi>
Christ therefore being both the <hi>Lord</hi> and the<note n="y" place="margin">Mat. 16. 18.</note>
               <hi>Builder</hi> of his Church, must be God as well as
Man: which is the cause, why we finde all
the severall mansions of this<note n="z" place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 20.</note> 
               <hi>great house</hi> to
carry the title indifferently of<note n="a" place="margin">1. Cor. 11. 16.</note>

            <p>
               <hi>True it is, that there are other ministeriall</hi>
builders, <hi>whom Christ employed in that ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice:
this being not the least of those gifts
which he bestowed upon men at his trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant
Ascension into heaven, that</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">Eph. 4. 11, 12.</note> 
               <hi>he gave
not only ordinary</hi> Pastours <hi>and</hi> Teachers, <hi>but</hi>
Apostles <hi>likewise, and</hi> Prophets, <hi>&amp;</hi> Evangelists;
<hi>for the</hi> perfecting of the Saints, for the worke of
the ministery, for the edifying of the body of Christ.
<hi>Which what great power it required, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
doth fully expresse in passing the grant of
this high Commission unto his Apostles.</hi>
               <note n="d" place="margin">Mat. 28. 18, 19, 20.</note> All
power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go
ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them
in the name of the Father, and of the Son, &amp; of the
holy Ghost; teaching them to observe all things
whatsoever I have commanded you: and lo, I am

               <hi>S.</hi> Paul <hi>professeth of himself, that he</hi>
               <note n="e" place="margin">1. Cor. 15. 10.</note> labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
more abundantly then all <hi>the rest of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles:</hi>
yet not I, <hi>saith he,</hi> but the grace of God
which was with me. <hi>And therefore although</hi>
               <note n="f" place="margin">1. Cor. 3. 9, 10.</note> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that grace of God which was given unto
him, <hi>he denieth not but that,</hi> as a wise master<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>builder,
he had laid the foundation; <hi>yet he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth
that they upon whom he had
wrought, were</hi> Gods building <hi>as well as</hi> Gods

               <note n="g" place="margin">Ibid. vers. 5, 6, 7.</note> 
               <hi>he,</hi> is Paul, and who is
Apollo, but ministers by whom you beleeved, even
as the Lord gave to every man? I have planted,
Apollo watered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but God gave the increase. So then
neither is he that planteth anything, neither he that
watereth: but God that giveth the increase.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Two things therefore we finde in our great</hi>
Prophet, <hi>which do far exceed the ability of any
bare Man; and so do difference him from all
the</hi>
               <note n="h" place="margin">Luk. 1. 70.</note> holy Prophets, which have beene since the
world began. <hi>For</hi> first <hi>we are taught; that</hi>
               <note n="i" place="margin">Matt. 11. 27.</note> no
man knoweth the Father, save the Son, and hee to
whomsoever the Son will reveale him: <hi>and that</hi>
               <note n="k" place="margin">Iohn 1. 18.</note> no man hath seen God at anytime; <hi>but</hi> the only
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:51763:32"/>
begotten Son, which is in the bosome of the Father,
he hath declared him. <hi>Being in his</hi> bosome, <hi>he is
become conscious of his secrets, and so out of
his own immediate knowledge enabled to
discover the whole will of his Father unto us.
whereas all other Prophets and Apostles re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
their revelations at the second hand, and
according to the grace given unto them by
the Spirit of Christ. Witnesse that place of S.</hi>
Peter <hi>for the Prophets:</hi>
               <note n="l" place="margin">1. Pet. 1. 10, 11.</note> Of which salvation
the Prophets have enquired and searched diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
who prophesied of the grace that should come
unto you; searching what or what manner of time
<hi>THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST WHICH
WAS IN THEM</hi> did signifie, when it testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
before hand the sufferings of Christ and the
glory that should follow. <hi>and for the Apostles,
those heavenly words which our Saviour
himselfe uttered unto them, whilst he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them.</hi>
               <note n="m" place="margin">Iohn. 16. 13, 14, 15.</note> When the Spirit of truth is come,
he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak
of himselfe, but whatsoever he shall heare, that shall
he speake; and he will shew you things to come. He
shall glorifie me: for he shall receive of mine, &amp; shew
it unto you. All things that the Father hath, are
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:51763:32"/>
mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine,
and shall shew it unto you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> all other Prophets and Apostles
can do more (as hath been said) but plant
and water; only <hi>God</hi> can give the increase<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they
may teach indeed and baptize; but unlesse
Christ were with them by the powerfull pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of his Spirit, they would not be able to
save one soule by that ministery of theirs. We,
<note n="n" place="margin">1. Pet. 2. 5.</note> 
               <hi>as lively stones, are built up a spirituall house:</hi>
but,<note n="o" place="margin">Psal. 127. 1.</note> 
               <hi>except the Lord doe build this house, they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
in vaine that build it.</hi> For who is able to
breath the spirit of life into those dead stones,
but he, of whom it is written?<note n="p" place="margin">Iohn 5. 25.</note> 
               <hi>The hour is
comming, and now is, when the dead shall heare the
voyce of the Son of God; and they that hear it, shall
live.</hi> and again:<note n="q" place="margin">Ephes. 5. 14.</note> 
               <hi>Awake thou that sleepest, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise
from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.</hi>
Who can awake us out of this dead sleep, and
give light unto these blinde eyes of ours; but the
Lord our God, unto whom we pray, that he
would<note n="r" place="margin">Psal. 13. 3.</note> 
               <hi>lighten our eyes, least we sleep</hi> the sleep <hi>of
death?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as a blinde man is not able to conceive
the distinction of colours, although the skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullest
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:51763:33"/>
man alive should use all the art he had
to teach him; because he wanteth the sense
whereby that object is discernable: so<note n="s" place="margin">1. Cor. 2. 14.</note> 
               <hi>the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
man perceiveth not the things of the Spirit
of God (for they are foolishnesse unto him;) neither
can he know</hi> them, <hi>because they are spiritually dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.</hi>
VVhereupon the Apostle concludeth,
concerning himselfe and all his fellow-labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers;
that<note n="t" place="margin">2. Cor. 4. 6, 7.</note> 
               <hi>God who commanded the light to shine
out of darknesse, hath shined in our hearts,</hi> to give
<hi>the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, in
the face of Iesus Christ: but we have this treasure
in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power
may be of God, and not of us.</hi> Our Mediatour
therefore (who must<note n="u" place="margin">Heb. 7. 25.</note> 
               <hi>be able to save them to
the uttermost that come unto God by him)</hi> may
not want the <hi>excellency of the power,</hi> whereby
he may make us capable of this high know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the things of God, propounded unto
us by the ministery of his servants: and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
in this respect also, must be <hi>God,</hi> as
well as <hi>Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>There remaineth the</hi> Kingdome <hi>of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer:
described thus by the Prophet Esay.</hi>
               <note n="x" place="margin">Esay. 9. 7.</note> Of the increase of his government and peace
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:51763:33"/>
               <hi>there shall be</hi> no end, upon the throne of David

<hi>one</hi> like the Son of man came with the clouds of
