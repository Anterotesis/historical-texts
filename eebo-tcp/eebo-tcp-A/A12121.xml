            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

And bicause longe ago, I was well acquaynted wyth them, when I red them to other in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Latin, and that they holpe me verye muche in the exposicion of good authoures, I was so muche the more ready to make them speak English: partli, to renew the pleasure of mine old studies, and partelye to satys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy your request.</p>

No ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned nacion hath there bene but y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> learned in it haue written of schemes &amp; fygures, which thei wold not haue don, except thei had perceyued the valewe. Wherfore after theyr example obtaynyng a lytle lesure, I red ouer sundrye treatises, as wel of those which wrot long ago, as of others now in our daies: fyndynge amonge them some to haue wrytten ouer brieflye, some confuselye, and falselye some.<note place="margin">Mosellane</note> Mosellane hathe in hys tables shewed a fewe fygures of grammer, and so hathe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded them together, that his

that lyst to reade them in oure tongue, I haue taken a lytle payne, more thorowelye to try the definicions, to apply the ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>amples more aptly, &amp; to make things defused more plaine, as in dede it shal ryght wel apere to the dylygente. I haue not translated them orderly out of anye one author, but runninge as I sayde thorowe many, and vsyng myne owne iudgement, haue broughte them into this body as you se, and set them in so playne an order, that redelye maye be founde the figure, and the vse wherevnto it serueth. Thoughe vnto greate wittes occupyed wyth weightye mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, they do not greatelye per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne, yet to such as perchau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce shal not haue perfecte instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toures,
<pb facs="tcp:11456:7"/>
they may be commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to helpe them selues for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> better vnderstandynge of such good authors as they reade.

The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon scholemasters be wont in readynge, to saye vnto their scholers: <hi>Hic est figura</hi>: and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyme to axe them, <hi>Per quam figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram</hi>? But what profit is herein if they go no further? In spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge and wrytynge nothyng is more folyshe than to affecte or fondly to laboure to speake darkelye for the nonce, sithe the
<pb facs="tcp:11456:7"/>
proper vse of speach is to vtter the meaning of our mynd with as playne wordes as maye be.

As it is therefore a greate euyll to accustume thy selfe to euyl, so to vse thy selfe to small good thynges is a greate good. And that tender age is so muche the more apte to learne these thyngs, because of it selfe it is plyaunt vnto all fashions, because it is not yet occupyed wyth vyce, and is glad to folowe, if you shewe it to do any thinge.
