         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOV may well wonder to be surprized with a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
from me, which is first exposed unto publick
view, together with a <hi>Sermon</hi> out of date. The
acceptance whereof from your Candour, I had no reason to
doubt howsoever: but rather how it may be entertained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad;
since there were no end of printing, if every Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
that hath been preached in an honourable Audience,
were to be divulged. Nor yet did I intend to have done
this, having kept it above a twelvemonth by me, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
such a thought till now. If my Reader will vouchsafe
to know the reasons of it, it was preached at your request,
as some part of a Sundayes entertainment, belonging to the
Reverend <hi>Judges,</hi> who were treated otherwise by you, with
great Magnificence. If it pleased in the heaing (being but
<hi>dense</hi> of matter) why may it not be more profitable in the
reading, and never out of season? we have heretofore been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up in <hi>comparing spiritual things with spiritual,</hi> but
since through a <hi>surquedry</hi> of <hi>new models</hi> (which did not
answer expectation) men have come to take offence at <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:37837:3"/>
it self, in whatsoever dresse she doth appear: so that
we have been reduced to compare even <hi>natural</hi> things with
<hi>spiritual;</hi> and by this discourse (I trust) it will appear,
that the later hath infinitely the more advantages. What
others have written lately to the like effect ought not to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
me: for the better cause requireth <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> evidence;
and number it self is not despised in the case: besides that
a <hi>new form</hi> is like cloathing of the <hi>first matter</hi> with a <hi>new
existence.</hi> Which is all the <hi>apology</hi> that I need to make
unto the <hi>publick,</hi> more then others that have gone before;
especially confessing, that <hi>private</hi> reasons joined with it,
did over-poise me.</p>
            <p>Such as these: you were lately my <hi>Mecoenas,</hi> and your
brave house, and Family my <hi>Municipium,</hi> wherein I did
enjoy much liberty, and priviledge. You were also a part
of my late charge, which I was forced to leave more abrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
then I intended, and so, there remaineth to me now no
other way of <hi>preaching</hi> to you, besides this. So that I
send it as a kind of token to you first, and by you to the rest,
to make up some part of my <hi>Apology;</hi> and to return to
you with such a foot as I had left, to set forward (being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed
with the Seas) such an one as is shod with the wings of
<hi>Mercury,</hi> of which we use to make our pens. In fine, it
is almost the only way, that men of our <hi>condition</hi> have to
testifie their gratitude unto Persons of your <hi>Quality</hi> (to
coin somewhat that may bear the superscription of your
names) which lies the more upon me, since your respects
have so often followed me hither: which seldome happens
when <hi>interest,</hi> and <hi>Relation</hi> cease. Let this therefore pass
by your hand, and it will adde more to the great <hi>cumble</hi> of
favours, wherein you have still taken pleasure to oblige,</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>Prov. 8. 12.</bibl>
               <q>I Wisdome dwell with Prudence—</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THis is gracious condescension of <hi>Wisdom</hi> (by
which name all the World imagines an high
<hi>Soverain,</hi> or a kind of <hi>Deity</hi> to be intended) to
tell us <hi>where she dwelleth.</hi> Every one might think, that
he knew before; yet all are in the quest still, and few
do find it, because she dwells with <hi>Prudence,</hi> A Lady
that doth often change her seats, and delight her self in
labyrinths, which are in-accessible, without a certain
<hi>clue.</hi> But since <hi>Wisdom</hi> seeme to be (as it were) at board
with <hi>Prudence,</hi> whether is the greater? which of these
is the <hi>Dowager,</hi> and which the <hi>Daughter?</hi> might it not as
well have been said, <hi>I prudence dwell with wisdom,</hi> as <hi>I wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
dwell with prudence?</hi> if the King say, I dwell in
my <hi>Court:</hi> and the <hi>Court</hi> say, <hi>I am wheresoever the King
is;</hi> which is the readiest enquiry to bring us into the
presence of the <hi>Royal Majesty?</hi> so when wisdom tells us,
that she dwells with prudence, and an imprudent man
knows not where that is, what is he the <hi>wiser</hi> for this
direction?</p>
            <p>The truth is, it is not fit, that the man which want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
wisdom, should find it without some certain travel:
for,<note place="margin">Chap. 2. 4.</note> 
               <hi>she is to be sought for as Silver, and searched for as
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:37837:4"/>
hidden treasures.</hi> Nay, to be concealed too, after find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
as the Merchant did by the <hi>rich pearl,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Math. 13. 45.</note> 
               <hi>found in the
midst of a Field,</hi> till he could purchase all together; least
another man should come between him, and his prize.</p>
            <p>What shall we do? shall we preserve the state of <hi>wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
any longer? or put the <hi>clue</hi> immediately into your
hands, that we may all proceed together, to wait at
the gates of wisdom? we are in hast; let me loose no
time to do it!</p>
            <p>Wisdom is the same, that we call <hi>Religion,</hi> the way of
happiness here, and hereafter; and she dwells with
Prudence, that is, in the breasts of such as will obey her.
For,<note place="margin">Job 28. 28.</note> 
               <hi>unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that
is wisdom, and to depart from evil, that is understanding,</hi>
or a right Prudence. In Philosophy, Wisdom is the
knowledge of choice things, and Prudence is a practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
disposition of applying so much of it unto use, as
may do a man good, when the case requireth. This
maketh men to enlarge their studies; that if it be possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
they may not be to seek in any case to know, when
they should be ready to do. So though wisdom be the
greater,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>?</note> yet Prudence entertains her, to her own profit,
and is never able to exhaust her treasures. What availeth
knowledge, if a man have not a present mind to do him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
good by it?</p>
            <p>So likewise in Divinity, wisdom is the knowledge of
the Word of God, which is unsearchable: and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
is a right obedience to it, which hath no bounds,
nor limits. Let us therefore measure our steps from
hence, from one degree to another; and when we
come near enough to be informed; no doubt, but we
may find our selves to be arrived unto some attainment
higher, then to what the world doth call its own wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
or its own pretended vertues whatsoever. And
the first hint to be observ'd is this.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:37837:4"/>
               <hi>Point.</hi> 1. That <hi>Religion</hi> is no carnal <hi>Policy,</hi> or wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
but Wisdom of God himself.</p>
            <p>Distinguish of <hi>Religion</hi> natural, or Christian: it
holds in either of them. Be it true or degenerous, so
much as there is of <hi>Religion</hi> in the breasts of men, it is
of God and not of men, and it is the first Wisdom in
the World.</p>
            <p>Let us put this first principle out of doubt, because it
has been questioned, whether there be any <hi>religion</hi> at
all by nature, or whether that which is, hath entred
meerly thorough Art, and Policy, the wiser taking
advantage of the ignorance; and the stronger of the
fears of the simpler sort, for ends of their own. Let
me pitch my banner here a little, while I labour to
reduce this skonce, which it is not safe to leave behind
me.</p>
            <p>I say then, that there are certain common Principles,
or notions of <hi>religion,</hi> imprinted by nature (which is
the immediate work, or <hi>protoplasm</hi> of the Divine wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and power) in the hearts of all men indelebly.
Which notions, though possibly they may be tainted
at the very spring-head, by idolatrous, or erroneous
education; yet so much as there is of <hi>religion,</hi> to be
discerned thorough these, it is of God, that did at first
implant it, and ever since maintain it, in the hearts of
men; that he himself might be justifyed; and such as
obey it not, may be judged by it, and left without
excuse. So that, this must needs be the Wisdom of
God in men, and no humane policy.</p>
            <p>For else,<note place="margin">Primus in orbe deos secit ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor.</note> whereas it hath been said, that fear at first,
brought in all <hi>religion,</hi> it might have been shewed by
such, as have written <hi>de primis rerum inventoribus,</hi> of
the Authors, and beginnings of all Arts, and Sciences;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:37837:5"/>
when <hi>religion</hi> also had its first beginning. But this they
could not do, though they could tell when <hi>Saturn, Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
and the rest of their greater Deities began to be
worshipped: an argument, that worship, or <hi>religion</hi>
was before Idolatry.</p>
            <p>Much less, can they tell when such fear began, as
they conceive to have been the cause of <hi>religion:</hi> as sure
an argument, that it had no beginning, but in that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which God created at the first, after his own
image. Of this <hi>Moses</hi> alone hath given us the right

been imposed upon in this kind; certainly, some of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:37837:5"/>
the Philosophers, who had searched into Nature, and
the Policies of States, could easily have discovered this
imposture; and would have adventured to atchieve so
great a glory, as to have redeemed their own sects, &amp; fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
from the muffler of the common people: yet, we
meet with none so bold, as to deny a Deity, besides
one <hi>Diagoras,</hi> who could not make a Sect; but affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
rather (like that mad-fellow, who burnt the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Diana,</hi> only that he might be talked of, after he
was dead, whatsoever he suffered for it,) to be infamous
for ever, among the Heathen themselves, then to dye
in his obscurity. And one <hi>Epicurus</hi> only, denyed a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
providence; making a Sect in other <hi>Tenents,</hi> but
never able to prevail with any of them, not to pray in
a storm,<note place="margin">Plut. adv. epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur.</note> or tempest, which <hi>Plutarch</hi> doth retort upon
them. But rather, as the Poet did observe. <hi>Hi sunt
qui trepidant, quos omnia sulgura terrent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now,<note place="margin">Ut passim est videre in Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretio.</note> some of these have looked upon <hi>religion,</hi> as a
great trouble unto States, and private persons; and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
to set men free from the apprehensions of it:
had it been but of Art, or humane Wisdom, what
should hinder but they might have done it, one time or
another, since the lower Sects, as the humour of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective

the greater? but it could never go this way.</p>
            <p>If it be suggested, that the Philosophers were deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

by superstitious rites, using them only as an
hank upon the people; and dissembling things that
were not true; which they themselves neither feared,
nor beleived. It may be so: doth it hence follow, that
<hi>religion</hi> is but a stalking horse, or stratagem of Policy?
nay, it rather followeth, that if the sense of some <hi>religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
had not been before, most strongly grounded in the
minds of the generality of men, there could have been
no policy (of which the <hi>Atheist</hi> would seem to be more
fond then any other) in laying that upon them, which
either would not take, or could not hold. It had been
in vain to go about to establish a <hi>religion,</hi> if there had
not been such a disposition in the people before, as we
have hinted, Certainly, <hi>Numa</hi> could not infuse such a
disposition into the minds of men, that were born before
him (many of which he governed) but had he brought
the people to a form, for a time; it had dyed with him:
or, when that <hi>form</hi> of <hi>policy</hi> had ceased, either that form
of <hi>religion,</hi> or all <hi>religion,</hi> if it had been but a meer im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posture,
had ceased with it.</p>
            <p>In the issue it remains, that as men were never of any
other mind, but that by force, or choice, they must
have some <hi>religion;</hi> so, they are never like to have any
other power, or inclination, for the future: let the
Atheist try his art, or power to the utmost! but, though
more may be made of <hi>religion,</hi> then there should; yet
there is so much of it written in humane nature; that as
the statuary engraved his own name in his work, so
that no one could efface it, without the demollishing
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:37837:6"/>
of the whole; so no humane wit, or malice, can oblite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<hi>religion</hi> out of humane nature, without the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of humanity together with it, because it is of an
higher impress; even the devise, and the motto of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
God in all his reasonable Creatures. To come to the
Christian <hi>religion</hi> in particular. In this indeed was the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold
wisdom of God made manifest above the rest. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Gentiles there were as many Gods, as Nations,
as many Idols as there were Hills, and Vallies. And they
worshipped one anothers Gods, when they came into
one anothers Country (even as some of our gentile Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant-travellers
make no matter, to bow to every
Popish <hi>Relique</hi> where they passe) there was no enmity
betwixt Idolaters upon the account of their <hi>religions</hi>
(only all abhorred the true worshippers) but rather,
<hi>Athens</hi> sent to <hi>Egypt</hi> to learn what they could of their
absurd Rites,<note place="margin">Livy.</note> and Mysteries: and the great Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
commented upon their <hi>hieroglyphicks</hi> or <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>acred
<hi>sphinges;</hi> even as wise men make morals upon some foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
fable. <hi>Rome</hi> again translated her laws, and rites
from <hi>Athens</hi> first, and then from other places, till the
City began to be so full of <hi>religions,</hi> that the Senate was
sain to take order against admitting more. But when
the Christian <hi>religion</hi> come to be set on foot, it soon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
all to one.</p>
            <p>That you may perceive the wisdome, and the power
of God therein, and have the better prospect into won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:
take account in what posture the world stood,
when the Gospel first began to be divulged.</p>
            <p>Our Lord himself, the Son of a Carpenter (as he was
reputed) preached three years; and then was so disgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by the crosse, and the malice of his own Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
that one would have thought, there had been an
end of him, and of all his new Doctrine; yet he left
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:37837:7"/>
twelve Fishermen behind him to uphold it, for which
they were to dye too. The Jews hated these, beyond
any patience: the <hi>Gentiles</hi> had them at first, in derision,
after in suspicion. Whither should they go? or what
should they do? must they perswade the <hi>Jews</hi> against
the Law of <hi>Moses?</hi> this they must do. Must they perswade
the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to abandon their Idolatry? the Gods which
they feared, and lov'd; the magnificence of sumptuous
shews, and Temples, and such feastings as they cheifly
used after sacrifice and oblations? this they must do.
A likely matter to take effect, or to take the world by so
much as by the little finger.</p>
            <p>Could these, or any of their followers raise an army?
it is hard to imagine out of what quarters: but what
if they could? had they then been but once beaten
(<hi>as Gamaliel</hi> did observe) they had been for ever
quelled:<note place="margin">Act. 5. 37.</note> or, if they had prevailed, and attained to an
Empire (as some have arose from small beginnings) yet
their fate might have been like that of all before, and
since. Which did you ever read of, that hath lasted
1600 years with advantage, and rooted it self so invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
in <hi>Asia, Europe, Africa,</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> still proceeding
conquering, and to conquer? which besides, did ever
possesse any one of these; and, next consider how and
what way Christianity is bound to subdue them all.</p>
            <p>By Faith, and patience; by prayers, and interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
for all men:<note place="margin">Rev. 13. 10.</note> 
               <hi>especially for Kings and all that were

               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 1. 2.</note> 
               <hi>and peaceable life in all Godliness, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty.</hi>
O ridiculous Wisdom in the eye of carnal poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;
and yet it over-swayed all!</p>
            <p>In above 300 years we read of no insurrection of
theirs against oppression, though they swarmed in all
Provinces of the Empire long before that: the <hi>Roman</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:37837:7"/>
legions were full of <hi>Christian</hi> Soldiers, and never muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied;
though<note n="*" place="margin">He began his reign A. D. 310</note> 
               <hi>Constantine</hi> came with the greater fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to the Imperial Crown, because he was a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,</hi>
and so many of his <hi>Veterans</hi> of the same profession.</p>
            <p>So that Prophecy was accomplished: <hi>Not by might,</hi>
or army,<note place="margin">Zech. 4. 6.</note> (as the <hi>Turkish</hi> Empire, and <hi>religion) but by my
Spirit, Saith the Lord. Which turned the heart of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

               <note place="margin">Mal. 4. 6.</note> 
               <hi>and the heart of the Children to the

               <hi>prepared for the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it may be, that which was wanting in an army
might be supplyed by policy?</p>
            <p>One might think so indeed, if the greater number of
the wise, and potent men of the world had taken this
way. But St. <hi>Paul</hi> (who had his hand from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in this work, and had the best experience of it) wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth
after this manner. <hi>The foolishness of God is wiser
then men:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 25.</note> 
               <hi>for ye see your calling, Brethren, how that not
many wise men after the Flesh; not many mighty, not many
noble are called,</hi> though some of all these.</p>
            <p>Instead of aids therefore, put into the contrary ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance;
that all the might, and <hi>policy</hi> of the world; all
that enraged <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Idolaters</hi> could do, was set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it. And yet, (by a new example) men delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to dye for <hi>religion,</hi> which was never known before,
at least, amongst the <hi>Gentiles:</hi> and out of their blood (as
out of the Teeth that <hi>Cadmus</hi> sowed) an innumerable
power of supplies rose out of the earth. Of
which it was foretold,<note place="margin">Rev. 12. 16.</note> that it should befriend <hi>the Woman,
and help her, swallowing up that stood, which the dragon
cast out of his mouth to drown her.</hi> Like <hi>Hydra's</hi> heads
cut off one, and more started up in the stead of it: per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
wrought nothing but encrease, as mowing
maketh the grasse to grow. It wrought nothing else
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:37837:8"/>
but a sweeter smell, and savour to <hi>Christianity:</hi> even as
when a roller is driven o're a walk of Camomil, what
could it avail to hinder?</p>
            <p>I have said but little yet (though it tend to admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
let the unbeliever mark, and be astonished at that,
which follows.</p>
            <p>Said not the proud <hi>Assyrian</hi> to the servants of King
<hi>Hezekiah;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Kings 18. 33.</note> 
               <hi>Have any of the Gods of the Nations delivered
at all his Land</hi> (for every Nation then made choice of
some especial <hi>Numen</hi> to be their Protector) <hi>out of the
hand of the King of</hi> Assyria: <hi>where are the Gods of</hi> Hamath
<hi>and of</hi> Arphad? <hi>where are the Gods of</hi> Sepharvaim? but
now, where are the Gods of <hi>Assyria</hi> it self? We need such
a learned Antiquary as your <hi>Selden,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Libro de Djs Syris.</note> to let us know
their names. Where are the Gods that <hi>Greece,</hi> and
<hi>Rome</hi> adored; why is there never a Temple (at the
least) of <hi>Jupiter's</hi> remaining, who was styled the Father
of Gods, and men? what ailed thee, O thou dreadful
Oracle at <hi>Delphos,</hi> that thou madest such pitiful excuses
(as thou didst) and then retired'st with the rest (who
made none) to everlasting silence,<note place="margin">Plut. de orac.</note> to deceive the world
no more? it was not because ye were dis-obliged by the
Heathen all the world over, at the same time. It was
because ye could not choose: it was not because there
was an earthly power to depresse ye; but another spirit,
which ye were not able to with-stand. Rise again, if
ye are able, to answer these reproaches! that part of the
world is forced to bow with you, which is not ready to
adore!</p>
            <p>More closely to the case in hand still: how came the
despised Land of <hi>Jewry</hi> to send a <hi>Law</hi> forth to all the
world, and yet themselves to be dissipated so, as never
people were and this has lasted above these 1600 years,
wherein (however) as there is not a <hi>Roman</hi> left, so there
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:37837:8"/>
is not a <hi>Jew</hi> lost; but there is a mark upon them. A
mighty people, if they could be gathered: but they are
cast far back for that,<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 25.</note> for it is not like to be, <hi>till the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Gentiles is come in.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is now but one God, and where <hi>Mahomet</hi> is
professed, <hi>Christ</hi> is also acknowledged to have been a
great Prophet before Him: and they have the history
of the Gospel, upon which they raise their damned Idol,
which is confounding evidence against these <hi>Apostates</hi>
from the Faith; and together with it, confounders of
that civility, that was in the world before.</p>
            <p>This one God is worshipped according to the <hi>Law,</hi>
which he gave from the beginning of the world, which
no false <hi>religion</hi> can pretend to in the least. Before,
there was no enmity betwixt nations on the account of
<hi>religion:</hi> but now, it is the greatest point, and ground
of amity,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> or enmity. As it was said in <hi>Genesis, I will put
enmity between thy Seed, and between her Seed.</hi> So more
expressely in the Gospel, our Lord himself doth testifye,
saying, <hi>I came not to send Peace upon the Earth, but a
Sword,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 10. 34.</note> and to set men at variance upon this account of
<hi>religion</hi> only. Which many <hi>States-men,</hi> having well
observed, would fain have taken another order with
<hi>religion,</hi> if they had been able; but it was too far
above them. <hi>Christianity</hi> hath abolished <hi>Idolatry, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy,
Policy,</hi> and brought in other orders, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments
among the Nations, then the <hi>wise-men</hi> of the
world allowed. All which doth shew, and prove;
that the Christian <hi>religion</hi> is the <hi>wisdom</hi> of God above
all; and not of man: that as it was rais'd at first, so it
doth still subsist by miracles, and therefore is invincible;
so that <hi>the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 16. 18.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But, since we have said so much concerning this <hi>wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
viz.</hi> that it hath abolished, not <hi>Idolatry</hi> only,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:37837:9"/>
but <hi>Philosophy;</hi> not the <hi>Jewish</hi> Law alone, but the <hi>civil;</hi>
not established <hi>governments,</hi> but subverted them not
brought in <hi>peace</hi> but <hi>war,</hi> it is high time, that we take
some caution concerning <hi>prudence,</hi> with which this
<hi>wisdom</hi> is said to dwell; least she be misprised for a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyer
of the house, wherein she liveth; since such
things as these cannot consist with <hi>prudence.</hi> Let us
therefore passe to the second, and the last point, to shew.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Point.</hi> 2. That this <hi>wisdom</hi> dwells with <hi>prudence,</hi> and
is the best <hi>policy:</hi> for so saith the context, <hi>and find out
the knowledge of witty inventions,</hi> that is, the choice ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedients
of felicity for all estates.</p>
            <p>What though the <hi>Christian religion</hi> hath beaten down
the galleries of the <hi>Cynicks, Stoicks, Skepticks, Epicure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
and all other <hi>heresies</hi> of true <hi>Philosophy,</hi> as well as
the Altars of the Idols? yet, it hath no more abolished
<hi>Philosophy,</hi> rightly so called, then it hath <hi>religion.</hi> But
rather, since the spreading of <hi>Christianity, multi transie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt,
&amp; aucta est scientia.</hi> Many have travelled to
augment learning, and to redeem <hi>Philosophy</hi> from all the
errours, wherein it was before entangled.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorteth the <hi>Colossians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Col. 2. 8.</note> to <hi>beware least any
man should spoil them through Philosophy, and vain deceit,
after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ:</hi> for
though all the Sects called themselves the <hi>Philosophers,</hi>
and theirs the <hi>Philosophy;</hi> even as our Sects in <hi>religion</hi>
do imitate the ancient usurpation; yet it is plain, that
the Apostle cautions them against no other <hi>Philosophy,</hi>
but such as is <hi>vain deceit,</hi> and opposite unto the simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Faith of <hi>Christ;</hi> which no real knowledge is.</p>
            <p>Again, he admonisheth them against <hi>a shew of wisdom
in will worship,</hi>
               <note place="margin">verse 22.</note> 
               <hi>and humility, and neglecting of the body.</hi>
It is but the <hi>shew of wisdom,</hi> which really is not such,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:37837:9"/>
that he cautions them against; especially such a shew,
as ministred before to heathen superstition, and being
brought into the <hi>Christian Church,</hi> might tend to corrupt
it with the old leaven, <hi>the rudiments of the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time, he himself disputed with the
Stoicks, and Epicureans, and other <hi>Philosophers,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their own Notions, which he had learned
at the feet of <hi>Gamaliel;</hi> being as conversant in the
Learning of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> as <hi>Moses</hi> had been before in
that of the <hi>Egyptians.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 7. 22.</note> The rest of the Apostles were
endued from above with tongues, and all knowledge;
so that they were reputed at the first, amongst the
<hi>Gentiles,</hi> as a new sect of <hi>Philosophers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the next succession, the prime Fathers of the
Church were of the converted <hi>Rhetors,</hi> and <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,</hi>
as <hi>Ignatius, Clemens, Irenaeus, Justin Martyr,
Athenagoras, Tertullian, Origen, Lactantius,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
others. What hath since been added to the maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zine
of learning, I may safely leave to be demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the <hi>ROYAL SOCIETY.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What if the Christian <hi>religion</hi> hath almost antiqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the <hi>Civil Law</hi> in divers Countries? it is only so far
as it hath abolish't slavery, and brought in <hi>Christian</hi>
liberty, even in civil things, wheresoever a <hi>Christian</hi>
Government has been established. Neither has it sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
any other, but to bring in better, and a sweeter
order. As may appear at this day, by comparing
<hi>Christendome,</hi> howsoever corrupted, with the <hi>Turkish,</hi>
or <hi>Pagan</hi> dominations. Wheresoever the <hi>Christian</hi>
yoke lyeth not on Princes, and their Governments,
they are barbarous, and cruel: whereas in <hi>Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:37837:10"/>
(especially amongst the Princes, and the States of
the Reformation) there is more property, immunity,
and priviledge to the lower states: and in case of tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe,
there are more pardons, and impunities: in case
of punishment, more mercy, Malefactors are chastised,
or put to death with the lesse severity, and horrour;
and the poor are not exposed.</p>
            <p>In a word; though by accident, <hi>Christianity</hi> draw
the hatred of the un-beleiving world, as being oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to the power of Satan,<note place="margin">Eph. 2. 2.</note> 
               <hi>who worketh in the children
of disobedience:</hi> yet, it hath made even wars them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
more gentle, then they were before, both in
sieges, and in battels, sparing the effusion of blood
(which the<note n="*" place="margin">Qui praemia, &amp; triumphos decrevere, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merum hosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um occisorum.</note> 
               <hi>Romans</hi> glorified in) affording ransom,
enslaving none of the <hi>Christian</hi> profession. And where
they trespasse (possibly) upon <hi>Christian</hi> tenderness in
enslaving <hi>Turkes,</hi> or <hi>Infidels;</hi> they seem to make some
amends by better usage of them, then our own poor
Captives do expect in <hi>Barbary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Content (may some one say) we are for <hi>religion,</hi> and
for the <hi>Christian</hi> too above all; but not with such <hi>hankes</hi>
as are put upon us, under this pretence, to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
of civil life; and thefore, contrary unto common
prudence.</p>
            <p>And first, because it is an hindrance to preferment,
to be held to such rules as may be given us:<note place="margin">Si violandum est jus, regnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di causa. Caesar ex Eurip.</note> if a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
or a great estate or fortune, lye before me;
must I let another carry them before me, if there be but
a scruple about the title, or the circumstances of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding?
if I have made a promise; must I keep it to
my own wrong?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:37837:10"/>
               <hi>Machiavel</hi> observes,<note place="margin">de principe.</note> that those Princes have been but
unfortunate, who have suffered themselves to be ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
by a word, or to be in earnest, too <hi>religious [but
he is very unfortunate himself in the instances, which he
giveth of some, that seemed to have prospered by their false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and impiety.</hi>] What shall we return to this?</p>
            <p>We say first, that, that which hath been called <hi>vertue</hi>
(for the most part) is a certain strain of natural <hi>piety,</hi>
even in the Heathens, so far as it can go: and that such
of those (whether private men, or Princes) as lived
most according unto true <hi>vertue,</hi> were the most prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
and glorious. But because the lives of private
men are apt to be buried in obscurity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> after a small time;
let us take account of Princes, whose memories remain
sacred, when they have done <hi>vertuously;</hi> as their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
were before (whether they were <hi>Pagan,</hi> or whether
they were <hi>Christian</hi>) while the issues hung in suspence,
and the ages under awe, wherein they lived.</p>
            <p>Who can be compared with <hi>Augustus, Titus, Trajan,
Antoninus, Constantine</hi> the great, and the rest of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
note? as for the vitious monsters of the Empire, who
by ambition, and deceit attain'd, and managed the
sway for a time; which of them came to a timely end?
as for those that retained wicked policies with a shew,
and some pretence of <hi>vertue:</hi> which of these did not
spoil all the rest thereby? I cannot stand to speak of
<hi>Tiberius, Galba, Severus, Julian,</hi> and others of them.
Much lesse, to verifie the same from our own Chronicles
(which might seem to exceed the lists of my profession)
to leave to every one their own.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:37837:11"/>We say again, that looking upon examples in the
Scripture; we have found none to have flourished like
those, that had the zeal of true <hi>religion;</hi> as <hi>David, So.
lomon, Asa, Jehosaphat, Hezekiah,</hi> &amp;c. Only, good
<hi>Josiah</hi> perished at the last, by admitting a little <hi>policy,</hi>
to be temper'd with his <hi>piety:</hi> and out of a Princely
emulation (as it might be thought) in his youth, to
shew his valor.</p>
            <p>On the other side, the wicked Princes fell by their
own vices: and had been likely so to do, though there
had been none but men to punish them. The Princes
that compounded, or confounded their pretences to
<hi>religion</hi> with other <hi>policies,</hi> fell ever short of their own
designs, which they pursued, under the veil, or mask
of hypocrisie; as <hi>Saul,</hi> and <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> and <hi>Jehu,</hi> and
<hi>Amaziah,</hi> and the rest.</p>
            <p>Then comes another in, with such a complaint as this,
to render this <hi>pretended prudence</hi> of ours to be but <hi>fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishnesse</hi>
(according to their shallow reasonings) shall I
part with a certainty for an uncertainty? quit my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,
and pleasures to embrace Melancholy, and to
solace my self with deaths-heads, and Coffins set before
me, while I walk in youth, or strength? shall I bind a
carcase to my living body, and go about with it, like a
ghost, through the terrour of a resurrection, and a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
judgment, whilst it seems to common observation,
that death is but a meer extinction; and as such, despised
by the bravest men?</p>
            <p>First, it is <hi>Popish superstition,</hi> that hath painted out <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>
in solitudes, and penances: and it is the modern <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharism</hi>
only, that hath sequestred it from society, and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:37837:11"/>
civility; wherein the highest satisfactions of life consist;
and certainly, men are rendred the more civil, and not
the less, by a right temper of <hi>religion,</hi> which is <hi>wisdom</hi>
dwelling in the Court of <hi>prudence,</hi> the bond of all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity.
So that impiety doth but put an ugly visard on
<hi>religion,</hi> or cloath it in a Bears-skin, to work its preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice,
when it sets it forth after this manner. It is far
from being sad, and melancholy, when it is rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood;
but is rather to be described,<note place="margin">Boeth. de consolat. philosophiae. l. 1. Mulier reverendi admodum vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, oculis ardentibus, colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re vivido, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que in exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sti vigoris, quamvis ita ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi plena soret, ut nullo modo nostrae crede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retur aetatis.</note> as the <hi>Christian
Philosopher</hi> describeth <hi>wisdom,</hi> to be like a woman of a
Matronly-look, having piercing eyes, and a lively co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour;
and though far above our age, seeming yet to
retain the flower of her youth.</p>
            <p>Again, there is no certainty to be parted with by a
religious life, seeing all other things are uncertain here,
unless it be this truth; that all good things are the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
free gifts of God, dispensed much according to
meet rewards of <hi>piety and vertue:</hi> and so it often goeth,
whilst all the superfluity of divine bounty, being no
way prodigal, is unaccountable unto men. But uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
there can be none about the future hopes, and
fears, till any man hath answered the evidence, which
we have given in before of the <hi>Christian religion.</hi>
Which we also presume to be un answerable by all the
wits of men, though they were even granted a <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanalian</hi>
liberty.</p>
            <p>Let us cast up the compt (if you please) on either
hand, what mischief comes by <hi>irreligion,</hi> and what
benefits do accompany an unfeigned <hi>Christian Piety.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, An <hi>irreligious</hi> life, through private lusts, and
passions, destroyeth bodies, and estates, and the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:37837:12"/>
weal; which are all saved, and advanced by the
<hi>prudence,</hi> and goodness of a <hi>Christian</hi> life, how many
bodies have been ruined by intemperance, and lust?
but who was ever hurt by Continence and Abstinence?
How many men have perished by the persecution of
revenge? but who ever came to any great disaster by
gentleness, and patience? How many estates have been
confounded by a prodigal profusion upon vanities? but
what estate did ever suffer by frugality, with an abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency
from all vain-glory, and impertinent delights?
what confusion hath it brought into States, and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
when particular persons, having power in their
hands, have dis-regarded, and hindred the publick
good, for their private ends, and satisfactions? but
when was the State ever hurt by a publick spirit, and by
self-denyal? the ungodly life of a few men bringeth
judgments on the land; but the Godly lie of fewer
stinteth the divine wrath, and bringeth blessings, not
only on themselves, but on many more.</p>
            <p>2. An <hi>irreligious</hi> life bringeth men under great bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage;
but a religious life (according unto this <hi>prudence</hi>)
doth set them free, and far above all fears, or the causes
of them. The one is in bondage unto meats, and
drinks, <hi>to make provision for the Flesh;</hi> enough to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
out a voyage: not (as it is usually pretended) for
hospitality, but because he wants them: whereas <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
is contented with a little, and <hi>piety</hi> with lesse. The
one is tempted with the forbidden fruit, and is in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,
because he will be satisfied; though it be through
dishonour, and a cumble of inconveniences. But un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
purer minds there ariseth little trouble of this kind:
either their mind is free from the power of such tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
or else, it is purged by repentance, and every
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:37837:12"/>
lust is mortified. The one cannot live comfortably (as
he conceives) without his lusts, and the other cannot
live at all with them.</p>
            <p>The weight of an ungodly mans bondage follows
yet (as the wain must follow the wheels.) When an
ungodly man hath pursued his ambition, pride, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
covetize, or any of his pleasures to the height;
he is still so far from being satisfyed, that he is rather
sad and discomposed, partly through <hi>vanity</hi> of the
Creature, and partly through the remorse of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
reflecting upon so much of the <hi>vanity</hi> of Sin,
as he is sensible of, in the things that he hath acted, or
wherewithal he was affected for the time. So, that
instead of recovering himself by reason, and by resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he is usually re-mitted to the same disease to be
healed, as they say, that a second burning of the finger
will cure the first. Now, if this part of a mans soul (if
I may divide it into parts) troubled the <hi>Heathen</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
(as I cannot stand to cite sentences, and instances,
that might be quoted out of Authors) how much more,
may I presume, it may do in such, as have heard the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
preached all their dayes, from which they cannot
choose, but to have received some impressions, howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
impregnable they may pretend to be.</p>
            <p>In a word, whereas true <hi>religion</hi> pacifies the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and alone is able to render that tranquillity of
mind, which the <hi>Gentiles</hi> sought in vain; an <hi>irreligious</hi>
life maketh men <hi>meticulous,</hi> as oft as the wind doth
blow, or the clouds are rent with thunder. A <hi>religious</hi>
man is in peace at home, <hi>impavidum ferient ruinae;</hi> The
end of the world will be no amazement to him; though
the heavens fall, or glow with fervent fire, as they must
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:37837:13"/>
do at the last, he is not to be dismayed by it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly and Lastly, There is as much latitude in
<hi>Christian prudence,</hi> as a <hi>wise</hi> man <hi>could</hi> wish: For there
is nothing in <hi>religion,</hi> that makes against a right <hi>pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;</hi>
nay, it comprehendeth all, and far excelleth
human <hi>prudence:</hi> you cannot instance in a case, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
you may not be, the best resolved. Hence <hi>Philosophers</hi>
have prescribed much austerity, and <hi>Idolaters</hi> have used
(and do use) great severity, but the <hi>Christian Religion</hi>
required nothing, but what is gentle, and agreeable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
nature, and civility. There is enough in it to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the Temporal felicity, and to augment it. Enjoy
as much of the goods, that God hath given you, as
will do you good: and be sure, if God had not known
better then we, what was good for us, he would have
allowed to us the larger size.</p>
            <p>Some restraints indeed, we must acknowledge, but such
as are for our greater priviledge, and enlargement ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way. Some think it a restraint if they may not
riot, but if they do, it spoileth bodies, and estates:
others, that there is no Community; but where there is
most impunity for that, the blood is most corrupted.
Others, that Polygamy (at least) is not permitted; but
where it is, it engendreth unto feuds, more then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
love. And when community was once too much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged,
the <hi>Romans</hi> were fain to provide by law, that
every man of such a quality, should have (at least) one
wife. The Laws of God therefore are the <hi>basis</hi> of all
other <hi>prudence,</hi> the establishment of the earth; such
as far exceeded those of all other Nations, to make
both the publick; and the private man the happier, so
that every way it is the better <hi>policy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:37837:13"/>I think our own Law approves of it, and hath this
rule, <hi>Lex Dei est lex terrae; The Law of God is the Law of
the Land:</hi> and that, there is no such preamble to any
of our Statutes, as, <hi>nos mitigantes regorem juris divini,</hi>
&amp;c. do enact,<note place="margin">Referente mihi nobili Polono de <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ua gente.</note> that it shall not be accounted murther in
a Noble man, if he kill a Paisan. If it were so, it
would not only be a violation of <hi>religion,</hi> but much
against the <hi>policy</hi> of <hi>ENGLAND.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Certainly then this <hi>Christian prudence</hi> cannot interfere
with the Civil, because it doth not only farre surmount,
but comprehend it.<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note>. It hath been said, that all <hi>vertue</hi>
is comprised in justice: much more in <hi>piety,</hi> which is
not only the greatest motive unto justice; but the <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum
mobile,</hi> a superiour orbe, that doth contain, and
carry it about with its own motion. Whatsoever there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
makes against <hi>piety,</hi> makes as much against justice,
and all other vertues, and as much against the felicity
of mankind, even in this civil life.</p>
            <p>Adde to this the <hi>vantage,</hi> we have shew'd, that true
<hi>religion</hi> laies but few and light restraints; but it opens
such enlargements of happiness, and fruition, on another
hand, as are neither to be counted by curious observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
nor yet to be exprest, or uttered by the tongues of
men, and Angels,</p>
            <p>What if I should resume my text (but that it is too
late) to be expounded <hi>mystically,</hi> and yet without an
<hi>allegory?</hi> you see that <hi>wisdom</hi> and <hi>prudence</hi> are here set
forth as two persons: and <hi>prudence</hi> for her part as if she
had an house large enough to entertain <hi>wisdom.</hi> What
if I should say, upon the whole, that it is not obscure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
signified by this; that <hi>Christ,</hi> the Son of God, the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:37837:14"/>
               <hi>wisdom</hi> of the father, dwelleth in them that do believe,
by his own spirit? whereby he is as much the soul of
their souls, as their souls are the life of their bodies: and
so doth prompt, and inspire them by his grace, in such
a manner, that they shall not only, not lightly forego,
or so much as slip any point, that tendeth to their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
temporal,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 18.</note> or eternal (for, <hi>all things work together
for good to them that love God</hi>) but doth also fill them
full of such inward joys, as <hi>carnal wisdom</hi> is not able to
conceive.</p>
            <p>Such as have been addicted to their studies, have
placed the chiefest felicity of life in
contemplation (we must suppose
that a man be of sufficiency to be
vacant to it,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">

choice of what he liketh) because
this is the pleasure of the mind. So our master <hi>Aristotle,</hi>
although his own speculations were but dry (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.)
But <hi>Sencea</hi> distinguisheth betwixt that part of
Philosophy, which is conversant about the natural
questions, and that which riseth up to the researches,
that are concerning God; speaking of this later as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
above the other, as much as the Heaven is above
the Earth: yet he moveth only such remote questions
of contemplation as these are, what the nature of God
is; and whether he be wholly intent upon himself, or
hath sometimes regard to us: pronouncing (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing)
of this later part, that
it is more<note n="*" place="margin">Altior est haec, &amp; animosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, &amp; multo hanc caliginem in qua volutamur, excedit, &amp; e tenebris creptos illo produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit, unde lucct. <hi>pri. nat. quaest.</hi>
               </note> high, and spritely
then the other: and such as
wraps us up above this darkness,
wherein we were mantled before
as in thick clouds, and brings us near unto that light,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:37837:14"/>
from whence it self doth shine, Such pleasures did they
pretend to take in their poor, and low sentiments of
Philosophy, the highest of which do hardly reach the
threshold of Divinity!</p>
            <p>The Poets seemed to be full of one of the nine God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desses,
the Muses, and to take great pleasure in it, when
their <hi>Genius</hi> worked kindly towards verses: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
used to begin their poems with a prayer to one,
or other of them, which was counted most propitious
unto such a <hi>vein,</hi> or <hi>strein</hi> of Poesy, as they then intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
The Heathen Priests in their Temples gloryed in
being possessed with the <hi>Daemon,</hi> strutting in the <hi>Pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tralia,</hi>
like the bird of <hi>Juno.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cicero</hi> delighted in the notion of immortality: but
it was of name only: that of the Soul he accounted as
a problem. Of death he therefore maketh the less ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
(as other of the Heathens) who thought it but
indifferent,<note place="margin">In Parad.</note> because it brought as much good, as evil
with it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cato</hi> was much taken with <hi>Socrates</hi> his discourses about
the immortality of the soul, when
he was about to kill himself:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Plutarch</hi> in vit. Cat. min. In Phaedone Platonio. Grandia morituri verba ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonis discere, ab insano mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tùm Laudanda Magistro, <hi>Pers.</hi> Sat. 3.</note> and
uttered strange, and admirable
sayings to the Heathen hearers:
yet he dreamed not of a resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
an Heaven; or but only of
<hi>Elysian</hi> fields, or shades: and so he dyed, not so much out
of good-will, as to save himself from falling into the
hands of enemies, which he thought would use him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumeliously.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:37837:15"/>But when we come to contemplate one God, distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished

               <hi>desinit in piscem mulier
formosa superne.</hi> What though
the heathen Priests seemed to have
some familiarity with the Gods,
in whose Temples they did attend, and serve? they
were usually deadly sick with it. Let <hi>Cicero</hi> please
himself about an immortal name: we should not know
him from another man, though we should meet him:
though we talk of him, he cannot hear us: and if he
be not, what is he the nearer, as <hi>Valla</hi> argueth. Let
<hi>Cato</hi> speak bravely of the immortality of the soul it self,
since he thought it better to dye, then to protract his
misery: yet none of his admirers could sind in his heart
to quit an indifferent life here, for the best that they
could make of the other.</p>
            <p>But since it is another kind of immortality, that the
<hi>Christian</hi> faith doth grasp, and gaspe after: no wonder
if the excellency of so sublime an object do draw them
up far above the state of other men, that seem to have
more in them, then themselves: and give them other
manner of fruitions, which are <hi>unspeakable and full of
glory,</hi> without deceit, or stilt: in a word, that it sill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
them not only with a true contempt of death (which
the other do but seign) but impelleth them to triumph
over it, and often to provoke it in the way of Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
Let us move yet but one step further, that
we may reach the goal.</p>
            <p>Others are not much addicted unto contemplation
(but rather leave it as a fancy to them that like it better)
yet they will not quit their own pretensions unto happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:37837:16"/>
They had rather have it placed in an active, or
a quiet life, supported with such means, and aides, as
may best administer unto either of them, as they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
should choose. Be it so, we are at all points rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to shew where happiness is, sooner then any other,
for <hi>Godliness is profitable unto all things,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 8.</note> 
               <hi>having the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
of this life, and of that which is to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Carnal <hi>wisdom</hi> seems to teach how to enjoy, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
the goods of fortune but it cannot get them:
whereas the true <hi>wisdom</hi> hath <hi>length of dayes in her right
hand,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 3. 16.</note> 
               <hi>and in her left riches and honour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Carnal <hi>wisdom</hi> teacheth to enjoy them alone, but
this how to enjoy God together with them, which is
much more. <hi>Carnal Wisdom</hi> teacheth a pretended e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quanimity,
and indifference in adversity (which it cannot
possibly prevent) but it can no more do it, then it can
satisfie thirst, and hunger with dainty words; whereas
this <hi>wisdome</hi> and <hi>prudence,</hi> whereof we speak, affords
such a true support within,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 6. 10. 74 Rom. 5. 3.</note> as hath really made many
(and still doth) to <hi>rejoyce in tribulations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if you ask me what this inward support is. I
answer, it is the spirit of Union, through faith, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
I gave you but an hint before, indeed, how the
Saints are united mystically unto <hi>Christ,</hi> and have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<hi>unspeakable</hi> enjoyments,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 8.</note> and <hi>full of glory:</hi> we cannot
shew in Act, because it is internal, and a mystery: but it
plainly appeareth by the effects: for, they are oft trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
in their private prayers, who have <hi>Communion
with the Father,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 1. 3. 4.</note> 
               <hi>and with his Son Jesus Christ,</hi> they have
admirable gifts when they come abroad. That Spirit,
which we account as their higher souls or by way of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:37837:16"/>
               <hi>eminence,</hi> sheweth wonders, when occasion draws it
forth to outward observation. But it is <hi>not according
to the will of man:</hi> neither of him that hath it, always
to exert the power of it, nor of others to make collusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with it: but rather, it makes but little shew to the
world (till God himself do set it forth to action, or to
patience) because it aboundeth most in mortified men:
who being <hi>filled with the Spirit,</hi> look never the fuller
for it;<note place="margin">Eph. 5. 18.</note> and while they are invincible in the Faith, do
but shew to be the meekest men. And so each one doth
acknowledge for himself, when he professeth with St.
<hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 2. 20. Col 3, 3.</note> 
               <hi>The Life which I seem to live in the stesh, I live not;
but my life is hid with Christ in God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude (since we must needs be reduced unto
some bounds, though our subject cannot) here is the
highest pitch of this excellency, which hath no pearch
below the clouds; but pierceth into the <hi>Empyrean</hi> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens.
This <hi>wisdom</hi> doth secure us of a better life (while
it is so far from diminishing, that it added unto this, as
I have shewed you) but <hi>irreligion</hi> hazzards both, upon
a fond supposition; what if there be no resurrection?
yet, by piety, you shall live more happily here, then
without it. The mad-man that had great joys to go
unto the Port, and to see the Ships come in, conceiting
that they were all his own, proved but melancholy,
when he was cured. Better it were to be deceived
with <hi>godliness, which is profitable unto all things,</hi> then to
be deluded by the world, that yeildeth no security, or
felicity to them, that stick the closest to it.</p>
            <p>But what if there be a <hi>resurrection</hi> at the last? <hi>insipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entis
erit tum dicere, non putaram.</hi> It will be but folly
to plead then; I had not thought, that it would have
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:37837:17"/>
proved so. And it will be too late to put in any other
plea: for this very <hi>wisdom</hi> will then come in, in evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;
and after speak like a judge from the bench, in
this manner. <hi>Since ye have set at nought all my Counsel,
and would none of my reproof,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov, 1. 24. &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>I also will laugh at your
calamity, I will mock when your fear cometh; when your
fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction as a whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind;
when distresse, and anguish cometh on you. Then
shall they call upon me, but I will not answer: they shall
seek me early, but they shall not find me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the summe of my exhortation, and my argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<hi>To day while it is called to day,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb 3. 15. 4. 7.</note> let us hearken to
the voice of <hi>wisdom,</hi> let us claspe this <hi>prudence,</hi> and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
part with it: but let us keep it so, <hi>that</hi> it my keep
us for ever.<note place="margin">Phil. 4. 7.</note> 
               <hi>And the peace of God which passeth all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
shall keep your hearts, and minds through
Christ Jesus.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 13. 20.</note> 
               <hi>Now the God of peace, that brought again
from the dead our Lord Jesus, the great Shepherd of the
Sheep, through the Blood of the Everlasting Covenant, make
you perfect in every good work, to do his will, working in
you that, which is well-pleasing in his sight, through Jesus
Christ.</hi> To whom with the <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>the Holy Ghost</hi> be
praise and glory for ever and ever.</p>
