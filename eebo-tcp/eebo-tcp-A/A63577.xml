            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Have thought meet to make this <hi>Dedication</hi> alſo to you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ye were not only eye and ear Witneſſes of what paſt in the <hi>Diſputation;</hi> but were privy to all the Circumſtances with which it was attended, and were the ſole Cauſe of my being engaged in it. How it was managed you beſt know, and therefore are proper Judges of the matters of fact related in this <hi>Narrative.</hi> For my own part, I have took much Pains, and uſed great Care and Conſideration in the Review of thoſe Papers you ſent me from thoſe that wrote down the Diſpute, that I might do no Wrong to either Party.</p>
            <p>And herein I have had all the Helps I could obtain both from our Brother <hi>Williams,</hi> who was engaged with me in the Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; from whom I received (by the hands of Mr. <hi>Sharp,</hi> our
<pb facs="tcp:31621:4"/>
               <hi>Moderator)</hi> an Account of thoſe Arguments he offered, and what elſe he could remember, taken from his own mouth: beſides the account I have had by Letters from divers other Perſons that were preſent. All which I have diligently compared, and have alſo endeavoured (ſo far as thoſe Accounts and my own Memory would furniſh me therewith) not only to give a true Narrative of what was ſpoken, but alſo to give our <hi>Antagoniſts</hi> Words their due weight as well as our own.</p>
            <p>And if there be any thing omitted therein, they muſt blame themſelves, or their own Scribe, and not us. For Mr. <hi>William Leddell</hi> went to Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> their Writer, and carried our Copy with him, and deſired him to compare it with his: He anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that his was very imperfect, it being the firſt time he was in a <hi>Diſpute,</hi> and he could not take it, but ſome things were left out; and ſaid, that it was not as yet wholly written over. Mr. <hi>Leddell</hi> waited upon him a ſecond time, but could not obtain a ſight of it to compare them together, although he was ſatisfied it was then finiſhed. Now whether he did this of himſelf, or by Advice from them, is beſt known to himſelf. However, it leaves us without blame.</p>
            <p>I know it is not proper for me (who was principally concerned in it) to ſay much concerning the <hi>Diſpute</hi> it ſelf: for being made Publick, it's left to every one that reads it to judge for himſelf. Nevertheleſs, it may not be amiſs to make ſome few Remarks upon it; becauſe it may fall into ſome hands who may not well underſtand the Grounds of the Controverſie.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is agreed on both ſides, That Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi>'s Sermons were the occaſion of that Offence taken by you, and of the <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute</hi> it ſelf; as appears by the <hi>Preliminaries</hi> ſigned by Mr. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Bowes</hi> and Mr. <hi>William Leddell</hi> on our part, and alſo by Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> and Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> on the part of the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians:</hi> as you may ſee in <hi>p. 3, 4.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The Objections being made againſt what Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> preach'd, it had been his proper Work to have vindicated the Truth of his Doctrine againſt thoſe Objections, by the Authority of Holy Scripture. But inſtead thereof, he puts us upon it to prove the contrary. But as the learned Dr. <hi>Smith</hi> did well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, <hi>He that aſſerts muſt prove.</hi> And their own <hi>Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> did declare, that Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> had in his Preaching aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that Infants are the Subjects of Baptiſm, but told us we were not to call on him for that <hi>then.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb facs="tcp:31621:4"/>
3. I would make this farther Remark upon it, That the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why he took this method was, becauſe he was unable to prove what he had aſſerted: for in one of his Sermons he thus ſpeaks; <hi>But that I may proceed with the greater clearneſs, I ſhall do theſe things; firſt, prove from Scripture the Warrantableneſs of Infant-Baptiſm,</hi> &amp;c. And to make his Aſſertion good, he cites the Commiſſion, <hi>Matth. 28. 19.</hi> for the Baptizing the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of believing Parents. And argues upon it, that Diſciples were to be Baptized; and (ſaith he) <hi>we have a plain Text that ſuch Infants are Diſciples,</hi> ſee <hi>Acts 15. 10.</hi> And when our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Go make Diſciples, baptizing them,</hi> it muſt be underſtood of ſuch Infants. Now as to his Pretence from <hi>Acts 15. 10.</hi> we did ſufficiently enervate that. And as for the Commiſſion, Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> doth confeſs (as well as Mr. <hi>Chandler)</hi> that it is a Command, and that the Command is expreſs'd, <hi>pag. 27.</hi> And farther ſaith, in <hi>pag. 28. We muſt all confeſs that Jeſus Chriſt gave Commiſſion to Baptize Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers when at the Age of maturity; but afterwards the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of thoſe Believers.</hi> Yet when Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> begins to anſwer my first Argument, he affirms, <hi>That Chriſt hath no where expreſly commanded Infants to be Baptized.</hi> See <hi>p. 6.</hi> And if ſo, then Infants cannot be intended, either in that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, or any other place where there is a Command in Holy Scripture for Baptiſm. So that he needs no other Confutation than his own Confeſſion, in the preſence, as is ſuppoſed, of about 2000 Witneſſes.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As for their Conſequences which they were ſo deſirous to have a Grant from me that I would allow them to make uſe of; it's very obſervable, that if they can do any thing that way, it's yet to be done; for they did not offer them to us in the Diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but have reſerved them in their own Breaſts, as the <hi>Pope</hi> doth his unwritten Traditions. And how they ſhould think the People ſhould be convinced of the truth of their Practice, when they tell them there is no expreſs Command in Scripture for it, and pretend only they have ſome Conſequences to prove it by, and yet refuſe to tell what theſe Conſequences are, it is beyond my Imagination. I can aſſure them, thoſe that can take up a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in ſuch empty Pretences, are ſufficiently prepared to be Prieſt-ridden, with a witneſs.</p>

And this was done by the Advice of ſeveral of their Miniſters, particularly Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> and Mr. <hi>Williams.</hi> His Name is <hi>Joſeph Fox;</hi> he is a near Neighbour of ours. And they did it either by the Commiſſion, or, without regard to it, I know not which; that they beſt know.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:31621:5"/>
Now by this Action of theirs, if they believe it to be according to the Commiſſion, then they juſtify our Practice; if they do it for any by-end, without believing it to be according to God's Word, then (as Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith) the whole Action is but a Sport.</p>
            <p>Now, that Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> can have no other Thoughts of it, doth evidently appear from his own Words: for in his Sermon preachd at <hi>Portſmouth</hi> Nov. <hi>10. 1698.</hi> he ſaith, <hi>It is not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that that God that will have mercy and not ſacrifice, would inſtitute an Ordinance ſo prejudicial to the Bodies of Men: and that it's very unlikely that</hi> Dipping, <hi>which when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is mentioned, is uſed as a Token of God's</hi> Vengeance, <hi>ſhould in this Sacrament be uſed as a Token of his Mercy. Where you read of</hi> Dipping, <hi>you find it mentioned in a way of Wrath and Vengeance. Thus the old World was Dip'd and Drowned for their Sins: God's Vengeance followed them, and they ſunk as Lead in the mighty Waters. Thus the</hi> Egyptians <hi>were Dip'd and Drowned in the</hi> Red Sea. <hi>Thus the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſhall come down from Heaven, to render Vengeance on his Adverſaries; cloathed with Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Dip'd in blood,</hi> Rev. 19. 13. [Here Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> hath rendred that word <hi>Dip'd</hi> to inveigh and ridicule our Practice of <hi>Dipping,</hi> although he could object againſt it when I gave it for an Inſtance.] But he goes on, ſaying, <hi>You find ſtill</hi> Dipping <hi>repreſents in Scripture God's Vengeance and Diſpleaſure. And ſo I ſay it is very unlikely, that what was always uſed as a Token of his Diſpleaſure, ſhould in the New Teſtament be uſed as a Token of Mercy. So that it is not neceſſary that</hi> Dipping <hi>be uſed in Baptiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I give this for Anſwer.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If it be ſo as he ſaith, then it was altogether unneceſſary that Mr. <hi>Erle</hi> (by his Conſent) ſhould dip Mr. <hi>Fox's</hi> whole Body under the Water.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That it was not done in Mercy to him, thus to Baptize him; but in Vengeance, and as a Token of God's Diſpleaſure.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That the Baptiſm practiſed by <hi>John the Dipper,</hi> and that of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, was not an Ordinance inſtituted of God in a way of Mercy, but appointed for the People in a way of Wrath and Vengeance: for I have given him a cloud of Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that they did adminiſter it by Dipping the whole Body un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Water.</p>
            <p n="4">4. By this he doth condemn and ridicule all thoſe learned Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants I have mentioned; with many others that might be named.
<pb facs="tcp:31621:6"/>
And the Divines of the <hi>Church of England</hi> (as well as we) who appoint <hi>Dipping</hi> as the best way of Baptizing (and <hi>Sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kling</hi> only in caſe of Weakneſs) and was uſed by them formerly as their frequent Practice; and is aſſerted by ſome of their greateſt Divines, to be the old and beſt way of Baptizing: and is to this day the conſtant Practice of the Greek Church.</p>
            <p>I am alſo well aſſured from ſome other hands, that, upon the 25th of <hi>Febr.</hi> laſt, a few days after the <hi>Diſpute,</hi> Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> ſaid in the Preſence of divers Perſons, That to ſatisfy a Scrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Conſcience he would adminiſter Baptiſm by <hi>Dipping.</hi> Whereupon Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> askt him if he would do it to anſwer a Scrupulous Conſcience without God's Word? And he anſwered No. And I have reaſon to conclude that Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> may believe that <hi>Dipping</hi> is the right way of Baptizing, whatever he might ſay in the time of the <hi>Diſpute;</hi> becauſe he did ſay to divers perſons, That if it had been in a private Conference, where there had been but a few Perſons of a ſide, he ſhould have made ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Conceſſions, which he was not willing to make in ſo great an Aſſembly. And therefore I will not charge thoſe extravagant Expreſſions of Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi>'s upon him; <hi>i. e.</hi> That <hi>Dipping</hi> was always uſed as a Token of Diſpleaſure. And ſurely Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> had mightily forgot himſelf when he ſaid ſo: for <hi>Naa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> the <hi>Syrian</hi> was commanded to Dip himſelf, not in a way of Vengeance and Wrath, but in a way of Mercy: and he found it to be ſo; for he was perfectly cured of his Leproſie thereby. I would adviſe Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> to read over <hi>Rom. 2. 1, 2, 3.</hi> and conſider how ſharply the Apoſtle reproves ſuch that condemn o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and yet do the ſame things themſelves; and ſaith, <hi>Thou art inexcuſable, O Man, whoſoever thou art, that judgeſt; for wherein thou judgeſt another, thou condemneſt thy ſelf; for thou that judgeſt, doeſt the ſame things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How can he, or any of them, condemn our Practice, when themſelves can do it to ſatisfie a <hi>Scrupulous Conſcience,</hi> or, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And eſpecially Mr. <hi>Leigh,</hi> who confeſſes it to be according to the Word of God? And Mr. <hi>Erle</hi> hath done it by their Conſent.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now give you an Account from another hand written from <hi>Goſport,</hi> in which (after he hath ſignified his reſpects to me, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> he thus ſaith;</p>

            <p>By theſe Teſtimonies you may ſee, that the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> had no Cauſe to publiſh what they did to the World, except it were to keep up their declining Reputation.</p>
            <p>After the <hi>Diſpute</hi> was ended, and I was returned to my Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> told me he would go to his Nameſake's houſe to talk with the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Miniſters that were there.

And when Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> came to ſee me before I left <hi>Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> he told me that he had delivered my Meſſage to them: and that Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Miniſter did acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that Mr. <hi>Robinſon</hi> had exceeded his Bounds: and that he did abuſe me in his miſrepreſenting of me to the People upon that Argument.</p>
            <p>I anſwer'd, It was well he had acknowledg'd it now; but it had been better if he had done it before the People.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> Miniſter was pleaſed to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate this Account to me by Mr. <hi>Sharp</hi> our <hi>Moderator.</hi>

               <hi>Feb. 23. 1698-9.</hi> Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> and himſelf being together at Mr. <hi>Williams's</hi> Houſe in <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> there came in Mr. <hi>Erle,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bowler,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Farrel,</hi> three <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Miniſters; and there was two other <hi>Baptiſts</hi> preſent at the ſame time. Mr. <hi>Farrel,</hi> in the Preſence of the forementioned Miniſters, ſaluted Mr. <hi>John Williams,</hi> the Diſputant, after this manner.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> I must tell you, and that not as my own Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents only, but as the Sentiments of every one of our Brethren, that what Credit was gained to your Cauſe, was gained by you.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> asked Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> whether we did infer from thoſe words. That the Miniſters had granted out of their own mouths that we had gained the Cauſe?</p>
            <p>His Reply was, No, all that we infer from it was this; That it was an implicit Conceſſion, that there was Credit gained to our Cauſe.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> ſaid, How much Credit did we infer was grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them to our Cauſe?</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> ſaid, We do not know the quantity of it.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> replied, Truly it was but a little Credit that was granted out of our own mouths that was gained to your Cauſe.</p>
            <p>To which Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> anſwered, That if there was a little Credit granted out of their own mouths, then there was Credit gain'd to our Cauſe, granted by themſelves; which was no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther denied by Mr. <hi>Leigh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what was ſpoken by Mr. <hi>John Williams</hi> in the <hi>Diſpute,</hi> was abundantly ſhorter than what Dr. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> did then ſpeak. Thus far as to Mr. <hi>Williams's</hi> Account.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding all this, whilst they were making theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions at <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> they let fly an <hi>Advertiſement</hi> after Dr. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> which was Printed and Publiſhed before he got home: for, as Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> ſaid, they knew who had hurt them.

            <p>We being ſilent, and not uſing the ſame Methods as they did, to ſquirt out fooliſh Advertiſements in common <hi>News-Papers,</hi> theſe Men grew confident; and upon the 1ſt of <hi>April</hi> following, in the <hi>Flying-Poſt,</hi> they publiſh a long Story, full of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntruths, and filly ſquint-ey'd Reflections, not becoming their Learning or Profeſſion: and all to ſupport a ſinking Interest. But it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo manifeſtly partial, that there ſeemed to be little or no cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit given to it, except by ſome few of their own Party.</p>
            <p>For although they were ſo civil to give themſelves the Title of <hi>Maſter,</hi> they grutched to ſpeak ſo honourably of their <hi>Opponents.</hi> And in the ſecond Paper they ſay, one Mr. <hi>William</hi> (by ſome called <hi>Dr.) Ruſſel</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>All that I ſhall ſay to it is this; As I am a Miniſter of Chriſt and of the Churches, I can (through the Grace of God) bear all the Indignity and Contempt they can put upon me; if I, by ſo doing, can but do good to Souls, and bring the leaſt Tribute of Honour to my Lord and Maſter thereby. I thank God that he enabled me to count the Coſt before I was ordained to the Work of the Miniſtry; and therefore, if Reproaches, yea Bonds and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, abide me, it is no more than I looked for.</p>
            <p>But what Reaſon theſe Men have to refuſe to give me the civil Title of <hi>Doctor,</hi> I know not, neither do I care. But this I know, that many years ſince, I was not only admitted as <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Arts,</hi> but took my Degree of <hi>Batchelor in Phyſick,</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:31621:8"/>
was after that Created a <hi>Doctor in Phyſick</hi> of the famous <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and alſo admitted by univerſal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to be a Member of the Senate there: and that not as ſome have ſuggeſted, as if it had been only <hi>ex gratia.</hi> Yet theſe Men, even whilſt I was in <hi>Portſmouth</hi> (as well as ſince) have repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted among the People there, that I was <hi>Ruſſel</hi> the Mountebank, a Man that hath been dead ſeveral years. They thought (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps) by ſuch Artifices to leſſen the Peoples Opinion of me. But by making me little, they make themſelves the leſs, in that ſuch Giants (as they would have the People believe them to be) ſhould not be able to conquer ſuch a Pigmy as they have repreſented me in the Eyes of the Vulgar.</p>
            <p>They have alſo reported, That I am a Hackney <hi>Diſputant,</hi> and that I refuſed to come down to <hi>Portſmouth</hi> under thirty <hi>Guinea's;</hi> but that at last I was prevail'd upon to take Twenty. I did not trouble my ſelf whilſt I was at <hi>Portſmouth</hi> to confute them in it, becauſe our Friends there knew how to do it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; for they knew the Report to be altogether groundleſs and falſe. But ſeeing I have this opportunity, I think ſit hereby to tell the World, That I did not ſo much as demand one farthing of them for my Journey, neither before nor after. For all that are throughly acquainted with me know, that I do neither Preach for Hire, nor Divine for Money, as ſome of them do: but as I have freely received, ſo I deſire freely to give; believing that ought to be left to the free Benevolence of the People.</p>
            <p>But that I may do Right to our Friends at <hi>Portſmouth</hi> and <hi>Goſport,</hi> I do acknowledge that of their own free good Will (without asking) they did pay my Coach hire and bear my Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; which, as they thought it was the leaſt they could do, ſo I can truly ſay, it was the moſt I ever expected</p>
            <p>I ſhall cloſe this Epiſtle, with giving the World an Account of the Occaſion of this Publication.</p>
            <p>There were two things that moved our Friends thereto.</p>
            <p>1. Their Noiſe and Clamour they made in the Time of the Diſpute; which bindred the People from hearing what was ſaid, eſpecially when they were pinch'd upon an Argument.</p>
            <p>For which Reaſon, it was thought convenient to publiſh it, that what they could not be permitted quietly to Hear, they may have the benefit to Read without Interruption; and ſo have leiſure to conſider it.</p>
            <p>But <hi>2dly,</hi> The principal Cauſe thereof, was thoſe Advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they ſent all over the Nation, to miſrepreſent the <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:31621:9"/>
and blind the eyes of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nthinking about it.</p>
            <p>Whereas this Publication will ſet the matter in a true Light, and let all Men ſee that they had neither Scripture, nor any good Conſequences deduced from thence, to prove their Practice, either with reſpect to the Subjects or Manner. And therefore when the People ſhall ſee that they have neither Command nor Example for their Practice, I hope it will be a means to convince them of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawfulneſs thereof; and that they will not dare for time to come to practiſe a humane Tradition in the room of an Ordinance of Jeſus Christ: remembring what our Lord ſaid of the Jews of old, <hi>In vain they do worſhip me, teaching for Doctrines the Commandments of men,</hi> Matth. 15. 9. And in Mark <hi>7. 8. For laying aſide the Commandment of God, ye hold the Tradition of men.</hi> And then hear what <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, Coloſſ. <hi>2. 20, 21, 22. Wherefore if ye be dead with Chriſt from the Rudiments of the world; why; as though living in the world, are ye ſubject to Ordinances</hi> (Touch not, taſte not, handle not, which all are to periſh with the uſing) <hi>after the Commandments and Doctrines of men?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the God of Peace, that brought again from the Dead our Lord Jeſus, that great Shepherd of the Sheep, through the blood of the everlaſting Covenant, make you perfect in every good work to do his Will, working in you that which is well pleaſing in his ſight, through Jeſus Christ, to whom be glory for ever and ever. <hi>Amen. So prays,</hi>

            <head>The Occaſion of this <hi>Diſputation:</hi> And how Dr. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> came to be ingaged therein; According to the Account received from <hi>Goſport</hi> and <hi>Portſmouth.</hi> The Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was this:</head>
            <p>THE Congregation of Baptized Believers at <hi>Goſport,</hi> were ſo bleſſed with Succeſs in their Miniſtry, that in a ſhort time they had gathered Twenty Members, very worthy Perſons, who were added to them by Baptiſm. Many others were amuzed and put upon Enquiry. This ſtartled the Presbyterian Party, becauſe divers of them were of their Number, either Members or Benefactors; and they began to fear the Iſſue thereof.</p>
            <p>Whereupon <hi>Mr. Sam. Chandler,</hi> of <hi>Fareham,</hi> about five or ſix Miles from <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> a Presbyterian Miniſter, whom they much eſteemed for his Learning, was procured to come and Preach up the contrary Doctrine, firſt at <hi>Goſport,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards at <hi>Fortſmouth,</hi> upon <hi>Thurſdays,</hi> on purpoſe (as was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed) to put a Stop to this ſo hopeful a Beginning amongſt the Baptiſts, and hinder their Progreſs therein. And this was managed by him and his Admirers in ſuch a manner, as was to the Grief of ſuch as truly fear God in thoſe Parts. For it was given out, that <hi>Mr. Chandler</hi> would not only prove Infant Baptiſm from Scripture-Teſtimony, and anſwer all the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections of the Baptiſts againſt it; but alſo ſufficiently furniſh his Hearers with Arguments to defend their Practice.</p>
            <p>And in the Proſecution of this his Deſign, he took occaſion to make his Excurſions, wherein he ſpake very diminutively of thoſe in the <hi>Miniſtry;</hi> repreſenting them as Perſons ignorant of, and unacquainted with the Holy Scriptures. He alſo ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculed and miſ-repreſented the Manner of their Performance of this Holy Ordinance as it repreſents a Burial and a Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, wherein upon <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 3, 4. he makes too bold with the manner of our Lord's Burial, and the Apoſtles Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof to Holy Baptiſm. He might have been pleaſed to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:31621:10"/>
have wounded the poor Baptiſts through the Sides of ſome other Perſon than ſo great an Apoſtle.</p>
            <p>He alſo did greatly extol the Practice of Infant-Baptiſm, and the Uſe and Advantage of it to them, beyond thoſe of riper Years; and did inveigh againſt their manner of Practice with moſt ſevere Reflections. Upon this, the Presbyterian Party began to triumph over the Baptiſts, and boaſted, that what <hi>Mr. Chandler</hi> had ſaid upon that Point was unanſwerable.</p>
            <p>Whereupon, when this laſt Sermon was to be Preached, wherein he was to ſhew his great Skill in Anſwering our Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections: <hi>Mr. Bowes,</hi> and divers other Brethren of both the baptized Congregations, went and heard him. When he had done. <hi>Mr. Bowes</hi> deſired leave to ſpeak, and in a modeſt and Chriſtian-like Manner, did enter his Objection againſt what <hi>Mr. Chandler</hi> had ſpoken: and upon a meeting betwixt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they did mutually Agree, That the Points in Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence ſhould be publickly diſputed at <hi>Mr. Williams</hi> his <hi>Meeting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe</hi> in <hi>Portſmouth;</hi> and that <hi>Mr. Chandler</hi> and <hi>Dr. Ruſſel</hi> ſhould be the Diſputants.</p>
            <p>As touching <hi>Dr. Ruſſel,</hi> his being ingaged in it, it did not ariſe from any deſire in himſelf to be concerned in it; but from the preſſing Importunity of his Friends.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Church</hi> at <hi>Goſport</hi> being newly conſtituted, and being more particularly concerned (as the thing was circumſtanced) and ſuppoſing that all this Stir and Noiſe was chiefly deſigned againſt them, did firſt make their Application to him for his Aſſiſtance. And in the Name of the <hi>Church,</hi> a Letter was ſent to him by one of their worthy Brethren, wherein they expreſs themſelves after this manner.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">

                  <head>To our eſteemed Brother <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> we of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> at <hi>Goſport,</hi> ſend Greeting.</head>

He alſo received ſeveral other Letters, Signed by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and other Private Brethren, to preſs him to it.</p>
            <p>He did ſend them word, that it was his Opinion, it would be the beſt way for <hi>Mr. Chandler</hi> and himſelf to exchange ſome Letters betwixt them in the firſt place, to try the ſtrength and length of their Weapons; and thereby prevent a Publick Diſputation, if poſſible. But when they let him underſtand that the Matter was too far proceeded in, and ſo circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that nothing leſs than a Publick Diſpute could decide it, he then conſented to anſwer their Requeſt therein, becauſe (as they had ſignified to him) the Glory of God, the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his Truth, and the Good of Souls, was eminently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in ſuch a Publick Defence, eſpecially conſidering that the Presbyterian Party had given out, that we were afraid to meet them: But I ſhall detain you no longer from the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute it ſelf; an Account of which follows.</p>

               <p>THE Diſputants going to the Place of Meeting, between the Hours of Nine and Ten in the Morning, having took their Places, <hi>Dr. Ruſſel</hi> ſpake to this Effect.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen Foraſmuch as the Work we are going to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in, is a Part of Religious Exerciſe; It is my Opinion, we ought in the firſt place (as is uſual upon ſuch Occaſions) to be ſeeking God by Prayer; that his Preſence may be with us, and his Bleſſing upon our Endeavours.</p>
               <p>The Motion being accepted, <hi>Mr. Chandler</hi> began the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a ſhort Prayer, which being ended, the Queſtions and Preliminaries agreed upon, were read, which are as followeth;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whereas by Mr.</hi> Chandler's <hi>late Preaching on the Ordinance of Baptiſm, ſeveral Perſons have taken offence; and upon deſire of Satisfaction, it's mutually Agreed between us, whoſe Names are

under-written; That theſe Two Points be Amicably Diſputed in the following Order, with Relation to Manner, Time, and Place; as hereafter expreſs'd,</hi> viz.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Que.</hi> 1. Whether according to the Commiſſion of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, Adult Believers are only the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Subjects of Baptiſm: and not Infants?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Que.</hi> 2. Whether the Ordinance of Baptiſm as appointed by Chriſt, is to be Adminiſtred by Dipping, Plunging (or) Overwhelming only, and not otherways?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Agreed, the Diſputation be held at</hi> Portſmouth <hi>in Mr.</hi> William'<hi>s Meeting Place, on</hi> Friday <hi>the 10 of</hi> February <hi>next enſuing (if God permit) beginning at Nine in the Morning.

               <p>Here follows <hi>Mr. Chandler</hi>'s Apology to the People.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My Friends,</hi> It is not out of Vanity or Pride, I appear in this Place upon this Occaſion at this Time: Moſt of you know, and I ſuppoſe many of you have heard, that in the Courſe of my Lecture in this Place, I have Diſcourſed of the great Principles of Religion; and having explained the <hi>Creed,</hi> and the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Prayer,</hi> I came to give an Account of the Two Sacrament, of the <hi>New Teſtament;</hi> and therein was una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably concerned to ſpeak to thoſe Truths that are contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted by theſe Gentlemen here preſent.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that heard me, know that I was very Modeſt in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing my ſelf in this Controverſie: But a bold and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Challenge was given me, which I knew not how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe; unleſs I would betray the Truths I believe in my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, or confeſs my ſelf not able to vindicate them. And accordingly theſe Men have ſent for ſome Aſſiſtance to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe us in this Matter.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:31621:11"/>
I deſire theſe things may be handled with a great deal of Calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; that we may diſcourſe of things as becomes Chriſtians. And as we have the Favour of the Government both Civil and Military, ſo we may give them no occaſion to repent of allowing us this Liberty.</p>
               <p>And alſo I deſire that nothing may be done unbecoming this place, where we uſually meet together for the more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Worſhip of God. And I would have you join with me in this Petition; <hi>That God would grant his Truth may take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He then repeated the Queſtions to be Diſputed, and ſaid, Theſe are the Two Articles we are to Diſpute of at this Time. We Deny, and they Affirm.</p>
               <p>Then Dr. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> ſaid, Gentlemen, you know I was not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the drawing up of the preliminaries, and therefore I think it may be neceſſary, before we enter upon the Diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to know wherein we agree about the firſt Queſtion, and wherein we differ; that we may not diſcourſe about thoſe Things wherein we are Agreed.</p>
               <p>I do ſuppoſe, by the ſtating of the Queſtion, That you do own that Adult Believers are the proper Subjects of Baptiſm. And if you do, I would deſire you to declare your ſelves herein.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> ſaid, He did own that Adult Believers were the proper Subjects of Baptiſm, but not the only proper: Infants were to be baptized alſo.</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dr. <hi>Ruſſel.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>Then you own our Practice to be right.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. <hi>Chandler.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>Yes, if they have not been Baptized in their Infancy; then they are to be Baptized upon Profeſſion of their Faith, when they come to Years.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. <hi>Chandler.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>Yes, I do ſo.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dr. <hi>Ruſſel.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>I ſuppoſe you expect I ſhould be Opponent firſt.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. <hi>Chandler.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>Yes, that was Agreed.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dr. <hi>Ruſſel.</hi>

                  <p>If therefore I prove that Infants are not the proper Subjects of Baptiſm, you will allow that I perform what I have undertaken, we having no other Subjects in the Queſtion but Adult Believers, and Infants.</p>

And now I would know how we ſhall Diſpute; whether by Reading the Commiſſion, and making an Inference there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from, and proving that (if we are not agreed about it) from ſome other Text; or what way we ſhall proceed in.</p>

                  <p>You muſt do it Syllogiſtically; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore form your Argument.</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>My Argument is this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. If Chriſt hath no where required any of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to Baptize Infants, then the Baptiſm of Infants is not according to the Commiſſion of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>But Chriſt hath no where required any of his Miniſters to Baptize Infants;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Baptiſm of Infants is not according to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Chandler.</speaker>
                  <p>I diſtinguiſh here upon your Antecedent. If you mean that Chriſt hath not expreſly commanded In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants to be Baptized; then I deny the Conſequence of your <hi>Major.</hi> For Chriſt hath no where expreſly commanded In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants to be Baptized.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dr. <hi>Ruſſel.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>If you will inſiſt upon that, I can eaſily prove it. For ſome Perſons are expreſly commanded to be Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in the Commiſſion: Infants (by your own Confeſſion) are not expreſly commanded to be Baptized either in the Commiſſion, or elſewhere: But I have neither the Word Commanded, nor expreſly Commanded in my Argument; and you muſt Anſwer to my Argument.</p>
                  <p>For I agree with you, that Infants are no where expreſly commanded to be Baptized.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Chandler.</speaker>
                  <p>There is no need of that; but thoſe of your Way will not allow us to prove it by conſequence.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dr. Ruſſel</speaker>
                  <p>I ſay, that it's no where required: If you prove it any way required, it ſhall ſuffice.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Chandler.</speaker>
                  <p>If you will allow good Conſequences drawn from Scripture. I will deny your <hi>Minor.</hi>

                  <speaker>Dr. Ruſſel.</speaker>
                  <p>Then you muſt ſuppoſe that Chriſt hath requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſome of his Miniſters to Baptize Infants.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Leigh.</speaker>
                  <p>We diſtinguiſh between conſequential Truths, and expreſs Words.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dr. Ruſſel.</speaker>
                  <p>So do we: But I hope our Lord's Commiſſion about Holy Baptiſm, is delivered in expreſs Words, and not conſequential. The Term in my Argument is very lax, I do not there ſay Commanded, but required; and if you prove the Baptiſm of Infants any where required by Chriſt, it is ſufficient.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Chandler.</speaker>
                  <p>Will you allow genuine Conſequences drawn from Scripture?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Leigh.</speaker>
                  <p>Will you allow good Scripture Conſequences in this Caſe, or do you expect plain Scripture Words?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dr. Ruſſel.</speaker>
                  <p>What need is there of ſo many Words about this? Certainly <hi>Mr. Chandler</hi> is bound to fix upon ſome Anſwer to my Argument. I ſay again, the Term I uſe admits of any Proof; he is not thereby obliged to produce any expreſs Command, if he can do without it; if he prove that Chriſt hath any way required it, it will ſuffice.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Leigh.</speaker>

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dr. Ruſſel.</speaker>
                  <p>I think I expreſs my ſelf plainly enough, when I tell you, that if you prove it any ways requir'd, I will allow it.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>Mr. Robinſon, their Moderator, ſaith, Will you allow this of Conſequence, or not?</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dr. Ruſſel.</speaker>
                  <p>Let us not thus ſtumble at the Threſhold, how often muſt I tell you, that if you can prove it any way re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by Chriſt; prove it either by Conſequence, or which way you will, if you do but prove it, I will allow it. But you muſt remember that you are to prove it according to Chriſt's Commiſſion, (for thoſe are the Terms in the Queſton.) and I believe you will find a difficult Task to do that by Conſequence.</p>
                  <p>For ſuppoſe an Embaſſador ſhould declare to the Prince to whom he is ſent, That his Maſter hath given him Authority, by his Commiſſion, to negotiate with him about ſuch a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular matter that he ſhall name, and that he is charged to do this in his Maſter's Name and Stead. If when his <hi>Credentials</hi> are produced there is no ſuch thing mentioned therein, he cannot expect the Prince ſhould give credit to him therein, when he had told him before, it was a Part of his Maſter's Commiſſion (which is our Caſe:) And his alledging only conſequential Proofs after that, will not ſerve his turn. But if you think you can do it by Conſequences, you may try your Skill, with all my heart, ſo you do but prove it requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red according to Chriſt's Commiſſion; which is the thing in Queſtion between us.</p>

                  <p>What, from the Commiſſion?</p>
               </sp>
               <p>Mr. Robinſon the Moderator cries out to <hi>Mr. Chandler,</hi> Hold! <hi>Dr. Ruſſel</hi> muſt prove it by an univerſal Negative.</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dr. Ruſſel.</speaker>
                  <p>Then <hi>Mr. Chandler</hi> muſt deny ſome part of my Argument, which I have not yet been able to prevail with him to do.</p>

                  <p>Then I will make good my <hi>Minor</hi> thus: If Chriſt hath any where required any of his Miniſters to baptize In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, it's ſomewhere ſo recorded in the Holy Scriptures:</p>
                  <p>But it's no where ſo recorded in the Holy Scriptures:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> Chriſt hath not any where required any of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to baptize Infants.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Chandler.</speaker>
                  <p>What do you mean by being recorded?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dr. Ruſſel.</speaker>
                  <p>I hope you know what the word Recorded ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies. I mean any where ſo written.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Chandler.</speaker>
                  <p>To this I anſwer, by diſtinguiſhing again. If you mean by being Recorded in Scripture, being Recorded in expreſs Words, I deny your <hi>Major;</hi> but if you mean by Conſequence, I deny the <hi>Minor.</hi>

                  <p>If you do but prove it recorded, it is ſufficient.</p>

                  <p>If it be any where ſo recorded in Holy Scripture, <hi>Mr. Chandler,</hi> or ſome other Perſon is able to ſhew it.</p>
                  <p>But neither <hi>Mr. Chandler,</hi> not any other Perſon whatſoever, is able to ſhew it.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>Hold Sir, it is an univerſal Negative. You muſt give your Inſtance where it is ſo written. I appeal to your Moderator.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Robinſon.</speaker>
                  <p>You muſt prove it ſtill. Suppoſe <hi>Mr. Chand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi> cannot give an Inſtance, nor no body in the Company; you cannot thence infer that none in the World can.</p>

                  <speaker>Dr. Ruſſel.</speaker>
                  <p>This is in Effect to give away your Cauſe, when there are ſo many Men of Parts and Learning preſent; if none of them are able to give us one Inſtance from Scripture for Infant-baptiſm, we cannot expect that any body elſe ſhould.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, I would deſire thoſe Honourable Perſons and others in this Aſſembly that underſtand theſe things, to conſider that I am not fairly dealt with, and that I am under a great Diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, not having other learned Perſons to aſſiſt me as <hi>Mr. Chandler</hi> hath, and yet am forced to anſwer two or three at a time.

I hope here are ſome Honourable Perſons and others that underſtand Nature of this Controverſie, and they may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably expect that thoſe who have made ſuch a Noiſe about it, can give ſome tolerable Inſtance for it; and if they will do that, we will proceed to examine it.</p>

                  <p>There are many here know how that <hi>Mr. Chandler</hi> hath aſſerted and proved that Infants are the Subjects of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm; but you are not to call on him for that now. You did (by your Friends) undertake to prove the contrary, and it reſts upon you ſo to do.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dr Ruſſel.</speaker>
                  <p>I have already proved the contrary, and my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument will ſtand good till you give your Inſtance.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Robinſon.</speaker>
                  <p>If you will change Sides, <hi>Mr. Chandler,</hi> you may admit this Trick.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dr. Ruſſel.</speaker>
                  <p>Can you (at other times) boaſt of ſo many plain Scriptures for your Practice, and now you are brought to the Teſt about it, you are not able to produce one; what will the People think of you?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Leigh.</speaker>
                  <p>I will undertake in any Diſpute Philoſophical or Divine, in this manner immediately to turn the Opponency upon the Reſpondent. When I cannot prove the Aſſertion, I will preſently ſay, If you can bring any ſolid Proof for your Practice it is true, if not, falſe. And I appeal to the Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, whether it be not his Buſineſs to keep the Diſputants to the Rules of Diſpute.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Robinſon.</speaker>
                  <p>The Moderator is to regulate them if they tranſgreſs Bounds; but you have grosſly tranſgreſſed: I appeal to any that underſtand Logick, whether this be ſufferable for him thus to turn the Opponency upon <hi>Mr. Chandler.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <p>Then <hi>Dr. Smith</hi> ſtood up and ſaid, If I muſt ſpeak, then by your Leave, according to what I always underſtood, He that aſſerts muſt prove.</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dr. Ruſſel.</speaker>
                  <p>Then they having aſſerted that Infants are the Subjects of Baptiſm, they are to prove their Practice, eſpecially when they are forc'd upon it by an Univerſal Negative. We deſire but one ſingle Inſtance, and they will not aſſign it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Robinſon.</speaker>
                  <p>No; you are to prove your Argument.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dr. Ruſſel.</speaker>
                  <p>I have done that already, and therefore if Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> will confeſs he hath no Inſtance to give, I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to a new Argument.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>This Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> refuſed to do, and yet would not give his Inſtance.</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dr. Ruſſel.</speaker>
                  <p>If Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> can give no Inſtance, here are divers other Miniſters, Gentlemen of Parts and Learning: Have
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:31621:15"/>
none of them an Inſtance to produce? If you thus refuſe to produce it, the People will think you have none to give.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding this, none of them could be prevailed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to do it, although they were called upon, and challenged to give any one Inſtance (where it was ſo written) if they could.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon Dr. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> ſpake to this effect, Gentlemen, It may be you think I have but one Argument; if you will ſay no more to this, I am not willing to tire out the Auditory; I will therefore proceed to a New Argument.</p>
                  <p>But take notice (by the way) that my firſt Argument ſtands good, till you give your Inſtance to the contrary.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. If Infants are not capable to be made Diſciples of Chriſt by the Miniſtry of Men, then they cannot poſſibly be the Subjects of Baptiſm intended in Chriſt's Commiſſion.</p>
                  <p>But Infants are not capable to be made Diſciples of Chriſt by the Miniſtry of Men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> They cannot poſſibly be the Subjects of Baptiſm in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in Chriſt's Commiſſion.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> repeats the Argument and then ſaith, Here if you mean by being made Diſciples, Actual and Compleat Diſciples, I deny your <hi>Major:</hi> But if you mean ſuch as are entered into a School and given up to Inſtruction, then I deny your <hi>Minor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Dr. Ruſſel Repeats his <hi>Major,</hi> and deſires Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> to tell him what he denies in it. For (ſaith he) my Words are plain, to be made Diſciples by the Miniſtry of Men.</p>

                  <speaker>Dr. Ruſſel.</speaker>
                  <p>But what then doth he mean by denying my <hi>Major?</hi>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>He denies, that they that cannot be made Compleat Diſciples, are not intended in the Commiſſion.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>I hope the Reader will obſerve how often Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> was at a loſs, and Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> and Mr. <hi>Robinſon</hi> were forced to help him out with their Diſtinctions and equivocable Expreſſions.</p>
               <p>Here Dr <hi>Ruſſel</hi> (ſeeing they would not be brought to give any direct Anſwer) turns his Hypothetical into a Categorical Syllogiſm.</p>
               <sp>
                  <p>Whoſoever are uncapable to be made Diſciples by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of Men, they cannot be the Subjects of Baptiſm intended in Chriſt's Commiſſion:</p>
                  <p>But Infants are uncapable to be made Diſciples by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of Men:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> They cannot be the Subjects of Baptiſm intended in Chriſt's Commiſſion.</p>
                  <p>Now let Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> tell me what he means by being made Compleat, or Incompleat Diſciples by the Miniſtry of Men (according to my Argument) if he can.</p>

                  <speaker>Dr. Ruſſel.</speaker>

                  <p>If you had done this before, you had ſaved your ſelf and me much trouble. Then I prove it thus.</p>
                  <p>If our Lord in that Commiſſion given for Holy Baptiſm, hath commanded his Apoſtles, that were Men, to make Diſciples by their Miniſtry, and after that, to Baptize them, then the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of the <hi>Major</hi> is true.</p>
                  <p>But our Lord in that Commiſſion given for Holy Baptiſm hath commanded his Apoſtles, that were Men, to make Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples by their Miniſtry, and after that to Baptize them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Conſequence of the <hi>Major</hi> is true.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Leigh.</speaker>
                  <p>I diſtinguiſh thus. They may be entered into the Church in Order for Learning, and ſo they are Diſciples be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Baptiſm: Yet in a more viſible Senſe, they are made Diſciples by Baptiſm.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dr. Ruſſel.</speaker>
                  <p>Then you ſuppoſe Infants not capable to be made Diſciples by the Miniſtry of Men.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Chandler.</speaker>
                  <p>Not ſolemnly inveſted.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dr. Ruſſel.</speaker>
                  <p>We are not talking of that; the Queſtion betwixt us is, Whether they are capable to be made Diſciples by the Miniſtry of Men. Will you aſſert that?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Leigh.</speaker>
                  <p>We aſſert they are Diſciples, as Children of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, before Baptiſm.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dr. Ruſſel.</speaker>
                  <p>This is nothing to the purpoſe, but to ſpin out Time. <hi>Mr. Chandler</hi> or <hi>Mr. Leigh</hi> ſhould have anſwered to my Argument, which neither of them have done. For if Infants are Diſciples ſimply, as being Children of Believing Parents, before Baptiſm (as <hi>Mr. Leigh</hi> ſaith) then it is done, without any Miniſtetial Inſtruction. And therefore is ſo far from being an Anſwer to my Argument, that it is a meer Evaſion.</p>
                  <p>I therefore Argue thus upon them.</p>
                  <p>If Infants are not the Subjects of Teaching, according to Chriſt's Commiſſion, then they are not the Subjects of Baptiſm by that Commiſſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:31621:16"/>
But Infants are not the Subjects of Teaching, according to Chriſt's Commiſſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> They are not the Subjects of Baptiſm by that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</p>
                  <p>For what our Lord hath joined together, no Man ought to ſeparate.</p>
                  <p>But our Lord hath joined Teaching and Baptizing together.</p>
                  <p>Therefore no man ought to ſeparate.</p>
                  <p>And it is further manifeſt, That our Lord did not command his Father to make Diſciples by ſome ſecret Work of his; but he commanded his Apoſtles (that were Men) to make Diſciples by their Miniſtry; and that is the Point you are to Anſwer to.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Robinſon.</speaker>
                  <p>He denies they are uncapable to be made Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples by the Miniſtry of Men.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dr. Ruſſel.</speaker>
                  <p>Then by the way take notice, that he grants my <hi>Major</hi> to be true; that unleſs they are capable to be taught by the Miniſtry of Men, they cannot be the Subjects of Baptiſm. I ſhall therefore proceed to the proof of my <hi>Minor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If Infants have no knowledge to diſcern between Good and Evil, then they are not capable to be made Diſciples by the Miniſtry of Men.</p>
                  <p>But Infants have no Knowledge to diſcern between Good and Evil</p>
                  <p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Chandler.</speaker>
                  <p>You Trick all this while. I told you by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants being Diſciples, I meant their being ſolemnly Inveſted by Baptiſm.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dr. Ruſſel.</speaker>
                  <p>You ſtill miſtake, we are not ſpeaking of their Inveſtiture, but of the Prerequiſites of Baptiſm: And it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from what I have ſaid, that thoſe that are truly Baptized according to Chriſt's Commiſſion (which is the thing we are upon) muſt firſt be made Diſciples by the Miniſtry of Men. For the Commiſſion in <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 15, 16. is a Command to his Apoſtles to go into all the World, and Preach the Goſpel to every Creature, and that ſuch of them that were made Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples by their Preaching, they ſhould Baptize. And in <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. They are commanded to Diſciple all Nations, and to Baptize ſuch of them whom they had made Diſciples by Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>Now when I have ſhewed you, how that Infants not being capable thus to be made Diſciples, they cannot be the Subjects of Baptiſm intended in that Commiſſion; then you grant the Conſequence of the <hi>Major;</hi> and by denying my <hi>Minor,</hi> you ſay they are capable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:31621:17"/>
And when I have brought another Argument to prove my <hi>Minor,</hi> you then evade it by an indirect Anſwer.</p>
                  <p>Sir, you are bound to give a direct Anſwer to my Argument.</p>

                  <p>How often muſt we have this diſtinction repeated to keep us from the Point in hand. We are now upon this, Whether Infants have Knowledge to diſcern between Good and Evil; which is the <hi>medium</hi> I bring to prove the other by: Why do you not anſwer to that?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Chandler.</speaker>
                  <p>They have no Knowledge, yet are capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Incompleat Diſciples.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dr. Ruſſel.</speaker>
                  <p>If by Compleat, you mean perfectly ſo, I know not of any ſuch Chriſtian in the World.

                  </p>
                  <p>If the Goſpel in the Miniſtration of it, was appointed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Men what is Good, and what is evil, and Infants have no Knowledge to diſcern betwixt Good and Evil (as Mr. <hi>Chand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi> hath been forced to confeſs) then they are not capable to be made Diſciples by the Miniſtry of Men:</p>

               <p>Dr. Ruſſel Anſwers, Have I not put it into an Argument, and you will not ſuffer him to anſwer it? If you think he hath not ſufficiently done that already, let him do it again, and tell to what he means by it, if he can.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Leigh.</speaker>
                  <p>I appeal to any, whether a Child ſent to School to a Maſter, or Miſtreſs; given up by the Parents, and accepted by them; whether the Notion of a Scholar be not grounded on ſuch a Relation?</p>

                  <speaker>Dr. Ruſſel.</speaker>
                  <p>I ſpeak of Actual Diſciples, made ſo by Teaching; are theſe ſuch, who (by your own Confeſſion) know not one Letter of the Book? Theſe are Incompleat Scholars indeed Mr. <hi>Leigh.</hi> I believe there is a School-Maſter here; let him ſpeak whether ſuch be not immediately Scholars.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>Upon this, Mr. <hi>Ridge</hi> the School Maſter ſtood up and ſaid, Upon the Parents Dedication, and the Maſters Acceptation, and the payment of Entrance-Money, we do look upon him as a Scholar. Whereupon there followed a general Laughter.</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dr. Ruſſel.</speaker>
                  <p>I appeal to this Aſſembly, whether my Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment did not expreſs ſuch that were made Diſciples by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of Men. What therefore is the Reaſon of your making ſuch a noiſe and ſtir about ſuch being accounted Scholars ſo ſoon as they enter the School, before they know one Letter of the Book. Are theſe made Scholars by Teaching, when they have never learned, nor cannot learn; becauſe they have no Knowledges to diſcern between Good and Evil: And yet this is the Caſe of thoſe little Infants you pretend to Baptize.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Chandler.</speaker>
                  <p>We allow they are not capable of Knowledge to diſcern between Good and Evil, nor of being made Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Diſciples.</p>

                  <p>Then the Conſequence neceſſarily follows, that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are not at all intended in the Commiſſion of our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19.</p>

                  <p>There is no need of that, for Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> hath granted every part of my Argument.</p>
                  <p>For 1. He hath granted that Infants have no Knowledge to diſcern between Good and Evil.</p>
                  <p>2dly. That (according to my Argument) Infants are not capable to be made Diſciples by the Miniſtry of Men. And then it muſt unavoidably follow, they are not intended in Chriſt's Commiſſion.</p>

                  <p>We have not the whole of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>'s Writings in the New Teſtament; and this that he wrote to the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> is but a ſmall part thereof.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Leigh.</speaker>
                  <p>I will do it by a Simile.</p>
                  <p>You know that <hi>Paul</hi> wrote divers Epiſtles, and in them of different Subjects.</p>

It is as if a Man ſhould write a Book of ſeveral things, and when he hath finiſhed it, one comes and cuts off ſix Leaves thereof; and after this, there is a Queſtion ariſes, whether ſuch a Man hath writ any thing about ſuch a particular Subject. Now it doth not follow, that becauſe it is not contain'd in the reſt of his Book, that therefore it is not in the ſix Leaves that were cut off.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dr. Ruſſel.</speaker>
                  <p>If <hi>Mr. Leigh</hi> ſpeaks <hi>ad Rem,</hi> as I ſuppoſe he thinks he doth, then I thus infer upon him. Firſt, That he doth by this allow, that there is no Mention made of Infant-Baptiſm in any of thoſe Writings of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>'s, that we have bound up with the reſt of the Holy Scriptures. Secondly, He ſuppoſes there may be ſomething ſaid of it in thoſe ſix Leaves that were cut off after he had finiſhed his Epiſtles.</p>
                  <p>Now the Aſſembly of Divines tell us, that the Scriptures of the Old and New Teſtament are the only Rule to direct us in Matters of Worſhip. But whether <hi>Mr. Leigh</hi> be of their Mind I cannot tell.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dr. Ruſſel.</speaker>
                  <p>Then what you mean by it I know not, but I believe they meant what we have in the Bible, and not what is contained in thoſe ſix Leaves that were cut off, or elſe they deſigned to put a Cheat upon the whole World, which I do not ſuppoſe.</p>
                  <p>But as touching thoſe ſix Leaves, I conclude our Brethren have them not in their Cuſtody, becauſe I never heard them ſpeak any thing in the leaſt concerning it.</p>
                  <p>For my own part, I can ſpeak for my ſelf; I never ſaw them, nor heard of them till now; neither do I know any thing of the Matter. But if <hi>Mr. Leigh</hi> or his Brethren have them in their Cuſtody, I deſire they would produce them. And when they have ſo done, if they will pleaſe to favour us ſo far as firſt to prove that thoſe were the very ſix Leaves that were written by <hi>Paul,</hi> we will take the Pains to examine them: And if it then appears that there is any ſuch thing contained in them as <hi>Mr. Leigh</hi> ſpeaks of, we will allow it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Mr. Leigh</hi> was angry hereupon, ſaying, What do you talk of our being the keepers of them? and what do you talk of all the New Teſtament? is all the New Teſtament the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>'s writings?</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dr. Ruſſel.</speaker>
                  <p>I ſay I do not confine you to <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles, much leſs pretend all the new Teſtament to be of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>'s Writing, as you would inſinuate to the People; but my Words are, It's no where ſo declared in the Writings of the New Teſtament. And do you produce one Inſtance that it is, if you can, for that will put an Iſſue to our Controverſie.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Leigh.</speaker>
                  <p>You would refer what <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith to the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> to the whole New Teſtament.</p>

                  <speaker>Dr. Ruſſel.</speaker>
                  <p>I hope you will own the Holy Scriptures to be the only Rule to direct us in Matters of Worſhip.</p>

               <p>Here <hi>Mr. Leigh</hi> breaks in upon the Doctor, not permitting him to ſpeak what he had to ſay: but inſtead thereof, he ſaith, I will not own that we have all the Sermous that <hi>Paul</hi> preached to the Church at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and if we had, he might preach it to ſome others though he did not to them, for this was ſpoken to them.</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dr. Ruſſel.</speaker>
                  <p>I refer you to the Scripture. You ſay that <hi>Paul</hi> might declare ſome ſuch thing, and yet it may not be recorded in the Scripture. The Words are plain. <hi>I have not ſhunned to declare to you all the Counſel of God,</hi> Acts 20. 27. And in Ver. 20. <hi>I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you.</hi> And I do not ſuppoſe that <hi>Paul</hi> taught one Doctrine in one Church and another Doctrine in another. For in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 17. He tells that Church, <hi>Timothy ſhall bring you into remembrance of my ways in Chriſt as I teach every where in every Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides, he doth not only tell them that he had ſo diſcharg'd his Office among them as to be free from the Guilt of their Blood, but that he was alſo free from the Blood of all Men, Ver. 21. Teſtifying to the <hi>Jews</hi> and alſo to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance toward God, and Faith toward our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>And I further add, That if <hi>Paul</hi> never taught Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm in the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> nor in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> nor in any other Place, I hope you will then acknowledge it to be no Goſpel inſtitution, nor any Part of the Counſel of God, nor yet profitable for the Church of God: And there is no Record in Holy Scripture of his ſo doing.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Leigh.</speaker>
                  <p>I ſay <hi>Paul</hi>'s Writings are not the hundredth Part of what <hi>Paul</hi> preached. We cannot ſuppoſe that in thoſe ſix Chapters to the <hi>Epheſians</hi> he could contrive to put down the whole of his Preaching to them.</p>

                  <p>Sir, you might have ſpared all thisLabour; for I am ſatisfied the People will not trouble themſelves to ſeek for it any where elſe, but only in the Writings of the New Teſtament; and if they will take my Word I can aſſure them 'tis not there to be found. And I perceive you think ſo too, or elſe you need not referr them to <hi>Paul</hi>'s Sermons which are not written. <hi>I have heard, indeed, of ſome unwritten Traditions that are lock'd up in the Pope's Ereaſt, to be delivered out as he finds Occaſion for the ſerving of a Turn; but I never knew that the Presbyterians were ever intruſted with any ſuch Treaſure.</hi>

                  <p>Then you deny my <hi>Minor,</hi> which is the thing you ſhould have done before, only you were afraid of being brought to give an Inſtance. Now by denying my <hi>Minor,</hi> you ſay it's ſomewhere ſo recorded in the Writings of the New Teſtament, that <hi>Paul</hi> did declare the Baptiſm of Infants to be a Goſpel-inſtitution, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And, to prove it is not, I argue thus.</p>
                  <p>If it be ſo recorded in the Writings of the New Teſtament, then <hi>Mr. Leigh</hi> or ſome body elſe is able to ſhew it.</p>

                  <p>Then I ſay it is not written in the Commiſſion that <hi>Paul</hi> did ever declare any thing concerning the Baptiſm of Infants.</p>
                  <p>But what do you bring this for now? You might have done it upon the firſt Argument, when we were upon the Commiſſion; but it's wholly improper now; for this that we are now upon, is, Whether the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> hath any where ſo declared it.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>Reader, Obſerve theſe Mens Trifling. Do they not know as well as we, that the Commiſſion of our Lord for Holy Baptiſm was given long before <hi>Paul</hi>'s Converſion; and yet they have the Confidence to affirm before ſo great an Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, That it is written in the Commiſſion, that <hi>Paul</hi> did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the Baptiſm of Infants to be a Goſpel-inſtitution, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is the thing expreſſed in my Argument.</p>

                  <speaker>Dr. Ruſſel.</speaker>
                  <p>If I do not underſtand thoſe Rules when I have occaſion for them, I will come to you and learn.</p>
                  <p>But to return to Mr. <hi>Leigh,</hi> for I have not done with him yet: Sir, you have aſſigned the Commiſſion to prove that <hi>Paul</hi> did declare Infant-Baptiſm to be a Goſpel-Inſtitution, part of the Counſel of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now it's impoſſible that ſhould be written in the Commiſſion, as I have told you before: You muſt therefore ſhew us where it is ſo Recorded in ſome other part of the <hi>New Teſtament;</hi> and not aſſign a place where there can be no mention of it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Leigh.</speaker>
                  <p>He ſays he gives us the Latitude of the whole <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> but will not admit of the Commiſſion, becauſe that doth not ſay that <hi>Paul</hi> hath ſo declared.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dr. Ruſſel.</speaker>
                  <p>And there is very good reaſon for it, for the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paul</hi> is now under conſideration, as mention'd in my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument; who ſolemnly proteſteth, that in the diſcharge of his Miniſtry, he had freed himſelf from the blood of all Men, in delivering to them all that his Maſter had given him in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. That he had not ſhunned to declare all the Counſel of God, he had kept back nothing that was profitable for the Church of God; but as faithful Steward of the Myſteries of God, he did diſpence the Word, as himſelf declares in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 1, 2. And I verily believe, that <hi>Paul</hi> was as Faithful, as Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, and as Laborous a Servant as ever Chriſt had upon Earth. And therefore the force of my Argument depends upon this, That if <hi>Paul</hi> never ſaid one word about Infant-Baptiſm, then it can be no part of the Counſel of God, nor a Goſpel In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, nor ever given him in Commiſſion by his Lord and Maſter.</p>
                  <p>You have denied my <hi>Minor;</hi> I have proved it by bringing you to an Inſtance by an Univerſal Negative. You have aſſigned the Commiſſion; I have ſhewed you the impoſſibility of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it from thence. I have preſſed you to aſſign ſome other part of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> for an Inſtance. I have not as yet been able no obtain it. Here are divers Men of Parts and Learning among you, can none of you produce ſo much as one Inſtance to prove it? Surely the People muſt needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude you have none to give. I therefore challenge you to produce the place where it is written, that <hi>Paul</hi> ever ſaid one word of Infant-Baptiſm. And till that be done, my Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will ſtand good.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Leigh.</speaker>
                  <p>If <hi>Paul</hi> did not declare it, if we have other places apparent and plain, at leaſt conſequential, it is ſufficient.</p>

                  <p>This is not an Anſwer to my Argument, you might have gone here upon the other, but cannot upon this; why did you not aſſign ſome of thoſe places then?</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. Chriſt's Commiſſion doth ſhew who are to be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.</p>
                  <p>But it doth not ſhew that Infants are to be Baptized:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> Infants are not the Subjects of Baptiſm according to Chriſt's Commiſſion.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. <hi>Leigh.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>I deny the <hi>Minor.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dr. Ruſſel.</speaker>
                  <p>By ſo doing, you ſuppoſe it doth ſhew it.</p>
                  <p>I therefore thus Argue</p>
                  <p>If the Commiſſion doth ſhew that Infants are to be Baptized, Mr. <hi>Leigh,</hi> or ſome other Perſon can ſhew it us in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</p>
                  <p>But neither Mr. <hi>Leigh,</hi> nor any other Perſon is able to ſhew it us in the Commiſſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Commiſſion doth not ſhew that Infants are to be Baptized.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. <hi>Leigh.</hi>
                  </speaker>

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dr. Ruſſel.</speaker>
                  <p>I beg your favour; Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> aſſerted in his Sermon, That it was the Infants of Believing Parents that were to be Baptized: And that it was neceſſary Men ſhould Repent and Believe, otherwiſe they had no Right to this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance. And if we were ſent (ſaith he) into an Heathen Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we ought to ingage Men to Repent and Believe, before we Adminiſter this Ordinance to them. Here are Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions required in the Perſons to be Baptized (by your own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion) without which you muſt not Adminiſter it. And it is contrary both to your own Principles and Practice, to Baptize Jews, Turks and Heathens, and all their Infants, without previous Qualifications to fit them for it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. <hi>Leigh.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>I ſay it is included in the Word, All Nations: Do you prove it is not.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dr. Ruſſel.</speaker>
                  <p>You have brought an Inſtance, and it is your buſineſs to make good your own Inſtance; otherwiſe my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument ſtands firm and untouch'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:31621:21"/>
But if I ſhew there are ſome Qualifications required in the Commiſſion, and prove that thoſe cannot be found in Infants; then Infants cannot be included in the Word, All Nations.</p>
                  <p>I tell you he hath commanded us to Baptize ſome Perſons, but he hath not commanded us to Baptize any Infants; which I thus prove.</p>
                  <p>If thoſe that Chriſt in his Commiſſion hath commanded to be Baptized, muſt firſt be made Diſciples according to that Commiſſion; then Infants are not to be Baptized by Virtue of that Commiſſion.</p>
                  <p>But thoſe that Chriſt in his Commiſſion hath commanded to be Baptized, muſt firſt be made Diſciples according to that Commiſſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> Infants are not to be Baptized by Virtue of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</p>

                  <speaker>Dr. Ruſſel.</speaker>
                  <p>Then I will make it Categorical.</p>
                  <p>All thoſe required to be Baptized by Chriſt's Commiſſion, are Diſciples: Infants are not capable to be Diſciples, as I have already proved.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> Not required to be Baptized by Chriſt's Commiſſion.</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>I deny your whole Argument: That all that Chriſt requires to be Baptized, are Diſciples, and that Infants are not capable.</p>

                  <p>If no other but Diſciples are expreſs'd in the Commiſſion, then the <hi>Major</hi> is true.</p>
                  <p>And if Infants are uncapable to be made Diſciples, then the <hi>Minor</hi> is true alſo.</p>

                  <p>But here are Diſciples mentioned in the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and none but ſuch that are made ſo by the Miniſtry of Men.</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>You talk of the Commiſſion: It is the good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences I inſiſt upon; and ſay, Perſons are not to be Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Diſciples before they are Baptized; nor actually Taught before they are Diſciples.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dr. Ruſſel.</speaker>
                  <p>Perhaps you mean a man is not a Compleat Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, if he hath not attained to the higheſt Perfection he is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of whilſt in this Life; although he hath been a real Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian for many Years.

                  <p>I did not know but you might have had a Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for <hi>Mr. Calvin;</hi> but ſeeing it's otherwiſe, I will thus Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue from the Commiſſion.</p>
                  <p>If there be an expreſs Command in our Lord's Commiſſion for the Baptizing of ſome Perſons, and there be no expreſs Command neither there nor elſewhere, for the Baptizing of Infants; then the Baptiſm of Infants is not contained in that Commiſſion:</p>

                  <speaker>Dr. <hi>Ruſſel.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>What again <hi>Mr. Robinſon?</hi> muſt I always be thus broke in upon by you; What is the meaning of it? When you ſee you are like to be pinched upon an Argument, then you make it your buſineſs to hinder me from ſpeaking: Doth this become a Moderator?</p>
                  <p>I beg I may have Liberty to ſpeak out, and not be thus taken up in the midſt of an Argument. Pray, Sir, remember what the Wiſe man ſaith of ſuch a one, that anſwers a matter before he hears it.</p>
                  <p>I ſay, if there be an expreſs Command in our Lord's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion for the Baptizing of ſome Perſons, and there be no expreſs Command neither there nor elſewhere for the Baptizing of Infants; then the Baptiſm of Infants is not contained in that Commiſſion:</p>
                  <p>But there is an expreſs Command in our Lord's Commiſſion for: the Baptizing of ſome Perſons, and there is no expreſs Command either there or elſewhere for the Baptizing of Infants:</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>Inſtead of giving his Anſwer to the Argument, he ſhams it off after this manner; ſaying, I appeal to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Though he allowed Conſequences but now, yet now he requires an expreſs Scripture. And yet I ſay, If Nations in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude Infants, they are expreſly mentioned.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Upon this, Mr.</hi> Robinſon <hi>turns Dictator, and ſays to Mr.</hi> Leigh, You were better deny his Conſequence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dr. Ruſſel</hi> ſaith, Pray, Mr. <hi>Leigh,</hi> be pleaſed to change places with Mr. <hi>Robinſon,</hi> let him be Diſputant, and you Moderator; for I perceive neither you, nor I are able to pleaſe him. <hi>This was refuſed. Upon which Dr.</hi> Ruſſel <hi>ſaid to Mr.</hi> Robinſon, Pray Sir, do not you thus Dictate to him, I have none to Dictate to me: Pray let him anſwer my Argument.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Here Mr.</hi> Leigh <hi>did as</hi> Mr. Robinſon <hi>had taught him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the Conſequence; and alſo that an expreſs Command was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Authorize the Baptizing of Infants.</hi>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>My Argument was, If there be an expreſs Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for the Baptizing of ſome Perſons, you deny the Sequel of the <hi>Major;</hi> and in ſo doing you ſay, That notwithſtanding there is no expreſs Command for the Baptizing of Infants, neither there nor elſewhere in all the Holy Scripture; yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs they are intended in the Commiſſion.</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>And I ſay, if there be an expreſs Command for the Baptizing of ſome Perſons; but none at all for the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing of Infants: Then they are not at all intended in that Commiſſion.</p>
               </sp>

                  <p>I deny firſt the ſequel of the <hi>Major,</hi> and then I will deny your <hi>Minor.</hi>

                  <speaker>Dr. Ruſſel.</speaker>
                  <p>This ſeems very ſtrange, that when I have made it appear ſo evidently from the Commiſſion it ſelf, that there is an expreſs Command for the Baptizing of ſome Perſons; and yet it ſhould not be allowed as a neceſſary Conſequence from the Premiſes, that Infants are not intended; when your ſelves have confeſſed there is no expreſs Command in all the Scriptures, for the Baptizing of Infants.</p>

                  <speaker>Dr. Ruſſel.</speaker>
                  <p>Then I will prove that there is an expreſs Command for the Baptizing of ſome Perſons, from the Commiſſion it ſelf.</p>

               <sp>

                  <speaker>Dr. Ruſſel.</speaker>
                  <p>And I bring the Commiſſion to prove it. But you ſay, that notwithſtanding our Lord hath expreſly commanded
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:31621:23"/>
ſome Perſons to be Baptized; although he hath not commanded Infants to be Baptized, yet they may be ſome of that Number. Hath Chriſt two ſorts of Subjects that he commands to be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in that Commiſſion? Or, rather, are ſome commanded, and others not commanded, and yet both to be Baptized; the one by a Command, and the other without?</p>
               </sp>
               <p>
                  <hi>Here</hi> Mr. Leigh <hi>refuſes</hi> to <hi>Anſwer, and cries out,</hi> Put it into a Syllogiſm.</p>

                  <p>If no Perſons are to be Baptized according to that Commiſſion, but what are there expreſly commanded; and Infants are not ſo commanded; then the Conſequence of the <hi>Major</hi> is true:</p>
                  <p>But no Perſons are to be Baptized, according to that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, but what are there expreſly commanded; and Infants, are not ſo commanded:</p>

                  <p>I repeat it not for my own Knowledge, but for the Peoples Information. And I prove my <hi>Minor</hi> thus:</p>
                  <p>If the words of the Commiſſion are expreſs Command to the Apoſtles, to direct them who they ſhould Baptize, then the <hi>Minor</hi> is true:</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dr. Ruſſel.</speaker>
                  <p>If there be no other Commiſſion of our Lord for Holy Baptiſm, but what is Recorded in <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. and <hi>Mark</hi> 16. then the <hi>Minor</hi> is true:</p>
                  <p>But there is no other: <hi>Ergo,</hi> The <hi>Minor</hi> is true.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. <hi>Leigh.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>I deny tae ſequel of your <hi>Major.</hi>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>We are ſo: But we ſay good Conſequences de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from the Commiſſion, are ſufficient.</p>

                  <p>So you may if you pleaſe; but I had rather walk exactly according to the Commiſſion of our Lord, than by ſuch Conſequences wherein I may be deceived.</p>

If there be no manner of Allowance given them to baptize any other but what they are expreſly commanded, then the Sequel of the <hi>Major</hi> is true:</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Leigh.</speaker>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dr. Ruſſel.</speaker>
                  <p>If the Words in the Commiſſion about Holy Baptiſm be a Command from Chriſt to his Apoſtles, then the <hi>Minor</hi> is true:</p>
                  <p>But the Words in the Commiſſion about Holy Baptiſm are a Command from Chriſt to his Apoſtles:</p>
                  <p>

                  <speaker>Dr. Ruſſel.</speaker>
                  <p>My Argument ſaith, They have not Allowance to baptize any other. I am now therefore to prove that the Commiſſion is Command to them, if you deny it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Leigh.</speaker>
                  <p>I allow that the Command is expreſs'd: But I ſay the Subjects are to be brought in by Conſequence.</p>

                  <speaker>Dr. Ruſſel.</speaker>
                  <p>Then I will prove that the Subjects are expreſs'd.</p>
                  <p>If Chriſt did command his Apoſtles to baptize ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and are made Diſciples, then the Subjects are expreſs'd:</p>
                  <p>But Chriſt did Command his Apoſtles to baptize ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and are made Diſciples:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Subjects are expreſs'd.</p>

                  <p>I find a fault with your Syllogiſm; your <hi>Major</hi> ſhould be Univerſal.</p>

                  <speaker>Dr Ruſſel.</speaker>
                  <p>I was to prove there is a Command, with Reſpect to the Subjects; and therefore I have form'd the Syllogiſm right. For it is evident that Believers and Diſciples are the Subjects they are commanded to baptize.</p>

                  <p>Is not that the ſame which I ſay you ſaid? I know you allowed there was a Command for the thing it ſelf, but not for the Subjects. And therefore I have anſwered rightly, and your Oppoſition is unreaſonable.</p>

                  <p>We muſt all confeſs that Jeſus Chriſt gave Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to baptize Believers when at the age of Maturity. Such as were before <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Greeks,</hi> and Newly-believing in the Lord Jeſus, were thereupon to be baptized; but afterwards the Children of thoſe Believers.</p>

                  <p>But I hope <hi>Mr. Leigh</hi> will allow our Saviour's Words to be True; That all thoſe his Apoſtles preached to, according to his Commiſſion, if they did not believe, they ſhould be damned. For of ſuch it is ſaid, <hi>He that believeth not, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned already, becauſe he hath not believed in the Name of the only begotten Son of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But as touching Infants, I am far from believing that God hath decreed them (as ſuch) to eternal Damnation. I will rather believe that all Infants dying in their Infancy are ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, than conclude that any of them are damned. And I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you do not know the contrary. If you do, I deſire you would tell the People ſo.</p>

                  <p>Becauſe I think it's reaſonable you ſhould tell the People what your Opinion is, ſeeing you have ſtarted it; for you ſee I have given my Opinion freely about it; and if you think otherwiſe, pray tell the People ſo.</p>
                  <p>For then I conceive that your Baptizing their Infants will do them no good; for you cannot alter the Decrees of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: Or if you believe, as the Papiſts do, that Grace is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to them barely by the Act done, notwithſtanding the Children are wholly paſſive in it, pray tell us ſo.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Mr. Williams</hi> proved his <hi>Minor</hi> thus:</p>

               <p>If none can believe on Jeſus Chriſt, that never heard of Jeſus Chriſt, then Infants are incapable of believing:</p>
               <p>But none can believe on Jeſus Chriſt, that never heard of Jeſus Chriſt:</p>

                  <hi>Mr. Leigh</hi> denied the Sequel of the <hi>Major.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But he ſhould have remembred what is written, <hi>Rom. 10, 14. How ſhall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how ſhall they hear without a Preacher?</hi> And I do not ſuppoſe our Antagoniſts think they are obliged to preach to New-born Infants. And yet the Adminiſtration of Baptiſm is (by the Commiſſion) reſtrained to ſuch as are made Believers by the Preaching of the Word.</p>
               <p>Theſe Arguments being ſufficient to prove the Incapacity of Infants believing, the next Argument <hi>Mr. Williams</hi> offer'd, was (from thence) to prove that Infants could not be the Subjects of Baptiſm according to Chriſt's Commiſſion.</p>
               <p>If the Adminiſtrator muſt have an Account of the Faith of the Subject before he baptize him, then Infants are not the Subjects of Baptiſm according to Chriſt's Commiſſion:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:31621:25"/>
But the Adminiſtrator muſt have an Account of the Faith of the Subject before he baptize him:</p>
               <p>Therefore Infants are not the Subjects of Baptiſm according to Chriſt's Commiſſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr. Leigh</hi> denied the <hi>Minor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the Proof of which, <hi>Mr. Williams</hi> urged two Scriptures, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 36, 37. and <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. and ſaid, when the Eunuch propoſed for Baptiſm, <hi>Philip</hi> tells him, <hi>If thou believeſt with all thy heart, thou mayſt.</hi> The contrary (that fairly offers it ſelf) is this; That if thou doſt not believe with all thine Heart, thou mayſt not. And upon this, the Eunuch declared his Faith before he was Baptized.</p>
               <p>From whence it's evident, the Eunuch was content to be taught; <hi>Philip</hi> teaches him; and yet after this, he muſt know whether he believes before he baptized him. Therefore it follows, they muſt have actual Learning; and the Miniſter muſt alſo know that they have it before he baptize them.</p>
               <p>And in <hi>Mat. 28. 19 Go diſciple to me all Nations, baptizing them.</hi> From whence I thus argue.</p>
               <p>If Miniſters have no Commiſſion to baptize any but ſuch as are diſcipled to Chriſt, then they muſt have an Account of their Diſcipleſhip before they baptize them:</p>
               <p>But Miniſters have no Commiſſion to baptize any but ſuch as are diſcipled to Chriſt:</p>
               <p>Therefore they muſt have an Account of their Diſcipleſhip before they baptize them.</p>
               <p>To which was added, That <hi>Eraſmus</hi> in his Paraphraſe upon the New Teſtament, reads the Commiſſion thus, <hi>Go and teach all Nations, and when they have learned, dip them.</hi> And I fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſay, If the Adminiſtrator muſt have an Account of the Perſon's Learning before he be baptized, then a bare going to School is not ſufficient to conſtitute him a Diſciple.</p>

                  <p>Why muſt <hi>Eraſmus</hi> be thus ſlighted? Here are ſome Honourable Perſons know very well, that <hi>Eraſmus</hi> was a Man not to be deſpiſed for his Skill about the Etymology of a Greek Word. But any thing ſerves your turn at a Pinch.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Leigh.</speaker>
                  <p>He quotes <hi>Eraſmus;</hi> and it's well known he was between Papiſt and Proteſtant. Now many of theſe Men, ſpeaking againſt Infant-Baptiſm, will call it Popery; and yet he quotes <hi>Eraſmus</hi> for their Judgment.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>Now, foraſmuch as <hi>Mr. Leigh</hi> ſlipp'd the Argument, and only replied to that of <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> that he was an <hi>Inter-Papist,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mr. Williams</hi> gave him this Anſwer.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:31621:25"/>
Sir, You have heard my Argument to which you have given no Anſwer. As touching <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> I did not quote him as building my Faith on his Authority, but for his Judgment; it being the Tranſlation of a Man that underſtood the Original: And although he was not accounted one of the beſt of Men; yet he was accounted one of the beſt of Scholars in his Time.</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. <hi>Leigh.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>And now as to the Eunuch, he was a Proſelyte too, and his Infants, if he had any, were to be taken in alſo. <hi>Philip</hi> comes to him and he requires a Confeſſion of his Faith, becauſe he was a grown Man. Yet had he had an Infant with him, he had had a Right to this Ordinance after he believed. When by your Opinion it muſt be caſt out; becauſe not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Actual Believing.</p>
                  <p>Now I deny that he that Adminiſters the Ordinance, muſt always have an account of the Perſon, whether he hath Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, or not.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>(I ſuppoſe Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> forgot himſelf, to talk of an Eunuch's having Children. It puts me in mind of a Story I lately heard, of a Presbyterian Miniſter that undertook (in a Sermon) to prove Infant-Baptiſm, and to that end choſe this Text for his purpoſe, of <hi>Philip's Baptizing the Eunuch.</hi> And when he had inſiſted ſome time upon it, he ſpeaks after this manner to the People: <hi>Beloved, when you are gone, perhaps you will ſay, What is all this to the purpoſe? Here is not one word of Infants in the Text. It is true,</hi> ſays he, <hi>there is not, but I will tell you how that comes in: Had he had his Wife and Children with him, they had then been Baptized as Well as himſelf: But they were at a great diſtance from him; but as ſoon as he came home, immediately he Baptized them all.</hi> I will make no Comment upon it, but only this. If theſe Gentlemen know what an Eunuch is, then it's vain Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling: If they do not, let them go to the Grand Senior's <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio</hi> and learn.)</p>

                  <p>We have plain direction for what I have ſaid; <hi>Philip</hi> ſaid to the Eunuch, <hi>If thou believeſt with all thine heart, thou mayeſt.</hi> And accordingly he took an account of his Faith.</p>
                  <p>And in the Commiſſion, <hi>Go Diſciple all Nations, Baptizing them.</hi> From whence it's evident, it was thoſe they had made Diſciples, that they were to Baptize.

               <p>But I will refer the Reader to a better Authority than a School-boy: The late Reverend and Learned Miniſter of the Goſpel, Mr. <hi>John Goſnold,</hi> in his Book Entituled, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>This <hi>Them</hi> then muſt have reference to Diſciples, to ſuch as are firſt Taught:</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> paſſes by this trivial Flouriſh; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to a new Argument.</p>

               <p>If a Perſon cannot be his Diſciple unleſs he deny both Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Self and Perſonal Self, then the Sequel is true:</p>

               <p>Are you of <hi>Mr. Chandler's</hi> mind in this Matter? <hi>He ſays,</hi> That Baptiſm is an Initiating Ordinance.</p>

                  <p>Then make Senſe of your Argument, if you can: For it will run thus.</p>
                  <p>If Infants are already viſible Members of the Church, then they are to be Baptized that they may be made ſo.</p>
                  <p>It is as if I ſhould ſay, That becauſe ſuch a Man is in this Houſe already, therefore there muſt ſome Act paſs upon him to bring him in, when he is actually in the Houſe before. Make Senſe of this, if you can.</p>

                  <p>But there is no other Initiating Ordinance into the Church beſides Baptiſm:</p>

                  <p>What, doth not Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> know the difference between the <hi>Major</hi> and <hi>Minor?</hi> I deny the <hi>Minor,</hi> and his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to prove the Sequel of the <hi>Major;</hi> which I had confute<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I ſhall prove my <hi>Minor,</hi> by an Induction of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
                  <p>There are divers Acceptations of the Kingdom of Heaven in Scripture. As,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It ſignifies the Laws and Promiſes of the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Graces of the Kingdom, whereby we are ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to obſerve thoſe Laws. And thus it is ſet forth by a grain of Muſtard-ſeed, by Leaven, and the like.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It ſometimes ſignifies Jeſus Chriſt his Management of his Subjects on Earth.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And ſometimes it ſignifies the happineſs of the Saints in Glory.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And many times it is taken for the viſible Church Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant. And in no other Senſe but this laſt, can it be taken in this Scripture to make good Senſe of it; which I ſhall prove by an Argument of Induction.</p>
                  <p>If it be Nonſenſe to ſay, Of ſuch is the Laws and Promiſes of the Kingdom; If it be Nonſenſe to ſay, Of ſuch is the Graces of the Kingdom, If it be Nonſenſe to ſay, Of ſuch is Chriſt's Management of his Subjects on Earth; If it be Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe to ſay, Of ſuch is the Happineſs of the Saints in Glory; and it be good Senſe to ſay. Of ſuch is the viſible Church; then the viſible Church is in part made up of little Children:</p>

                  <p>There is ſo much Nonſenſe in this Argument. I know not well how to make Senſe of it: It ſeems to me little to the purpoſe. But however, I will deny your <hi>Minor,</hi> and ſay, It is good Senſe to ſay, that little Children belong to the Kingdom of Glory.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>
                  <hi>I pray obſerve (by the way) what ſort of Subjects Mr.</hi> Leigh'<hi>s Church muſt conſiſt of; if they have no Intereſt in the Graces of the Kingdom, nor yet in the Glory of the Kingdom.</hi>

                  <speaker>Mr. Leigh.</speaker>
                  <p>I ſay it's Nonſenſe to underſtand it otherwiſe.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>And upon this he deſired, that all thoſe who were ſatisfied with what he had ſaid ſhould hold up their hands. And of that great Multitude, there was but a very few that did it: So that it was manifeſt they were not ſatisfied with what he had ſaid.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Williams.</speaker>
                  <p>Is it Nonſenſe then to ſay, that any Infants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Kingdom of Glory?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Leigh.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, while they are in their Infant State; for when arrived to Glory, they are perfect as grown Men, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they were on Earth. Otherwiſe we muſt ſay that there are Infants of two foot long, poor, weak, ignorant things in Glory: Therefore it muſt be thus taken, for we muſt make good Senſe of Scripture.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Williams.</speaker>
                  <p>I deny you <hi>Minor,</hi> and ſhall form an oppoſite Argument thus:</p>
                  <p>If Infants are neither Members of the Univerſal viſible Church, nor yet of a particular Conſtituted Church, then they are not Members of the viſible Church at all:</p>
                  <p>But they are neither Members of the Univerſal viſible Church, nor yet of a particular Conſtituted Church:</p>
                  <p>Therefore they are not Members of the viſible Church at all.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Leigh <hi>took no notice of this Argument, but ſaid,</hi> It did not belong to a Reſpondent to form an Argument.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To which Mr.</hi> Williams <hi>Reply'd,</hi> My work is to clear the Truth; I will not be ty'd up to your Rules of Diſputation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr. Robinſon</hi> required an expreſs prohibition of Infants Church Memberſhip.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr. Williams</hi> Reply'd, That is fine indeed; Pray give us an expreſs prohibition of Baptizing with Cream, and Spittle, and Salt, and Oyl; and the uſe of the Croſs in Baptiſm: (all which you reject) and of many things more that might be brought into the Worſhip of God. <hi>And to this no Reply was made.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Leigh <hi>inſiſting again upon his Argument for excluding In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants out of the Kingdom of Heaven, from</hi> Matth. 19. <hi>affirming,</hi>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:31621:29"/>
that from thence it was Nonſenſe to ſay, they were the Subjects of Glory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr. Williams</hi> ſaid, We muſt diſtinguiſh between a Title to Glory, and the actual Enjoyment of Glory. Elect Infants have a Title to Glory, by Virtue of the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed unto them; although they are not actually in it.</p>
               <p>In the next place Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> denied the <hi>Major,</hi> and proved to him from <hi>Matth</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>3 7. That Church-Memberſhip could not be the ground of Baptiſm; becauſe thoſe many Phariſees and others, that came and offer'd themſelves to <hi>John</hi> for Baptiſm, were Church-Members: And yet <hi>John</hi> denied to admit them to Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Here Mr.</hi> Leigh <hi>diſtinguiſhed between Church-Members</hi> de jure, <hi>and ſuch that were only ſo</hi> de facto.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr. Williams</hi> asked him, whether he did own them to be Church-Members <hi>de facto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>His Anſwer was,</hi> He did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then Mr.</hi> Williams <hi>told him</hi> Church-Memberſhip could not be the ground of Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr. Leigh</hi> ſaid, They were not ſo <hi>de jure,</hi> becauſe they were a Generation of <hi>Vipers,</hi> and therefore ought by the Law to have been caſt out.</p>
               <p>But when Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> did deſire him to tell him where that Law was written, he could not produce it.</p>
               <p>Upon this Dr. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> asked Mr. <hi>Leigh,</hi> what Relation this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of his had to the Commiſſion? For he did not know that they were obliged to follow them any longer in anſwering ſuch Impertinencies, that were not at all included in the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. And therefore deſired him to produce ſome Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that was more conſonant to the Point in Queſtion, for this was foreign to it. For we have granted you more than you ſeem willing to deſire, in favour of Infants; namely, That they have a Title both to Grace here, and Glory hereafter, through the Merits of Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs imputed to them. And yet we cannot allow that they are the Subjects of Baptiſm, according to Chriſt's Commiſſion; or, a Part of the viſible Church. Nevertheleſs we have very Charitable Thoughts towards them, becauſe we believe their Salvation is ſecured to them another way.</p>
               <p>Mr. Leigh <hi>then proceeds to another Argument:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If Infants are Diſciples, then they have a Right to Baptiſm according to the Commiſſion:</p>
               <p>But Infants are Diſciples:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> They have a Right to Baptiſm according to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> denied the <hi>Minor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:31621:30"/>
In defence of which, they Argued from <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 10. after this Manner.</p>
               <p>If thoſe upon whom the Yoke of Circumciſion was impoſed after the manner of <hi>Moſes,</hi> were called Diſciples, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <hi>Moſes</hi> was to Circumciſe Infants; then Infants are called Diſciples.</p>
               <p>But thoſe upon whom the Yoke of Circumciſion was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed after the manner of <hi>Moſes,</hi> were called Diſciples, and the manner of Moſes was to Circumciſe Infants:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> Infants are called Diſciples.</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dr. Ruſſel.</speaker>
                  <p>I both diſtinguiſh upon your <hi>Major,</hi> and deny the Conſequence thereof. For I hope you underſtand a difference betwixt the <hi>Manner</hi> of performing an Action, and the <hi>Subjects</hi> upon whom it is performed.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Manner</hi> of <hi>Moſes</hi> is the thing here ſpoken of; which was to cut off the Foreskin of the Fleſh with a Knife, a ſharp Stone, or the like Inſtrument: And this was ſometimes practiſed upon grown Perſons, and ſometimes upon Infants. As touching Infants, they are neither expreſſed, nor intended in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture you have alledged. For they are called Brethren, Believing Gentiles, ſuch that had an Epiſtle ſent to them, and when they heard it read, they rejoyced at the Conſolation, were eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd in the Faith, and are called Churches: which your ſelves know (in thoſe Times) conſiſted of Adult Perſons, Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes both of Men and Women. But not of one Infant that we read of among them. And indeed, none of thoſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Characters can agree to little Infants.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. <hi>Leigh.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>I grant the Manner is there ſpoken of, and the Subjects brought in afterwards. But would not the People conclude that Infants were intended, if I tell them it muſt be done after the manner of <hi>Moſes?</hi>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dr. Ruſſel.</speaker>
                  <p>It's no matter what thoſe People conclude, that know not how to diſtinguiſh between the Subjects, and the Manner. But thoſe of whom this was ſpoken, knew right well, that the falſe Teachers impoſed it upon the Gentiles that did Believe: And they are the Subjects here ſpoken of.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. <hi>Leigh.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>I would form this Argument.</p>
                  <p>If thoſe are called Diſciples who are adviſed by Judaizing Chriſtians to be Circumciſed after the Manner of <hi>Moſes,</hi> then Infants are called Diſciples:</p>
                  <p>But they are called Diſciples that are adviſed ſo to be Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> Infants are called Diſciples.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dr. Ruſſel</hi> denies the Conſequence of the <hi>Major,</hi> for it doth not follow that becauſe Adult Believers who are the Subjects
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:31621:30"/>
there ſpoken of (as is already proved) are call'd Diſciples; that therefore Infants, who are neither expreſſed, nor inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, muſt be ſo call'd. For Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> hath allowed the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction betwixt the Subjects, and the Manner.</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. <hi>Leigh.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>Read the firſt Verſe, and you will find, that there came Men from <hi>Judea,</hi> that taught the Gentile Church that believed, That unleſs they were circumciſed after the manner of <hi>Moſes,</hi> they could not be ſaved, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It was the Yoke of Circumciſion here intended.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>Whereupon Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> did deny, that barely Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was that intolerable Yoke, which neither they nor their Fathers were able to bear, that is there ſpoken of by <hi>Peter.</hi> For Circumciſion, barely conſidered, Children of Eight Days old were able to bear it, and did bear it.</p>
               <p>But Circumciſion, as it obliged to the Law in Point of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, was that intolerable Yoke, which neither they, nor their Fathers were able to bear. For the Apoſtle tells the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians,</hi> That if they were circumciſed, Chriſt ſhould profit them nothing; and that they were bound to keep the whole Law.</p>
               <p>Now, altho' Circumciſion, barely conſidered, might be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on Infants; yet the falſe Doctrine in which that into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable Yoke did conſiſt, together with Circumciſion, could not be impoſed on Children.</p>
               <p>Beſides, that Circumciſion, after the Manner of <hi>Moſes,</hi> did not reſpect the Subjects, but the Form. It was the Brethren that were the Subjects the falſe Teachers would have had to have been circumciſed after the Manner of <hi>Moſes;</hi> amongſt which, Children could not be numbred.
<list>
                     <item>For, <hi>1ſt.</hi> They were ſuch Brethren that had received the Holy Ghoſt.</item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>2dly.</hi> They had purified their Hearts by Faith.</item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>3dly.</hi> They were ſuch that from among the Gentiles were turned to God.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Then they went off alſo from this, and ſaid. Infants are part of a Nation, and therefore might be Baptized.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> replied, Though Children are part of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yet not of a Nation modify'd according to Chriſt's Commiſſion.</p>
               <p>Whereupon their Moderator ſaid, He thought Mr. <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ams</hi> had but little Academical Learning.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> Replied, He was warned by the Word, to have a care of vain Philoſophy. And preſently demanded, what was the Antecedent to the Relative <hi>them,</hi> in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</p>

The Moderator making no Anſwer, Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> ſaid, It was all Nations Diſcipled.</p>
               <p>And upon this, Dr. <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> did both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire them to produce one Inſtance for Infant Baptiſm, out of the Word of God. And this they did very many times deſire of them, but no Inſtance was produced. At length Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> deſired them, in theſe Words:</p>
               <p>Brethren, I would beg you to produce one Inſtance for Infants <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aptiſm; it will reflect upon you if you do not. What will all this People ſay, when they are gone? So many times one Inſtance deſired: So many Miniſters here, and not one Inſtance produced: They muſt needs conclude there was not one to be produced.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding this, the Miniſters were all ſilent; and not a Man did reply to it.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> ſaid, We might take up the Opponency again if we pleaſed.</p>
               <p>Thus ended their ſo much boaſted of Opponency, in that vain-glorious Advertiſement, publiſhed in the Poſt-man, the <hi>Saturday</hi> Morning after the Diſpute, (either by one of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or of their unthinking Admirers) before Dr. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> could return to <hi>London,</hi> altho' he ſet forth from <hi>Portſmouth</hi> the next Morning after the Diſpute; his preſſing Occaſions neceſſitating him thereto.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> did then, at Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi>'s Requeſt, reaſſume the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponency, of which Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> ſeemed to be ſick, and was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to get rid of it. Which was a ſign they had no mind to inform the People of the Grounds upon which they keep up the Practice of Infants Baptiſm; when they had ſo fair an Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity put into their Hands to do it, and made no better Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of it. But having no Scripture Proof for it, they were not willing to let ſo great an Auditory know the true Cauſe why they continue ſuch a Scriptureleſs Practice; to ſay no worſe of it.</p>

                  <speaker>Dr. Ruſſel.</speaker>
                  <p>I will therefore prove, that no Infants are to be Baptized by virtue of Chriſt's Commiſſion.</p>

               <p>Dr. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> having obſerved what evaſive Anſwers they had given to his own and Mr. <hi>Williams</hi>'s Arguments, was reſolved to force them to a direct Anſwer (if poſſible) by retorting their own Allegation upon themſelves, that they might ſee the Abſurdity of it: And this put them into a flame, and great confuſion.</p>
               <p>The Argument was this:</p>
               <q>If Infants are capable to be made Diſciples of Chriſt by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of Men, without the uſe of Reaſon, then the Beaſts of the Field are alſo capable: but the Beaſts of the Field are not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable: therefore Infants are not capable.</q>
               <p>Upon this there was a great Diſorder among them, and a Perſon in the Company cried out, <hi>He ſpeaks Blaſphemy.</hi> But one of the Miniſters that ſat by him was ſo juſt, as to ſatisfie him to the contrary; for which he deſerves Thanks.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>Robinſon,</hi> their Moderator, ſtood up, and threw himſelf about, making a noiſe like one in a delirious Paroxyſm; and bid the People take notice, that Dr. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> had ranked their Infants among the brute Beaſts; and that if they became of his Opinion, they muſt look upon them as Dogs, or Cats, or Hogs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with much more of the ſame ſort of Rhetorick; endeavouring all he could to enrage the multitude of unthink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſons againſt him, and put the People into a Confuſion.</p>
               <p>Upon this Mr. <hi>Sharp,</hi> the Baptiſt Moderator, ſtood up, and ſaid, Gentlemen hold! what is to do now? What, doth Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Self</hi> ride Lord General in the Town of <hi>Portſmouth</hi> to day? What is the Reaſon of this?</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dr. Ruſſel.</speaker>
                  <p>Hold, Mr. <hi>Robinſon.</hi> Muſt I be thus miſrepreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the People, becauſe I ſay (that which you all know to be true) that Infants want the Uſe of Reaſon? I hope you will be quiet a little time, and give me leave to make my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to the People againſt your clamorous Expreſſions.</p>
                  <p>I am now put upon a neceſſity to tell this Aſſembly (of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Perſons, and others) what my Thoughts are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the State of Mankind in general, and of little Infants in particular.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="36" facs="tcp:31621:33"/>
I believe that Man, as he came out of the hands of God, was a noble Creature, the top Perfection of all his Creation here below and was ſubſtituted Lord of this lower World; was endowed with the Image of his Maker, both natural and divine.</p>
                  <p>But by his Sin he loſt the divine Image, and brought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf thereby under the Curſe, and into a ſtate of Condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in which his Poſterity were alſo involved.</p>
                  <p>But it pleaſed God, of his infinite Mercy, not to leave him in that miſerable Eſtate, as he had left the fallen Angels. But Chriſt interpoſed between Juſtice and the Sinner, the Promiſe being made before the Sentence was pronounced, <hi>Gen. 3. 15. That the ſeed of the Woman ſhould bruiſe the Serpents head.</hi> And this promiſed Seed hath (through the Grace of God) opened a door of mercy for little Infants, who never ſinned in their own perſons; as well as for others.</p>
                  <p>And you know, Gentlemen, I have already told you how great an Eſteem I have for your little Infants; that I will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther believe that all Infants dying in their Infancy are elected, than I will conclude that any one of them are damn'd: And this is more than I could perſuade our Oppoſites to confeſs, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they were urged upon it.</p>
                  <p>So that (for ought yet appears) we have a greater Eſteem for your tender Babes than theſe Gentlemen have, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding Mr. <hi>Robinſon</hi>'s unreaſonable Clamour againſt me. And having thus Apologized for my ſelf, I do now expect an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to my Argument.</p>

                  <p>I am ſo far from talking of Baptizing the Beaſts of the Field, that my Argument is rather to prove the direct contrary. And whereas you affirm that Infants have a Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be made Diſciples of Chriſt by the Miniſtry of Men (or elſe you have been ſaying nothing to the purpoſe all this tim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Sirs, I would put this Caſe to you. Suppoſe there were twenty or thirty new born Infants in a Room, and you ſhould chuſe out the moſt able and learned Perſon among you to preach to them, in order to make them Diſciples according to Chriſt's Commiſſion; I believe he would have no better Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs than St. <hi>Anthony</hi> had (as the Story goes) when he took upon him to inſtruct the Pigs; or, as ſome others have don<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

the Fowls of the Air, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of which I could furniſh you with divers Inſtances.</p>
                  <p>But why ſhould Mr. <hi>Robinſon</hi> think it ſtrange that any body ſhould have ſuch a Conceit in their Minds? Doth he not know that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> baptize things of an inferiour Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? for they baptize Churches and Bells.</p>
                  <p>And if I had compared your Practice to theirs of baptizing Belle, you had had no reaſon to complain, for they are both paſſive in the Act; only if you will give credit to one of the Fathers (viz. <hi>Auguſtine)</hi> the Bells are upon that account the fitteſt Subjects, for they are wholly paſſive: but (ſaith he) the little Children are not ſo; for they ſhew their Reſiſtance by their Crying. And now I demand of any of you to take off the Retortion, and ſhew the Diſparity if you can.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>Upon this they were all ſilent, and none of them would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to ſhew the Diſparity: and till they do it, my Retor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will remain upon them.</p>

                  <p>I will now enter upon it.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Queſtion is this:</p>
                  <q>Whether the Ordinance of Baptiſm, as appointed by Chriſt is to be adminiſtred by Dipping, Plunging, <hi>(or)</hi> Overwhelming only, and not otherwiſe?</q>
                  <p>I take the Queſtion in the Affirmative, and my firſt Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. The Holy Scripture ſhews us the right way of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing, as appointed by Chriſt:</p>
                  <p>But it doth not ſhew us that it ought to be done by Sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling:</p>

                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> Sprinkling is not the right way of Baptizing.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Leigh.</speaker>
                  <p>Sir, you muſt bring in that Dipping is abſolutely neceſſary (as in the Queſtion) what do you talk of Sprinkling for?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dr. Ruſſel.</speaker>
                  <p>Sir, I know not of any other way that is practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by you; nor, I ſuppoſe, any of theſe People: I conclude they have often ſeen you ſprinkle Infants; and Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> hath particularly recommended it in his Preaching, as the beſt way of Baptizing: and I hope you are not aſham'd of your Practice.</p>
                  <p>But if you will diſown Sprinkling to be the right way of Baptizing, I am contented; I will not then inſiſt upon it.</p>

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> was pleaſed to make uſe of an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Induction, upon the Queſtion about the <hi>Subjects:</hi> And why may not I uſe the ſame Liberty about the <hi>Manner,</hi> and prove it by Arguments of Inductions?</p>

               <p>Upon this ſome of them fell a laughing, and Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> thus expreſt himſelf; <hi>Your Induction is an Induction like the man's Covey of Partridges.</hi>

                  <p>What is the Reaſon of all this? I tell you I will make it good by Arguments of Induction: And if you do not underſtand my meaning, I will inform you; and ſhew that it is a good way of arguing, and will anſwer the End I bring it for.</p>
                  <p>For. I will firſt argue off your way of Sprinkling; and after that, if you ſhall aſſign a <hi>Third</hi> way, that is neither practiſed by you nor us, I will then argue that off alſo: and then (I hope) I ſhall fully prove what I deſign by it; namely, that Ours is the <hi>only</hi> right way of Baptizing.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>Upon this they readily diſcerned they ſhould be forced to give an inſtance from Scripture for their Practice of Sprinkling, which they were conſcious to themſelves they were not able to do; and therefore utterly refuſed to anſwer the Argument.</p>

                  <speaker>Dr. Ruſſel.</speaker>
                  <p>If this Argument will not be admitted, I will proceed to another.</p>
                  <p>That Way which doth not ſignify that which ought to be repreſented in Baptiſm, according to Chriſt's Appointment, is not the right way of Baptizing.</p>
                  <p>But this your pretended way doth not do:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> It is not the right way of Baptizing.</p>
                  <p>And this I ſhall make good by the following Syllogiſm.</p>
                  <p>If that Baptiſm which was appointed by Chriſt doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly repreſent his Burial and Reſurrection, and ours by him, then it muſt be done not by Sprinkling, but by Dipping, Plung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or overwhelming the Perſon Baptized into Water:</p>

                  <p>This cannot be underſtood literally; for ſo they were not, could not be buried with him in his Sepulchre, neither can we, But the Apoſtle reſolves us how this was done, and how they were, and we may, be buried with him, and alſo riſe with him; and that is by Baptiſm. <hi>Buried with him in Baptiſm, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in alſo ye are riſen with him.</hi> Therefore Baptiſm is to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in ſuch a way that repreſents a Burial and a Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: which is moſt aptly repreſented by Dipping, Plunging, or Overwhelming the Perſon baptized, into the Water, and raiſing him up again out of it.</p>

                  <p>We will argue on a Probability. It might be done other ways than by Dipping; and a Probability is the moſt you can pretend to for Dipping. I require you to prove that Dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping was certainly intended in thoſe places you bring for it; and then I will prove, that Dipping was not intended, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an Application of Water to the Perſon.</p>

                  <p>That it may ſometimes ſo ſignify where the Scope of the place may ſhew it, I will not contend.

And it would many times be Nonſence to underſtand it otherwiſe. I will give you ſome Inſtances of it, in the room of many that might be given.</p>
                  <p>As in <hi>John 3. 17. God ſent not his ſon</hi> into the <hi>World to condemn the World; but that the World through him might be ſaved.</hi> Here <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>And in <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 16. it's ſaid, <hi>He went</hi> into <hi>the Synagogue on the Sabbath-day, and ſtood up for to read.</hi> Here again it is ſo ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred; for the Words are, <gap reason="foreign">

And I hope you will not deny that Chriſt went into the Synagogue: but you may do it with as much colour of Reaſon, as to ſay he was not Dip'd, or Plunged of <hi>John</hi> into the River of <hi>Jordan.</hi> when the ſame Word is uſed in the ſame Senſe. And beſides if we do but conſider thoſe multitudes that <hi>John</hi> Baptized in the River of <hi>Jordan,</hi> and other places where there was much Water; we have no reaſon to doubt of the Truth thereof.</p>

                  <p>We allow, that what cannot be now uſed without being burdenſome. might be more commodious in that day, and obſerved in that hot Country of <hi>Judaea,</hi> when there was ſo many came to <hi>John</hi> to be Baptized: and therefore it may be that they went out to Rivers. But I will argue upon a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability. It is well known, in thoſe hot Countries the People wore Sandals: and they might go <hi>into</hi> the Water a little way to waſh their Feet. Now I offer this fair Interpretation: They might ſtep a little way <hi>into</hi> Jordan for Eaſe and Refreſhment, and then <hi>John</hi> might pour a little Water on them.</p>

                     </gap> doth proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſignifie <hi>to Dip,</hi> as all the great Lexicographers and Criticks do tell us; and that its proper and native Signification is to Dip <hi>into</hi> Water, or to Plunge under Water: and that I could give you many Inſtances of, out of <hi>Scapula, Stephanus, Schre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velius,</hi> and many others.

                  <p>But that you may ſee I am not ſingular in my Opinion, I will ſhew you that your own Expoſitors do thus render it, and ſome of the greateſt Men among the Proteſtants that ever wrote ſince the Reformation: of which I have made a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection out of their own Works, becauſe I would not wrong them.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall begin with the Teſtimony of thoſe learned and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Divines of your own Perſwaſion, who were thoſe that continued Mr. <hi>Peol</hi>'s Annotations upon <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 6.

                  <p>Upon <hi>John</hi> 3. 22, 23. There <hi>John</hi> was Baptizing, becauſe this <hi>Aenon</hi> was a Brook or River that had <hi>much</hi> Water.

               <p>Before Dr. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> had read this laſt Sentence wholly out, the Presbyterian Miniſters, even Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> himſelf, as well as the reſt of them, fell a hiſſing ſo loud, and ſet others of their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to make a noiſe alſo by their ill Example, that altho Dr. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> went on with his Work, yet the Noiſe was ſo great, that it wholly drowned his Voice, that he could not be heard.</p>
               <p>Whereupon Mr. <hi>Sharp,</hi> the Moderator, call'd out aloud to ſtill this great Noiſe, and ſpoke to this effect: What is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this Hiſſing?

                  <p>You have recourſe to the prime Signification of the Word, whereas we muſt take it according to its Accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Scripture. And I offer it to the Conſideration of the Learned, whether the prime Signification of the Word be a ſufficient Argument in this caſe? And here he makes his Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torical Excurſions about a Mathematician, an Angel, a Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boy that carries a Letter, a Phyſician, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and concludes thus, but we muſt go to the Scripture Acceptation of the Word. And I challenge you to bring one place of Scripture where it muſt be underſtood that it was done by Dipping.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dr. Ruſſel.</speaker>
                  <p>It is very well, Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> will allow that I have given the People the proper Meaning of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and that its prime Signification is <hi>to Dip.</hi> Now he might have ſpared all the reſt that he hath ſaid; for we do not lay the ſtreſs only upon the Etymology of the Word, but alſo upon the concurrent Teſtimonies of Holy Scripture, that it was ſo underſtood and ſo practiſed by <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, and ſo repreſented by the Metaphors made uſe of (as a Burial and a Reſurrection) to ſet it forth by: as alſo their chooſing places where there was much Water to Baptize in, as I have already ſhewed, ſo far as they would permit me; and ſhould have made it manifeſt beyond exception, if I might have been heard.</p>
                  <p>But to anſwer your Demand, I alledge <hi>Acts 8. 38, 39. And they went both down into the Water, both</hi> Philip <hi>and the</hi> Eunuch, <hi>and by Baptized him. And when they were come up out of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> &amp;c. Here we have an account, that both the Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:31621:37"/>
and the Perſon to be Baptized, went both down into the Water: and when they came there, he Baptized him. And if <hi>Philip</hi> had not been to put the <hi>Eunuch</hi> into the Water, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him with it, why ſhould they go down both into the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? A little of it might have been brought up to them into the Chariot, if Sprinkling would have ſerved the turn. But it appears manifeſtly, that nothing leſs would ſerve for to anſwer the Commiſſion, but to Dip the Perſon Baptized into the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, otherwiſe they did that which was wholly needleſs, and beſides the Rule that was given them to practiſe by. And their coming up again out of the Water, doth evidently ſhew that he was Plunged into it, and overwhelm'd with it.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> replied, That the Greek word ſignified to go down <hi>to,</hi> and come up <hi>from</hi> the Water.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr. Williams</hi> replied, That there was two differing Words (as he had been informed) in the Greek Text; as there are two different Words in the Tranſlation. For it is ſaid, <hi>As they went on their way, they came</hi> unto <hi>a certain Water:</hi> This was before he propoſed for Baptiſm. But when a Grant was given him that he might be Baptized, it is then ſaid, <hi>They went down both of them</hi> into <hi>the Water, and</hi> Philip <hi>Baptized him there.</hi> Now as they are different Words in the Tranſlation, coming <hi>unto,</hi> and going <hi>down into,</hi> even ſo they are differing Words in the Greek.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dr. Ruſſel</hi> ſaid, They were two different Words; to which Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> conceſſed.</p>
               <p>But after the Meeting was over, Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Miniſter, in whoſe Meeting place the Diſpute was, told Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> the Baptiſt Diſputant, he was in the right, and that they were two differing Words in the Greek; one for coming <hi>unto,</hi> the other for going down <hi>into.</hi>

                  <p>That I deny; for the Word there is <hi>Ebaphe,</hi> and not <hi>Baptizo.</hi> But do you not know what <hi>Weemes</hi> ſaith in his <hi>Chriſtian Synagogue,</hi> That the <hi>Septuagint</hi> Tranſlation was burnt, and only ſome Fragments of it remaining, which was made up by others: ſo that neither you nor I know when we read the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> and when we read other men.

               </sp>
               <p>Whereupon an Hebrew Bible was produced, and handed up to Dr. <hi>Ruſſel.</hi> And the Book of <hi>Daniel</hi> not being placed in its right order, as in other Hebrew Bibles, he did not readily find it; whereupon they cried out, They believ'd he could not read it. The Dr. anſwered, He could read Hebrew before Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> was born: and as a demonſtration of it, he read a Verſe or two in the Beginning thereof. Upon this Mr. <hi>Robin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> took the Book, and with ſome difficulty found out the Book of <hi>Daniel</hi> and then gave it to Dr. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> again, who read the Place by them directed to, and told Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> that the Word <hi>Tabal</hi> was not there. And then, after all this needleſs trouble, Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> did confeſs that it was not: and ſo all his Pretention from thence vaniſhed into Smoak.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> alſo urged for another inſtance, to prove that <hi>Tabal</hi> ſignified a Waſhing leſs than that by Dipping, 2 <hi>Kings 5. 10, 14. Go and waſh in Jordan, and be clean.</hi> And in Verſe 14. <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <speaker>Dr. Ruſſel.</speaker>
                  <p>I do allow that the Command is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>xpreſt by <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chatz,</hi> and alſo that it ſometimes is uſed, as we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> as <hi>Cabas,</hi> to ſignifie leſs than Dipping when it is applied to ſome particular things, or parts of things, which are to be cleanſed from Filth; as you know <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> in the Greek is <hi>to waſh the hands.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But where <hi>Rachatz</hi> in the Hebrew is uſed in the Sence as it's here expreſt, namely, <hi>to waſh himſelf;</hi> it's always to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of ſuch a Waſhing as is by Dipping. The Jews under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood it ſo, and <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Syrian</hi> underſtood the Prophet in that ſence; for it's ſaid he dipped himſelf in <hi>Jordan</hi> ſeven times. And that he was not miſtaken about it, is evident; for that the Spirit of God hath left it upon Record, that what he did was according to the Saying of the Man of God: ſo that the Prophet did not intend by <hi>Rachatz</hi> any other Waſhing than what is performed by Dipping of the Perſon ſo waſhed into the Water. And had this been a Derivative, there might have been ſome doubt raiſed about it; but ſeeing <hi>Tabal</hi> is the Root it ſelf, it can ſignify nothing leſs than what is the known ſence thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> he Dipped. He dipped himſelf in <hi>Jordan</hi> ſeven times, according to the Saying of the Man of God. Thus I have cleared this Text from your Objection, as not intending any ſuch thing as you have brought it for, but the direct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> ſaid, We challenge you to prove, by Scripture, that the Word <hi>Baptizo</hi> ſignifies <hi>to Dip,</hi> and that <hi>that</hi> is intended by Baptiſm.</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dr. Ruſſel.</speaker>
                  <p>I will prove it from all the Places where the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> is ſpoken of, if you will let me prove it from the Greek.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Chandler.</speaker>
                  <p>No, you ſhall prove it from our Tranſlation, that it's there any where ſo rendred; but you ſhall not do it from any of thoſe places where the Ordinance of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> is ſpoken of.</p>

                  <speaker>Dr. Ruſſel.</speaker>
                  <p>That is unreaſonable, that when the Uſe of a Word is enquired into, and what was the Practice of the firſt Miniſters, purſuant to that Word by which they are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Baptize; for all thoſe Scriptures where it is ſo mentioned to be excluded out of our Enquiry.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Chandler.</speaker>

                  <speaker>Dr. Ruſſel.</speaker>
                  <p>If nothing elſe will do with you, I will then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to prove from divers places in Scripture, that either <hi>Bapto,</hi> or its Derivatives, is ſo rendred in our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

The firſt Scripture I ſhall inſtance in, is, <hi>Revel. 19. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Chandler.</speaker>
                  <p>This is not <hi>Bapto.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dr. Ruſſel.</speaker>
                  <p>No more is <hi>Baptizo, Baptiſmos, Baptiſma,</hi> &amp;c. but they are all Derivatives from it; and ſo is the Word that is here uſed. And this Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> did not deny.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dr. Ruſſel</hi> did then urge the ſeveral places in the Evangeliſts about <hi>Judas</hi> dipping with Chriſt in the diſh; as, Matt. 26. 23. <hi>He that dippeth.</hi> Mark 14. 20. John 13. 26. <hi>When I have dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped it. And when he had dipped,</hi> &amp;c. Now in all theſe places you ſee it's thus rendred, and the Ordinance of Baptiſm not in the leaſt intended.</p>
               <p>Moreover, I will give you one Inſtance more, in which the moſt minute Action imaginable is intended, and yet ſo much as was put into the Water is ſaid to be dipt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 24. Where the rich Man being in Hell, deſired Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Abraham</hi> to ſend <hi>Lazarus,</hi> that <hi>he might dip the tip of his finger in Water, to cool his tongue,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>By this it appears, that our Tranſlators did thus underſtand the Word to intend Dipping; and have never rendred it to Sprinkle in all the New Teſtament.</p>
               <p>I would only add, That when Learned Men come to have but the ſame Wiſdom as the Jewiſh Rabbies have, to reduce all doubtful Words to their Roots and Theme from whence they are derived, then much of our preſent Diſputes will iſſue in the Knowledge of the Truth; and we ſhall ceaſe to ſtrive about Words to no profit, but to the ſubverting of the Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
               <p>Upon this followed a confuſed Jangling and Noiſe, ſo that the <hi>Amanuenſis</hi> could not take it down, neither did he think it worth the taking.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> the Presbyterian Miniſter, ſaid, he thought there had been little ſaid to the purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Upon this Dr. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> ſaid, Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> I think there hath been a great deal ſaid more than hath been anſwered: but if you are not ſatisfied, we will wave all that hath been ſaid, and I will diſpute it over with you <hi>de novo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr. Williams</hi> ſhrugged, and anſwered no; I am not very well.</p>
               <p>Although he had not been engaged at all in the Diſpute himſelf, and the Doctor had been fatigued by ſo long a Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, yet Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> refuſed to accept his Offer.</p>
               <p>It was at laſt thought meet by them to put an Iſſue to the Diſputation. And Mr <hi>Leigh</hi> (after he had made a Speech to thank the Governour and the Mayor for their Civility towards
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:31621:39"/>
them, and the Baptiſts had returned their Thanks alſo) he then concluded in Prayer; and ſo diſmiſt the Aſſembly. It was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the hours of Six and Seven of the Clock when the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute ended.</p>
               <p>I do now think it proper to give you an Account of thoſe Learned Mens Teſtimonies to juſtifie our Practice of Dipping, which <hi>Dr. Ruſſel</hi> was then prevented to recite, by reaſon of the Miniſters Hiſſing, and the Noiſe and Clamour of their Party, that would not ſuffer him to be heard.</p>

                     </gap>, ſignifies <hi>mergo, immergo, ſubmergo, obruo; item tingo, quod fit immergendo.</hi> To dip, to overwhelm, to plunge or dip in, to drown or ſink in the Water, to overwhelm, to dip, or plunge; to put under, to cover clean over, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Now theſe two different Words, do ſignifie two different Actions: For he that is only ſprinkled, cannot be ſaid to be dipt, or plunged under the Water, and to come up again out

of the Water, (when they were never in it) as thoſe are ſaid to do, in <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 38. They went both down <hi>into</hi> the Water, and they came up again <hi>out</hi> of the Water. Beſides, I challenge all the Learned in the World to ſhew one Inſtance in the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> that theſe words <hi>Rantizo, Rantiſmos,</hi> or <hi>Rantiſma,</hi> are ever made uſe of by the Spirit of God, to expreſs that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of Baptiſm by. For they know right well that <hi>Bapto,</hi> and its Derivatives are always made uſe of to expreſs it by. And where they are tranſlated into Engliſh, the one is rendred Dipping, and the other Sprinkling. But if theſe Men will keep up a Practiſe contrary to Holy Scripture. and the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the moſt Learned <hi>Lexicographers</hi> and <hi>Criticks</hi> in the Greek Tongue, it's their own fault, and not ours.</p>

                     <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 38. They went both down into the Water.</p>
                  <p>They were wont to dip the <hi>whole</hi> Body, or go down into the Water, as here, and <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 16.</p>
                  <p>And upon <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 4. Buried with him by Baptiſm.</p>
                  <p>See <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 12. In this Phraſe the Apoſtle ſeemeth to allude to the <hi>Ancient</hi> Manner of Baptiſm; which was to Dip the Parties Baptized, and as it were, to bury them <hi>under</hi> the Water for a while, and then to draw them out of it, and lift them up; to repreſent the Burial of our Old Man, and our Reſurrection to newneſs of Life.</p>
                  <p>The late Dr. <hi>Gabriel Towerſon,</hi> in his Explication of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſm of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> Part 4. pag. 20 <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſpeaks largely upon it, in Vindication of the Rite of Dipping in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm; of which I ſhall recite ſome few Paſſages, and refer you to his Book for the reſt.</p>
                  <p>Baptiſm is intended as a Sign, and that in reſpect of the Manner of Application uſed; I mean the dipping, or plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the Party Baptized in it. A ſignification which St. <hi>Paul</hi> will not ſuffer thoſe to forget, who have been acquainted with his Epiſtles, for which he Quotes <hi>Rom</hi> 6 4. and <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 12. It was performed by the Ceremony of Immerſion, that the Perſon Immerſed, might by that Ceremony (which was no obſcure Image of a Sepulture) be minded of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent Death, as in like manner by his coming again out of the Water, of his riſing from that Death to Life, after the Example of the Inſtitutor thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="58" facs="tcp:31621:44"/>
Then he puts this Queſtion, Whether it ought to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by an Immerſion, or an Aſperſion, <hi>&amp;c?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His Anſwer is, It may be a more material Queſtion than is commonly deemed by us who have been accuſtomed to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize by a bare Effuſion and Sprinkling of Water upon the Party.</p>
                  <p>For things which depend for their force on the meer Will and Pleaſure of him who Inſtituted them, there ought (no doubt) great regard to be had to the Commands of him that did ſo; as without which there is no reaſon we ſhould receive the benefit of that Ceremony to which he has been pleaſed to annex it.</p>
                  <p>Now what the Command of Chriſt was in this particular, cannot be well doubted of by thoſe who ſhall conſider; Firſt, The words of Chriſt, <hi>Matth</hi> 28. 19. concerning it, and the Practice of thoſe Times, whether in the Baptiſm of <hi>John</hi> or our Saviour; for the words of Chriſt are, <hi>That they ſhould Baptize or Dip thoſe whom they made Diſciples to him;</hi> for (ſo no doubt) the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Baptizontes,</hi> properly ſignifies: Though if there could be any doubt concerning the ſignification of the words themſelves, yet would that doubt be removed by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the Practice of thoſe Times. For ſuch as was the Practice of thoſe Times in Baptizing, ſuch in reaſon we are to think our Saviour's Command to have been concerning it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there being not otherwiſe any means either for thoſe, or future Times to diſcover his intention concerning it.</p>
                  <p>What the Practice of thoſe Times were, will need no other proof, than the reſorting to Rivers and other ſuch Receptacles of Water for the performance of that Ceremony, as that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there was <hi>much</hi> Water there, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>John</hi> 3. 23. And the Scripture expreſly affirming concerning the Baptiſm of the Eunuch, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 38. That <hi>Philip</hi> and the Eunuch went both down into a certain Water (which they met with in their Journey) in order to the Baptizing of the latter.</p>
                  <p>For what need would there have been of the Baptiſts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorting to great Confluxes of Water; or of <hi>Philip</hi>'s and the Eunuch's going down <hi>into</hi> this, were it not that the Baptiſm both of the one and of the other, were to be performed by an Immerſion; a very little Water (as we know it doth with us) ſufficing for an Effuſion or Sprinkling.</p>
                  <p>The ſame is to be ſaid yet more, upon the account of our conforming to the Death and Reſurrection of Chriſt, which we learn from St. <hi>Paul</hi> to be the deſign of Baptiſm to ſignifie; for though that might, and was well enough repreſented by the Beptized Perſons being buried in Baptiſm, and their riſing
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:31621:44"/>
out of it; yet can it not be ſaid to be ſo, or, at leaſt but very imperfectly, by the bare pouring out, or ſprinkling the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmal Water on him.</p>
                  <p>But therefore; as there is ſo much the more Reaſon to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Rite of Immerſion as the <hi>Only</hi> Legitimate Rite of Baptiſm, becauſe the <hi>Only One</hi> that can anſwer the ends of its Inſtitution, and thoſe things that were to be ſignified by it; ſo eſpecially, if (as is well known, and undoubtedly of great force) the general Practice of the Primitive Church was agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thereto, and the Greek Church to this very Day: for who can think that either the one, or the other, would have been ſo tenacious of ſo troubleſom a Rite, were it not that they were well aſſured (as they of the Primitive Church might very well be) of its being the <hi>Only</hi> Inſtituted and Legitimate One. I cannot but think the forementioned Arguments to be ſo far of force, as to evince the neceſſity thereof, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For what benefit can Men ordinarily expect from that which depends for its force upon the Will of him that Inſtituted it; where there is no ſuch compliance in the leaſt with it, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Inſtitutor; as may anſwer thoſe ends for which he applied it.</p>
