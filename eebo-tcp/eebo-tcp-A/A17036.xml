            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE CHRISTIAN
READER, GRACE AND PEACE
from God the Father, and from the
Lord Iesus Christ &amp;c.</head>
            <p>DEARELY beloued in the truth, you haue in this booke
an answere to an answere written vnto Master Harri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
at Middleborough by Master Cartwright vpon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of controuersie betweene them concerning the true
spouse of Christ or his ordinarie visible Churches in Englande,
And it is thought good to put this aunswere before the saide aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
of Master Cartwright. And although the godlywise, and
such as haue onely the glorie of God before their eyes and his pure
Religion and seruice together with the saluation of their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
will easily perceiue the reasons, and causes: yet least anye
might take offence in this offence in this behalfe, it is though meete
to shewe some. The first reason therefore is this. Our corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is more prone and readie to imbrace the errour of man then
the trueth of God Another cause was for that our vntowarde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
is so great, that if an vntrueth be once receiued, it worketh
such a preiudice in the heades and mindes of men, that they will
heare neither God his worde, neither reason or argument to the
contrary be it neuer so good and effectuall. A thirde cause moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
to place this answere first, for that it shoulde bee an occasion
vnto the Reader, to vse more diligent conferring of this aunswere
with the other, for the better discerning and finding out of the
trueth in this controuersie. It is not necessarie that any man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpose
his iudgement at this tyme, but to attende by prayer the
good euent which God will giue for the further manifestation of
his trueth, and abolishing of the contrary. Nowe these fewe lynes
<pb facs="tcp:9956:3"/>
are thought in this matter sufficient, least it might seeme to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudge
any trueth in either of these answeres, or else by accepting
of persons to foster corruption, or a lye in any thing set foorth in
the Name of the Lorde. It is expedient therefore that the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
be faithfull searched by the godly Reader, to see whether
these thinges be euen so or not. For no man that feareth God is ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of the doctrine of our Sauiour christ, that whosoeuer
breaketh the least of the commaundements of God, and teacheth
men so, is least in the kingdom of heauen. Neither ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

&amp; vniuersal doctrine of god his word, true repentance, vnfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
faith with amendment of life, to be necessarie vnto saluation.
But it is said before, these fewe things suffice. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the faithfull Reader is to be commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to the grace of God, for his fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
direction in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe,

            <head>AN ANSVVERE
TO MASTER CART<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WRIGHT
HIS LETTER, FOR
ioyning with the English Churches:
Whereunto the true Copie of his
saide Letter is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed.</head>
            <p>AS there be alwayes both friendes and enemies to the
Church of God, so some doe giue their handes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it as friendes, and some being enemies will giue it
their left hande of friendshihpe to turne it cleane
out of the way. Howe friendly <hi>Master Cartwright</hi> is to it,
let vs examine by this his Letter, and by the grace of God,
let vs trie out the trueth betwixt him and vs: his letter is
in many mens handes, and was seene abroade vnsealed and
open, as if he cared not who shoulde reade it, wherefore I
may the more boldely answere it, and the rather because
the matter thereof is publike and pertaining to the Church
of God. It came but lately to my handes, and was written
as they tell me more then fiue or sixe weekes agoe, wherein
if he and others that prouoke him, sought not to take vs
tardie in the trueth and to worke vs trouble, we would the
les<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e haue regarded his letters: but seeing he will needes
make vs enemies to the common and ordinarie good lawes
of the Realme, to the Church of god in the Realme, and to
the peace and welfare of the common wealth: Let vs an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
his cauilles: and for so much as we haue so small res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pite
of time, let vs shortly gather vp his vntrueths and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
and hurle them out by manifest &amp; knowen markes,
least any man doe beleeue them as trueth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:9956:4"/>
               <hi>Master Cartwright</hi> doeth mooue the first question
thus: <hi>That the outwarde profession made by the lawes of the
lande, and the assemblyes of the Church helde accordingly, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened
as vnlawfull:</hi> this is the short (saith he) of <hi>M. Harrisons</hi>
lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger discourse, if he vse to make such shorts, he is not meete
to deale with short or with long. Let him lappe vp his
shortes in his budget, and not sende them abroade in steade
of our lengths or larger syse. For at the first brunt he would
set against vs all these enemies: 1. <hi>The lawes of the lande.
2. The outwarde profession by the lawes. 3. The apparant
Churches of Christ, 4 and the lawfull assemblyes thereof.</hi>
First, for the lawes, he knewe well ynough what Lawes we
meane: namely, <hi>certaine Popish Cannon lawes,</hi> which though
the Magistrates doe tollerate for a time, yet the common
good lawes of the lande are wholy against them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let him not deale doubly with vs, as hauing our true
meaning in his heart, to fumble out of his mouth or to
shuffle vp in his letter a contrary meaning: we know that
the lawes doe punish all outward grosse wickednesse, or suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
it to be punished: as namely, <hi>Idolatrie, forswearing, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surping
of Lordshippe, rebellion, murther<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fleshly filthinesse, theft, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
raylings, grieuous slanders, drunkennes, &amp;c.</hi> and if there
be any vice not punishable by the lawe, yet the lawes doe
suffer either the Church, or euery housholder, or gouernour
to correct (so it be not against lawe) such as are vnder their
charge. So then the lawes are a wall to the Church rounde
about: they stande vp for it as an armed man, that it may
shewe it selfe openly without shame or feare. For when
they put downe all outwarde grosse wickednesse, and will
not suffer it, they doe as it were scatter and driue awaye
darkenesse from the Church, that men may see it visible
and cleare as the Sunne. Likewise for the outwarde pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
by the lawes, <hi>Master Cartwright</hi> woulde playe at
handie dandie with vs, and yet not giue vs that hand which
we doe choose: for there is an outwarde profession after
the olde Popish traditions and orders, let him holde this
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:9956:4"/>
profession in his left hande: and there is a profession more
syncerely by some, after some better Lawes and Orders,
this he shoulde houlde in his right hande: wherefore then
doeth hee reach vs that in his right hande as taking it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull,
which we choose as lawfull. If he saye that wee
condemne that ordinarie abused and corrupt profession of
the most, I aunswere that the Lawes doe also the same:
For the common Lawes are against the cannon Lawes
in many hundreth poyntes, one giueth checke to the other
as two Dames at variance in one house, the cannon is as
fire in the house to burne it, the common is as water pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
downe to quenche it. The Popishe courtes esteeme
all sortes of christians for churches of Christ, much like
those harlots, that woulde haue many children though it
were by fornication, that they myght rule ouer many, but
the Common wealth reiecteth her children, as beyng
children of Death, euen for smaller Theftes, Felonyes,
Roginges, and Wanderinges, without honest Trades
and laboures; as for the right corrections of Adulteryes,
those Whoorish courtes haue taken so much vpon them,
that the Ciuill Magistrates coulde not so well see to it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this time. But nowe euen for this matter they haue
giuen a great checke to the cannon Officers. Also for
persecuting the brethren and sundry worthye men, their
authoritie and cannon power hath receiued a great blowe
and wounde. If there be contrary lawes one against ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as through change of tymes, variaunce of people, and
other necessities, it may fall out, yet through fauour and
helpe of good Magistrates, the lawe shall still be with the
Church and not against it: As for the Maiestracie of By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
there is no lawe to warrant it, but only her Maiesties
permission: likewise for the common forme of seruice and
prayers, there is exception by the lawe, and it is set downe
also in the booke of Common prayer, that the prayers may
be changed, intermitted, and left off by occasions: as when
<pb facs="tcp:9956:5"/>
the Minister is to preach or applye him selfe to his studie
for preaching. Further whereas the lawe doeth binde vs to
come to the church, it doth well, for no man ought to refuse
the Church of God, yet if when we come to the church,
we finde there an vnlawfull minister, and a wicked confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of all sortes of people, the fault is not nowe in the law
but in the Byshoppes which place such ministers, and in
their spirituall courtes which are authours of such confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
for the Lawe commaundeth that the Minister should
be <hi>Doctus</hi> and <hi>Clericus,</hi> which wordes doe require learning
sufficient, and godlinesse meete for a cleargie man: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
howe shoulde he be <hi>Clericus</hi> that is one of the Lordes
inheritance. But the Bishops count him learned if he can
but reade onely, and answere to a catechisme as doe chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren:
wherefore good Magistrates will execute the lawe
according to the true meaning, and not according to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie
of the wordes, and if they see to it, that men shall
come to Church, they will first see that the church be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ordered that men may come with comforte, and not
with heart burning to their conscience. Also for discipline
in gathering the worthie from the vnworthy, the lawe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointeth
it and giueth leaue to make exception both in
publique iudgement and in churches against vnworthye
persons: as against Drunkennesse, fightings, murther, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulteryes,
stealth, slaunders, &amp;c. and that before the Consta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
Iustices of Peace, Iudges and Iustices of Assises, and
yet also doe giue libertie to the Church to vse their owne
discipline. But eyther the Popes cannon lawes, and his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
doe quite ouerthrowe it, or the Ministers are so ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile
and foolish that they can not, or dare not execute it: It
were too long to rehearse what libertie the lawes do yeelde
to vs, and what outwarde profession there is by the lawes:
but thus we conclude, that seeing very many of the Bishops
doings and their officers are vnlawfull, and yet very vsual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and ordinarily professed, helde, and practised, we must
needes say that such an ordinary profession is vnlawfull.</p>

Nowe followeth the chiefest and greatest matter in
controuersie: namely, <hi>Whether the ordinarie assemblies of
the professors in Englande be the Churches of Christ.</hi> A part of
this question he must make as he doeth the vsuall outward
profession. What <hi>Master Harrison</hi> did write in his letter,
and vpon what wordes <hi>Master C.</hi> doeth gather this questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
I can not tell: for I neuer sawe <hi>Master Harrisons</hi> letter:
but I hope <hi>Master H.</hi> did not condemne any assemblyes,
but abused assemblies, neither any professors, but false pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors:
wherefore let him take his right meaning, namely,
<hi>The ordinarie abused assemblyes of false professors.</hi> But he will
admit no such distinction: for belike he will haue no such
assemblyes, yet in a time of better reformation then is now
in Englande,<note place="margin">Ierem. 3. 6. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that Iudah had not returned vnto him with their whole heart
but faynedly.</hi> If they then were false professors, whose hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie
was in their hearts, why should not they be false pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors,
which doe shewe foorth in practise a false professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and that chiefely in their assemblyes? but whatsoeuer
false profession they haue, and howe grosse soeuer their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buses
be, <hi>Master Cartwright</hi> will prooue them to bee chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of Christ. But goe to, let vs examine his proo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es: those
assemblyes haue Christ for their head and foundation, for
saith hee, they beleeue in Christ, and haue the spirite of
Christ, therefore they are the churches of Christ. Nowe to
prooue that they beleeue, he bringeth in their profession: so
that all <hi>Master Cartwrights</hi> arguments falleth from one to
one, till it come to nothing at all, for from the head and
foundation of the church, he descendeth to the spirite and
to faith, and so at last to the outwarde profession. Nowe
the outwarde profession must chiefely be shewed and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
by the lawfull vsing of publique assemblyes. If they
then be so shamefully abused by meanes of the bishoppes,
and their officers, then his proofe of the outward professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
also falleth to the ground. Thus of necessitie he must iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
many grosse corruptions both in the assemblyes, &amp; in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:9956:6"/>
sundry their practises and customes, or else laye by his
proofe as vntrue. But what neede hee haue fetched about
and made suche adoo, touching faith and the spirite, and
the head and the foundation of the Church, and then to
haue no other proofe but the question to prooue the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.
For the question is, <hi>whether the assemblyes bee lawfull
outwarde Churches, being helde according to so corrupt professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
or whether the outwarde profession of the false profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours
standing as it doeth, the assemblyes that are according, bee
lawfull or no?</hi> Thus he prooueth <hi>idem per idem:</hi> it is so, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is so: it shall bee so, because it shall bee so. But
marke his turning and shifting to and fro in this matter.
For from the outward church and the outwarde profession
he leapeth and fleeth to the spirite and faith, which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde:
and from the inwarde graces he returneth to the
outwarde profession. Thus as one that is hunted with his
enemie within, he runneth out, and being in daunger with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
he runneth in: for by faith which is inwarde, and the
spirite that is inwarde, hee woulde iustifie an outwarde
churche. Againe, by an outwarde, false, and corrupt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
he will iustifie the inwarde spirite and faith of
professours, to bee syncere. Thus with turning and retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to and fro, he woulde establishe his errour, but hee
doeth wearie him selfe in vaine. Nowe as his dealing
herein is ridiculous, so hee increaseth it vnto a shamelesse
and blasphemous doctrine: For he sayeth that there being
but one onely true Christian in a church, or congregation,
and all the rest wicked, yea and so wicked that they haue
but a bare profession in worde onely without any good
workes, they shoulde all be counted the church of God,
for that one mans cause. I maruaile howe his penne coulde
droppe downe such poyson, and he not smell the stinch
thereof as he wrote it: For by this doctrine euery faithfull
christian shall bee aboue Christ. For <hi>Master Cartwright</hi>
doeth giue them power to loose those on earth, which
God doeth binde in heauen, and this power Christ neuer
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:9956:6"/>
had: For if the faith of one or a fewe beleeuers in an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly

(for so the Prophet tearmeth them) namely,<note place="margin">Iere. 7. 4.</note> 
               <hi>The Temple of

many wretches to be the church, then the vnfaithfulnes of
many shoulde be of force to make them all no Church:
But as my wickednesse condemneth no man but my selfe,
except they partake with me in my wickednes, so my faith
iustifieth no man to be of the church, except they hold with

               <hi>and confession of the
mouth both together, as needeful vnto righteousnes &amp; saluation:</hi>
and by the confession of the mouth, he meaneth al outward
profession agreeing to faith, because the professio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by mouth
is chiefest. He can not turne his words, as if he spake of one
truly faithful, and all the rest secret hypocrites, for he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
of the outward profession, of the outward works, and
of the outward church, &amp; granteth also that there are many
outward &amp; grosse abuses: further, he nameth that in wordes
only they hold the true faith, as who say, be the deeds neuer
so abhominable, yet for that faithful mans sake, they are al
<pb facs="tcp:9956:7"/>
to be called one church with him. If <hi>Master Cartwright</hi> had
sayde cleane contrary, he had spoken more truely: namely,
that if among many good liuers, one wicked man were

so contrary to God and all godlinesse, that I wonder anye

hee meaneth not a profession altogether corrupted, but a

which iustifieth such abuses in assemblies, I maruaile howe
he dare pronounce it an apparant sanctification, or an holy
profession in other dueties, where there is so corrupt and
polluted a profession in publique assemblyes. Doth not the

not to refraine a mans tongue, is to proue his religion vaine:</hi> then
to haue a filthie polluted profession in publique assemblies,
is to make all other profession filthy and polluted. And so
reasoneth the Prophet Haggi,<note place="margin">Hag 2. 13. 14.</note> 
               <hi>That as any holy meate was

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:9956:7"/>
or the skirt of a mans garment did but touch it, so much more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane
was that people and nation, and all their holy exercises and

them selues but in one thing,</hi> namely, <hi>in slacking and fearing to
builde the outwarde Temple, which was but a figure of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
Church of god at this day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But we come to another of <hi>Master Cartwrights</hi> proofes,
which hee giueth thus: They haue the couenaunts of the
churches of god, namely <hi>the spirit and the worde of god put in
their mouthes, therefore they are the Churches of god.</hi> We doe
not denie but that there are sundry churches of god: but
the question is of a corrupt profession by Popish Lawes,
and of vnlawfull assemblyes made thereby. But whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
corruption there is, (as he granteth diuers) yet they
haue the couenant saith he of the spirite, and the worde of
god in their mouthes. So without shame he abuseth that
place in <hi>Isaiah<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 59 For he leaueth out one part of the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,<note place="margin">Isa. 59. 20.</note>
which is, <hi>That the Lorde will come vnto Zion and to those
that turne from iniquitie in Iacob, and with them will hee make
his couenant:</hi> wherefore the worde is not the couenant to
establish a Church except it reigne and rule in the Church,
to subdue it in obedience to the Lorde: for the Lorde ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
no couenant, but with those that turne from iniquitie
in Iacob.<note place="margin">Gen. 17. 1, 2.</note> As againe it is written, <hi>Walke before me, and be thou

               <note place="margin">Exod. 19.</note>
the promise of obedience in the people, is set downe as
one part of the couenant, <hi>Obey my voyce, and doe according to
all these thinges which I commande you, so shall you be my people
and I will be your god: or else cursed be the man that obeyeth
not the wordes of this couenant.</hi> For on this condition will the
Lorde receiue vs,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 6. 17, 18</note> as <hi>Paul reasoneth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if we come out from among
the wicked,</hi>

               <hi>Then will I be a Father vnto

Thus shoulde <hi>Master Cartwright</hi> haue conferred
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:9956:8"/>
place with place, and haue knowen that the worde is no co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant,
where the practise thereof is reiected and troden vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
foote: neither can men say they haue the couenant of
the spirite, when open and grosse wickednesse so reigneth
in them, that there is no power of the spirite to redresse it,
but it remaineth incurable.<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 14.</note> And so Paul reasoneth, <hi>that as
many as are led by the spirit of god, they are the sonnes of god<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> but
he sheweth that they are in the state of condemnation, and
not in Christ Iesus, if they walke after the flesh, and not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the spirite. For there is not the couenant of the spirite,
where we are not turned from iniquitie as <hi>Isaiah</hi> him selfe
witnesseth,<note place="margin">Zech. 12. 10.</note> and let <hi>Zecharie</hi> interprete <hi>Isaiah,</hi> whose sheweth
what spirite God will powre vpon his house and people,
namely, <hi>The spirit of grace and compassion, vnto repentance and
mourning for their sinnes.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezec. 11. 19, 20.</note> Likewise <hi>Ezechiel</hi> doeth giue the
proofe and tryall of that newe spirit and newe heart which
God woulde put in his people, namely this, <hi>That they should
walke in his statutes, and keepe his iudgements, and execute them,
and so doing, they shall be his people, and he woulde be their god.</hi>
Wherefore let not <hi>Master Cartwright</hi> account so much of
the word in their mouthes,<note place="margin">Deut. 30. 14.</note> except as it is written in Deut.
<hi>it be in their mouthes and in their heartes for to doe it.</hi> Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
Christ wil pronounce of them, that in vaine they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
the Lord,<note place="margin">Mat. 15. 8.</note> and so are they false worshippers: for god is

               <hi>They drawe neere vnto god with their mouthes and honour him with

are not those burning lampes, neither the golde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> candlesticks

the Lord,<note place="margin">Isa. 29. 13.</note> 
               <hi>euen as a nation that did righteously,</hi>

               <note place="margin">Isa. 59. 2, 20.</note> Yet in the next chapter
the Lord witnesseth, <hi>that there was a great separation betwene
him and them, so that he was to make a newe couenant with them,
and they were to turne from their former iniquities, or else they
could not be his people and Church.</hi> And therefore when Christ
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:9956:8"/>
appointeth the Apostles to plant churches throughout the
world,<note place="margin">Mat. 28. 19, 20<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> he appointeth them not, to talke of and professe the
word in their mouthes onely, but he giueth in charge these
three things, as being the chiefe marks of a planted Church:
namely <hi>preaching the word, ministration of the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
of life,</hi> which is the chiefest thing of all to set forth
his Church &amp; kingdom: for he comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth to preach and
baptize, &amp; because preaching &amp; baptizing is nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
amendme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of life, he addeth these words, teaching the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to
obserue &amp; do all things, whatsoeuer I haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded you.
Therfore as appeareth in the acts of the Apostles,<note place="margin">Actes 2.</note> was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the church nor the couena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of the Church established
among any,<note place="margin">Actes 8.</note> but where their good &amp; godly profession was
shewed,<note place="margin">Actes 19. 18.</note> and the contrary refused. I know <hi>M. C.</hi> will gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say
that there must needes be hypocrites in euery church, &amp;
sometimes also open breach of gods commandements.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 5. 11.</note> It is
true indeede. But yet if any make an open and grosse breach
then Paul hath written vnto vs, <hi>that we company not together
with such. For if any</hi> (saith he) <hi>that is called a brother, be a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicator,
or couetous, or an idolater, or a railor, or a drunkard, or
an extortioner &amp;c. with such a one eate not.</hi> The aduersaries
replie to this, that in deede to eat common bread with such,
or to partake with them in the feastes of charitie was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden,
which distinction and shift they alleadge out of
Caluin. But who dare say that the godly wife may not eate
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon bread with her exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate husband? or the godly
children with their wicked parents? or seruants with their
masters? For otherwise al seruice, ministery &amp; communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in
a common wealth should be ouerthrowen. And so as Paul
reasoneth the godly shuld not be able to liue in the world.
Who also dare say that when the church held their feasts of
charitie they might forbid wicked persons to partake with
them in the feastes, and yet suffer them to partake in the
Lordes-table. Nay they kept their feastes and the Lordes
Supper together. And hereupon Paul gaue this distinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that they should suffer none but bre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ioyne with
them in the holy feastes or in the assemblyes which were
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:9956:9"/>
               <hi>for ministration of the Lordes Supper:</hi> but if we will not eate
and drinke with sinners in the worlde we must goe out of
the worlde. Wherefore there is an eating with wretches in
the worlde, or in worldly meetings and feastings, which is
forbidden in the Church meetings. As if a brother being se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
and fallen away, should in an Inne or vitailing house
sit downe at the table to eate, after we and others were set;
it were vnlawfull to rise from the table because of him: yea
it were both against common charitie and humanitie, and
also against the peace &amp; communion of a common wealth.
But of this matter it followeth to speake afterwardes.</p>
            <p>We haste one to others proofes. An other proofe is,
as though it were graunted him, <hi>that where a preaching mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
is, there is a Church:</hi> nay we know that assemblyes of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes
haue preaching ministers, and yet are not the church
of God. And though they be Protestants which haue a
Preacher ouer them, yet if he for his wickednesse cease to
be a brother, and they also for their wickednesse be no bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
the preaching Minister can not cause them to bee a
Church of God. This is manifest before, and shall partly
also afterwarde be spoken of: wherefore I let it passe. As
for that he saith, of some knowledge receiued by a dumbe
ministerie, and of faith receiued by some further Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
it is much like the same tryfling proofe he vsed before,
and is answered alreadie. For we said, that the inward faith
will not iustifie the outward Church, when there is a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
profession contrary to the doctrine of faith. Againe a
man may beleeue, &amp; be wonne to faith, by meanes of some
godly brother, and that before he haue outwardly ioyned
him selfe to the Church: so in gods secret election he is of
the church: yet because he hath not the outwarde professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
can not be sayde to be the outwarde Church. But here
<hi>Master Cartwright</hi> though he dare not iustifie the blind rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Ministers, yet he doeth praise them as doing some
good. But of this matter also it followeth afterwarde to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate,
as whether he that doeth so much hurt and mischiefe

that we ought ioyntly to execute this power: but if others
will not or bee in bondage that they can not ioyne with

And so also all are commanded to saue them selues from a froward

to the place in <hi>Matth.</hi> 18 <hi>that we must complaine to the Church,
and then if the offender heare not the Church, we must take him
for a heathen and publican.</hi> I grant that if the offence be pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate,
he must be first priuately dealt with. But this proueth
not, that either for priuate or open offences, we must waite
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:9956:10"/>
on them for redresse, which are enemies of the Church, and
which haue no power to binde and lose, as hath the church.
Wherefore let not <hi>Master Cartwright</hi> accompt so much of
the assemblyes he speaketh of: for what is a Church with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
this power we spake of? yea what are those assemblies
which in steade of it, do holde that Antichristian power of
the spirituall courtes, or rather are helde in bondage by it?
But <hi>Master Cartwright</hi> alloweth not onely those assemblies,
but also those vile courtes and officers, and Bishoppes set
ouer them to be all the Church of God. For he sayeth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde,
namely in the sixt page, that the calling of the
dumbe ministers, whichis by them, is a calling of the church
and sufficient to make them ministers: yea and he seemeth
to allowe also their suspendings of preachers, as if it were
done by the Church, so that both for complaint and for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse
of defaults, &amp; for establishing and gathering the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
hee alloweth or tollerateth those officers and courtes
to haue the power and authoritie of the church. But God
hath appointed no such kinde of complaintes in the
Church, neither such kinde of redresse, nor ordering of
matters. First, because they redresse and order matters by
money, Brybes, Fees, Ciuill penaltyes &amp;c. wherein the
Church discipline ought not to meddle. For the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
of our warefare sayeth Paul,<note place="margin">2. Cor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 10. 4.</note> are not carnall. He mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
that the Church maye not deale in matters of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
as doeth the common wealth and this present
worlde. The Church can deale no further then onely by
rebuke, warning and exhortation out of gods worde, and
by forsaking &amp; casting of fellowship in grosser sinnes: And
therefore rightly may the word and his Spirituall graces be
called the weapons of our warfare. Also in the church there
can bee no recompence made for sinne by money.<note place="margin">Num 35. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the sinner is the murtherer of his owne soule. And therfore
the law of god is, that for murther or killing any, there ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:9956:11"/>
him selfe, or the high Priest, which figured thus much, that
except we see in any transgressour open repentance and
faith in the death of Christ, we are to iudge him still dead
in his sinne, and that money can not make him to liue, nor
redresse his wickednesse. And the officers that take money
in such a case,<note place="margin">Hose. 4. 8.</note> doe euen eate vp the sinne of the people, as it
is written <hi>and lift vp their mindes in their iniquitie.</hi> Also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Iudges and officers of the court doe wrest Gods
Lawe,<note place="margin">Deut. 16. 14.</note> by their Popish cannon Lawe, and respect persons
and take rewarde which is forbidden in Deuteronomie (and
by their profession they must needes doe so, or else they can
not holde their office,) howe shal any make complaint vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them for Church matters, which can be counted none of
the church. And seeing Christ hath commanded to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine
to the Church against the sinner, howe shall Christs
ordinance be broken by complaining vnto such wretches.
Furthermore seeing the Scripture sheweth that the church
hath nothing to doe to iudge those which are without,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 5. 12.</note> how
shal any complaine of such a number of wicked men, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
were worthie to be cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted the church. Againe, seeing no
godly man may seeke iudgement vnder the vniust,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 6. 1.</note> as Paul
sheweth, if he haue a matter against a brother, why shoulde
we seeke vnto such for iudgement. Further the rebuke and

               <hi>For we knowe perfectly (saith Paul)

               <hi>that his sheepe will not

<hi>because they deuoure,</hi>

exalt them selues, and as it were smite the people on the face, and
cast them them in prison, they do all these things; besides the church
gouernment, and therefore ought to be reiected, and in no case to
be uffered.</hi> Thus it is manifest by the worde of God that
such proude prelates, and Antichristian vsurpers, haue no
authoritie nor power of the church: neither is their sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendings
to be counted suspensions by the church, nor their
calling of Ministers a calling by the Churche. Nay
surely the least in the kingdome of God shalbe able by the

&amp; haue no felowship with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the church &amp;
so to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are vtterly plucked out of the Church. For
they are kings and priests vnder Christ,<note place="margin">Reuel. 1. 6.</note> to execute the lords

            <p>He alleadgeth another proofe by peraduenture. For he
guesseth, that peraduenture we will say, it were better for an
assembly to haue no minister at all, then to haue a blinde
reading minister. And then he reasoneth thus, that hauing
none at all but yesterday they are the church, or may be the
church, then hauing a dumbe minister to day, they are still
the Church of god, and can not so suddenly be made the sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue

of Satan. This is a slender proofe, and borowed by
imagination: for we make not the minister, whether du<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>be,
or not dumbe to be the essence, substance, or life of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Church, but the keeping of the couenant by the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde

               </gap>th the keeping of the couenant by this discipline, his
staffe of beautie, as appeareth in Zecharie, which being
broken, he disanulleth his couenant with the people, and so
they become the sheepe of slaughter, For he saith, <hi>I will not
feede you: that that dyeth, let it dye, and that that perisheth, let it
perish, and let the remnant eate euery one the flesh of neighbour.</hi>
Likewise in Iere. &amp; Ezek. as the breaking of the couenant is

as though they that helde the couenant to day, might not
breake it to morowe, and as though any grosse wickednesse
committed of all, were not the breaking of the couenant by
all. Did not the people pleade truely against Reuben and
God,<note place="margin">Ioshu. 22. 18.</note> that if they rebelled to daye against the Lorde, euen
to morrowe the Lorde woulde be wroth with all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
of Israel. And they alleadge further, that for A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chans
sinne, wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel.
Howe suddenly and quickely was this sinne committed?<note place="margin">Ioshu. 7. 12.</note>
and howe soone was the Lorde prouoked, euen to forsake
all the congregation, and to be with them no more, except
they destroyed the excommunicate from among them: for
so are the wordes of the Lorde him selfe. Nowe what was
that sinne, which Israel calleth rebellion in Reuben and
God, both against the Lorde, and against the rest of Israel?
And what was the sinne of Achan? Surely they thought
that the Reubenites and Gadites had broken that comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
which the Lorde had giuen them,<note place="margin">Deut. 12. 11. 12. 13<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> namely, that they
should not offer their burnt offerings in euery place which
they liked, but only in the place which the Lorde had cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:9956:12"/>
to put his name there. Now who knoweth not, but that
that place of the name of God, figured the visible Church
of god, so that this matter toucheth <hi>M. C.</hi> very neerely. For
if it be true, that as all sacrifices then, so all sacraments now,
are rebellion against the Lord, being ministred without the
visible Church of God, then that sinne which he calleth a
fault, shalbe found to be more then a fault, euen rebellion &amp;
falling away from the Lord. And this is a sinne of execrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
euen abomination in the eies of the Lord, to measure the
visible church of god, by a compasse of ground, by a nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber
of housholdes, by slint of tythes &amp; tenthes as we see in our
parishes. For the place maketh not the church, neither is the
church or true religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be measured by the place,<note place="margin">Iohn. 4. 23.</note> as Christ
him selfe teacheth vs, <hi>for neither in the mountaine where the
father worshipped, neither yet at Ierusale the citie of god, was God
any more to be worshipped, but the true worshippers shall worship
the father in spirit &amp; truth.</hi> By which words Christ meaneth
thus much, first, that the spirit &amp; trueth being shewed by the
outward good profession, declare the outwarde Church of
God, and not the places, neither temples, nor cities, nor pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes.
For in whome we see the spirit, that is, the graces of
the spitit by their outward good works, and the trueth, that
is the lawes and word of Christ which is true, to be kept &amp;
obserued, them only we must call the Church of God. And
therefore in <hi>Isaiah</hi> it was shewed before<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> that with those on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
which turne from iniquitie in Iacob,<note place="margin">Isa. 59. 20.</note> will the Lord make
his couenant, euen his spirite which is vpon them, and his
words which he hath put in their mouth. Secondly by those
wordes Christ teacheth, that al the Iewish ceremonies shuld
be abolished, because the chiefest, euen Ierusalem and the
Temple should be no more. For the temple at Ierusalem &amp;
circumcision were the chiefest. How great the citie and the
Temple were,<note place="margin">1 King. 8. 29.</note> it appeareth by that prayer of Salomon, 1.
<hi>Kinges</hi> 8. 29. And by sundry other places. <hi>Deuteronom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And of circumcision Paul reasoneth with the Galatians,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:9956:13"/>
               <hi>That if they be circumcised, they are bounde to keepe the whole ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall
lawe:</hi> for it being one of the chiefest ceremonies,<note place="margin">Gala. 5 3.</note>
if they still obserued it, they should also obserue all the rest,
but if they reiected the chiefest, they should also reiect all
the rest. And to that ende Christ reasoneth, that seeing all
things are nowe to be verified in spirit and trueth, therefore
all ceremoniall and superstitious worship shoulde cease. As
also Paul reasoneth,<note place="margin">Gala. 5. 18.</note> 
               <hi>That if they be led by the spirit, they are not
vnder the ceremonies of the lawe.</hi> So then it appeareth that ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things,
because they were ceremonies, belong not to the
Church. And because such abomination is committed by
them, namely, the due planting and gathering of the church
is hindred, and the libertie of the Church for remouing euil
ministers stopped, they are euen the execrable things which
<hi>Achan</hi> did steale. For if the common wealth (as it ought)
had long agoe taken from the ministerie those tenthes, and
Popish liuings, then <hi>Iericho</hi> being once destroyed (I meane
the Antichristian churches once put downe) had not so

is not chiefe, but Christ, and that wee make nothing of
the dumbe minister, and yet will needes haue him to be the
head of those Churches. Indeede we make nothing of him
concerning any goodnes that is by him, for he helpeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
thereto, but concerning the mischiefe and hurt which
he doeth, or the sinne that is by him,<note place="margin">Iere. 10. 21.</note> let him not say wee
make nothing of it. <hi>For if they be beastes</hi> (as it is written) <hi>so
that by their want of vnderstanding and conscience, the flockes of
the pastour be scattered and perish, shall we say it is nothing. If
they be those foolish shepheardes whome the Lorde saith by Zecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
he will raise vp in iudgement, to sell and to slay the sheepe,</hi>

he sayeth that Christ is the head of those assemblyes, and
not the dumbe ministers. That Christ is their head or fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
he can not prooue, as was shewed before, wherefore
for any thing he can prooue, the dumbe ministers in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of the Bishops and their officers, are the chiefe and
heades ouer them. That they are alwayes chiefe we saide it
not, for when the Bishoppes which are greater vsurpers are
present, then they are heades, and both the dumbe ministers
and hireling preachers, may serue well ynough to bee the
tayle. For Satan hath all wayes by such,<note place="margin">Reuel. 12. 4.</note> as by the taile of the
dragon, drawing the third part of the starres of heauen, and
cast them to the earth. What shall we vnderstande by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
but the shewe of the church, as it were set in heauen, &amp;
by the starres, but the children of the church, falling to wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes

company. For they (saith he) were not cast foorth of the
lords host by Moses, therefore should not these assemblyes
also which haue a dumbe minister thrust vpon them, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
for runnegates from the Lorde, well, let vs see: was
not in deede <hi>Corah</hi> with those that claue to him,<note place="margin">Num. 16.</note> put apart
from the hoste of the Lord?<note place="margin">verse. 24. 25. 26.</note> First, Moses commaunded the
congregation (&amp; the Lord so bade him) to depart from the
tents of those wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest
they perished in their sins: was not this a putting apart, or
a casting out? Againe by the word of the Lord in the mouth
of Moses, the earth opened her mouth,<note place="margin">verse. 31.</note> and swallowed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
vp quicke. For assoone as he had ended his words (saith the
text) euen the grounde claue asunder that was vnder them:
was not this also a putting apart, or a casting out? The next
day also fourteene thousand and seuen hundreth dyed by a
plague for cleauing still to <hi>Corah</hi> by an aftermurmuring:
was not this a putting apart? And these iudgements were
both an ensample and a figure of the spirituall iudging at
this day, both by excommunication, &amp; by rebuke, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
iudgement. For otherwise to what purpose is it
said in the reuelation, <hi>that the witnesses at this day,</hi> meaning e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
faithful preacher,<note place="margin">Reue. 11. 4.</note> 
               <hi>are as oliue trees, and golden candlesticks

of their mouthes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and deuoureth their enemies: and that they haue

they will.</hi>

We read that Dathan &amp; Abiram would not come to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined,
and so of them selues they were put apart. As for
<hi>Corah</hi> and his company two hundreth &amp; fiftie, where as
they tooke censers &amp; came before the Lord in the doore of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:9956:14"/>
the tabernacle, they did it as vsurpers: and both in the very
acte doing were separate by fire to destruction, and before
the act, Moses is so farre from ioyning with them, or from
allowing or tollerating their act, that he prayeth against it,
saying, Lord looke not vnto their offring Likewise that the
people ioyned not with them in their censing, it is euident:
for euen while they were burning incense, or before, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

was giuen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which they obe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

get them away from about the tabernacle of Corah, Dotha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
&amp; Abiram, and touch nothing of theirs. Now if any will
take vantage, that yet their ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sers were holy, as the text saith
because they offred them before the Lord: &amp; so will impute
some holines to the ministery of dumbe ministers, let vs co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
what holines this was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> First, their action was altogether
vnholy, &amp; none might or did ioyne with them therein. And
ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fore the censers were consecrate as a signe &amp; reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
saith the text, that no stranger which is not of the seed of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aron,<note place="margin">verse. 39. 40.</note>
come nere to offer incense before the Lord, that he be
not like Corah &amp; his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie. Wherfore those censers were
holy, because they were made a holy signe of iudgement for
warning to all posterities not to do the like: wherefore I
would say, there were holines in the dumbe ministery, if all
the dumbe ministers were hanged vp in the Churches and
publike assemblies, for a warning &amp; terrour to the rest, that
are readie to enter such a function. Then indeede they were
a holy signe &amp; reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance of iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t against such wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
but other holines haue they none in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Yet <hi>M. C.</hi> dare
say that their ministration of Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, &amp; reading of prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
is holy &amp; sanctified, yea so farre sanctified that we may
lawfully receiue the Sacraments of them, &amp; ioyne with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
in praiers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Belike because Moses commanded Corah &amp; his
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany to come with their censers, therfore those also must
come with their seruice books. But did Moses cal the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for any
other purpose, saue only to destroy the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? Did he meane as <hi>M
C.</hi> doeth, to ioyne with them, to tollerate their ministerie, to
excuse their vsurping, to pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce a blessing on their mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery.
For indeed it is blessed if it be as he saith, that we may
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:9956:15"/>
lawfully receiue the Sacraments of them. Did not Moses
say plainely, <hi>To morrowe the Lorde will shewe who is his, and
who is holy, and who ought to approche neere vnto him?</hi> meaning
that by his terrible iudgement, he woulde shewe that they
were none of his, and that there was no holinesse in their
action of comming neere to the Lorde. Surely therefore,
this holinesse which <hi>M. Cartwright</hi> imputeth to the dumbe
ministers and their assemblies, is like the holinesse, whereof
<hi>Corah</hi> spake together with his companie, saying, <hi>That all the
congregation was holy, euerie one of them, and the Lorde was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An other proofe <hi>Master Cartwright</hi> taketh by the seales
of the couenant, that is, the Sacraments. They haue the
Sacraments (saith he) as seales of the couenant, therefore they
are within the couenant, and so are the Churches of god.
Here the question falleth out, whether the sacraments are
false sacraments, and counterset seales of the couenant: He
saith it is graunted him, that they are true and vncounter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faite
sacraments being ministred by sufficient ministers, for
(sayeth he) if we condemne the seales set to by dumbe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
then we must needes iustifie the Sacraments mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred
by sufficient ministers: So by his iffs and supposings
he will gather against vs what proofes he list. But though
they be preaching ministers, yet are they not sufficient mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
as we shewed before. <hi>For if they goe out of the way,</hi> as
it is written,<note place="margin">Mala. 2. 5. 6. 7. 8.</note> 
               <hi>and cause many to dash and fall by the lawe, they are
not sufficient ministers, but they breake the couenant of Leui, and
the Lorde will make them despised and vile before the people, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they keepe not his wayes.</hi> If they be neuer so famous in
preaching, yet if they be worldly minded men,<note place="margin">Phil. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ministers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But why did <hi>M. C.</hi> so subtlely set contrary
to dumbe ministers, sufficient ministers, &amp; not rather prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
ministers. For the question is of false professors, and
of a false profession, and therefore also of preachers which
hold a false profession, together with their assemblies: now
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:9956:15"/>
such we say are not sufficient. for they are not such as Paul
appointeth in his epistles to <hi>Timothie and Titus.</hi> So herein
we see howe <hi>Master Cartwright</hi> misseth of his proofe,<note place="margin">Titus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 6, 7, 8, 9.</note> and
in missing doeth take a further foyle.<note place="margin">1. Tim. 3. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.</note> for he reasoneth that
if the Sacraments doe prooue a Church, then though they
haue not the discipline commanded by Christ, yet they are
the Church. But howe doeth this followe? belike he thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
that the Sacraments may be seuered from discipline,
yea and the Church also, and yet be an outwarde and visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Church of God. Howe true this is, it followeth after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
to be examined. First let vs stande on his proofe, that
he taketh by the iudgement of other Churches in Europe,
all which (saith he) giueth the right hande of societie vnto
our <hi>English assemblyes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> which proofe he confesseth not to be
so strong, yet strong ynough to stay all sudden iudgements,
and so long to cause silence til on eyther side the light of the
trueth doe breake foorth. I will not heare enter into that
question, whether the Churches haue power to sit in mens
consciences, and to shut vp mens mouthes from testifying
their iudgements and consciences, for in some matters <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
Cartwright</hi> doeth giue them that power, namely <hi>for their
verdite and sentence, which be true Churches of God.</hi> What van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
the Pope and Papistes might take hereby for defence
of their churches it may be easily iudged: and what a clog
to mens consciences it were to iustifie and ioyne with all
assemblies, till all the churches by generall consent did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
them, let euery one iudge. But surely Paul witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 2. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.</note>
               <hi>that the spirit of God in his children searcheth out all things
euen the deepe things of God: yea it iudgeth and knoweth all
things that are of God.</hi> And againe he saith, <hi>that he which is
spirituall discerneth all thinges: yet he himselfe is iudged of no
man:</hi> meaning, that indeede worldly men can not rightly
iudge of him. wherefore the godly may freely both iudge
and giue their iudgement, euen of all assemblies which they
knowe, whether they be the true Churches of God.<note place="margin">Phil. 4. 7, 8, 9.</note> And in
another place he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeth <hi>not onely to minde, iudge &amp; think
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:9956:16"/>
on all things that are true, and honest and iust, and pure but also
to doe them.</hi> Wherefore as we ought to loue the godly and
their assemblyes,<note place="margin">Phil. 1. 9.</note> so our loue (as Paul teacheth vs) ought to
abounde more and more in knowledge and in all iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that wee may discerne thinges that differ, especially
that wee may knowe the house of God from a denne of
thieues. But herein <hi>Master Cartwright</hi> doeth much abuse
vs and also all the Churches of Europe. For neither we,
doe cast out the churches of two whole. Ilandes as he saith,
neither doe they holde them all in For though the fame of
the Martyrs of Englande came to their eares, and also their
doctrine &amp; profession at that time, as they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues wrote
it or testified it by mouth, was knowen vnto them, and then
in the time of affliction they tooke them for brethren and
churches, yet it followeth not, that nowe in our securitie,
they heare of our canon lawes and popish gouernment &amp;
of our wofull abuses thereby, or if they doe heare, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
they doe hastily iustifie vs. In deede they can
not rashly condemne vs, because they knowe not our state:
and rather they should take our assemblies to be the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of God, for the fame they haue sometimes heard of the
Martyrs. But that we which throughly knowe them, should
not iudge truely and doe accordingly, it is both against
reason and duetie.<note place="margin">Mat. 15. 13, 14.</note>

we haue not, we knowe that all the commaundements of
God, vpon the like occasions, belong vnto vs. And concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
authoritie and power, wee prooued before, that the
least in the kingdome of God, hath it equall with Ieremie
or any of the Prophetes. Hereby is that also aunswered
which <hi>Master Cartwright</hi> inferreth, that if one man bee
founde worthie of excommunication, the smaller part of
an assembly is not to proceede against him, if the greater
part will not. What doctrine is this? and what one worde
of God doth he name for profe of this &amp; diuers other such
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ike? For though Kings &amp; nations &amp; all the would, wuold
take any knowen wretched liuer to be a brother, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
with him, yet neithe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>r the smaller part of an assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
neyther I alone ought to do it. For there is a flat law
set downe by the Lorde:<note place="margin">Exod. 23. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Thou shalt not followe a multitude
to doe euill: neyther agree in a controuersie to decline after many,
and ouerthrowe the trueth.</hi> But <hi>Master Cartwright</hi> will saye,
that this Lawe was giuen for wittnessing the trueth in
publique iudgement, and not that euery one shoulde
take vpon him to excommunicate. We knowe that the
common wealth of Israel: and their ciuill iudgement
did figure out the Lordes Spirituall iudgement in his
Church:<note place="margin">ephes. 2. 12.</note> and therefore it is sayde of Saint Paul that wee
are nowe no more aliauntes from the common wealth of
Israel; which wordes doe shewe that their Common
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:9956:17"/>
wealth did figure out our spirituall fellowshippe. But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it did or no, the lawe is generally giuen both for ciuill
iudgement, and for all dealings in controuersie, that wee
ought to giue true iudgement and testimonie, and not to
keepe backe iudgement, or peruert the trueth for any mans
cause, yet we say not that euery one may excommunicate
alone. <hi>For we ought to tell the Church,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 18.</note> (saith Christ,) and so
we should haue the church to ioyne with vs in that action.
And Paul sheweth <hi>that his spirit &amp; theirs being met together,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 5.</note>
               <hi>was ioyned as in one for excommunicating the incestuous person.</hi>
but what if the rest of the church will not ioyne with vs
therein? Surely then, as we prooued before, we must set our
selues against them all, we must not be afraid of their faces,
as the Lorde commandeth,<note place="margin">Ierem. 1. 17.</note> lest he destroy vs before them.
For they all, that knowing <hi>Achans</hi> sinne, refuse being war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to cut him off,<note place="margin">Iosh. 7.</note> are guiltie with him in his sinne, or if
they touch or come neere the tents of <hi>Corah, Dathan and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biram,</hi>
they shall perish with them:<note place="margin">Nomb 16.</note> or being in a citie that
is fallen away to Idolatrie, if they flee not out of it, or set
not them selues against it,<note place="margin">Deut. 13. 15.</note> they shall be destroyed with it.
All which indgements doe teach the Church at this day,
true iudgement: namely, to set it selfe both against small &amp;
against great companyes, if they withstande or refuse the
true discipline of the church.<note place="margin">Iere. 15. 10.</note> For Ieremie saith of him selfe,
that he was as a contentious man, and a man that did striue
with the whole earth: euery one did curse him, his owne fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliars
watched for his halting, as he saith in another place,
he was in derision daily and euery one mocked him:<note place="margin">Ierem. 20. 7, 8, 9, 10.</note> for
he called the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al an assembly of rebels, priuate famillar fello<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe
he brake off with them, as was shewed before, and
openly he came not amongest them, but only to proclaime
their sinnes, and preach vengeance against them. If it bee
then asked, whether <hi>Ieremie</hi> did condemne them al as none
of the church and people of God:<note place="margin">Ierem. 5. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</note> let <hi>Ieremie</hi> him selfe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
it, for indeede by their vsuall and common professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and trade of life, they shewed not them selues to be the

people and Church of god. For as it is written, both the
great men and rulers,<note place="margin">Ierem. 9. 2, 3. &amp;c.</note> and also the inferiour and poorer
people had all together broken the yoke and burst the
bandes. In the streetes of Ierusalem, and in the open places
there could not a man be fonnde, that did execute iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and sought the trueth, that the Lord might spare the

<hi>that when iudgement was turned backewarde, and iustice

<hi>there were some that refrained from euill, and were made a pray to

               <note place="margin">Isa. 51. 18.</note> In deede openly there was none to reforme the
church: of all his children there was none that tooke her by
the hande to bring her into the way. For the Lorde sought
for a man among them that shoulde make the hedge,<note place="margin">Ezek. 22. 30.</note> and
stande in the gappe before him for the land, that he should
not destroy it but he found none. Yet there were those that
had a marke on their foreheades,<note place="margin">Ezek. 9. 4.</note> as mourning and crying
for all the abominations that were committed. And if it be
asked, whether these were a visible church of God, it is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
by Ezekiel in another place, that among the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
and in the countreyes where the Lorde did scattere
them,<note place="margin">Ezek. 11. 16.</note> he was as a litle Sanctuarie vnto them: whereby is
meant, that though they wanted the visible signe of the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
and Sanctuarie at Ierusalem, yet their holy conuersati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
shoulde shewe the Lord to be among them,<note place="margin">Ezek. 34. 17.</note> and that the
Lorde would iudge betweene sheepe and sheepe, betweene
the rammes and the goates. It is manifest that the Synago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:9956:18"/>
of the Iewes in Antiochia and Ephesus were the
churches of God: yet when Christ was preached vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
and they withstoode Paul and Barnabas, did Paul or Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas
stay for the consent of the most part to cast them off?
Did they not foorthwith separate the disciples,<note place="margin">Act. 13 46. 51.</note> and gather
the church apart from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? yea will <hi>M C.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act 19. 9.</note> say: for they were
worthy to be cast off, seeing they refused Christ. Then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
it is true, that one man or a fewe persons may cast off
whole churches, for some greater sinnes and offences. How
then is it true which <hi>M. C.</hi> saith, that one man being founde
&amp; iudged to deserue separation, should not be separate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the most part do consent? He wil say peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture, that
he excepteth idolaters &amp; apostates fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Lord. why then
did he giue a generall rule, without naming such exceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s?
yet Christ for all disobedience in refusing any message of
God, doth giue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement,<note place="margin">Mat. 10. 14.</note> euen to all and euery one of
his messengers, to cast off whole cities and churches,<note place="margin">Luk. 9. 5.</note> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in a worse case then Sodome and Gomorrha. <hi>For if
they receiue you not,</hi> sayeth he, <hi>nor heare your wordes, when ye
depart out of that house or that citie, shake off the dust of your
feete against them.</hi> He will answere, that their sinne also of
not receiuing the messengers of Christ, was the sinne of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postacie.
And is not this a message from Christ, when one
or a fewe persons doe iustly rebuke the congregation for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowing
the Lordes discipline and treading his scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
vnder foote? and is not his scepter cast downe, and his
kingdome polluted, when he which is manifestly know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
and prooued to deserue separation, can not be cast out?
But againe he will say, that those cities and churches were
not cast off, for refusing the Lordes messengers, but for refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
such a message as they brought: namely that the
Christ and Messiah was nowe come in the flesh. Surely til
after the death of Christ, they had no such message. For
Christ straightly charged his disciples, that they should tell
no man,<note place="margin">Mat. 16. 20.</note> that he was Iesus the Christ: meaning that till his
death and rising againe, it is not meete that that doctrine
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:9956:18"/>
shoulde be blased abroade, but it was sufficient for that
time, if they generally beleeued in the Messiah, as the
Iewes also did, and refused him not when he shoulde be
preached more clearely yet long before his death was the
commandement giuen, concerning those houses or cities,
which shoulde refuse his messengers. yet in deede it is true,
that they which refuse his discipline and gouernement, do
also refuse Christ him selfe: and so it is the sinne of apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacie.
For so it is written,<note place="margin">Luk. 19. 27.</note> 
               <hi>Those mine enemies which woulde
not, that I shoulde reigne oner them, bring hither and slay them
before me.</hi> But hereto they will answere, that yet till iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was executed by the Lorde him selfe, they were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
his Citizens:<note place="margin">verse. 14.</note> for so the text sayeth that his Citizens
hated him, and sent an ambassage after him, saying, we wil
not haue this man to reigne ouer vs. But doe they not
knowe, that they are called his Citizens, because they
should haue bene so, and were not, but became his enemies.
Indeede they were Citizens in name only, but not in deed.
So Ierusalem in name was called the citie of God, yet in
deede it became that great Citie, as it is written,<note place="margin">Reuel. 11. 8.</note> which spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually
is called Sodome and Aegypt, where our Lorde
also was crucified. The Iewes were planted a noble vine
as Ieremie witnesseth:<note place="margin">Isa. 5 7.</note> and Isaiah sayeth, that the vineyard
of the Lorde of Hostes was the house of Israel, and the
men of Iudah (were sometymes) his pleasant plant, but
nowe they are turned vnto me sayeth the Lorde into the
plantes of a strange vine.<note place="margin">Iere. 2. 21.</note> yea that we be not beguiled with
the Names of Gods house, Church, and Citie, he him selfe
hath giuen it a name, as it is written, the name of that city
shalbe from that day,<note place="margin">Ezek. 48. 35.</note> 
               <hi>The Lord is there.</hi> And in this respect
also it is called in Ieremie the throne of his glorie. As who
say that amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>soeuer we see not the Lord to reigne by

complaint of the penitent, and not to proue that the wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched

God.<note place="margin">Isa 35. 8.</note> Wherefore to conclude this matter, <hi>The path and way
of the Lord is holy,</hi> as the prophet teacheth, <hi>&amp; no polluted shal
passe by it: there shalbe no lyon, no noysome beast shall ascend by it,
neither shall they be founde there.</hi> whereby is meant that open
and grosse sinners shall not be suffred in the Church. For
either they shall be separate by excommunication, or els all
the godly shall withdraw them selues from them, and hold
them accursed. As it is written, If any man loue not the
Lorde Iesus,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 16. 22.</note> let him be had in execration, yea excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
to death. And surely they loue not the Lorde, but are
his enemies,<note place="margin">Luke 19. 2 7.</note> as was shewed before, which refuse his gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that he can not reigne ouer them. And againe it is
written,<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 5. 3.</note> 
               <hi>This is the loue of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Iohn. 2. 4. 5.</note> 
               <hi>that we keepe his commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts,
and he that sayeth I knowe god, or I loue god, and keepe not his

we can keepe his commandements without all breach or
offence. for wee are not Donatistes as the aduersaries sla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
vs: that we should say, we may be without sinne, or that
the church may be without publike offences, or if there fall
out some sort of grosser sinnes, that therefore it should cease
to be the church of God. we teach no such doctrine, but if
in any Church such grosse sinnes bee incurable, and the
Church hath not power to redresse them, or rebelliously
refuseth to redresse them, then it ceaseth to be the Church
of God, and so remaineth till it repent, &amp; take better order.</p>
            <p>And here co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth in that question to be decided, whether
without the discipline co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded of Christ, any assembly
or church may be called the church of Christ, <hi>M. C.</hi> saith,
that for want of this discipline, we giue al the english assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,
the blacke stone of condemnation. Howe truely he
writeth this of vs, his conscience is witnes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for we neuer said
that all the English assemblyes doe want discipline. Thogh
this matter be sufficiently debated before, yet let vs weigh
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:9956:19"/>
               <hi>Master Cartwrights</hi> answere. H sayeth that faith in Christ
is the essence, being, or life of the church: as for discipline it is
but accidental, and therefore the Church of God may haue
her being and life, and be named the church of God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
discipline. what worde of God doeth he bring for all
this? we knowe in deede that Christ is the life and essence
of the Church. For except as braunches we abide in him,<note place="margin">Iohn 15. 6.</note>
which is the true vine, we can bring foorth no fruite, we are
cast foorth as branches, and are to be consumed with fire.
Christ is the resurrection and the life. He is the way, the
trueth, and the life. So it is true,<note place="margin">Iohn 11. 25.</note> that Christ is the life of the
church,<note place="margin">Iohn 14. 6.</note> as for faith it is but the hand, whereby we take hold
of this life: As it is written, he that beleeueth in the sonne,
hath euerlasting life, and he addeth vpon it, as a tryall of
faith,<note place="margin">Iohn 3. 36.</note> euen our obedience to the sonne, and saith, he that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyeth
not the sonne, shall not see life, but the wrath of god
abideth on him. Nowe it was prooued before, that they
which are guilty of such horrible abuses, &amp; so grossely of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende
by their corrupt and false profession, haue not this
faith, neither do holde Christ the foundation. But see, how
fondly &amp; blasphemously <hi>Master Cartwright</hi> distinguiseth:
He will haue a dead Christ, or an Idol christ to be the life
of the church. For he will ioyne the church to Christ, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the discipline and gouernement of Christ. He putteth
asunder the church and the discipline of Christ, and so must
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eedes sunder Christ from his owne discipline or gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
Nowe Paul calleth this discipline,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 5. 4.</note> the power of our
Lorde Iesus christ. So if wee seuer christ and his power,
what is he but a dead christ? Also by his discipline, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement
he hath ouer vs, he is our king: as againe it is
written,<note place="margin">Hebr. 1. 8.</note> the scepter of thy kingdome is a scepter of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse.<note place="margin">Psal. 45. 6. 7.</note>
So if we seuer christ, and his discipline, rule, and
gouernement what is he but an Idol christ? If <hi>Master Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright</hi>
say, that by the scepter there is meant nothing else
but the power of the worde of God, I graunt it: as Paul
saith I will knowe not the speach or wordes of these men,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 4. 18. 19.</note>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:9956:20"/>
but the power: <hi>For the kingdome of God is not in worde, but
in power saith he,</hi> and in the psalme, <hi>The Lorde shall sende the
rodde of this power out of Zion. And the weapons of our warre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
are mighty through God,</hi> as againe he writeth. So then if
the power of the word to bynde &amp; lose, to remit or refaine
mens sinnes, to promise lyfe, and to rebuke and giue ouer to
execration be taken from Christ or the church of Christ,
what remaineth but an Idol or counterfet christ, an Idol or
counterfet church? Thus while <hi>M C.</hi> wil haue faith in christ
to be the life of the church without discipline, he doth leaue
christ himselfe without life, &amp; as one that is dead, or turned
into an Idol<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet further he proceedeth in his absurdities &amp;
blasphemies, &amp; saith, <hi>that fayth only is the essence, being, or life
of the church, and that besides faith, nothing is necessary to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
essence and being of the church.</hi> Thus be like children which
yet through want of discretion, can not haue faith, shall be
without the essence &amp; life of the church. How corrupt do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
this is, I neede not heere stand on it. If he say that by
the faith of the pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts they haue life &amp; esse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in the church,
the scripture is against him.<note place="margin">Gene. 17. 7.</note> For by the promise &amp; the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant
made to the righteous &amp; to their seed are their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
reckoned in the church &amp; not by their faith. Therefore
the faythful are called by Paul <hi>the children of promise.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 4. 18.</note> 
               <hi>For we
are (sayth he) after the maner of Isaac children of the promise,</hi> and
againe to the Romans, <hi>the children of the promise are counted
for the true seede of Abraham.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 9. 8.</note> But that by any mans faith his
children or others, should haue life &amp; essence in the church,
is the same false doctrine we refuted before. <hi>For the iust shall
liue by his fayth</hi> saith Habbakk If then a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shall liue by his
owne faith,<note place="margin">Hab. 2. 4.</note> he shall not liue by the faith of another. And by
baptising into the fayth and profession of any, we must
vnderstande, that we are baptized to holde the same fayth
and profession, when wee come to discretion, and not to
haue our lyfe and saluation by an other mans fayth, when
as yet we haue not the same fayth our selues. And if wee
shall liue by faith,<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 22.</note> then fayth is the meanes to come by that
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:9956:20"/>
lyfe, and is not the life it selfe. Wherefore Christ is the life
and essence of the Church, and not faith. Nowe Christ is
made as no christ vnto vs, except we holde him, and ioyne
with him as our annointed King, priest and Prophet. For so
the word (<hi>Christ</hi>) doth signifie. And here I demande of <hi>M. C.</hi>
whether the Kingdome, Priesthood, &amp; Prophecie of Christ
be of the essence and life of the Church. I am sure he dare
not say nay to this: and why then will he haue the Lordes
discipline or gouernement, to be but an accident or hangby
to the church <hi>For by Christ</hi> as paul sheweth, (<hi>that is by the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Christs kingdom, priesthood <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> prophecie) all his body,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 16.</note> 
               <hi>(that
is all his Church) are coupled &amp; knit together by euery ioynt, and
so receyueth increase and edyfiyng in God.</hi> So take away the
kingdom and gouernement of Christ, and there can be no
ioyning, nor coupling together of the church, no offices nor
callings in the church, yea no face, or shewe, or rather no
part, signe or token of the church. For these graces do we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
of Christs kingdome or from his imperiall Maiestie.
And therefore it is writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that when he ascended vp on hie,
(as our triumphant King and Gouernour) he led captiuitie
captiue,<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 8.</note> and gaue giftes vnto men: and againe, he ascended
far aboue all heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,<note place="margin">Iere. 14. 21.</note> that he might fill all things.<note place="margin">Ezek. 43.</note> And wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is the church and people of God in so many places,<note place="margin">Mat. 13. 7. &amp;c.</note> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the throne of God and the kingdome of God, but only
to shewe that without the discipline and gouernement of
Christ therein, it loseth eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her esse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, life &amp; being in christ.
And this <hi>M C.</hi> is forced to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse, For he saith that the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery
of the word is a part of this discipline, &amp; the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of the people is another: &amp; so reasoneth, that, take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
all discipline &amp; euery part thereof, &amp; there remaineth
no church of christ. Thus the truth hath made him to yeeld
in battell, and turned him backewarde, and yet he will resist
as it were going backward. For how backewardly doeth he
deale in this matter? to say that discipline is not pertaining
to the essence of the church, &amp; now for wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of discipline, to
take away the essence and name of the Church. Againe to
say, without discipline there may be a church, and nowe
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:9956:21"/>
to say that without discipline, there can be no church. So ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then he will be without an enemie, he will fight with a
shadowe. For nowe full wisely he doeth cut discipline in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
partes: namely the ouersight, rule, and gouernement of
such as haue charge in the church, and the obedience of the
people thereto: which two partes indeede doe conteine, all
the other partes, and therefore very vainely he speaketh of
other partes of discipline, as if they might be separate and
secluded from these. For he can shewe none in the church,
but either gouernours, or vnder gouernement: neither can
he shewe any duetie in the church, but onely the dueties of
gouernement or of submission and obedience: neither any
worke, matter, businesse, or ministerie in the church, but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of charge and ouersight, or vnder charge or ouersight.
Wherefore take away both gouernement and ouersight, &amp;
also obedience and submission, and there can be no other
part of discipline remaining. For the dueties of teaching,
exhorting, improouing, rebuking &amp;c. also all dueties of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining
and deciding controuersies, of reforming abuses,
of relieuing and maintaining the afflicted and poore, of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating
the vnworthy &amp;c. are contained vnder that parte
of gouerning. Also all dueties of beleefe and learning the
trueth, of reuerence, honour, meekenesse and all kinde of
seruice and vpright behauiour &amp;c. are contained vnder
that part of obedience and submission. Thus it is manifest,
that through want of discipline, there is no naturall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction
of the partes and members of the church together,
so that both the head and vitall partes are wanting, and all
the other partes are wholy and throughly either displaced
and peruerted, or vtterly lost and perished. But why doeth
he not shewe what part of discipline may be wanting, yea
and of those two partes, which he sayeth can not be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
yet what defect there may be. Indeede it is comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<hi>to forgiue a brother,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 17. 4.</note> 
               <hi>if he sinne seuen times in a day, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen

               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:9956:21"/>
But yet Christ giueth no power to forgiue, if a brother re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
wilfull in his sinne, yea if it be but a priuate sinne, I
am to proceede against him, and am not to cease, till either I
haue brought him to repentance, or haue broken off all fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowshippe
with him, as with a brother. But we must take

of the wicked is a binding, let him knowe that the Church
hath more liberty &amp; right, particularly to iudge those which
are within, then generally to iudge those that are without.
And safely, if it haue not power to iudge those which are
within, it hath no power of iudging at all. So that it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest,
that no part of church discipline can be wanting, but
the church doth straightway go to mine thereby. For a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
gathering of al together, was proued to be no church
of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Likewise if the couenant of the church, &amp; the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
thereof, be broken and disanulled, <hi>Master C.</hi> graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
that there is no church: and nowe it is shewed that
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:9956:23"/>
without that power of rebuking and iudging those which
are within, and of excomunicating those that deserue it,
there can be no church of God. As for that his fonde an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere,
that for some default in preaching, and some default
in obedience, the discipline of the church may fayle and yet
be the church, let him knowe that though some preacher or
other person offende, yet doeth not therefore the discipline
of the church fayle or want, except the church be negligent,
or wilfully refuse to redresse such offences, or is brought
into bondage that it can not redresse them. And yet also
the question is not of some weakenes and failing in disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
but a full want and ouerthrowe either of the whole,
or of some parte thereof. Wherefore that proofe they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadgeby
the Corinthians, that they wanted discipline, &amp;
yet were the church of God, is false &amp; very vaine. For they
wanted it not, but were negligent therein. They were not
vnder the bondage of a popish discipline, &amp; power, which
denyed and withhelde the Lordes discipline. Nowe negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
was a fault in them, yet not an vtter ouerthrowe and
failing of discipline. For being rebuked of Paul, they men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
this negligence,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 7. 11.</note> in so much that their repentance and
sorowe for their negligence wrought a great<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> care in them,
yea as the text saith, <hi>a clearing of themlselues, an indignation, a
feare, a great desire, a zeale, a punishing of themselues.</hi> Likewise
for their abuses in the Sacrament of the Supper, Paul con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth
euen the Supper,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11. 20.</note> and sayeth, <hi>This is not to eate the
Lordes Supper.</hi> And for abusing that Sacrament, many of
them were plagued of God, and dyed. So that although for
a tyme, they turned the Sacrament to be a iudgement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; the discipline of the church did fayle, yet was
it not therefore quite ouerthrowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; debarred from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
whereas some beleeued not the resurrection fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the dead,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 34, 35.</note>
it was the ignorance of those which had newely imbraced
the Christian profession, and not the ouerthrowe of the
church discipline. And here is that answered which <hi>M. C.</hi>
alledgeth, that Paul calleth the churches of God by the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:9956:23"/>
of the faythfull and Sayntes. For though some fall away
vnto wickednesse, yet by the discipline of the Church the
rest doe remaine as Saintes. And that tytle of Saintes is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst
<hi>Master Cartwright.</hi> For if they be Sayntes and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
howe shall they shewe forth a wicked and vnholy
profession, and still be called the Sayntes and Church of
God.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1, 2.</note> Though Paul wrote his Epistle to the Church and
Sayntes at Corinth, yet doeth he not thereby call the ince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stuous
person or other grosse sinners, the members or parts
of that Church. But in the fifth Chapter <hi>he calleth the ince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stuous
person a wicked man and not a Saynt.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 5. 13.</note> As for his tytle of
the faythfull, he can not shewe that Paul vseth it, without
addition of other wordes, to shewe the good profession of
that fayth: as in that place, (<hi>To the Sayntes</hi> fayeth Paul <hi>at E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesus

was the city without the walles any figure, but onely
by the walles. And therefore doth Nehemiah say in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde

remember himselfe, and shewe any place in the
worlde, that is called a city, and yet hath not the walles of
a City. Or an orcharde, garden, or close so called, without a
hedge, a wall, or some safe inclosing of fensing. Are a clump
of fruite trees called an orcharde, yf they stande open in the
fielde without any fence? or is a fayre piece of grasse
grounde named a close, if it be not enclosed. So by his
owne vayne reason he ouerthroweth him selfe. And wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
he sayeth that after their returne from Babylon <hi>the Citie
is called the Citie of the great king,</hi> euen before the walles were
builded: what proofe bringeth he for that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is called a city
indeede by Nehemiah,<note place="margin">Nehem. 2. 3.</note> 
               <hi>but a destroyed and waste Citie:</hi> hee
meaneth that it had bene a Citie, but nowe is destroyed and

               <hi>and he saith he would builde the citie,</hi> (not that it was
nowe a citie, for then it had bene buylded to his hande) but
the vse of speach is, that where a city hath bene, to call the
place and the ruinous heape of stones by the name of the
Citie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And so in Ezra, before their returne from Babylon,
<hi>The Heathen King Cyrus calleth the place of Ierusalem by the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:9956:25"/>
of Ierusalem,</hi> yet was neither the people of God there, nor
the Temple of God. <hi>Yea Zion was plowed like a fielde, and Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem

               <note place="margin">Ezra 1. 3.</note> 
               <hi>and the mountaine of the house, was as the
high places of the forest.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Micah 3. 12.</note> And being in that case it figured ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the desolation of the spirituall Ierusalem,<note place="margin">Ierem. 26. 18.</note> which in the
<hi>Reuelation is called Sodome and Aegypt:</hi> and howe then could
it be the City of God,<note place="margin">Reuel. 11. 8.</note> saue onely in Name, for that it had
bene so. Likewyse his descantyng about a vineyarde is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
himselfe. For there can be no yarde or court except
it haue the walles or fence of a yarde or count, and so where
no yarde is, there may be vynes growing, but there can bee
no vineyarde. And so where discipline is wanting, there
may be some graces of God appearing, as knowledge, and
an outwarde subiection to mens lawes and to Magistrates,
yea there may be Gods secrete elect children, and an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
false shewe of religion and deuotion: and yet no
true shewe nor face of an outwarde and visible Church of
God.</p>
            <p>Nowe <hi>Master Cartwright</hi> commeth to that poynt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the dumbe minister: of whome as he, so wee also
haue spoken before. But here he prooueth the Sacraments,
ministred by such, to be Gods Sacraments, and that men
may receiue them lawfully. His proofes are like wynde
blowen out of a bladder. he myght rather laugh at them
him selfe, then offer them to others to take viewe of his
folly. His first proofe is, they are ministers, but no lawfull
ministers, and they are ministers, though they be Idol my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
therefore he concludeth, that though they be Idoles
and vnlawfull ministers, yet wee may heare then<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue
the Sacraments of them. He confesseth them to bee
vnlawfull and Idol ministers, and yet their ministration or
mynisterie must be good and lawfull: This is as much, as if
one shoulde condemne a theefe and iustifie hys theft. For
if they be not messengers, nor ministers from Christ, then
their message and ministerie is not from Christ, but from
the deuill. For these be coniugates, an vnlawfull minister,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:9956:26"/>
and his vnlawfull ministerie: a messenger from the diuell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and his message from the diuell: a wicked man to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred
and his wickednes to be abhorred. Euen so it must
needes followe, that a minister being vnlawfull and of the
diuell, his action and deedes of ministration, are vnlawfull
and of the deuill.<note place="margin">Ier. 23 vers. 16. vers. 21.</note> And so the Lorde reasoneth, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
shoulde not heare the prophets that prophecied peace
vnto them, for he had not sent, nor commanded them: as
who say, because they were vnlawfull messengers, therefore
their message also was vnlawfull and to be refused. But
<hi>Master Cartwright</hi> sayeth that though they bee vnlawfull
messengers and Ministers, &amp; not of God, yet their message
and ministerie is of god. For it is not a false or euil message
or ministerie as was that of the false prophetes, but good
and necessarie for the Churche. For that that is of Christ
sayeth he, is good, and by their ministerie they giue vs that,
that is of Christ, hee meaneth the Sacramentes and their
reading of Common seruice. And so hee concludeth that
they are Ministers of good thinges. Yea and hee addeth
a further distinction? that to vs they are ministers of
god, but to them selues or in respect of them selues, they
are vnlawfull ministers. Surely these are trimme distinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to carrye him blyndefolde, hee can not tell whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
For whether will hee wander in his vanities? or
howe many deuelish doctrines will hee heape vp toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
First hee sayeth, they are vnlawfull ministers, and
yet ministers of god: then that they are ministers of god,
but not lawfull ministers of god: Thirdly that they
haue their calling and allowaunce by the Church and
yet are thrust vpon the Church: Fourthly that eyther
such dumbe ministers, and theyr ministerie is of GOD:
or if they bee of the Diuell, yet if the Bishoppe and his
officers doe authorize them, then the Churche doeth
authorize them, and noe man ought to refuse them:
Fiftely that their reading of seruice, is to bee heard, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a good thing from christ: sixtly that their sacraments
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:9956:26"/>
are to bee receiued as good thinges from Christe: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
also it followeth that Christe doeth sende such
dumbe, or blynde reading ministers to take charge of the
people: also that for a neede, reading ministers may bee
in the Churche in steade of preaching ministers: Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that the Byshoppes maye thrust vpon the flocke,
what Ministers they lyst, and giue them that autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
and calling which God can not giue them: Also
that the people shall bee counted Gods people and
Churche, though they bee vnder the deuilles messenger,
and subiect to his guyding. Howe vngodly and foolishe
doctrine is all this? and yet hee heapeth much more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it,<note place="margin">Psa. 145. 17</note> before his letter bee ended. It is written that the
Lorde is ryghteous in all his wayes and holy in all his
workes. If then anye Minister bee of God howe shall
he bee an vnlawfull minister? or if he bee vnlawfull,
howe shall he be of God? If he say a thing may be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
before men, which before GOD is not so, and
therefore that men maye take it as lawfull before God:
Let hym remember himselfe, that hee speaketh of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
ministers euen before men, yea whome hee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
knoweth and calleth vnlawfull.<note place="margin">Mat. 15. 13. 14.</note> So that beeyng vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
ministers both before men, and before God, how
shall they be ministers of god? Wherefore they are of the
Deuill, and plantes, which the heauenly Father hath not
planted, and therefore shall hee rooted vp: and christ
sheweth the way to roote them vp: namely that we let
them alone blinde guides, leaders of the blinde, and haue
nothing to doe with their guyding and ministerie.<note place="margin">Luke 5. 33.</note> For

through that lamentable bondage of popish discipline, we

               <note place="margin">Ier. 23. 14, 15.</note>

saith the Lorde <hi>as Sodome, and the inhabitantes thereof as Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morah</hi>
But let vs see, what are those things, of Christ, which
he saith the dumbe ministers can giue vs. Forsooth the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
and the reading of common seruice.<note place="margin">Nom. 16.</note> Indeede <hi>they
haue gotten the censers of Corah and his companie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 12.</note> and they are
made priestes of such places and churches, as the Lorde as
yet doeth not choose to put his name there. Wherefore as
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:9956:27"/>
as we shewed before, both their censings and their offrings,
that is their prayers and sacraments are reiected of the Lord
as execrable things.<note place="margin">Ezek. 44.</note> They are those strangers named in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiel
and in Nombers, which are not of the Leuites nor of
the seede of Aaron, but doe pollute the Lordes house, and
can not offer the sweete incense and pure offerings, which
Malachie speaketh of.<note place="margin">Mal. 1. 11.</note> Their Sacraments are stollen and
counterfet badges,<note place="margin">Reuel. 13. 16.</note> and howe then shoulde we receiue them
as markes of the true church of God? They offer the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense
of Nadab and Abihu.<note place="margin">Leuit. 10. 1.</note> For their stinted forme of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,
deuised by the Byshoppes, and translated from the
Massebooke, can neuer be prooued to be incense made by
fire from the Altar of the Lorde. But yet <hi>Master Cartwright</hi>
will iustifie their Sacraments and reading of seruice. Let vs
therefore see to his proofes.<note place="margin">Mat. 23. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> One proofe is this, the Scribes
and Pharises might be heard preaching true doctrine, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the dumbe ministers may be heard reading seruice: a
goodly proofe, For it was lawfull for the Pharisees to bee
preachers of the trueth, and it was a parte of their office
and ministerie: but it is not lawfull to be a blinde reading
minister, neither is it any parte of the ministerie, to reade
ouer such a stinted forme of seruice. Wherefore though I
may heare and like of that, which is truely preached, yet
doeth it not followe, that I shoulde heare, like of, or ioyne
with, that which is vngodly, and blasphemously spoken,
vttered or done. Againe he abuseth that place in Matthew,
<hi>saying, that it was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded by Christ to heare the Scribes.</hi> There
is no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement giuen to heare, but to do as they knewe
the Pharises taught truely. And though by occasion they
might heare them teaching trueth, yet were they separate
as was shewed before, from being their disciples: they were
not vnder their charge and ministerie, as those are nowe
vnder the dumbe ministers charge, whome <hi>Master Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright</hi>
doeth iustifie in hearing them, and receiuing the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
of them. Hee can not shewe that the Pharises
were no Leuites nor Priestes, and yet offered the sacrifices
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:9956:28"/>
as the Priestes And yet these doe minister the Sacrament<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
and will be Priestes ouer the people, beyng neither to bee
counted brethren, nor Christyans. And though the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rises
or Scribes had so farre vsurped, yet shoulde not the
people haue partaken with them in the sacrifices no more
ought the people at this day, to partake in the Sacraments
with such blinde ministers. But why doth not <hi>Master Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright</hi>
perceiue, that his owne proofe is against him selfe.
For if the Scribes and Pharises were to be heard because
they preached trueth, then are these dumbe ministers not
to bee hearde, because they are no preachers. But this
proofe fayling, <hi>Master Cartwright</hi> prepareth another,
namely this. The Scribes and Pharisees, were as vnfit and
as vnlawfull ministers, as our reading ministers, and yet
might be heard, therefore our reading minysters may bee
heard. Howe vnfitte ministers the Pharisees were, it is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
examined. We saye not, but that the dumbe ministers
may be heard. For if standing on the gallouse to be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
they say they woulde come downe, I knowe we maye
heare them. But the question whether we may be vnder
their charge and guiding, and so daily and vsually heare
them, as our spirituall guides, pastours, watchmen for our
soules, and ministers in the church. This <hi>Master Cartwright</hi>
can not prooue, and therefore his proofe serueth for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
matter, quite besides the question. Yea if he looke
well, this proofe serueth against him. For the disciples of
Christ were not to heare the Pharisees, as being their disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
and vnder their charge, therefore may not we be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the dumbe ministers charge, to heare them as our tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
and guides in Christ. Another proofe he giueth
thus: The dumbe ministers haue a calling by the Church,
as the scribes and Pharisees had: therefore wee may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
heare them and receiue them as ministers. In this
proofe wee haue these matters to consider whether our
dumbe ministers haue as good a calling as the scribes and
Pharisees had. Whether the bishops and their officers that
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:9956:28"/>
call ministers are to be counted the Church: whether if the
church shoulde appoint and receiue a dumbe minister, he
had thereby any whit more authoritie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or were any whit the
rather to be receiued.<note place="margin">Ezra 7. 6, 11.</note>

            <p>Then also he is against him selfe herein, for he confessed
before, <hi>That the dumbe ministers are thrust vpon the Churche,
and howe then can they bee called by the Churche:</hi> Thyrdely,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:9956:29"/>
if they were called, and then both the maner of calling bee
altogether blasphemous and wicked and the office whereto
they are called, is none of the church offices and callings of
what weight or authoritie shall their calling be? Shall wee
haue strange offices and ministeries in the Church, which
God hath not appointed? or shall wee giue any authoritie
or reuerence vnto them, because men account of them? shal
the blasphemie and wickednesse of a number, though they
be named the Church, make me any whit the more, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
a dumbe minister, because they doe wickedly and
blasphemously call and authorize him. Nay, <hi>I ought not to
followe a multitude to doe euill.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 23. 2.</note> For it is not as <hi>Master Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright</hi>
would haue it, that the moe which sinne in a matter,
the lesse the sinne is: but rather it is the more grieuous, and
more to be abhorred. <hi>And Paul giueth this libertie to Tim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie,
That though other men euen the Elders and people shoulde
choose any vnmeete minister,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Tim. 5. 22.</note> 
               <hi>yet hee shoulde not partake with
them in their sinne.</hi> And if in the acte of chusing, the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
of the church is not to be regarded, when it shamefully
abuseth her authoritie, then also in the wickednesse &amp; sinne
that is wrought by the choyse, it is lesse to be regarded. For
the reading ministerie is abominable wickednesse, and as it
first ouerthrewe the Churches of God,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 3.</note> and brought in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist,
so it is still the doore and high way to all ignorance,
dissolutenesse, and all wicked practises and customes.
Wherefore let <hi>Master Cartwright</hi> laye away his fonde di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
that they are ministers, though they be vnlawfull
ministers. For if the reading ministerie be no office nor cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
appointed by christ, then is it an office of Antichrist:
<hi>And why then shoulde he sticke so much on the worde minister, if
they be Antichristian and deuelish ministers? And what will he
make of the Church?</hi> It is indeede the house of the liuing
God, the piller and grounde of trueth. But <hi>Master Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright</hi>
will haue it to presume aboue Christ, and so will
make it an Antichrist. For if it ordeine strange ministeries
and offices in the church, which christ and his Apostles ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:9956:29"/>
coulde doe nor woulde do, doeth it not presume aboue
Christ? Christ and his Apostles coulde not thrust,<note place="margin">Luke 9 5.</note> no not
lawfull ministers vpon any congregation.<note place="margin">Mat. 10. 13, 14.</note> Neyther coulde
he commande any Congregation or Church to receiue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
ministers, and take them for their guydes. Yet by
<hi>Master Cartwrightes</hi> saying, we may receiue such: and if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
such be thrust vpon vs, we must account their ministery
to be sanctified, for the Churches sake which calleth them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Surely if the Church doe vsurpe and chalenge, such a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of ruling, and such a holines in sanctifying, which christ
neuer had: it becommeth the church of Antichrist, and
quite ouerthroweth the kingdom and priesthood of christ.</p>
            <p>But let vs see further what <hi>M C.</hi> sayeth. He pleadeth for
the dumbe ministers, by comparing them still with the
Scribes and Pharises, also with the priestes and teachers in
the olde lawe, with the chiefe Priestes at Christs comming,
and with vnsufficient and vnable Magistrates. He wil haue
them to haue as lawfull a calling and ministerie as any of
these. The Scribes sayth he, taught vntruely &amp; were decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
in the chiefe grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of religion, &amp; yet were to be heard
of the people: therefore our dumbe ministers are as lawful
ministers as they. Likewise he saith of the priests &amp; of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates
that some of the priests were dumbedogs, &amp; some
false teachers, and some had not so lawful calling, also that
some Magistrates are not lawfull &amp; sufficient Magistrates
and yet neither the Scribes nor the priestes nor the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
were to be reiected as no ministers nor Magistrats.
What true or false doctrine there is in all this, we will shew
by and by. But graunt it true which he sayth of the scribes,
Priestes, and Magistrates: namely that they were so euill,
as he sayeth, or taught such false doctrine, yet he him selfe
hath giuen the answere before, to condemne him selfe: For
he sayde that the Scrybes were not to bee heard, but in that
they taught trueth: and that our dumbe ministers were to
be heard and receiued so farre, as they can giue vs any thing
that is of Christ. Nowe it is shewed that a reading or dumb
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:9956:30"/>
ministerie is not of Christ, therefore we are not to receiue
or heare such a ministerie. Lykewise the Scribes when they
preached trueth, were to bee heard and receiued, therefore
these being no preachers, are not to be heard nor receiued.
The same may be sayde of Magistrates, that what duetyes
they are able and sufficient to doe, therein we may receiue
some good by them, therefore the dumbe ministers hauing
no ablenesse nor sufficiencie to that calling, are wholy to be
reiected. If he say that the reading of common seruice is
some ablenesse and sufficiencie of a minister, hee knoweth
well ynough that that is no parte, nor duetie of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie.
For though it bee written <hi>That the Leuites reade
in the booke of the Lawe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Nehem. 8. 8.</note> 
               <hi>and gaue the sense, and cause the people
to vnderstande the reading.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Actes 15. 21.</note> And againe in the Actes <hi>that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
was preached being read euery Sabbath:</hi> yet wee must not
thereby vnderstande a bare reading onely, neither a reading
of a stinted forme of seruice. <hi>For the order was,</hi> as appeareth
<hi>in Luke and in the Actes chap</hi> 13.<note place="margin">Luke 4. 17.</note> 
               <hi>to reade the Law and word of
God and then to preach vpon it.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Actes 13. 15.</note> And therefore as appeareth in
Nehemiah <hi>They read in the Booke of the Lawe, and preached
the sense and vnderstanding thereof to the people.</hi> And therefore
in Timothie,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 4. 13.</note> 
               <hi>Reading, exhortation, and doctrine are ioyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</hi>
If <hi>Master Cartwright</hi> doe further alleadge, that the
dumbe ministers haue some ablenesse or sufficiencie to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
the Sacramentes, he likewyse knoweth that it is no
parte nor duety of the ministerye,<note place="margin">Deut. 33. 10.</note> to reade a consecration
of the Sacramentes,<note place="margin">Eccles. 4. 17.</note> neyther to minister the sacramentes,
without preaching,<note place="margin">Mat. 28. 19.</note> and much lesse without the power
and abilitie to preache.<note place="margin">Actes 2. 42.</note> This is manifest in the olde Lawe
<hi>as in Deuteromie, Ecclesiastes, and in other places. Likewise in
Newe Testament, as in Matthewe, Actes and sundry other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi>
By all which places it is euident, <hi>That though preaching
may sometymes be without the present Acte of ministring the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes,
yet the Sacraments might neuer be ministred but of
preachers and with preaching.</hi> But nowe marke howe fonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hee compareth dumbe Ministers to vnable or vnsuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:9956:30"/>
magystrates, which shoulde rather bee compared to
Trayterous and vsurping Rebelles. For as anye vsurper
were wholy to bee reiected and withstoode, if hee shoulde
get from Her <hi>Maiestie</hi> her royall dignity and crowne, or
laye clayme thereunto: So also are these minysters to bee
reiected, which vsurpe a kyngdome and gouernement in
the Churche: when as they ought not to bee counted
brethren, nor members in the Churche. It agayne <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
Cartwright</hi> doe saye, that vsurping Traytours maye
geue vs our ryght, and wee are to take it, at theyr
handes: Wee aunswere, that this is the questyon, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the readyng of seruyce in that manner, and theyr
mynistring of Sacramentes bee ryght or no. Fyrst wee
shewed before, that such Sacramentes so mynistred, and
suche a readyng of Seruyce were execrable thynges
and also none of our ryght. But if they were our ryght,
yet a man is to take his ryght from vsurpyng Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toures
by force of armes, if hee bee able. Or if hee bee not
able, hee shoulde rather loose his righte, then doe suite
and homage to a Traytour. In deede the Lordes Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes
are our ryghte, and thankes bee to our Lorde
GOD, wee may haue them by other meanes, then by
the Dumbe Mynisters. And though wee coulde not,
yet wee shoulde not take our ryghte on a thyefe to iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>styfie
his theeuerye.<note place="margin">Iohn 10. 1.</note> 
               <hi>For these hyrelynges are theeues and
robbers comming in by the windowe, as it is written.</hi> So wee
shoulde first followe the Lawe on them, to thrust them
out of the sheepefolde, and then see if wee can get our
right For if all such Ministers were excommunicate from
among the brethren, wee shoulde knowe the better, both
what were our ryght, and howe to come by it. Againe
<hi>Master C.</hi> distinguisheth, that to be able to teache is not of
the substance of a minister, but onely of a lawful minister,
also that to be able to iudge true iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is not of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of a magistrate, but onely of a lawfull Magistrate
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:9956:31"/>
Such lyke sopperyes as these not worthie the answering, we
haue answered before. But here agayne we answere, that
the discipline of the Church and of the common wealth
are vnlike in this, that vngodly men, may bee sometymes
lawfull officers and magistrates in a common wealth: and
therefore Heathen Kynges, yea Idolatrous kinges and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are lawfull Magistrates at this daye<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Otherwyse wee
shoulde condemne our owne Kinges and Queenes, which
heretofore haue bene Popish and Idolatrous, as beeing no
lawfull Magistrates: But in the Church of God, this hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
not. For if any be a wretched liuer, or an Idolater, hee
can neither be minister nor lawfull minister in the church:
yea he is no parte, nor member of the Church. Againe we
say, that if any be an vnlawfull minister, hee is a Minister
quyte out of the Church, as we prooued before, and then
what hath the churche to doe with hym? <hi>Master Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright</hi>
will needes haue hym to bee a minister, and we are
content: for he shall bee a minister, not for the Churche,
nor to haue any medling in the Churche, but for Satan and
for the children of Satan. Further wee answere accordyng
to hys manner of reasoning that to auoyde Idolatrye, or to
be no Idolater is not of the substance of a mynister but of a
lawfull mynister: for he may be a minister though he be an
Idolatrous minister. But shall wee therefore say that dayly
massemongers commyng openly from the masse, to myni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
the Sacramentes, in the same order that our dumbe
mynisters doe, shall be receyued of the brethren, or that
the brethen shall receyue the Sacramentes at theyr handes?
And yet agayne wee answere that if a man bee not a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
minister, hee hath no essence nor substance of a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister:
except we saye hee hath the substance of a deuelish
minister. <hi>For the lawfulnesse of a minister, and of his ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is the essence and substance of a minister, and of his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string.</hi>
Paul saith,<note place="margin">Rom. 4 15.</note> 
               <hi>that where no lawe is, there is no transgression.
He meaneth that because there is a lawe, therefore the breach of
that lawe, is the essence and substance of sinne and transgression.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:9956:31"/>
The lawe</hi> saith he <hi>is it that causeth wrath: For it maketh sinne
to be sinne.</hi> Wherefore as that which is vnlawfull or against
the lawe of God, hath the being and essence of sinne: so it
must needs folow, that the lawfulnes of anything is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the essence &amp; substance of the same &amp; therfore also that
the lawfulnes of ministers is the essence, &amp; substance of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters.
And so we see how vayne his distinction is, that a
ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may haue the substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of a minister, &amp; yet be no lawful
minister. I would not so readily vse such schoole tearmes &amp;
words, as is essence, substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, &amp; being, if I were not forced
thereto by his vngodly subtleties. And surely except god in
iudgement haue blinded his eyes, he may well perceiue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
not only to be vngodly, but altogether childish &amp; vnlearned</p>
            <p>Nowe we come to answere other matters, which fall out
of the former proofes. As that he saith, the Scribes were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
deceiued in the Messiah. He might rather saye,
they were ignorant, in some mysteries of the Messiah, then
all together deceiued. And so Paul saith of them, <hi>That had
they knowen,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 2. 8.</note> 
               <hi>they woulde not haue crucified the Lorde of gloríe.</hi>
And <hi>Peter also saith That the people did it of ignorance,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 3. 17.</note> 
               <hi>as also
did their gouernours.</hi> Yea the Apostles them selues were a

Christ testifieth that many Prophetes and righteous men desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to see and heare those thinges which the Apostles sawe and
heard,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 13. 17.</note>

wrath was destructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, so to trust in him, was blessing and sal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>utio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
sTherefore it is not truely sayd, that they were altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
deceiued in the Messiah. Rather it is true that they were
ignorant but in these two poyntes. First,<note place="margin">Ioh. 6. 51.</note>

and secondly <hi>howe he being man shoulde be God also, and

so long as they helde the generall fayth and beleefe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Messiah, and were ignorant, whether that
particular man was the Messias, I say this ignoraunce for
the time was no open ouerthrowe of any grounde of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
For the Apostles were commaunded not to preache
Christ particularly to bee the Messiah,<note place="margin">Mat. 16. 20.</note> till after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection.
And the fayth of the holye Fathers before time
suffised to saluation, though particularly they knewe not
Christ,<note place="margin">Heb. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Wheseas <hi>Master Cartwright</hi> sayeth, that the Scribes and
Pharises taught iustification by workes, he hath graunted
before, that preaching false doctrine, they were not to bee
heard: and therefore the dumbe ministers, being no prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
at all, are not to bee heard. But if they taught that
doctrine, yet they taught but a true doctrine, except they
taught it as our Papistes doe at tthis day. For the Scripture
sayeth. <hi>That the man that shall doe the workes of the lawe, shall
liue in them,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 12.</note> or haue life by them.<note place="margin">Rom. 10. 5.</note> So then hee that can keepe
the Lawe,<note place="margin">Ezek. 20. 11.</note> without breach of the lawe,<note place="margin">Deut 30. 12.</note> shall be iustified by
the Lawe. But <hi>Master Cartwright</hi> can not prooue, that it
was a common doctrine among the Pharisees, that any man
coulde keepe the Lawe, without breach thereof. Yea there
is proofe to the contrary. <hi>For the chiefe Priest did once eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

               <hi>a man shall bee thrust out of the kingdome

that burden or yoke is rather meant, which is named

               </note> 
               <hi>which neither they, nor their fathers were able to
beare.</hi> This burden was the ceremonies of the olde Lawe,
which were more intollerable to others, then to the Scribes
and Pharises. For they being most of them Priestes and
Leuites, were not to bring their tythes, first fruites, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringes
to Ierusalem, as did others, from all quarters round
about. For they dwelt at, or about Ierusalem, especially
those whome Christ rebuketh, or else came to Ierusalem to
minister in their course. And they tooke tythes and payed
none,<note place="margin">Leuit. 18. 29.</note> saue onely the tenth parte of the tythes that were
brought them. They did very straightly looke to their
tenthes, and to all clensings, purifyings, vowes and offrings
&amp;c. for they were their liuing and maintenance. Wherefore
it being a great trouble and burden to others, to come from
all places of the worlde, to Ierusalem euery yeere, as the
Lawe then did bynde them, also to pay their vowes and
their tenthes and first fruites, and to obserue their purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
&amp;c. and no trouble at all to the Scribes which kept at
Ierusalem, no maruaile though <hi>Christ say they layed heauie
burdens vpon other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s shoulders, but would not touch them, them
selues with the leact of their fingers.</hi> For there being an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth
occasions in the yeere,<note place="margin">Leuit. 15. 12. 13, 14 &amp;c.</note> whereby the people might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
vncleane,<note place="margin">Colos 2. 21.</note> as by touching,<note place="margin">Nom. 19. 11, 12, 13. &amp;c. 16.</note> tasting,<note place="margin">Leuit. 5.</note> handling,<note place="margin">Rom. 9. 32.</note> by the
death of any that should dye by them by diseases, by igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
and escapes &amp;c. they were to bee cleansed by the
sprinckeling water, and to bring their offeringes to Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.
But <hi>Master Cartwright</hi> might haue alleadged a more
likely proofe then these, out of the Romanes: namely <hi>That
Israel sought not righteousnesse by faith, but as it were by the
workes of the Lawe: for they haue stumbled at the stumbling
stone.</hi> For answere hereto, we shewed before, <hi>that the Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites
made a profession of their faith in the Messiah, euen till the
tyme, that he plainely shewed him selfe: and then they reiecting
him, and yet beleeuing that he was still to come, their faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
as no faith: they beleeued in a Messiah which was to come,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:9956:34"/>
but they stumbled at him which was come. And so he was vnto
them that stumbling stone, and rocke of offence.</hi> And so this
worde (<hi>as,</hi>) or (<hi>as it were</hi>) is well added of Paul. For hee
meaneth, that their doctrine and profession, was not open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
nor directly to seeke righteousnesse by the bare Lawe,
but by their rebellion against the Messiah that was come,
they did as much and as they tearme it, indirectly. So as it
were they sought righteousnesse by the Lawe, when they
kept the ceremonial law, without the Christ that was come,
though not simply without the Christ they looked for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea
they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eleeued that the ceremonies did still offer and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Christ vnto them, &amp; so made profession that to keepe
the ceremonial law, was to keepe their faith and beleefe in
Christ <hi>But they hauing refused Christ co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e alreadie, and christ ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uing
abolished that law, they might well be said to seek righteousnes
without faith in christ.</hi> Thus it is manifest that the doctrine &amp;
sacrifices of the Iewes was to haue righteousnes and atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by Christ, whome their sacrifices did signifie: but
their deeds and practise in refusing Christ, was as much, as
to seeke righteousnesse by the law. <hi>Nowe those which refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
christ,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Actes 5. 13.</note> 
               <hi>and beleeued not in him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Actes 2. 40.</note> 
               <hi>were vtterly separate as was
shewed before from the communion and fellowship of the churche.</hi>
And therefore this matter is altogeter against him.<note place="margin">Luke 18. 9.</note> 
               <hi>As for
that place of luke, he abuseth it too much: for the parable of a pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise,
which speaketh of matters, as though they were, when in deede
they were not,</hi> he alleadgeth for proofe of all the Pharisees
doctrine. First, the fault of one Pharise if he had bene faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
can not prooue them all faultie: then also the parable
of a fault, doeth shewe it to be no fault committed, but i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magined
or supposed, as if it were committed. Thirdlye
Christ in that place, mindeth not to rebuke any doctrine of
the Scribes and Pharisees, but as the text sayeth, he spake a
parable vnto certaine, which trusted in them selues, that
they were iust, and despised others. None are named to
teeche any such doctrine, but certaine are rebuked for tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
in themselues, wherefore the like proofe to this, might
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:9956:34"/>
I alleadge against him: namely that very many in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
both preachers, and others doe trust in their riches, or
power, or wisedome or good workes &amp;c. Therefore the
preachers in Englande doe teach men to trust in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues.
But as this proofe is fonde, so the conclusion that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
is according<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For he concludeth that the dumbe mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie
is as lawful and good, as the ministerie of the Scribes:
which taught vntruely, saith he, in the chiefe grounds of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
Although he cannot proue such vntrue doctrine, yet
howe doeth it followe, that their ministerie, which faileth
in all poyntes, shoulde bee as good as theirs, which fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
but in some poyntes. For the dumbe ministers wee
prooued, to haue no parte nor worke in the ministerie,
And the Scribes hee confessed before to sit in Moses seate,
to teache true doctrine, to haue a calling by the Churche.
Agayne they must needes edifie more, which preache
much trueth, then they whiche are no preachers at all.
But the Scripture is playne, that if anye preache muche
trueth, and yet doe preache heresies withall, they are to be
auoided: as it is written,<note place="margin">Tit. 3. 10.</note> Reiect him that is an heretike,<note place="margin">Mat, 18.</note>
after once or twise admonition. And though the Churche
is to admonishe such, yet if it will not or can not, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
man particularly hath this libertie to admonishe, ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cept
for his scornefulnesse and obstinacie he be vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie.

to be refuted, which he addeth in these wordes, that the true

               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:9956:35"/>
say, the pollutions we speake of, were by Idolatrie:
let him knowe that Malachie spake to those, which were
no Idolaters, which also had a generall reformation from I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrie:
<hi>Likewise Haggai prophecied in a time of reformation,
and spake to those which were no Idolaters. And Ezekiel in that
Chapter, mentioneth no Idolatrie, but rebuketh other wickednesse,
as it were seuering it from Idolatrie.</hi> For in the next Chapter,
he toucheth their sinne of Idolatrie more particularly. And
to those that accounted so much of the Temple, and of the
sacrifices, as <hi>Master Cartwright</hi> doeth of his Churches and
Sacraments,<note place="margin">Isa. 66. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Isaiah saith thus, The heauen is my throne saith the
Lord, and the earth is my footestoole,</hi> and so he proceedeth to
rebuke their vaine bragge of the Temple, and then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to their sacrifices, saying, <hi>He that killeth a bullocke, is as
if he slewe a man, he that sacrificeth a sheepe, as if he cut off a
dogges necke: he that offereth an oblation, as if he offered swynes
blood: he that remembreth incense, as if he blessed an Idol:</hi> by
which wordes it is plaine that he rebuketh euen those, that
detested Idoles, and swynes blood &amp;c. and telleth them,
that their sacraments are no sacraments, they are vncleane
and polluted, as the most vile filthinesse, which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
abhorred. If he say, that yet to the godly in those
dayes, the sacrifices were lawfull and good, I aunswere that
the godly had uo medling with such wicked men, nor with
their sacrifices. For in the seconde verse after hee speaketh
thus to the godly,<note place="margin">Verse 5.</note> 
               <hi>Heare the worde of the Lorde, all ye that
tremble at his worde, your brethren that hated you, and cast you
out for my Names sake, sayde, let the Lorde be glorified: but hee
shall appeare to your ioye and they shall bee ashamed.</hi> So then
there was a great separation betweene the righteous and
the wicked in those dayes: in so much that the righteous
forsooke all fellowshippe in their sacrifices, and the wicked
cast them out from among them. If <hi>Master Cartwright</hi> say
that the righteous forsooke not their sacrifices, but were cast
out from them,<note place="margin">Isa. 59. 15.</note> it is answered in another place <hi>That while
they refrained from euill, they made them selues a pray to the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:9956:36"/>
So then the cause why they were cast out was, because they
woulde not partake with the wicked in their wickednesse.</hi> If
<hi>Master Cartwright</hi> saye that that was for other wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,

I aunswere that the question is not of forbidding and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barring
from the sacrifices, but of withdrawing our selues
from wicked companions in the sacrifices. And so it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
that if the whole Churche ought not to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
with such in the sacrifices, then no part nor member
of the Churche ought to communicate: and if the whole
Churche doe sinne and commit wickednesse by commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating
with suche: then if any amongest them will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
to communicate, they shall doe well, and shall not
sinne thereby. That the whole Churche ought not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate,
but to cast out such from amongest them, it is
prooued before.<note place="margin">Phil. 1. 17, 18.</note> But here is that place of Paul to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
which the aduersaryes lay against vs: whiche is
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:9956:38"/>
that some preache Christ of enuie and strife, and some also
of good will, and Paul reioyceth that Christ is preached
all manner wayes. By which wordes they woulde gather,
that we may communicate in the Churche with false tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
false prophetes, heretikes, and vngodly wretches.
Howe shamelessely they gather this,<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> euen Paul in the same
Epistle answereth them: for he biddeth them beware of
dogges, beware of euill workers: beware of the concision.
Woulde Paul haue dogges and euill workers to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
in the Churche? Nay doeth he not call them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision
from the Church: meaning that if they preached
circumcision, they must needes be cut off from the Church,
and others also with them. And so their circumcision,
shoulde rather be concision, that is a cutting and renting of
the Churche in sunder. Paul is so farre from reioysing in
such preachers,<note place="margin">Verse 18. 19.</note> that in the eighteenth verse he geueth war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of them, with weeping teares, and calleth them ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of the crosse of Christ, belligods, proude and worldly
men, and appointed to damnation.<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 12.</note> And Paul would not
onely not suffer the churche to communicate with such,
as is largely prooued before, but wisheth they were euen
dead and destroyed which so did disquiet the churche.
What is then to be meant by Paules ioy, that Christ was
preached all manner wayes? Surely this, that so the church
and the discipline thereof were kept vpright, we neede not
care for the enemies thereof. yea and if in the churche also,
the doctrine of hypocrites doe more good; then their secret
faultes can doe hurt, we are therein to reioyce. For Paul
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>peaketh of the enuie and contentious minde of such prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
and not of anye grosse wickednesse that brake foorth

the same vnto them sayeth Paul: he meaneth so long as

in contentious preaching? Surely as Paul reioyced, so
Christ desired to haue contention in the worlde. Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
I say in the worlde,<note place="margin">Luke 12 49, 50, 51. Mat. 10. 34.</note> but not in the Church. For I came

there shall be fiue in one house deuided, three against two,

to the faith.<note place="margin">Act. 6. 7.</note> And therefore no doubt of it, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
made choise of the priestes, as they did of those foure
brethren, with whome Paul did contribute &amp; other priests
besides the high priest might accomplish the common ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
of the sacrifices,<note place="margin">Heb. 9. 6, 7.</note> 
               <hi>Hebrewes</hi> 9. If they say that the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
and oblations were sanctified in the name of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
hie priests, we denie it: For the beleeuers did know that
Christ the high Priest was come alreadie, and therefore in
his name they tooke the sacrifices to be sanctified, and not
in the name of the other priestes. Moreouer it is manifest,
that they did not communicate, neither offer any offering,
but rather that they shoulde haue done it, and were letted
by the vproare before the dayes of purifying were ended.<note place="margin">Actes 18. 18.</note>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:9956:40"/>
And it seemeth that Paul knewe by the spirite and by the
prophecies that went on them,<note place="margin">Actes 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

fall out,<note place="margin">Actes 21. 11.</note> and therefore also knewe that the offering shoulde
be letted. If here againe they obiect, that the sacrifices them
selues, were fulfilled in Christ, and also abrogate, and yet
for the churches sake were tolerated, I aske them what they
would gather hereby, or what vantage they would take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
vs? Forsooth they would iustifie thereby a tollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of our horrible abuses and disorders. But how ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they,
by those things which God commandeth, warrant those
things which God neuer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded. Againe they are fowly
deceiued, as touching the ceremonial law. First because they
thinke the accomplishing or fulfilling of the ceremoniall
law, to be a present and vtter abolishing thereof, without a
certaine testimonie and preaching to the people, that it is
abolished. Secondly for that they make no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the law disanulled: and the forbidding thereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
disanulled, also betweene the acte and manner of abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating
the law, &amp; the law already abrogated. Also because
they will haue the new lawe stand in force, before it can be
duely proclaimed and receiued in steade of the old. And so
to the Hebrewes it is written, <hi>that the old testament being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anulled,</hi>

               </hi> wherby it is ment, that it could

by degrees and measure it was abolished and taken from

               <hi>To day if ye will heare his

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:9956:40"/>
to be disanulled, because of the weakenes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
For what faithful subiect wil forsake the old lawes of his
prince, till he be assured that newe lawes are proclaimed
which abrogate the olde.<note place="margin">Heb 9. 16.</note> Indeede the newe Testament or
new Lawe tooke place and was established at the death of
Christ, as the Apostle prooueth. yet by degrees it tooke
place in the Churches, as Christ also teacheth, where hee
sayeth,<note place="margin">Iohn 12 3.</note> And I, if I were lift vp from the earth will drawe
all men vnto mee, meaning that at his death hee establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
a newe Lawe and Testament, by which men should
bee drawen vnto him, not that they were drawen at once
in a moment and all together. For the vayle or couering of
the.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 3. 14. 15.</note> olde Testament was first to bee taken away. By this
vayle no doubte Paul meaneth the ignorance of the Iewes,
whereby they did cleaue so much to the old law &amp; ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.
And therefore the Lord sayth in another place,<note place="margin">Isa. 25. 7.</note> that he
will destroye in this mountaine, the couering that couereth
all people, and the vayle that is spredde vpon all nations.
For the Temple that stoode on the mountaine, with the
ordinances thereof, was as a vayle to blynde the heartes of
the Iewes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which dwelt among all nations. And therefore
Christ did foreshewe the destruction of the Temple,<note place="margin">Mat. 24. 2.</note>
which came to passe about fourtie yeeres after:<note place="margin">Iohn 4. 21.</note> A great
parte of which tyme, it was still permitted to the Iewes to
holde the olde Ceremonies. If they obiect that the vayle
of blindenesse was sinne, and therefore to holde the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
was sinne, I aunswere, that it was no vayle of
blindnesse, to those that were willing, ready, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
to receiue the Newe Lawe and Testament when
it was offered. If againe they obiect that their willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and forwardnesse appeared not, seeing the Gentiles so
quickely reiected the olde lawe, and they in so long time
reiected it not: wee aunswere, that all the beleeuing Iewes
did straightway reiect it in part, though not wholly: but
some of them also reiected it wholy euen in shorte time,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:9956:41"/>
yet they were but fewe, and no maruaile. For the Gentiles
had neuer receiued the olde lawe, and therefore might the
more readily imbrace the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>we. but the Iewes were alwaye
zealous of the olde Lawe,<note place="margin">Actes. 21. 20.</note> and therefore coulde not so sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
be reclaimed from their former zeale. Further that
distinction or difference betwixt the acte and maner of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 2. 8.</note> and the deede alreadie done, appeareth by
that place in the Hebrewes: where it is said, thou hast put
all thinges vnder his feete: in which wordes the acte done,
is put for the doing thereof. For yet we see not, (saieth the
Authour) all thinges subdued vnto him. but the worke
was in haude, as it were, it was doing and prospered, till all
thinges shoulde be subdued. Euen so we may say that the
olde lawe was abolished. or taken away, at the death of
Christ: that is, it was in abolishing, or it was readie to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
away, and to be vtterly abolished yea in Christ the
head, it was abolished, and in the members also it was
readie to be abolished.<note place="margin">Rom. 14. 1, 2, 5.</note> And therefore Paul giueth this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction,
that some brethren are weake in faith, and are
not yet perswaded in their mindes, that the ceremoniall
lawe is abolished<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <note place="margin">Vers. 14.</note> others haue knowledge. Now Paul rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soneth,<note place="margin">Vers. 23.</note>
that in such matters concerning the obseruation of
such ceremonies, euery mans faith or knowledge must bee
his rule. For to him that iudgeth any thing vncleane, to him
it is vncleane. Therefore he that doeth any thing in suche
matters, against his knowledge or conscience, he sinneth.
For whatsoeuer is not of faith or knowledge is sinne, saieth
Paul. So then our answere is true, that the ceremonies of
the olde lawe, were not vtterly to be remoued, but by faith
and knowledge of the full abrogation thereof. Otherwise
Paul woulde not haue said, that he which obserueth a day,
or he which eateth not vncleane meates, obserueth the day
of the Lorde, or eateth not the meate to the Lord. He mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
according to his owne interpretation verse. 18. vers. 4.<note place="margin">Verse 4.</note>
that they serue Christ in these thinges,<note place="margin">Verse. 18.</note> and are acceptable
vnto God, and also to be approoued of men. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:9956:41"/>
also they that were stronger, and had further know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
were to beare with the weaker,<note place="margin">Verse 3. 4. 13. 22.</note> and to applie their
knowledge and iudgement,<note place="margin">1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Cor. 8. 9.</note> that they put no stumbling
blocke nor occasion to fall before their brethren. Againe
we haue a further answere by these wordes of Paul. That
some thinges may be done, vpon iust occasion, as when we
are sure that we serue God therein: and some thinges are
simply sinne, which may neuer be done vpon any occasion.
Such are our vyle abuses and vngodly disorders, which are
not as the ceremonies of the Lawe, that by occasion might
be obserued or not obserued: as to make differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of times
or of meates: but they are altogether forbidden by the word
of God, and therefore not indifferent as they terme them.
And though some thinges in them selues,<note place="margin">Rom. 14. 14.</note> as they are crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 4, 4.</note>
are rather cleane, good, and lawfull, then (as they
terme them) indifferent, yet their vse, or rather abusing in
such manner and order, is not lawfull and good, neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different.</p>
            <p>And here againe is another obiection to be answered,
because when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing Hezekiah did celebrate the Passeouer,<note place="margin">2. Chron. 30. 17, 18, 19.</note>
there were many in the congregation, that were not clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and yet did eate the Passeouer. And thereby they doe
gather, that wicked wretches may partake with vs in the
sacraments. That place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> plainely sheweth, that it was one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a ceremoniall vncleannesse, and no wickednesse in the
people.<note place="margin">verse. 19.</note> For the people as the wordes doe testifie, prepared
their whole heart to seeke the Lorde God. againe the same
place answereth it selfe: that they were not clensed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the purification of the sanctuary: whereby is ment,
as it is written in Nombers,<note place="margin">Nom 9. 10.</note> that they were to keepe the
Passeouer, notwithstanding such vncleannesse. For it could
no way be remedyed. before the time of the Passeouer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.
And againe that ceremonie of vncleannes,<note place="margin">Nom. 19. 20.</note> was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
because of the sanctuarie, which might not be pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted.
Nowe therefore they onely eating the Passeouer in
their houses or tentes, and not comming to the sanctuarie,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:9956:42"/>
their ceremoniall vncleannes was no wickednesse in them.
For the Priestes them selues,<note place="margin">2. Chron. 29. 34,</note> as the text declareth,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

suffered to come into the Sanctuarie or Temple,<note place="margin">Marke 7. 15.</note> being not
yet cleansed. And yet also there is a further answere. For
that the ceremoniall vncleannesse was no sinne, so long as
it was not by their carelessenesse in auoyding it, or if it had
bene sinne, yet it was to be counted a smaller escape or an
infirmitie, and no grosser wickednesse. And then seeing it
was openly rebuked, and openly confessed, and prayed for
by the King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and also healed in the people, (For the Lorde
healed the people saith the text,) I say, seeing the matter
stoode so, howe shal any man excuse or tollerate thereby,
our intollerable disorders, which are also incurable. For if
escapes, or open infirmities are not so to bee borne with,
but that they must be openly rebuked and mended, before
the offenders can communicate in the sacraments, Then
much rather are open grosser sinnes to be first redressed,
before the sinners be suffered to partake in the sacraments.
But <hi>Master Cartwright</hi> bringeth a place in Ieremie, for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of suspendings, which the Bishops vse nowe a dayes:
or at least for tollerating of them that the preachers should
take and giue ouer their callings, as the Bishops and their
officers doe appoint them. Why doeth he, so carelessely fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sifie
the Scriptures.<note place="margin">Ierem. 36. 5.</note> First he saith that Ieremy was suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from preaching, and then he woulde prooue that Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
obeyed that suspension, thirdly he sayeth that Ieremie
was at libertie of his bodie, and fourthly that he would not
preache in the Temple for making a tumult. All whiche
things are vtterly false, and haue no shewe of trueth in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
<hi>For first it is plaine in the chapter he quoteth, that he was shut
vp:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ierem. 32. 2.</note> and therefore was not at libertie of his bodye: <hi>and the
32 chapter sheweth that Ieremie was shut vp in the court of the
prison.</hi> Then also imprisoning of a man doeth shewe a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
withholding of a man from preaching, and not a sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending.
Further that Ieremie would obey no suspendings,
it is plaine by the charge and message he had from the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:9956:42"/>
Lorde.<note place="margin">Ier. 1. 10, 18.</note> 
               <hi>For he was set ouer the nations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ouer the kingdomes,
(as is written) and was made an yron pillar, and walles of brasse
against the king, the princes and the priestes, and was not to bee
afraide of their faces, least the Lorde did destroy him before the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi>
Indeede it is true as we haue prooued before, <hi>that we are not
to preach to the vnworthie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hose 4. 4.</note> 
               <hi>as to scorners, and persecuters. For
there is a time when the wise man shall keepe silence, when scarce
any is to rebuke, or reprooue another.</hi> But when Ieremie was
shut vp, there were of the princes that tooke his parte. For
by their meanes no doubt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> did Ieremie get out of the prison<note place="margin">Iere. 56. 19.</note>
court, and so hid him selfe with Baruch. There was no such
bondage of suspendings, as <hi>Master Cartwright</hi> would tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate:
and though there were, yet Ieremie obeyed them not,
but onely gaue place to the tyrannie of persecuters, As for
the tumult he speaketh of,<note place="margin">Actes 23. 6.</note> we know that Paul him selfe,
though he sought peace, yet he cared more, for his safetye,
and to witnesse the trueth, then he did for to raise a tumult.
And Ieremie also ceased not to preache still, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
that a tumulte,<note place="margin">Ierem 26. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>when as yet the couenant of the priesthoode pertained by the lawe
vnto Abiathar and his house.</hi> But necessities and iust occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
did oftentimes make change of the ceremoniall lawes,
and yet no corruption nor abuse came thereby. Wherefore
for aunswere I say, that the priesthoode was not made a
yeerely office, but that by course euery yeere two priestes
did execute the office. And this seemed to be tollerable by
the Lawe, seeing that if one priest shoulde be sicke, or let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by some greater occafions, the other might be in his
steade. <hi>As wee shewed before, that Eeleazar was chosen high
Priest,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn 18. 13.</note> 
               <hi>while Aaron yet liued, and Zadok in Abiathars steade.
and yet were there not two high Priestes in the office at once, but
onely one at once was to execute the office. Also there seemed to be
much doubt and controuersie, to which of the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iestes, the priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode
did belong</hi> (as also we may reade in Iosephus.) <hi>And
therefore two chiefely standing for it, there were two chosen to it.
And because the lawe of God did not suffer two at once to bee in
the office, they did succeede one another in the execution of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</hi>
Againe <hi>seeing they were of the sonnes of Aaron, and called
after the order of Aaron,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 5. 4.</note> 
               <hi>no doubt their calling was lawfull and
good,</hi> Otherwise if any at that time, had bene lawfull high
Priestes, and yet not lawfully called as was Aaron, then
the Apostle woulde not haue set downe this for a generall
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:9956:43"/>
trueth, That no man taketh this honour vnto him selfe, but
he that is called of God, as was Aaron. Neither let him here
shift off our answere, by his fonde distinction of the essence
of a priest, and of a lawfull priest, which before is refuted.
As for Symonie wherewith he chargeth the high Priestes,
hee can not prooue it against them. For if the Romanes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerruling
them, did grieuously exact their tributes and pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
both of Christ himselfe,<note place="margin">Mat. 17. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

and of the high priestes: it was no more Symonie in the
priestes, then it was in Christ to pay them their exactions.
For the priesthoode was their right. seeing it pertained vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, being the sonnes of Aaron. yet can not <hi>Master
Cartwright</hi> prooue that they payed any monie when they
tooke their right, or if they did, that they thereby bought
their right, and not rather payed an exaction, which the
Romanes demanded when they tooke their right. But sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
that secretly they gaue bribes to the Romanes, &amp; delt
by Symonie, yet that being hidden and not manifest to the
people, they were to be taken of men as lawfully called to
that office. For if the Lawe and common tribute exacted
monie of them, they might pay it as well as Christ. If the
officers did exact any besides lawe, they did it secretely, lest
they them selues should be condemned by lawe: and so it
is manifest that no symonie could be laid to their charge.</p>
            <p>And therefore no maruaile though Christ bad the man
shewe him selfe to the high Priest. For before the high
priestes became open persecuters, there was a lawfull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
to be had with them. But this communion was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
broken, and made vnlawfull through their open
wickednesse. Also it is false, which <hi>Master Cartwright</hi> saith,
that Christ did reuerence the high Priest,<note place="margin">Iohn 18. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> and gaue him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countes
of his doctrine. For he gaue him no accountes, and
answered him so roundly, that one of the officers whiche
stoode by, smote him with a rodde. Also his aunswere is
false co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning that place in Hoshea,<note place="margin">Hose 4 6.</note> that the Lord would
refuse the priestes, for being any more his priestes: seeing
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:9956:44"/>
they were without knowledge, of which wordes he sayeth,
that the prophet rather giueth a rule to be followed in their
election or deposition, then howe farre they may be vsed.
Nay the Prophet there speaketh nothing of electing them,
or deposing them by men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but rather of the plague or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
that shoulde come vpon them. yea hee sheweth
that through the ignorance of the priestes all wickednesse
and idolatrie reigned,<note place="margin">Verse 9.</note> and therefore he saith that there shal
be like people like Priest, meaning that they shall haue a
like destruction. Now <hi>Master Cartwright</hi> dare not say, that
all abominable wickednes and Idolatrie reigning, and the
priests them selues being wicked idolaters, I say, he dare not
affirme, that they helde the couenant, or were the people, or
church of God. For before he hath said the contrary. And
howe then dare he say, that such priestes, were yet priestes
vnto God, and were not deposed from their priesthoode,
when as their owne wickednes and idolatrie did depose
them. For that whole chapter of Hoshea is altogether a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
their wickednesse and idolatrie. And let <hi>M. C.</hi> knowe
that our open grosse sinnes &amp; abuses, being not curable by
the discipline of the Church, are as euill as Idolatrie: as Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel
the Prophet doeth witnes,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 15. 23.</note> saying, that rebellion is as
the sinne of witchcraft, and transgression (he meaneth tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression
which is stoode in, and wil not be mended) is wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes
&amp; idolatry. But this matter is made manifest before.</p>
            <p>Now followeth the last part of his letter, &amp; the last mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in controuersie, as whether by communicating with a
reading minister, we do communicate with their impietie,
&amp; establish their ministerie. <hi>M. C.</hi> herein doth more shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
erre, then if he should, with the bishops, altogether iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
such reading ministers. For he might better say, they
were lawfull ministers, and that their ministerie were law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
then that he should confesse them to be vnlawfull mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
&amp; yet iustifie that we may receiue them, as hauing
the essence, and substance of ministers, and partake in their
wicked ministerie, without impietie or establishing their
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:9956:44"/>
But he may playnly see (except his eies of vnderstanding be
vtterly darkened) that if any do vsurpe, as traitors, against
her maiesty, then they also that come vnder their vsurped
rule and gouernment, being once free from it, are also tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
together with them: So likewise those men vsurping a
ministery, which Christ neuer gaue them, neyther sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be in his Church, both they doe wickedly, and they
also, that wil come vnder theyr ministery, doe establish theyr
wicked ministery, and partake with them in theyr impiety.
If a man of the winde, (sayth the prophet) and false fellowe
doe he saying,<note place="margin">Micah. 2. 11.</note> I will prophecie vnto you of wine and of
strong drinke; he shall euen be the prophet of this people.
Yea why not, sayth <hi>Master Cartwright,</hi> if the Church doe
call such a one, is it his sinne onely, sayth he, and not theyrs
that receaue him. And the prophets, sayth he, doe not lay it
to the peoples charge, though they communicate with such.
Doe they not indeede? doth not this prophet Micha laye it
to theyr charge?<note place="margin">Zech. 13. 3.</note> doth not also Zecharie shewe how vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
it was to communicate with false prophets, where he
sayth, that when any false prophet shall yet prophecie, his
father and his mother that begate him, shall saye vnto
him, Thou shalt not liue: For thou hast spoken lyes in
the name of the Lorde: and his father and his mother that
begate him, shall thrust him through, when hee prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieth.
But the trueth of this matter, I haue prooued before.
Let vs further examine his wise reasons. He confesseth that
if by communicating with him, we doe make him minister,
then we are guilty of his wickednes. But we make him not
minister sayth he, though we communicate with him. But
I demaunde, should we haue such ministers, if no parishi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner,
nor other did communicate with them? Woulde
there be any magistrates, if there were no subiectes to bee
vnder theyr guiding, or any master, if there were no
seruants? So then as the hauing of seruants and subiects, to
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate in the same houshold or kingdom, doth make
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:9956:45"/>
masters and magistrates, so to haue parishioners to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
with such ministers, doth make them such ministers,
and also establish their ministerie. If <hi>Master Cartwright</hi>
were not voide of common reason in this matter, he would
neuer affirme such absurdities. But before he graunted as
much in effect, that the church which receiueth and calleth
a minister doeth especially make him minister: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
herein he is contrary to him selfe.<note place="margin">1. Chro. 29. 22.</note> And therefore it is
written,<note place="margin">Ierem. 23. 21.</note> that the congregation of the people, made Salomo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
king, and Zadok high priest. Indeede if the false prophets,
or reading ministers doe runne of them selues onely, and
were not called nor receiued of any, neither had any office
nor ministerie in the Church, then the deuill onely, might
be said to make them ministers, but the parishioners recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
them for their ministers, and taking them to be called
to that office by the Church, as <hi>Master Cartwright</hi> teacheth
vs, and yeelding them selues to be their flocke and charge. I
say, those parishioners together with the diuel and his offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
do make them ministers. As for partaking with the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietie
of the minister, we haue prooued before, that if anye
wickednes be open, and the church will not redresse it, it is
guiltie of the wickednes committed. neither ought it to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge,
that it can not redresse it.<note place="margin">1. Cor 5.</note> For it hath the power of
Christ,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 10.</note> to iudge those that are within, &amp; those strong wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
of the spirituall warrefare, which can cut off all wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
disorders in the church. Otherwise as we haue shewed,
it is not the church of God. Paul sheweth that except we
purge out the olde leauen we can not be a newe lumpe to
the Lord, neither keepe the Lordes feastes. he sheweth his
meaning in that place, that they suffering such a grosse of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender
amongest them, were guiltie of his wickednesse, and
coulde not partake in the sacraments, but it must needes be
done with the leauen of wickednesse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not with the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leauened
bread of sinceritie and trueth.<note place="margin">M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

the next epistle it is shewed,<note place="margin">2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Cor. 7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 11.</note> that they all repented and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed,
as being guiltie of his sinne, whom they had no soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:9956:45"/>

            <p>And why was king Hezekiah afraide,<note place="margin">2. Chron. 30. 17, 18, 19.</note> and all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
For the ceremoniall vncleannes of some, but onely that
they feared, least they all were polluted thereby, and the
Passeouer not accepted. And therefore that vncleannesse,
which the Lawe also did suffer, and which was without
sinne, as we haue shewed, was openly confessed, and healed
by prayer: least the keeping of that feast should be wholly
vncleane. Howe much more then shal open grosse wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
when it breaketh forth, in the Church, make them all
polluted and guiltie thereof, if they refuse and will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse
it. Finally his similitude of receiuing goods or landes
of a mans father being a murtherer, is vaine. For the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which the reading ministers doe geue vs, are neyther
his sacraments, neyther the Lords, as we prooued before, but
are polluted pledges of a wicked communion. Againe wee
may not receiue golde of a thiefe, to iustifie his thieuerie.
And wee haue shewed that such ministers are theeues and
robbers, and can not as Fathers giue vs the Lordes holye
thinges. Likewise is that answered of communicating with
adulterers whome we can not (as he saith) auoide. For if
their sinne be open and prooued, then both all the Church
and euery one of the Church, ought and may auoyde them,
I meane their fellowship in the sacraments. If their sinne
be secret and not prooued by witnesses, then the question
is not of them.</p>

            <p>GRACE and peace &amp;c. Beloued for so much as I left
you the choyce for the first conference, whether you would
haue it in writing or by speech of mouth; I attended some
dayes for your answere of that matter: which because it
was not returned, I esteemed that you held you still to the request of
your letters, which was to receaue some thing from me by writing.
For answere therefore, so it is that your letters affected me diuers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
For where your first page had raysed me vnto some hope for
the reuniting of your selfe, with the rest of your company vnto vs,
from whome you haue thought good to sunder your selues. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

in vniting your selues, with such you shoulde be vnequally yoked,
and made fellowe members of some other body then of that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
Christ Iesus is the head. First therefore if it bee shewed that
the ordinary assemblyes of those which professe the Gospel in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande
be the Churches of Christ, it seemeth that the way will bee
paued and plained for mutuall entercourse betweene vs, thus ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

his words in their mouthes are the churches of God: but such
are the assemblies in England as touching the spirit of God it hath
bin said before, whereupon also it followeth that he hath likewise
put his word in their mouthes, considering that the spirit of God is
not giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but by the word, &amp; seing that the Lord in mercy hath set
vp diuers burning lamps in those assemblies whereby light is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyed
more or lesse into all the parts almost of that land, it seemeth
that the church of England should receiue iniury if it should not be
accounted among the golden candlesticks which seeme to keepe out
darknes &amp; might from the Lords sanctuary, vntill such time as the
day starre spring &amp; Lucifer do rise in our hearts. If you say all
do not beleeue the gospel truely which professe it, the same exceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
lyeth against all other churches how reformed soeuer, if that there
be fewer faithfull in our churches then in others, the trueth of the
chnrch standeth not in the nomber, for if there were but in euery
church one truely and vndissemblingly faithfull, al the rest holding
the faith of our Lord Iesus christ in wordes onely, yet shoulde all
those churches be vnto vs the churches of God, and if you say the
assemblyes, as it were all the branches or armes of the candlesticke
haue not lightes set vpon them, the greater nomber of them being
dumped with dumbe ministerie, notwithstanding by the way you
confesse those assemblyes vpon whome the Lorde hath set the lampe
of a preaching ministery are the churches of God, whiche seemeth
to cast downe that hill which standeth in the waye against
our reioysing, wherebye you can not afoorde vs the Name
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:9956:47"/>
of gods churches because we haue not the discipline by him appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
nowe for the other, whether they haue some glimpse of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
by the dumbe ministerie or no, may afterwardes in another
place be considered for the present I answere, that euen in those
congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s forasmuch as they both haue and might haue by some
former ministrie or means which the Lord hath vsed towards the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
receiued faith standing therby in our sauiour christ as in the shaft
of a candlesticke they cease not to be a branch in the Lords candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticke,
and being members of the same body they may well receiue
some supply of their want from the light that shineth in the next
branch vnto them, for if euery assembly being without a lampe of
the ministry shuld by &amp; by be holden to be broken from the shaft of
the church candlesticke, then at euery vacation of the ministry and
whensoeuer by death the Lorde shoulde put out one of his lightes,
it shoulde followe that that assembly by the fall of their minister
into the graue, shoulde from the hyest heauen fall into the graue
of hell, but you will say peradventure, that an assembly that hath a
dumbe minister is in worse case then that which hath none at all,
if that be graunted, yet followeth it not therefore that the assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
which yesterday being without a du<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>be minister was the church
of God, shoulde to day by hauing such a one set ouer them be the
Synagogue of Satan and here me thinkes whilest you go about to
make nothing of the dumbe ministrie you ascribe more force to it,
then it hath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for you make him not so much as a guide or an head
of the church in that those which before in all equall iudgement
were to be deemed members of Christ, by hearing them shoulde
suddenly become the members of antichrist, I do not therefore yeeld
vnto you, in that you saye they are the chiefe alwayes in the
synagogues, our Sauiour Christ in whome those companies do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
being the chiefe with whome through faith they growe to be
one body, which rather then by hearing the dumbe minister to bee
one with him, say therefore that it is a fault in them to heare such
a minister thrust vpon them, yet that it is an apostacie from God
and an vtter falling away from the Gospell, I see not with what
great apparance of trueth it can be spoken. <hi>Moyses</hi> when diuers
of the people claue vnto Korah, Datham and Abiram, forsaking
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:9956:47"/>
willingly the lawfull and ordinary ministry of the Aronites, did
not therefore cast them forth from the Lordes hoste; and should the
churches of God, for hearing a dumbe minister which is thrust vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, forthwith be reputed for runnagates from the Lorde. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
the Lorde is in couenaunt with that people to whome he
gieueth the seales of his couenant; this he doth to our assemblies in
England, therefore they are the Lordes confederates. Yf you say
that the seales set to by the dumb ministery are no seales, (which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde
commeth to be examined) yet you thereby confesse that
those which are ministred by sufficient ministers are the true and
vncounterfaite sacramentes of the church: whereby it falleth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
that you seeme to hold that the churches in England are not
true churches of Christ, because they haue not his commaunded
discipline. Hereunto may be added the iudgment of all the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of Christ in Europe, all which gieue the right hande of
societie in the house of God, vnto the assemblies which are in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.
Which argument of the churches authoritie, albeit it be not
so strong as it will enforce, yet ought it to staye all sodayne and
hasty iudgments vnto the contrary, and so long to cause silence vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
the cause be rightly on both sides debated, and the contrary of
that which the churches holde, doe through the lightnesse sonne of
the trueth thereof breake foorth, and if it be meete to proceede
softly, and as it were with a leaden foote to the excommunication
of one onely member of the Church of God, there ought verily to
haue bin great consultation taken, when the Churches of two
whole Ilandes shoulde haue bene cast out, (especially when they
be holden in by voyces, not of diuers persons, but of all the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
to whome the knowledge of their estate hath come.) And if
there were but one man worthie to be excommunicate, yet if the
greater parte of your assembly, woulde not yeelde consente there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
I holde it that the order of the discipline requireth, that the
rest are to beare the person whome they can not remooue. And
therefore although the assemblyes of Englande had deserued tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
want of discipline, and of a teaching ministerie, to bee cast
out from the accompt of the churches of God, yet being holden in by
the most voyces of the Churches them selues, they ought to haue
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:9956:48"/>
bene so farre borne withall, as the communicating with them
shoulde not make them guiltie of a falling away from the Lorde.
Nowe I come to those two reasons whereby you thinke you maye
iustly holde the assemblies in Englande for no churches of God.
And first of all to the reason of the discipline, for the want wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
you giue them all without exception the blackestone of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
from being the churches of christ, where it is to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoode
that as in a man there are certaine partes essentiall and such
as without which the man can not stande, and other some seruing
either to his comelinesse or to his long continuance, so it is in this
matter, there is the foundation christ, whereupon it is necessary
that by fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th the assemblies be laide, which groweth vnto the
Lordes building, without the which it can not bee his church,
which thing being, whatsoeuer is either wanting of that which is
commaunded, or remaining of that which is forbidden is not able
to put that assembly which by faith is layde vpon Christ, from the
right and title of being the churche of Christ, for faith can admit
of no such thing, which giueth an vtter ouerthrowe and turning
vpside downe of the trueth. By this title of the faithfull, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
in his epistles noteth out the Churches of God, it being all
one with him to say to the faithfull or to the Saintes, as to the
Churches of such a place, whatsoeuer wanteth vnto this, or is
more then ynough, it wanteth or aboundeth to the disgrace and
vncomelinesse, or to the hassarde of the continuance and not to the
present ouerthrowe of the churche and although besides faith in
the Sonne of GOD there may be many thinges necessary for
euery assembly, yet be they necessary to the comely and stable being
and not simplye to the being of the churche: hereupon the people
of Israel which neglected for the space of fourtie nine yeeres the
holy Sacrament of circumcision and the Passeouer also, (as it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth)
one onely time excepted, seased not therefore to be the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of God and to haue the Sanctuarie amongest them. And in
this respectes the Dutch assemblyes whereof the greatest parte in
high Germany, which besides the same Name of discipline which
is common to our churches, are grossely deceiued in the matter of
the Supper are notwithstanding holden in the roule of the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:9956:48"/>
of god. In this respecte also certaine assemblyes of our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
which hauing the vse of the discipline permitted vnto
them, are not suffered to haue the vse of the Sacramentes of the
Lordes Supper are no therefore when the Lordes churches are
mustered and their Names written and enrouled vp, cast out as
vnfit to remaine in any accompt of the Lordes hoste without anye
parte of that order and discipline which the Lorde hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
I graunt there can be no churche of christ for that without
some parte of it there can be no faith in Iesus christ, it is a piece
of that discipline of our Sauiour christ that there shoulde be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
which shoulde be chosen out of the rest to preache the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell,
by preaching whereof the churches are gathered. Where
therefore there is no ministerie of the worde there it is playne
that there are no visible and apparant churches. it is another
parte of the discipline of our Lorde, that the rest of the body of
the churche shoulde obey those, that are set ouer them in the Lord.
Wheresoeuer therefore there is no obedience of the people giuen
to the ministers that in the Lordes name preach vnto them, there
also can be no churche of christ, but where these two be, although
other pointes wante, yea although there be some defect in these,
that neither the ministers doe in all pointes preach as they ought,
nor the assemblyes in all pointes obey vnto the wholesome doctrine
of their teachers, yet doe they for the reason abouesaide retaine
the right of the churches of god.</p>
            <p>This may be made by plaine similitude from the body of man,<note place="margin">A foppe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</note>
whereunto we are alreadie entred, for if any man shuld haue both
his hands &amp; his armes cut off his eyes put out &amp;c. yet as lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g as the
head standeth and other vitall parts, he is to be accompted a man,
although a maymed man: euen so it is in the assemblie, as long as it
holdeth the head, how defectiue it is otherwise, yet it hath the due
and right of the church of god, and although a man shoulde haue
sixe fingers on one hande and but three one another, &amp; albeit they
shoulde stande where the mouth doeth, yet all this deformitie should

one with another; but a whole and through displacing of euery
parte, from his proper state then verely coulde he not be deemed to
haue either the proportion of a man or his life, so likewise if an
assembly either holde not the head which is Christ Iesu or be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
els but a confused multitude without any parte of that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
which the sonne of God hath appointed, the same is iustly cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
out of the accompte of Gods churche, was not Ierusalem after
the returne from Babylon the citie of the great King, vntill snche
time as Nehemias came, and builded vp the walles of the citie: to
say therefore it is none of the Church of god, because it hath not
receiued this discipline, me thinkes is all one with this as if a man
woulde say it is no citie because it hath no wall, or that it is no
vineyarde because it hath neither hedge nor dyke. It is not I grant
so sightly a citie or vineyarde nor yet so safe against the inuasion
of their seuerall enemies which lye in waite for them, but yet are
they truely both cities and vineyardes. There remaineth the other
point which is against those assemblies onely which haue a dumbe
ministerie, wherein that parte of your conclusion that the assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
where they be are none of the Churches of god is before an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered.
There resteth that part of your conclusion, whereby you
inferre that the Sacramentes ministred by them are none of gods
Sacramentes, and therefore that a man may not receiue anye of
them at their handes, here first I agree with you that their mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie
is vnlawful and to them selues without repentance a certain
matter of destruction, especially in those vnto whome the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of this corruption is come, to the churches where they be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
hurtefull, and in the ende without remedie deadly, but that
they are no ministers of god so far as to receiue the good thinges
they offer vnto vs that I suppose I may not well yeelde vnto, the
grounde hereof I take from the former parte of my answere that
for so much as they are allowed by the churches of god they ought
vntill remedie may be founde of so great disorder to be heard and
receiued so farre as they can giue vs any thing that is of christ,
and for this cause our Sauiour christ commanded that the Scribes
shoulde be heard in that they taught truely,<note place="margin">Mat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that their vnfitnesse and vnlawfulnesse in the ministerie al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
another way was as great, as it is in our reading ministers
they were all together deceiued in the Messias, for neither knewe
they that Iesus was the christ, nor yet that the christ whome they
looked for shuld be the sone of god,<note place="margin">Iohn 9. 22.</note> but held him for a bare &amp; na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedman.<note place="margin">Mat. 22. 42.</note> It appeareth also that they taught the iustification which
is by the lawe of workes not onely in the eighteenth of Luke but
euen the very selfe same place where our Sauiour commaundeth
this audience vnto them, for speaking of the workes of the morall
Lawe, which they woulde not touch with one of their fingers, hee
saith that they layde them vpon the peoples backes, as burdens
which coulde not be borne, whereby our Sauiour besides the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risticall
pride and Lordlinesse in teaching signifieth that they
taught them to iustification, seeing that if they had onely taught
them as testimonies and fruites of faith they had not bene vntolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
but as our Sauiour saith an easie yoke, and as Saint Iohn
sayeth,<note place="margin">1. Iohn 5.</note> not grieuous or heauie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now the dumbe ministerie is not
farther off from the institution of a lawfull ministerie,<note place="margin">Matth. 11.</note> then to
teach vntruely in the chiefe groundes of Religion, neither is the
edifying of the church respected in making lawes for the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie,
lesse hindered by a ministerie teaching false thinges, and
that in so waightie pointes, as by an vnpreaching minister, and
according to this saying of our Sauiour christ, we may see what
the practise of the Prophetes had bene before, who although they
had oftentimes to doe both with false teachers and Priestes that
dumbe dogges and not able to barke,<note place="margin">Isay 58.</note> yet giuing the people war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of their corruptions and insufficientnesse, threatning also the
casting them from the ministerie in the good time when the Lorde
shoulde haue pitie on his Church, they are neuer founde to haue
forbidden the people to come to their sacrifices, or to bring their
sacrifices commaunded by the lawe vnto them, yea our Sauiour
that liued in the corruptest times of the Churche, and when things
were most confused and fewest steppes of any lawfull calling to be
seene, yet commaunded the man whome he purged from his leprosie
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:9956:50"/>
to shewe him selfe vnto the priest, where it is to be obserued,<note place="margin">Matth. 8.</note> that
he saith to the priest generally without willing him to make choise
of a priest better instructed or affected vnto the trueth then the
rest, but indifferently vnto the priest, the high priest albeit hee
was at that time contrary to the Lawe made a yeerely officer, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he entred in by Simonie and rewarde vnto the Romanes,
yet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> notwithstanding we see our sauiour bare him reuerence for
his office sake and as before his Iudge in spirituall causes gaue an
accompt of his doctrine, we haue another example of reuerence
vnto such rulers euen in thinges that were done by them wronge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

for Ieremie being as it appeareth suspended for a time from
comming into the Temple and albeit at libertie of his body woulde
not, least as it seemeth be should make a tumult enter into the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and therefore hauing written that which he had to say, sent
Baruch to reade his sermon in the temple, moreouer when a magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
is not able to doe some parte of his office, as for example be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
able to doe the dueties which are to be perfourmed in peace is
insufficient for mortall offences, yet no man refuseth to take that
which he is able to giue, because he is not able to doe all that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.
Euen so endeuoring to our uttermost to a sufficient mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie,
I woulde thinke in the meane season, that the good thinges
that they are able to giue vs may be taken at their handes and if
any say that it is of the substance of a church minister to be able
to teach, and therefore he is no minister that hath not that habili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
it may be answered that it is of the substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of a good &amp; law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
minister of God, but not simply of a minister, whereunto it is
sufficient to haue the church calling as it is of the substance rather
of a lawfull magistrate to be able to iudge betweene his subiectes
then simply of a magistrate whome the election of the people, or of
other to whome his choise belongeth, maketh a magistrate of the
Lorde although he be no lawfull or sufficient magistrate as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we take him for a magistrate which for the ignorance of his
charge may be called an idoll magistrate. Euen so it seemeth that
he may bee holden for a minister which hath the Churches cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
albeit he be not able to doe the principall charge of that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie.

make him minister, I graunt that a piece of his guilte would sticke
to our fingers, but when that is not, I see not howe by receiuing
the sacramentes of him which partake more vnto his wickednesse
then the sonne is partaker of his fathers murther, because he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth

the Sacramentes offered by him, we put the Lorde awaye from

bee parteners of impietie, which is the meanes, and can take no
