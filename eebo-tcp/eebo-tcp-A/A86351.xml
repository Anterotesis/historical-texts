         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHen the Apoſtle makes a prediction of the evils and miſcariages of the laſt daies, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. he doth not inſtance in ſuch wickedneſſes as are of a groſſe and viſible cognizance, but in thoſe of a more ſpirituall and refined nature, <hi>men ſhall be lovers of themſelves, without naturall affection, highminded,</hi> &amp;c. For as in the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of heavenly glory the beſt wine is kept till laſt, and the compleateſt enjoyments ſerved up at the end of the feaſt; ſo darkneſſe treaſures up her moſt deceava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble workes till the laſt ſhew and appearance of all her ſorceries: The reaſon is, becauſe the world being now ripened in underſtanding and judgement, by long and coſtly experience, is not ſo apt to be impoſed upon by ſuch evils, as lye open to the redargution of ſence and common principles; but is advanced into error by chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able fallacies and deceits, through all gradations and methods of ſubtilties, according to the wiſdom of him who is wiſer in his generation then the children of light, amongſt thoſe dark and ſable appearances which hight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the danger of the laſt times; the Apoſtle gives the laſt place to <hi>a form of godlineſſe, without the power, ver.</hi> 5. &amp; truly <hi>(Reader)</hi> when thou ſeeſt ſelf love, love of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, covetouſneſſe, fierceneſſe &amp;c clothed with a form of Religion, then judge that this prophecy is fulfilled, and that thou art fallen into the very laſt of the laſt dayes, <hi>(i.)</hi> into the lees of all danger, and the very dreggs of times. And indeed the world in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure labours under this deceit at this very time, when
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:117344:3"/>ſelfe and ſelfe intereſts are advanced, under notions, and pretences more ſpecious and taking then their own; who is there almoſt that lives in the true being and power of Religion, and delights in it for its own ſake? but we embrace the outward huske and ſhell, mixing the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of divine and humane intereſt for worldly advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, which is the moſt fordid and degenerous of all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts; how happy were it if the world were unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaved in this particular, and could attaine to the true underſtanding and diſcernance of all things, untwiſting all intereſts, unfolding all myſteries, giving unto <hi>Caeſar</hi> that which is <hi>Caeſars,</hi> and unto God that which is Gods? As I cannot acquit many of our owne from this evill, ſo thou haſt here a pregnant inſtance of this deceit in the enſuing diſcourſe. Our brethren of <hi>Scotland</hi> (us we formerly called them) in the flood of all their deſignes made their own intereſts and advantages the mid chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell, the heart, and center, which acted and informed the courſe of their undertaking here amongſt us.
